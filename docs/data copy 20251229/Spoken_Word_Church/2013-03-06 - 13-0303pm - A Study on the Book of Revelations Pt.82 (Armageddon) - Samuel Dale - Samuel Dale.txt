each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you have your way now in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Revelations 16 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he s he signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand now Revelations 16 I said this morning I'm not going to try to cover the plagues that are written in 15 you know talking about it and starts at 16 and goes on through I just want to make a a insert right here on something that will take place during that time and you'll see in a moment what we're talking about so let's just read 13-6 and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to GA them to the the Battle of of that great day of God Almighty behold I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue arm Edon so you may be seated the Lord add his Lessing to the reading of the word now I believe he needs to get Aaron up and let him at least turn the fan on we got to learn how to do these things and you know come on up to the Aon at least turn a fan on because I know it's stuffy in here and temperature wise it might be all right but we need a little a stearing all right now I hope he was following this morning what I was bringing cuz I actually had notes written to speak upon what we miss you know by being the Bride of Jesus Christ of these plagues and things and I wouldn't go and preach on the plagues and that's see I I actually took them out rewrote the notes and everything had to turn around this morning and rewrite it put it all back in so that okay it'll all work out I get to the right place eventually and if it don't we'll get when we get over there so it be all right but I hope you enjoyed that what we miss we miss all of these things you read chapter 16 and you read on over and that Lord willing we jump into chapter 17 the next but you read that there is seven plagues vows as is called there and those seven plagues you know are things that will happen to Israel and to the people of the world during what is known as the tribulation period and that coincides with the trumpets with the the seals opening the things and U if you'll notice and we'll read just a minute what the prophet said but if you'll notice that you're going through the plagues and especially if you have a Scofield bible if you'll look at it it's covering 1 2 3 4 5 6 the sixth vow is the uh 12th verse and then the seventh vow begins in the 17th verse and this is an insert that's placed within here on the uh three unclean spirits like frogs and things like that and coming down to Armageddon it's an insert by meaning that that part of these things will be this this is something added in and it is actually a uh uh you remember between the sixth and seventh Church age there's an anle and the prophet preached uh the uh 10 virgins right then between the sixth and seventh seal there's an interval and he preached the uh you know the bringing in of the seventh chapter of Revelations because you're bridging in in other words you're expressing what these things uh what they make or do see because that's the way that you you come up in the church ages and then you got a breach see you come up in the seals you got a breach right all right each one see you've got a breach and actually here you've got a breach or a interval and the interval is between the sixth and seventh uh plague and then it shows you something that is very important because now remember the compound meaning right remember what we've bringing in the always been trying to bring a compound meaning because see we're not over here this is not to us the literal reading if we read this here I can stand here today and say this has nothing to do with us and I'm exactly right see but then to turn around and say this has a lot to have to do with us because it is showing us where we're at now I'm exactly right see you're saying no that's too different things no that's a that's a showing you a compound meaning what will happen here will continue on over to Israel right as we were covering this morning of the The Three Angels the that justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost will go right on to Israel they'll get justification sanctification to baptism of the Holy go all right see then here we get this part of the three unclean spirits like frogs Y and then this will carry over to Israel all right now if we get to it this afternoon I may have to rearrange something with the brothers cuz I'm always doing that and they're wonderful to to change things when I want them to but I want us to see right where we are at by the word all right and if God God is revealing these things even through the Book of Revelations you know showing us the symbols showing us the places showing us what these are right and if we can see it happening here all right then we can look and see it happening there right right all right and we know what will happen to Israel when we get out of here right right we can study the book the whole book the whole this is our book this is the bride's book and we're just not limited with say the New Testament right we have the the complete revelation of the entire Bible delivered unto us and the prophet would even say one day like this he said as far as man knew of justification sanation baptism and the Holy Ghost said it's been revealed he said then the seals open to show us the future what about it so wonderful a thing to be able to stand here and know what will happen right see but it don't have to go there but what I see of myself here is what I need the seals are the literal happenings of the seal is to Israel but the revelation of the word of God will change these bodies right amen right amen and will take us in a Rapture all right then if we can go in a Rapture then they will follow in the B of whatever to to be made known and they will get the message and and you know and and and they will have their time and we have our time now listen to what I'm saying if this don't happen here I've tried to say this many times if if the bride can't overcome right if the bride can't overcome and and come forth in the word and CH be a change and don't even talk about Israel over there right cuz there's no need to worri about what will take place if we if we don't come to the place to take a change of the body so then they are waiting on us so they without us cannot be made complete see they're waiting on us to come to the position but see I've done read the book that's what I'm if you understand what I'm doing I done read the book If you you had a book that would tell you you know that things and and and and in the book you find out that maybe you're an inheritance to a great amount of money well if you could read the book see the deed to whatever you want to bring it the will and you say this is mine you say yeah but but the will hasn't been probated yet what does it matter that's that's right I've always said you know if I had a something if I come along you know and somebody was going to give me $10 million you know right but it was going to be 5 years from now before I got it well I I I would go to all of the banker people I could find that would I could find somebody that would say Okay 5 years from now I get $10 million if you let me have a couple of million in advance I'll give you 1 million when the 5 years is up well if he's a good Banker he would read the paper see the things know that it's true know everything's right and he say hey I'll take it why he going to make a million bucks all right you're going to lose a million bucks but you're going to be able to enjoy it that's right it's like we went up my wife and I kind of check on drawing Social Security and I was really checking on me drawing and how long it would take me to get to the places cuz I had kind of wavered 62 all and U we get in there the leg said what you start drawing now I said because I'd lose money she made a couple of calculations she said you got two or three years before you can start drawing she said you realize how long it would take you to get the $100 back that if you wait 3 years and draw it and you get $100 a month you realize how much money you going to make between here and there I said hey I think that's got some sense to it I said sign me up she said okay I'll sign you wife up too you mean I can draw see we found out something you understand what I'm saying if you can get something and see it and if you can really see it in the word and then you can hold on to that that's it I have a promise in the Bible I don't have any physical evidence whatsoever to produce to you today right everything I would produce to you to try to show you that one day I'm going to be changed in a moment to twinkle and I everything I've got is false right cuz I'm getting older I'm getting sick I'm doing this I'm I'm going the opposite way but see God has told me that I would come to a place if I believe it right somebody is so why can't I believe I'm it well what if you're not well get me up okay you know you you're the one that's going to bring me out so you believe it right if I can't do anything let me preach it to you get you to believe get you to be anchored into the word right so we're not over where the seals literally happen but we see by Revelation the things that will take place that's wonderful we don't have to go through these things to be able to see what they'll be we already know what they will be as much as can be seen of maybe but not the physical part all right but we can see it we can understand and see the day that we're living is the most wonderful day we were talking about it last night we had a wonderful time last night of doing it now tapes or there if you want to get them you know brother Joel can make some copies off of them but we do copy the Bible study it's kind of independent and kind of you know out we just eat popcorn and and and have a good time talking about the word of the Lord amen all right see and fellowshipping together but see we were in it last night talking about the things that are personal to us right see you can read the word of God but you remember when you read the word of God it seemed like it was over Yonder seemed like it was to somebody else right right because it's kind of the way we were taught well we'll never come to this oh yes one of these days but that's you know you talk to anybody and say the end of that say they'll tell you they'll say the end of the world's coming don't you believe it look at the B time you start talking just a little bit and that first thing they'll say but nobody knows the name on the hour now let's don't get excited about it because I believe it'll be 100 years from now in other words it means they don't have to put up with it that's right right cuz they're going to be dead to God that's right but see church I believe we're down here at the end of it right not because there there's doing this or doing that but because of the revealed word not because of a pop com out of the United States or whatever what if he don't come what are you going to do well I guess you could die with in just a little bit see you always want to prop it up why prop up things why not be what we are amen but now if I bring this the way that I'm looking at it it might be a kind of surprise at the end so just hang on and think about it and it says here that there's an insert or a a interval a gap right and then in that Gap you have to put things in there to make it across right right you know you know what I'm talking about a bridge that's what a breach is brother around preach the six seal and then took the seventh seal to bridge it in between I mean the seventh chapter to bridge it in between the and sth seal he had something to put in there he took in the church ages the the the 10 virgins and if you go back and look you'll read it it'll go through six Church ages then 10 virgins and then the seventh Church a bridge a breach a bridge something in the breach the breach is is something but something's got to be in the breach if you just said there's a breach between yeah you would mean there's a gap yes right but if you can see what goes in that Gap amen right y l well amen I kind of believe I'm looking at what's going to fill the scal up right you know this gap between time amen that's right and Eternity amen I've always preached to you and I always believe you you go back to Leviticus 25 and 8 and 9 and 10 you'll find this prophet's message come at a special time yes right it came in a promised time a wonderful time amen he may have had to die we were talking last night and go on by the grave but yet his message is to live cuz he was that angel Messenger to bring us the message of but he said I must decrease that he might increase he had to get out of the way yes he'd be 104 5 years old now if he live you know that's all of the things but still we're not looking at that right we're looking at what did he bring amen all right now brother Brown this is an interval between the sixth vow plague and the seventh one and what is this that you're waiting us to see so we read it there three unclean spirits like frogs and notice it goes out of the mouth of the Dragon it goes out of the mouth of the false prophet goes out of the mouth of the Beast the same Doctrine so we've been through what the Beast is we've been through what the the dragon is we've been through what the false prophet brings and knowing that all of that is Catholicism coming forth now I'm not going to get D this afternoon the Lord willing will do it Wednesday cuz I'm going to change the directions in a minute and you'll see where I'll turn but you see when we come to it Armageddon is a little different from what we used to think about Armageddon that's right right see arm is just the termination of forces okay but where those forces come from we were down at aens Georgia years ago and a brother preached on Armageddon and he had the Russians coming down and he had the the the India China whatever all of those China especially all that coming down to fight Israel okay there will be those things right but brother Mo came out and he said brother said according to the force seal say where does those forces come from and the brother said he said I don't really know he said brother ROM tells you exactly where they come from now some of you that would know but don't say nothing but where does those forces come to fight the battle of Armageddon right well it comes from Russia it comes from China it comes from here com from that you show me in the fourth seal where brother randam ever named any country that they come from right right and yet he preached Armageddon he said it was Protestants and Catholics MH read your seal book and you get home come on he said Protestants and Catholics comeing against the word of God that's right right sure there'll be Russians and there be Chinese and there'll be this that or the other forces is coming but isn't it odd how the world is opening up now to allow Christianity to go into all of those countries yes right right do you know that in World War I that the Germans had In God We Trust on their belt buckle and we had it on our belt buckle right see we're looking at some kind of a great catastrophe to take place and missing the Simplicity that's the whole purpose that I'm going through the Book of Revelations is to get our mind off of some Beast some Dragon blowing fire some kind of s right and look at it already happen the mark of the beast what is that oh that's that that's that come on that's that's that's what we used to think oh they going to St it right across your forehead we found out it's your trinitarian Doctrine bring it down to Simplicity not make it some great big catastrophe make it what it say simply is once St the blood that's my whole goal we all in the Book of Revelation is to get us away from looking at great things and saying here it is the Bible said the moon would turn to blood I can't explain that to you even after the prophet said it but he said I can show you that's already happening well I don't know where happened if you ever find where it happened the prophet said you come tell me right and don't get down into some of those things that we think the moon was made out of cheese you know that brother Brown even made this statement was listening to tape the other day and you know what statement he made he said if you ever notice that man in the moon you know certain times you can look up you can see look like a man's face in the moon you know what he said it was it ain't cheese right you know what said what and they proved it when they got there he said it's valleys and mountains on the surface of the Moon that you make it look like a man's face look how simple we spent all the time to go and what did he do he said I first went first off he said don't think he'll ever make it that was a statement come in there ear years that's what he said but watching what he said he said if they do they won't find nothing you need that quote from R random he said they won't find nothing well if we just listen to that or read the Bible you know the the day missing in space he had to go back to the Bible to prove what it was high not and to find out how to make their calculations correct they had to go to the Bible to get the time and it says about a day so they run it up there they found out there was about what 40 minutes missing or something like that so many minutes was missing well then they had to go back to the Bible find out that the moon the sun went back so many degrees then they had enough to prove right if they read the Bible to start with it would have to wor about but if they read the Bible and believed it they would been working on trying to find cures for all the things we've got instead of billions of dollars of junk to send to outer space What are you going to find up there brother you don't believe in illegal alien no I believe in stupidity of people if there is somebody there he's just like me he needs salvation that's amen right he may not look like me but he needs salvation right that's right why can't we be this straight honest what if a jet what if a big plane sits down in your front yard I'm going to say hey guys how you do it it's going to be hardd they to understand ain't that something all these uh times that people have talked to these extraterrestrial beings they can always understand them uh oh that's kind of ODOT is it okay get off going on but listen there's three unclean spirits like frogs and it goes out of the mouth of the Dragon right goes out of the mouth of the Beast goes out of the mouth of the false prophet right whatever they say is the same right right y right that's the point this whatever it said is the sign now watch it when we get down towards the end of seeing how come in this message seemingly the a lot of the Ministers of this message are turning back to those word phrases and things that they had a long time ago you need it odd that the first I see in Council was not over the Trinity right I want you to show me it was over whether Jesus was almighty God or a like substance they even denounced the like substance doctrine of the first n in counsel and declared read it declared that he was almighty God but people don't want to go read that they just got their mind see but see the man had already made the inroad of his Doctrine right that back there that taught that Jesus wouldn't god Till The River Jordan that's what he Tau and it kind of odd that Doctrine would flare up in the last days right they were trying to establish the fact of two Lords andin it kind of odd that Doctrine fell back into state right y some of these doctrines are so identical right you can take the two Soul Doctrine and identically lay it with the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence right but yet a big portion of the message people believe that Doctrine especially the Foreign Fields and still believe it today is it odd that those things came from B guar over here well you know brother brand might be right when he said every doctrine that there is come out of Genesis you remember that right he said the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian the Pentecostals the Catholics was all in Genesis right now some he brought down with enough understanding that we can clarify nimrods and things like that motherson worship right come out of Genesis out of some of those people that were back there is it odd it would come over today and be right Among Us right ain't it odd that the deity doctrines of the back there in Genesis would come over and they would believe brother Bram to be God right we see people don't want to hear it like that I want to hear something about how good we are tell us how tell us about the good like we were talking about last night when the Bible says that that talking about coming to the the law being a school Master to bring us to Christ all right when you come to Christ do you forget the law the law would be don't cut your heart don't wear paint don't do this don't worry don't don't do don't do don't but when we come to the school M we come from the school Master the Christ of Revelation go cut your hair all you want to where all pants you want to we're in another dispensation now do you know that's a Doctrine in this message right it's called that we're already in the Millennium yeah that's in this message see see church I don't like to be arrogant or hateful and don't call names but those doctrines are in the message right where' they come from the original Trinity first Trinity we call it the original Trinity came out of the mouth of somebody how many of you know that brother Brown Tau that there would be a new Trinity come out in the end time you ever read that we're going to read it in a second that won't be my opinion that it would come out of the old Trinity the old Trinity was established bragging on greater depth but en roded in it 325 a day or come in a little bitty thing but then by 606 it began to be developed in what was called a trinity Doctrine all right what about a new Trinity to come out after the opening of the seal you believe he said that yes sir if it came out after the opening of the seals and it came out after 63 you know I'm honest and I'm I'm wrong you correct me I don't know of no new doctrine in Catholicism other than the old Trinity do you has the old Trinity Doctrine yeah n see you coming down the denomination the organization are they teaching any form of a new Trinity no they're still on the same old Trinity right right y same one they started with they still got y MH so could the new Trinity come out of the people of this message right amen sure amen oh got to come out of the mouth of somebody that's right y I give you a break this morning I harder screamed with you now let's than okay I like to do that every once in a while but I like to settle down and just think things over righten am you know it took a long time for me to learn to ride a bicycle a matter of fact I was about 16 years old I just kind of slug but you know what I did finally learn the right one we just bear with me let's see what brother randam had to say about this three unclean spirits like frog and see where he says they come from and when they come out then would you believe it of course after turn on the the internet you're going to you're going to cut it off and you say I don't believe it anyway well going just see what brother Brown has to say go ahead brother let's start off I didn't give them these so I had to give them to him later and you know I'm bad to do that to shuffle things around I I wouldn't asked you to please read the our hearer the mass the anointed once at the end time all but remember it is the the anointed ones that he's speaking of is the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost anointing someone but they themselves are false you you understand the background of anointed ones you say well how to do anointed ones well then you don't have the new birth because you that you know the ones that have the new birth you got to have an anointing of the Holy Ghost right are you going to say the anointed ones got something greater than you no brother random is explaining the anointed ones the inside the soul of that individual is not born again the outside of that individual is Anointed with a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit I believe that right all right that's why it's called see they put it the anointed ones at the end time y but it's really the title is what anointed ones all right now watch what he says when he gets over to paragraph 236 through 244 let's just read it this may be all we get on the message today but that'll be fine preached in 1965 7:25 the morning service notice here something real quick now while we're ending the our talk notice Revelation 1613 to 14 is that where we just read 16 13 says the unclean Spirit three unclean spirits okay if you want to put that down I want have time to maybe go in go to it maybe to go to it I want you to be sure and see it now notice this is the sounding between the sixth and seventh vow all right that's Revelations 16 you come up to verse 12 insert yeah drop this that's the six trumpet uh six vow PL you go down to verse 17 picks up the seventh one so it's an interval just like I was saying about the seals tonight now we'll close out just in a minute if you can just by a few minutes longer closing out now notice Revelation 1613 to 14 between the sixth and seventh vow three unclean spirits like frogs did you notice that went out of the mouth of someone and what does it say over there they went out of the mouth of the Beast they went out of the mouth M false prophet they went out of the mouth of the Dragon they all got the same Doctrine okay what real K Spirits like frog did you notice that when out of the mouth of someone now Noti quickly are you ready say Amen congregation said amen a trinity of spirits watch that a trinity of frogs y a frog is an animal that looks always looks backward he never looks where he's going he looks where he's come from everybody know about a frog okay see now don't you see don't you see where was trinitarianism born at remember he's looking back where was it born at remember three uncan Spirits individual Spirits are you getting congregation says amen notice they look back to the naum council where the Trinity Doctrine was born that not in the Bible that now the false prophet he covers you know what it comes out the N seean Council Rome the Trinity was born and that's where it come from the Trinity of frogs came out of the old Trinity gave birth to a new Trinity their mother what did it come out of a trinity the dragon see the Beast and the false prophet now you think you some people think you trapped Point down of what I said want I go but remember the old Trinity came out of the Roman Catholic Church which was paganism that's what he's explaining right paganism of trinitarian Doctrine come over to the Catholic church and formed a new Trinity right a new teaching of uh paganism come out from the old Roman paganism that's what he's explaining but then he gets on down in a minute and he explains something else related to this day so just in case somebody would look at that and say hey wait just a minute you explain while to go well let's explain now see there's no such a thing they look back to the naan Council okay where the Trinity was born at notice where they come from where did the Trinity at Rome where did the Trinity at NAA come from and The Trinity of frud came out of an old Trinity from old doctrine of many gods that's why the Roman Catholics come in with all of those many gods they had to get something brother around said because it wouldn't line up with the word where they come notice in the Trinity FR come an old Trinity give birth to a new Trinity their mother so they gave birth to organized religion gave birth to the Roman Catholic Church the mother what did it come out of a trinity the dragon see the Beast and the the false prophet a trinity knew for when when were these frauds come out we did it notice they was there all the time but it wasn't manifested until between the sixth and seventh vow just before the seal opened to reveal it now he's bringing it down our okay he said I feel of people resenting that notice the Trinity the dragon how many knows what the dragon was it was wrong and the dragon stood before the woman div our child as soon as it was born that's right what does beast mean in the bible power right Bible means power all right false prophet false prophet and a false anointed one all right now what false prophet false prophet a false anointing one now let me explain something here see the dragon is Rome Pagan Rome become powerful wrong true right I know you're getting sleepy so high highas now the dragon that stood before the woman of our child was not the Roman Catholic church right so you need some understanding in there right the Roman Catholic Church didn't stand before Jus before married to Dev child devour child when it was first born come on you got to think a little the Roman Catholic Church didn't come along till a few hundred years later right see she's trying to devour this child that comes forth see the natural Roman government was one that stood before Jesus Christ that's right and before he was was born and killed all the babies and the things that wasn't the Catholic church right so now move the Catholic Church on down a few hundred years and then see how she starts trying to Devour the child in other words the word she started eating the word down right through the Dark Ages she took the word away she's eating up the child I've mentioned a little bit of that in Revelations 12 about what 40 sermons ago all right started work this is false prophet singular look how specific the prophet would be the Bible says false prophet it doesn't say false prophets you know in the reading comes out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the the the and then it comes out of the mouth of the false prophet look how specific brother R can be starting word this false prophet singular false prophet the first hope MH now he's so specific with his scriptures he got it exactly in line the Bible says false prophet doesn't say false prophets they in Revelations 16:13 if the th come out where did the come from the and the mother of Harlot the whole thing it came from that original false prophet singular guy that started the first poem now that's that's pretty specific a it you said brother BR really didn't understand it's amazing to me sometime how the man speaks with a seventh grade education amen that he's so precise with his words if you'll take it right right and try to devour what he's talking about cuz like up above there he's putting the dragon the different the the mother the different things the old Roman government was the one that tried to kill or put Jesus trying to kill him it wasn't a Roman Catholic church but the Roman Catholic church after it began to develop was started trying to Devour the child right that's Revelations 12 y coming on down watch a false Trinity was Rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days it went right on through with it but when the Seven Seals become come and open those Mysteries and reveals them that's when the frogs the three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a trinity Doctrine against the truth are you reading when did the seal was open I thought that was 1963 right y so there's a new Trinity to come out in the end time where're at see where it come from see where it's going back to ecumenical council they're all Brothers anyhow and the things watch now where we at 241 what paragraph We on how it uncovered yet false prophet singular so we're through with a reading all right come out to manifest themselves now you look around at the people of this doctrine of this message and if you can't find those old trinitarian Concepts you was asleep while ago when I was explaining and then you come up later and you tell me I missed it and I say you wake up that's right had a brother one time he said you said so and so I said I never said it he said yes you did I hurt you I said we'll solve that problem see he thought he was really going I said let's go pull the tape that's why they're there right you out on the internet you say I I caught you here there okay come on let's see it I've got the tapes that I can pull every tape that I preached here from 198 82 up to now and let's see if I said it the brother said well I don't know and see he he was just trying to Bluff me don't try to Bluff me I don't Bluff too good I'm just honest cuz I've always been you know you can run after you you if somebody Bluffs you just Bluff back you got to run then run later you know I mean he bust your nose time to run but if he's Bluff it just Bluff but see if you got the goods you don't have to worry about Bluff in or all do you I smart why in the world can't people value somebody that knows this message over something that's made predictions and made all kind of things that's going on and know nothing about the message and the Very people that's preaching these doctrines that the prophet said he I didn't read I didn't say he said it would come out after the seals what was the SE pre 63 to after then three unclean spirits like frogs developed in this message mhm right you go read anointed on and see if I'm wrong that's right come on you read the whole book come back and tell me I'm wrong he really got strong in anointed once the end time to show how it was going off that people was twisting his message go back and read three unclean spirits like frogs going out of the mouth of somebody it's got to have a false prophet amen right every Doctrine in this message is got a false prophet y if it's a false Doctrine right right and then it can't be but one true Prophet cuz it ain't but one truth of the message so we didn't need but one true prophet and that ain't Samuel Dale that's William Bram right he was a true Prophet so then it'd have to be false prophets come off to try to tell you what he's talking about right right right come on I'm just asking you to check it it is hardd that these doctrines that were way back there right I come through the Baptist Church and what was the doctrine there you don't have to believe it I mean you don't have to have it just believe just believe you got everything when you believed people in this message say that you get all of this right here the day you're born again you get all them virtues and everything day he born again well how in the world could you tell that person anything you know what it would be like and this actually happen most of you know that I was 2 years in studying this message before I ever said I had to baptism with the ho ghost because I didn't believe I had it once I seen the prophet the way he was bringing the message I seen I didn't have the new mer you said well I had a new bir all the time it brought me to where it is I was reading six books a day and listening to two Tes don't you think I believe the message you know what I talked to a Baptist one day and I had told him that I didn't believe that I had the new birth brother brother said you better leave in bad just alone you ever heard him say that he said theyare you depart that word right I was telling this bck I could call his name and he would know him and I said told him about something in the the godhead and the doctrin you know and everything he said Sam I thought you told me one day that you didn't have the new birth you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said you're exactly right I still don't have it he said then you can't teach me nothing he said because I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and says you know that you're not supposed to teach it unless you got it is that Bible right you can't tell nobody about the new birth until you get the New Birth come on PL SS you know what I done I shook his head and laugh I mean his hand laugh you're right that don't change what I just said that's the truth you still need to get baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know but you see what I'm talking about we think we've got it figured out then a prophet would come along and talk about a new Trinity that come out after the opening of the seal this is not a new thing we preached this 40 years ago a new Trinity to come out before some of these doctrines ever even come out I was warning you to be careful of the doctrines you hear right well brother D I listen to brother so and so I didn't hear him say that wake up yeah I've talked to people exactly like that and they say I've listened to Tes out of that man for years and he ain't never said there was two Lords you don't understand what they were trying to say maybe I don't right so you don't understand them that that say that that you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost today like you had it on the day of Pentecost there's a major doctorine among the message forign fields are real full of it yeah I can name the names of the doctrine those people that taught them we see they would tell you right in front of you don't W do it with me because I was there one of them told a brother that used to be here is dead and gone on now he said I ain't never taught nothing like that that's a lie I tapped him on the shoulder I said turn around and tell me you ain't never said it CU he sit in my house and told me that nobody had the Holy Ghost like it was in the book of Acts I said I'm not trying to prove a doctor I'm showing you brother random brother BR said he met people with the Holy Ghost with exactly like the day of Pentecost 50 years before him right but see he wouldn't turn around and tell me he wasn't afraid of me physically he just knew better cuz he knew I'd sit in home and talk to him about it other brother was a wonderful sweet brother that wouldn't say nothing back to him but listen church I thought brother Bram said I'll be glad when somebody gets like they were back there that would say you're not saying what Paul said that's right that's right oh you just got your you're just arrogant and hateful well does that change the truth I'm going to agree with you I'm arrogant and hateful but does that change the truth does that make you where you don't have to believe it I thought if a dum donkey told you the truth you had to believe what the truth was you see what I'm talking about three unclean spirits injected in between right the sixth and seventh plague you know some of these plagues has already taken place right that's my point that I've made with you some these vows are already taking place upon the Earth some of these things are already here why don't we believe it you just got a bone to pick with somebody I've got a bone to pick with one thing it's either the truth or not the truth let's get this thing settled right I mean 40 something years why do you think we've been here 40 something years for right right why do you think we've been around hor 40 something years you know why they went out around horb you read your Bible why did they go around horb for 40 years somebody say it where I don't have to cuz everybody accuses me to being a smart alley it was to let the old dead heads die off you go read your Bible 40 years they went around there to let them people die that had spood Moses that's right now you get your Bible and read it and tell me I'm wrong that's right brother Dale you're pretty old that's right there's old heads I told you about first time I went to Jeffersonville we was up there and we was in a ministers meeting and I come back around this D laughing brother Mo said what in the world you laughing about I said well I went over this one group was the old man this happened old man that was in the message with brother Bram I knew a lot of them personally and and I said they was all saying that the young people had missed it you had to be able to see the prophet oh my if you didn't see the prophet way he made his hands go and what he done way he spoke that you couldn't understand what he's talking about well I went over to another group and I did I went over here there was a bunch of young you know rer Snappers like can myself it just coming along you know what they were saying they saying all the old ones has got a 20 and above got to die off because it's us young ones that go into the promised land I laugh I'm still laughing but crying three unclean spirits like frogs you realize if I've got any Doctrine whatsoever that is connected to the Trinity I am the one this Bible and the Prophet is speaking of so that's why you got to know the message that's right right Amen brother it's not brother Dale's a good guy and he's a good fell and we we stay with him cuz he's good that won't work that's right we can all die and go to hell together let's get into the message and find out whether it's the truth or not show me what the messenger says don't give me your ideas or thoughts they don't work that's it's what the Bible says it's what the prophet had to say Amen when I tell you something that's my opinion I always tell you that's my opinion outside of that I'm trying my best to tell you what he said am he said these three unclean spirits like frogs would go out of the mouth of somebody after the opening of the seals but look around you and find a few doctrines going on that are connected to the trinity okay what see that makes me a smart at it because I told you the truth now you know what it makes me what the Bible says it makes me your enemy because I told you the truth that's what the Bible says amen the church it's a desperate hour yes but it's the most wonderful hour yes that's right I'm going to say it this way then Wednesday night the Lord will preach I'll try to bring it back into things there's going to be a battle one of these days it was called the battle of Armageddon and in that battle it will be a great forceful battle in the Bley what is it mego megido is that the word for it says it even it'll be there and brother brandham said it scripture doesn't bring it out brother Bram brings it out it even the blood would run to the bridal mouth of a horse I've been in that Valley we were there in Israel we went to that Valley I I'm just plain honest but not contrary if you took all of the people of the world and put them in that Valley right now the blood would not run the depth of a Bridal's mouth if he was standing up you say okay he's laying down okay you you do your carnalities CU a Bridal's mouth would mean it would have to be at least somewhere in a 3-ft bracket and that Valley is thousands of miles this away and that way it's not a a valley that's ducked out you know and it's 5 miles wide it's hundreds of miles but if you took every battle that has ever happened there and all the blood that has run out of those people cuz it's 26 I believe it is times that that place was rebuilt I believe that's right 1926 I I keep forgetting the memories of it but you take all of the battles that's ever happened there and you put all the blood there that's ever happened in that Valley it would be up to the brid's mouth for the Bible Tri the prophet tribe because you took all of the blood that was shed there but see it's to happen there and it's to be a great battle a great destructive decisive battle all right but you see the Bride of Jesus Christ is now fighting the greatest battle that's ever fought right you agree where's it at right here in the human mind is that the N the greatest battle ever fall and see we're in a spiritual Army getting remember the compound meanings a physical battle of Armageddon but a spiritual battle of Armageddon we're in a spiritual battle right now you and I are having a spiritual battle of Armageddon I'm trying to think of a direct quote that brother were talking about about some battle that happens and he said that's what's taking place now we're at Katie Baria yeah right right you remember that you want prophet's message we're at kades barel which was a decision time of whether or not to go into the Promised Land all right and Cades Baria you remember what happened the first time they were there and they refused to go over and Moses said okie doie yep to the Wilderness we go yep if you remember the story if you don't read your Bible The Story Goes that the next day the children of Israel come to Moses and they said we don't want to go to the Wilderness y we want to go across he said I'm not going with you you don't made up your mind you said they said we're going they went down and fought a battle and lost a bunch of people read your Bible at CAD Barne they went and fought a battle because they did not have the leader Moses with them to lead them through and they had to come back and follow Moses y right around the mountain y we're at Katie spia because of a decision time of whether or not this message is right right or whether or not we're so sympathetic until we believe that brother someone was a good brother I've never said nobody wouldn't I've told you many of the doctrinal people of this message that I met and shook their hand and that as far as a person they were great people the two Soul Man invited me to come up and preach for him when I first met him I told to him I said I just don't understand it I don't believe what you believe that's called I don't believe it's because I don't see it I've talked to many of them the I mean the well I talked to the 700 virt man year years ago too but the one that was no Holy Ghost Doctrine I said listen him preach wonderful man but yet he got carried off the two Soul Man preached against polygamy in his first Beginnings but then he started practicing polygamy and the ending of his message I'm talking about good people getting caught not talking about some PP out of Rome talking about Good Brothers I've known some good brothers and sisters in this nation some wonderful people going to spend eternity with them you say yeah but if they got the wrong Doctrine that's what you don't know than what I preached 40 years ago that there'd be a lot of people die before the end time because they wouldn't have the ability to come to a change and I may be one of them and you may be one of them because we don't have the ability to stand there and change the moment twinkling life if it don't and you got the new birth you got to go to the ground first so you can come up like I told him last night you may die one minute and raise the next one sure what's it got to do with it but you're going to go by the grave if we don't have Rapture in faith that's pling sense you said well brother Dale I got you there what about the babies the problem cuz I heard you say that if a baby was there like Jo like uh Jonas and like you know Eli I believe if Mom and dadd is a born again Christian and go into Rapture God's not going to leave that baby here and that baby's going to get eternal life and going to be standing there 18 20 years old you want proof of it Sharon Rose brother rand's daughter MH 18 months old but the next time he saw her she was standing at the gate a beautiful young woman that he didn't even know who she was cuz she was 17 18 years old she said I'm waiting on Billy to come see we don't think about what eternal life is what if it's a spec of eternal life that's Eternal y that's right that's it any spot of eternal life is eternal Luther's justification is eternal life amen Y and his the of is just as Eternal is yours why because eternal life is eternal life it's the person of Jesus Christ right he not degreed Jesus had all of it right but we don't have all of it so it's degreed into bases that you and I must become the fullness of the godhead bodily or there's not going to be a Rapture of the church that's what your Prophet says amen that's right he said we got to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 yes right that's what he said said turn this back turn that back but you get a new birth of that you'll know what's going on y the birth of this message do you understand what I'm trying to say yes we're in the greatest battle that's ever fought in the human mind because right now going through your mind is quotes quotes quotes quotes I got chewed out one time for saying one thing and I I simply said I said I don't want you to write down any notes today I want you to just listen to me preach cuz you write notes you can't hear every word I say I don't care who you are right right right even you that can typ every word I say you can't comprehend what I said you're only getting wor the mind is not comprehending what I'm saying the mind is only hearing what I say and transporting it to the fingers that's right right why you got so much mass confusion let see Church that greatest battle is going on right now am whether or not we believe this message and why is it in the end time that they've now come out with all of these things that brother Bram was wrong about his dates out there in Arizona yeah then he said this and said this is it's all come out after the opening of the seals right right they wouldn't dare attack brother Brandon when he was here and say he was wrong right now they're saying he was wrong and not only now saying he was wrong saying Jesus was wrong and if I call that name most of you would go through the flowboard of this church and wind up in the basement because you're listening to them and you call them wonderful brothers I'll never called them nothing to tell but I just don't agree no but listen Church what about all of the things of the message until look at it now around the message until you can hardly get a group together they're just little Splinter groups yet the Foreign Fields are running like crazy and there millions over there but now I'm going to ask you something I'm sorry but if you take a two Soul Doctrine to a foreign field you're not going to convert them to this message I don't care how much you say brother Brown said you're going to convert them to your Doctrine right y you're not going to put out money to convert to brother Brown's message you're putting out money to convert to your idea of two Soul 700 virt Peru is son of man no Holy Ghost River Jordans and things that's right so what is the world hearing are they hearing the truth right I told you about the brother you know and I told him one time I said now you've talked to people brother R was a prophet now tell him what he go right I mean you go have a meeting you get 500 converted to the message you go have a second meeting you don't want them converted and unconverted put them over in the room to theel and teach them when he talk get you 500 more started that's right I know about being that American I know that's but is it the truth the world's wanting to know what this Prophet taught but what are they hearing I talk about what I know right I said and listened to a man explaining to denominational people just trying to get them into the message and he was telling them that brother brandham was the angel that come to John on patmas that's a big doctor in this message even if that was true do you realize what those unconverted people are thinking this guy is deity this guy believes R around him is God that's right right right that's right cuz I believe it was God that come to John pmas the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man amen right but you teaching will we we're teaching them about the Simplicity of the message brother there we're not getting into the deep time well why do you bring up right if I have been some of them sitting there and didn't know this message i' have got up and spit in that man's face and walked out you said brother Dale you would have yes I would have because they were teaching I teach people that don't know nothing that brother randam was the one to come to John on even if that was true ask brother dick did I explain brother brandom to him when I first started talking to him he asked me months later where did you get this at I said no I'll tell you yep trying to convert people to the message but then telling them brother brandom is deity while you doing you said Brother D who's doing that I'm already in enough trouble I'll answer you privately but I won't answer you from here cuz I'm already in that much trouble cuz everybody thinks I'm against everybody in this minage no I'm looking for people that want to hear the word not what I got to say I want to hear what they've got to say about Jesus Christ do you understand what I mean yes three unclean spirits like frogs come out after the opening of the seals you know that brother random even people used to no I won't go that bring up night but you see brother random loved people and wanted to help them but they said he had a book now this is what was told that he had a book written down where people come into the message and went out you ever heard that story the brother R had it wrote down where they come in and where they went out if God revealed it to him it would be no problem with it look at the people in this message that come to brother Brown and moved in beside of him and things in Jeffersonville And yet when he died they went back to organized religion the Nam that you hear on almost almost every tape not sure hope God didn't let brother randam see those things right cuz he would have died of a broken heart three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of someone the prophet said the Beast the false prophet the old mother the denominations everybody's teaching the same identical Doctrine and a big portion of the ministers in this message are preaching the same identical Trinity Doctrine right if you believe that Jesus wouldn't go up to the River Jordan you're a trinitarian screaming that we're W this take on these time the battle of Armageddon is a spiritual battle in The Bride of Jesus Christ going on right now right right the termination of forces cuz that's what happens in Armageddon right yep that's a termination of forces right right yep and brother R is R and we'll get to it Wednesday that the battle of Armageddon will be between Protestants and Catholics trying to gather against Israel right if that's right then where are we Gathering now right he said Gathering Together against the truth people don't want to hear the truth and come to meet personally said brother Dale I want you to come to my church and preach marriage and divorce I've heard that youve preached it and brought it through and I want to hear it and I want my people to hear it I said brother would you do me a favor I said would you click on the internet and pull up the series I preached on marriage and divorce and listen to it and then make up your mind whether you want me to come or not he was already making dates can you come here can you come I want you to come for a week if NE whatever it takes I said just pull it up and see what I talk that man won't even hardly shake my hand today he never called me to come and preach right well you just a smart tic that's what it is well what are you I made a state years ago in everybody life never did understand it you ain't Jr and I ain't Sue Ellen so what's going on now some of you know what that was that was the old what was it Dallas Z and Jr and Sue Ellen what do I mean I mean we're all just human beings and we're all learning right y right I sat there the other day reading through the Book of Revelation just turning and I sat there thinking God there was a time that I didn't know what in the world none of these symbols were I didn't know nothing about this what this was and all of these beasts and this and that and the other and but now Lord I can read through the book and just follow it and see what's taking place thank God for the truth that's right let's stand we're just going to sing one song W's going to do the communion today I've done told these brothers they got in another line B's going to be next and aon's last I may even put Terren in there somewhere because I warn him ahead of time because Deacon ought to be able to take all these things and do sir but you see church I believe the truth amen sorry for way I am I'm just me I'm just a human being that's trying to find the truth Desiring the truth wanting to know the truth because it says you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right brother R said that three clean Spirit like frog come out against the truth yeah you know there's not a person in this message that any of those Doctrine forms that I called out they're not one of them that would get up and say well I'm false you ought not be listening to me M right you ever heard a denominational preacher preach that is false I mean you went the church you in denomination you ever heard a preacher say it's false I never have heard one everybody says they got the truth right well if the truth is as mixed up as everybody's got it no wonder the world are want I'm sorry to say things like but I thought now here you are this brother I thought you're over here converting people that don't know nothing about brother Bram never heard his name until you brought it up and you're trying to tell them that brother Bram come to join on B that's say deity as anything could be right anybody have a need before we go into the communion I love you I love you because he
