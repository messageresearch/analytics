[Music] shining in the light of your power and we see [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of your own to power only ho [Music] Oh [Music] whoa [Music] amen that's our desire tonight good to be in the house of the Lord y'all hear me alright alright I'm in trouble tonight Louisa sitting on the front row you were their shooting range brother what yeah oh that's right so listen I'm gonna read from Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 tonight and we're going to take four a little topic maybe up maybe a little strange topic all aboard the gospel train then you say well you might say well how did you get that from Acts well let's see let's just as there is there back there pulling that up let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight or Jesus and gather together one another Lord Jesus as we bring our little licks of fire together Lord we know that your word and your spirit is uniting the bride more and more closer and closer together until we get to a honing just a razor-edged and we see it coming to past and today Lord Jesus we just observed that the signs of the times and the the revelation of the our Lord and we're so grateful to be able to live in this time and I pray God that you'll just come tonight and make your word perform at what it's supposed to do tonight tonight Lord God bless it as it goes forth Lord and I pray God that your Lord feel welcome here tonight Lord as we open the doors of our heart and the doors of our church and just open up completely to you Lord that you can have the preeminence tonight Lord we just ask you to come and take your abode with us and bless your word we ask in the name the Lord Jesus Christ amen Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey and when they were coming and they went up into an upper room and I've got that highlighted in red because that's the really the key point they went up in the upper room because that was word you know Jesus told him to go to Jerusalem that was there waiting point there they were up there waiting for something to happen where abode both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of Alphaeus and Cylons and Lotus and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one prayer Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus with his brethren you may be seated little Bliss's word so here they are if I could just set a little background they've here they are up in the upper room and you know really if you want to put this into context they really might not be fully aware of what's about to take place they've gone through all these all the they've seen all of the different events unfold that were very surprising and very unexpected and everything and you know if you want to go back and look at think about how they had walked and and talked with Jesus for three and a half years and been with him as they saw him perform wonders and saw him live his life out and saw him do all of these things and then he gave them the Great Commission and kind of gave him all of these promises and I want to maybe think tonight about all the promises that you have in the Bible and these promises maybe represent the night if I want to just kind of painting a picture in your mind these promises represent a gospel train a locomotive if you will that's sitting on the track and we want to see how we can put this locomotive this gospel train into action well the disciples had seen this locomotive in action they had seen the Train in action as it walked the shores of Galilee and they saw Jesus perform all these things and live they saw him for example or maybe at first heard the stories about how after the Spirit fell on him and there on the River Jordan he went into the wilderness and was tempted by the Evelynn how he reacted to the devil and knew exactly what to say to him and knew how to how to respond and and and knew right how to put the devil in his place they had seen that great faith that he had how he stepped out on the water and he walked on the water and something held him up and when he called Peter Peter was able to walk on the water with him and to him and they saw how he would curse the fruit tree for not bearing forth fruit and they they remembered how God had had with his spoken word he spoke to that fruit tree and the fruit tree had to obey his command and then Jesus would come and tell them the very strange saying that if use if you have enough faith if faith is a mustard seeds a little grit a little grain of faith of a mustard seed something that can't be corrupted if you speak to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart then it'll have to obey you and as we go along as I recite all these these things think about the disciples up there in that Upper Room were remembering all these things and thinking about how that they these things were something that was in Jesus Christ life they were in that locomotive and now Jesus was gone and it's time for that what was what was manifested in his life to be made manifest in another body of flesh in a group of people that were sitting there in that upper room you think about how how Jesus manifested virtue now he when that woman came up and touched his garment he turned and he said just I know something happened here everybody stop for a second because somebody touched me and she reached she reached out and touched him by faith believing that there was something in that man that was special something that she could pull something out of and you remember how Jesus talked to the woman at the well and said I'll give you well Springs of everlasting life I'll give you water that you don't know anything about you say you worship over here and you worship at the mountain and the Jews worship in Jerusalem but I'll tell you where one of these days people are gonna know where to worship they'll worship in spirit and in truth it won't be in any particular place but they'll be worship they'll be worshiping the truth think about how Jesus with the Pharisees came to him and they they approached him and with the trickery and things and trying to trying to put something over on him and saying whoa who's in script you know who should we pay taxes to who should we do this to and and he turned around and he knew exactly how to respond and he said well whose inscription is on the coin and no matter how they approached him he always knew what the right response was why because not only did he have faith but he also had virtue and he also had knowledge he was the stature of a perfect man because he was that perfect man he was he was the the masterpiece they're walking on the shores of Galilee this man had had the kind of temperance where when they drug into the cross they could beat him and spit on his face and he wouldn't react he would just allow himself to be led like a lamb to the slaughter led to the cross allow himself to go through all of that punishment for you and I looking at cute looking at you and his mind's eye realizing that the things that he went through those things that he suffered were for your sake and I want to say to you tonight that that is real brotherly kindness well you can lay down your life for somebody else and say I'm willing to I'm willing to die for this person I'm willing to do whatever whatever it takes that this person could enter into the kingdom that this person can realize the benefits of the promises of God patience where he he dealt with all the disciples and walked with him and he said finally do you now believe oh you of little faith do you finally believe and he walked with him and talked with him and it kind of kind of you know you know encouraged him along the way and helped him out when they stumbled helped him to answer their questions even when they would come to him and say we you you spoke about this when you were preaching to the pharisees and sadducees and i didn't quite understand what you meant and he dealt with him and he and he kept talking to him and till finally they got it was just a mental conception just the mental intellectual kind understanding and then think about godliness when he said who do you say that I the Son of Man am and he was able to identify himself as God in flesh because he knew who he was he knew who he knew he wasn't just another prophet he knew when he talked to those Pharisees and Sadducees in the temple when he was just another boy he knew who he was he didn't come with any kind of you know confusion about what was happening what was taking place and he was able to respond to them but just as a little young bored within a way that would confuse them and confound them because he was God in flesh do you think about all this was wrapped up in this man and this was the locomotive that they they up there in the upper room how are we how are we going to make this work how are we going to make this work think about mark chapter 16 verse 15 and 19 then maybe they would reflect back to and think about how Jesus Jesus told them that they were supposed to have things happened in their life they were supposed to have power to cast out Devils now I just want to read it here for a second so it really sinks in and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature preach the gospel to every creature because the same when Jesus he went into the temple and took took the scroll of Isaiah and said I the Spirit of the Lord has on me to preach the deliverance of the captive and all those things you know somebody else after Jesus left the earth somebody else has the preach the deliverance of the captain somebody else has the preach the delivers to us so that the priests preach this Gospel message that's why I'm calling it the gospel train what's what what will power this gospel train he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues and I want to declare tonight that I still believe these things I still stand for that these signs shall follow them they believe because the Word of God is still active today he's Hebrews 13:8 he's still able to perform signs and wonders like the children of Israel when they wandered through Egypt they had the pillar of fire and their midst they were led by the prophet of God and signs and one could not help but follow them because they were believers when they got to the River Jordan it had done Foley had to pass before then because they were believers and they had the word with them these signs shall follow them they believe in my name they shall cast out devils do you believe that I you know I believe that the preaching of the word is what cast out devils your sanctified by the hearing of the word and the devil will leave you but what if you're in a situation where listen what if you had the devil has got you in such a situation where you're slithering on the floor you just can't react there's a power that's in the preaching of the gospel there's a power that there in Saints to make that devil get up and leave to make that thing get out I believe in the power of the gospel I believe in the power of the resurrected Jesus because sitting there tonight is a witness that Jesus Christ is not still in the grave but he's alive and he's rose that is really he's risen again it is the rising of the Sun his rose again he's not still in the ground but he's living in the lives of people because this gospel train is moving that's what I think I want to talk about tonight is not just not just that the gospel train needs to move but I believe it is moving I believe that the gospel train is what started on the day of Pentecost and then never stopped it'll never stop until it reaches its destination because jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and that's train and go stop until you get to your destination and that's where he is they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe that because I've seen it now I haven't seen taking up serpents and things but I believe that there's a life in that down on the inside of a believer that's able just like with Paul that to repair all the things that you know what we're telling about the story of the brother branham's pastor when he was just starting out how he took up that somebody said well you had a had a vial of opposing what her sitting up there on the pulpit and said if the gospel is true come up and drink this and prove it and he went up there and proved and he drunken down that whatever it was some kind of vile poison and they start a little revival in that church why because the people saw that the promises that are written in this Bible they were somebody was able to make a move somebody was able to make them to believe it enough to see that gospel locomotive moving that gospel train was moving it's real and it's live and it's filled by the Word of God look at my getting my head myself so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and said on the right hand of God and now now he's off the scene so now how does that gospel locomotive gonna get started you know they were up there in that upper room thinking that all of these things you know you know you think think about this picture now think about this this locomotive sitting on the track they had heard all the word they had heard it laid out exactly how everything should be all these things that would be in the moment quicken but for now it was sitting on the track maybe maybe if you were to walk up to it and put your hand on it we cold to the touch and you'd feel like the coldness of an eye you know you wonder sometimes if that's how a lot of Christians are today they don't have a fire down on the inside they don't have something-something ball and they don't have steam on the inside because the Bible says that this gospel locomotive that I'm talking about it's supposed to have fire and pillars of smoke it's supposed to have fire on the inside it's supposed to be fast and it's supposed to keep getting faster and faster and faster it's supposed to be something as speedy and you know you know if you look at a real locomotive you know they said they only had maybe five or ten horsepower but because of the way that it was built it didn't need much fuel to run fast with just a little bit of feel that can run 200 miles per hour across the plains and that's how that gospel locomotives supposed to be it's supposed to be something on the inside burning something feeling it something to keep it warm so that when you get up next to it you can get warm from it not not cold like painting words on the page where you don't you know that doesn't happen you get warm from a painted fire you gotta have something that's real cold to the touch unmoving you know I think many times people people want to see you know the Bible says that the whole earth is waiting growling for the manifestation of the sons of God why because the whole earth wants to see a moving train they want to see the gospel in action they don't want to just hear somebody talk about it then I want to declare to you tonight that I'm not here just to talk about the token I'm here to manifest it I'm not here just to talk about the things that are written in the Bible I'm here to manifest it I believe it it's manifest in time you can see if you go out on the street the things that it is manifest in time the things that are done in secret or now made open the secret desires of people are made open openly declared where everybody can see it secret things on the internet on Facebook Instagram things are being made public everywhere and the secret desires the bride are now being made public they're being made manifest what you can look at it and see it moving you can look at it and see something happening in the Bride of Christ unmoving no fire on the inside no sound of the whistle oh goodness and you know you know if you think about the whistle how there's there's something that the train is supposed to be moving and that's where the steam goes the steam was supposed to move the train but you know something comes out of that whistle too and I believe that what comes out of the whistle was is a blessing that the bride receives she gets something to understand because the move and the fire begins to move down on the inside something's got to come out and she starts to say I believe the promises of God I believe it let it come to pass and she begins to confess the word and move forward based upon her confession and last of all if you want to think about this little gossip gospel locomotive sitting there on the track the wheels are supposed to be moving it's supposed to be turning because as we kind of go through this message tonight what good does it do you if it's wonderful to have fire on the inside it's wonderful to have steam and everything but the gospel locomotive ain't meant to just sit on the tracks the wheels are supposed to be turning its supposed to be moving its supposed to be an action and so they're sitting up there how are we supposed to make this work and that's what a lot of people do sitting in churches sitting at homes I think how do we make how am I supposed to make this work when I read the Bible how am I supposed to make it work how could I do it and that's our problem we try to make it work we try to when you got some kind of problem in your life that you want to get rid of alcohol or or you know the long list that we could go through all the different things that beset different people and plagued them and and keep them in bondage you chained down to the earth chained and bond is your sin but you know the gospel is supposed to free you from all that stuff and that's the that's the point I want to make tonight is that is the gospel that will deliver you it is the gospel that will move you you can't do it on your own you can't do it by yourself what we need to do is learn how to yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit so that God can do it what we need to do is take a hold of God's Word and just believe it so that a fire can be kindled because that's all you can do what more can you do there's nothing you can do if your own self listen I'm getting on something tonight let's I'm just a borderline meddling a little bit because people people get in it you get it in your head that to get virtue that's something you got to do first before you can get virtue before you can have brotherly kindness or something you got to do first and then once you got that out of the way then you can have brotherly kindness they nothing you can do the only thing you need to do is get the fire kindled the fire is the most important thing of this whole thing because everything comes out of the fire everything originates with the fire if you get the fire started everything else will take care of itself everything else will be automatic after you get the fire started it's all automatic so when brother branham in this quote that I'm going to read was down in I am looking at this old cold train sitting on the track and he said what will make this move that's the answer let me let me read this quote he said it's faith by experience I was over one time at a railroad yard and they just made one of these new Zephyr engines and train and I had the privilege of going through the Train oh it looks so pretty and all of us aluminum works in it I went into the dining room and oh it looks so pretty I went into the Pullman into all the cars and the seats were so pushed and looked so pretty and he actually I skipped over you'll notice there's just 29 this is 31 so there is a paragraph missing sorry about that look at this old train as I went through it I said when's it going to move can't it move my answer to you tonight is it can move you just got to get some fire in there so let's go to took quote to which just kind of continues this from paragraph 31 he said I looked at this old train as I went through with it I said when's it going to move can it move said no sir I said I'd like to take a little ride he said it can't move I said why he said there's no fire in the engine that's what's the matter with the church today it's all plush up and decorated up with no fire in the engine you can only move by the fire Oh what we need today is some more Holy Ghost and fire that's what we need today we need if you get Holy Ghost and fire down on the engine they learn to take care of the fire the pillars are smoke it'll take care of the speed and the power it'll put something in that locomotive that where it can pull every promise of God it can even take care of this brother locomotives problems it can pull them along with it if there's a local motor that's broke down a little bit on the side of the tracks pull that locomotive that's working real good up next to it I pull that brothers burdens alone that's how we're supposed to be like the gospel pulls one another alone and you can't do it yourself which is what Matthew 536 SC said thou canst not make one hair white or black but we think in our mind we think we can do think we can increase our stature if we just struggle enough if we just if we just pray it up you know let me get on prayer a little bit because you know really sometimes when you get down and begin to pray and fast and things you can almost work yourself away from the things why because instead of just taking it by faith you're waiting for something to happen if is unless this particular thing happens unless I feel something or I see something or something like that happens and I say I can't quite grab a hold to it but maybe that's a lesson for us ministers to you know today you know you sit back there and well is it gonna happen tonight am I gonna be able to get it what get myself out of the way is it gonna be as the locomotives gonna run well tonight and what you have to do is just check out all the word the Word of God and just believe it just accept it I let God turn loose and let God grab a hold to it take the turn loose and let God do it but because it's not by our efforts it's not by that's that's the problem with preachers they get up behind the pulpit and they try to help they try to help God out God don't need no help what God needs us to do is get out of way and let him do it and that's that's a lesson for in every aspect of our lives you start worrying about things and start fretting about your future of your children and the future of what's going to happen that you know we need I think we need to take a lesson from Moses mama when she just took him and put him in the little in the little basket and set him loose on the water and said Lord he's yours now your deal with him and that's the best way to handle it if she would have kept a hold of him and trashy just meddled with the situation then before long the guards would have showed up and there wouldn't have been a Moses but she just took him and put him in that little basket and set him loose just turn it loose and let God have a hold of it but you know these these brothers and sisters and all of them up in that upper room the one thing that they had right the one thing that they had going for him is their what they were a band the word of the Lord where Jesus had told him to go to Jerusalem wait for the power wait for something to happen because what were they doing was upper room really now I know I'm dramatizing a little bit I might be taking a little artistic license here but what if I want I want to I want to paint for your picture up in that upper room what they were doing was they were standing on the platform they were standing on the platform of the train station waiting for the train to come and this because what was it it's injunction time junction time a judge train Junction is when you got two tracks and one ends up going another direction one hundreds up going the direction that you want to take and I've been in that trouble many times when I've been down in Atlanta and I'd be reading the message or something and lose track of time and before long I realized that I had missed the last Junction and I was going the wrong way I was going away that I didn't expect and I had to maybe add in another 30 minutes to get off the train turn back around get on the right train and go in the way that I was supposed to go so you got to be careful when you get to junction time because God's fixing to take a turn that's junction that was a junction time when I arena scam on the scene those a junction time when Martin came on the scene and there's a junction time in this last day when there was denominational systems and they everything they were just kept marching on the way that they thought was correct but God sent a prophet on the scene to turn make a little turn here and if you're not ready for that Junction whoo you won't take that turn right so you've got to be on the right platform you've got to be looking for the right thing and that's the way to get the fire started is to be there at the right place at the right time and the right place at the right time just so there's no confusion is this a message of the hour this is the platform that you're supposed to be in because if you're not on a platform then you won't you'll miss it how are you gonna take a rapture sitting at home reading listening to things on the watch the stuff that you're not supposed to be watching on the internet if you're not on the platform you miss it all you missed the boarding and experience you missed the rapture you missed everything you every promise of God that God gave us for this age you'll never be born again bye the platform is a popularity or money or education popularity seems like a real big thing today and you did let me get on this thing for a little bit because you know you know we say that you're born again by the believing of the word and all you have to do is just believe the word but I believe sometimes an altar call is what people need because they need to get down and the altar and show that that something is more worthwhile to them than their popularity that they don't care what anybody else thinks sometimes you need to do a little take a little extra stands actually do a little something extra to show that you don't care about popularity anymore you don't care about whether people think but what kind of clothes you're wearing what well you know whether you got holes in the bottom of your shoes or not because if you down there kneeling at the altar then everybody can see the bottom of your feet you sometimes we need to get past that when you get past that when you get past what other people think about you then you really enter in and entering into freedom territory then when you get past whether people are looking at you because you raise your hands in church or whether you say Amen or whether you run up and down the aisle or whether you come down to the altar then you really get in somewhere what God can use you you'll never be born again by popularity or money or education it takes a god to have a birth and you'll never get a rapture by listening to a previous age and I like you know there was a lot of things that the Baptist said that were good there were a lot of things that Luther said that were wonderful yet for his age and for Wesley and all the things all the things that led up to the seizure to lose the street that was fine for the time that was a fantastic platform for that time as they were it was they were at that junction time but now it's time to take a rapture and if you want to get ready for a rapture you've got to be on this kind of platform this is the platform that you need to be in in the word all the way so get the fire in the engine I'm gonna take a little break here this is serious business I'm not supposed to laugh so how do you get fire in the engine now this is this is that controversial thing we're getting into controversial territory now because because Jesus told them to go to Jerusalem and wait till they were going to deal with power on high weight in Jerusalem because Jerusalem was going to be the starting point Jerusalem was gonna be the place with a fire fell first and after that all the fire that would ever come after that would be an offshoot of that first fire do y'all see what I mean because we're in down there and they were as they were journeying through the wilderness God told Moses how the pattern to erect that Tabernacle with he got the tabernacle all set up and then maybe he was wondering that question to wear how does the fire come from do I have to do I have to strike a match do I have to kyndall something but that God answered his question with starting that fire where's the fire fail God God kindled the fire God is the one that started the fire and every fire after that was kindled from that same fire when Solomon's Temple was erected it was Eagles kindled from that same fire they had two candlesticks inside and it each candlestick had to be lit from the fire of the first one everything started from that same fire and that's how the gospel works everything the fire from the ephesian church age kindled the fire there I read in the next church age of the next of the next all the way down it's like a great tree because you think about Phillip going to Nathaniel come and see a Phillip told Nathaniel coming saying he's kindling a fire Phillip went to the Ethiopian eunuch and he said do you understand what you read in the IAM yeah the eunuch said how can I understand unless some man tells me and they began to talk to him and he kindled a fire before long he was baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch and one after the other down through the ages one tells the other and the other tells the other and it Kindles a fire let me read Jude 1:3 no joke I woke up at 4 o'clock in this morning speaking this scripture from my sleep and it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints but why did why does it read like that contend for the faith the faith which was once delivered under the Saints the faith because there ain't a million different face there's only one faith there's only one Lord one faith one baptism there's only one and and and you know that's what we're trying to get into as it narrows down to the one faith to have an understanding a perfect understanding because that one faith is going to carry us to the end of our journey that one faith is going to take us to true fellowship true oneness with him contend for the faith and that faith that faith was lit on the day of Pentecost that's why I says which was once delivered unto the Saints it was delivered once it doesn't have to be delivered over and over and over again it was delivered exactly the way God wanted it to believe him to be delivered on the day of Pentecost it was delivered the way he wanted to be delivered and a handle and everything and a lot of these things were hidden down through the seven churches as the Romans and whatnot ate away at the word but now at the end that once did that faith that was once delivered to the Saints has been restored again and we can look back with confidence we can look back with a surety and know that we believe that same faith that same faith that was once delivered to them that's been passed down through generations and generations of ones preaching the gospel that's how you light the fires by the preachers of gospel from one to the other from church to church lighting the fire so that the whole world can see all around the world and that fulfills the Great Commission where Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel how is the gospel go around the world by passing from one to the other as a fire is lit in one and it goes from one to the other you you read over it and this is what I'm getting to I'm getting to the back behind that locomotive is this big old coal car and that coal cars packed up with fuel for that fire you know you read over in Isaiah where it talks about the Seraphim that took a live coal that live coal was so precious and so revered that that did you ever notice that Seraphim didn't even touch it with his hands he didn't grab a whole two and said here you go he took it with tolls and he took that live coal and he touched it to the prophets li'l and that live coal was enough to cleanse the prophets lips and make him speak ride and make him walk ride and make him a cried that live coal was enough as well that's what I believe the preaching of the gospel is as the shoveling of the coal what is it what you got people in there and the locomotive there's a shovel that coal to keep it moving hey shovel it into that furnace that's shoveling it faster and faster and what they're doing is if I can compare the ministers as they're not shoveling coal so much shoveling promises shoveling the promises of God where you got ministers around the world that are preaching he's the same yesterday today and forever that there is power in the blood that the Lord God healeth all thy diseases that all things are possible to them they believe believe in you and your house shall be shaved and that's shuttling those promises in you know if you go look back at what it takes to move a locomotive up a hill it takes for just a slight grade for 25 pounds scoops every 15 seconds to climb a hill and that furnace is putting out for 195 degree heat for 25 pound scoops every 15 seconds to climb a hill so what does that mean that means those ministers that I'm going to put as an example those ministers are shoveling coal like nobody's business God promised it he promised he promised and the signs and wonders would follow them they believe he promised that he was wounded for our sins for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities nothing you have to do to merit it all you have to do is believe it because he promised it he made a way for you he and when he makes a promise when he puts an objective of the thing out there for you to do for you to achieve he makes a way for you to do it he made he equips his ministers he equips his people he equips his believers he gives you something to accomplish you with and in what he gave us to accomplish the goal what he gave us to keep the locomotive running is the fire of the gospel the word the word is what he gave us you know you look around you you think about this those ministers that I'm gonna call a minister shoveling coal in the locomotive shoveling it covered by coal dust covered by coal dust and seared by the singeing flames and then people begin to talk about I'm gonna say well well I don't know if he's preaching right I don't know I don't know if I like this person particular person instead of accumulating the word instead of coming in the water into the service and just opening themselves up to receive the word what many people do is they begin to accumulate accumulate offenses and I tell you one thing that one thing about church is that the church is a good opportunity for you to accumulate offenses you start feeling like you're getting preached on and some don't go the way that you should somebody doesn't say instead of you singing somebody else does or instead of you getting play in it to play an instrument somebody else does and before long these things start getting in the way and clogging up those flus so that the thing doesn't burn right so that it doesn't move right and you know there's a remedy for that if the remedy is really hard for us to do sometimes the remedy is to forgive one another to forgive stuff the stuff is gonna happen is it can't help but happen along life's Road you're gonna get things you know somebody's gonna say something about you and and things begin to go wrong or whatever but the best thing to do is for us to just say well I forgive because you know brother Branham said you can't have faith without forgiveness you can't have a real true faith without forgiveness I believe even even forgiving your brother when when you don't even they don't even come begging you just forgive them anyway because so many times things get interpreted the wrong way is you think somebody said something or did I left you out on purpose when there really didn't they just that you life just got in the way life just happened it's still instead of accumulating the word and just letting it pile up and unclog the flues we accumulate offenses and things and let that all these worries and things I believe we all just give way to God and let that fire just blast everything out of it because we were predestinated to be in that gospel locomotive running down the track at full speed not hindered by anything if a cow gets in a track just that there's supposed to be a power in that blue light locomotive that blacks that cow off the track the old devil gets in your way just blast it out of the way oh my so we get that we get the fire down and they fire down on the locomotive going real good we get the fire going and it begins to produce something something gets to bowling and that's the next thing I'm gonna talk about you're feeding it real good you go on lickety-split you you're you get the fire going real good down inside that locomotive that nobody can see just you just you are aware of that thing because it's faith and nobody else can see your face it's something that only you are truly aware of something burning down on the inside and what's that what happens as it begins to to bubble up that that steam that water pressure begins to build up and you know brother Graham preached all these sermons about pressure letting off the pressure and and how how we need to be pressurized let me let me read this quote about what brother Bram said in and enticing spirits number five he said it's just like down here the car works where they build a big bunch of freight cars or a big bunch of passenger cars I used to work there and they take and build those big coaches and everything and put hardwood in and lay mahogany all around and everything so beautiful set it out there on the track and it was as dead as a doornail they're set the engine no steam in it so see there it might be all right with a fire in it but you got to have steam in it too you got to have power in it she just sit there what it needs today is some fire and the Bolar what it needs today is some steam what it needs today in the church to boil to the hottest Bowlin thing there is to Baal sin out of your life is love and if you can't love one another how you going to love God who you haven't seen love hides a multitude of seeing get in love with God then you'll love one another then you'll love the church you'll love the calls you'll love everything that's godly and you'll keep away from the things of the world so that fire begins to it begins to create something on the inside and what's happening is is that word that you've been here it begins to expand and the spirit begins to work because that's what happens the more you eat the more of the word takes over the more you believe there more it takes over until it eventually takes the goal is for it to completely take over take over all of your senses take over your memory and reason and conscious affection imagination take over everything until you're a complete union of God completely given over to him where that fire on the inside is God and the whole thing directing the whole thing and that pressure begins to build up until you've got something to come back the pressures of the world with because you've got pressures on the outside the flesh is beating in on that from the outside and there's a there's a pressure on the inside that's combating that the lust of the flesh the trials of life when when someone says something against you all these things that you know brother Brown talked about how he preached about how that like a fish when it goes down into the bottom of the sea it needs to be pressurized so that it can withstand the pressures of the ocean ocean it's got to have something on the inside to react to the pressures on the outside and that fire on the inside of you was creating that pressure that to react to give you something what is what it's giving you with something what it's giving you is something to power the wheels with something to get the wheels moving because what good does it do to have faith if you don't have works what good does it do to have faith if you're just sitting there on the tracks doing nothing not talking to other people not sharing the gospel not passing the gospel around not helping others not met you know the gospel the gospel is a Christian life is supposed to be living for others living for others is what Christianity is about it's not for us to be hide and cooped up in the tabernacle like down in the Holy of Holies all the time cooped up on the inside but sooner or later you got to come out you got to manifest on the outside what you got while you were in say in there eating the shewbread and the the manor and back in there with the the life of Aaron's rod budding and all of those things that that represents sooner or later you got to come out let's read number seven faith once delivered to the Saints that says it's just because we won't let him do it oh how he wants to try this take this convention in his arms I said children I want to work with you I want to work through you he's trying to press his way into you just like her just like all the water in the world put up in a four-foot barrel four foot across how many tens of thousands miles higher that would be what a pressure it will be trying to get through that's like the Holy Spirit trying to get into the church trying to find a little crevice somewhere to bring himself into to bless you and to make you grow and to live and yet we stay dry hard I don't know about that oh my he's pressing trying to get into you so that he can press out he's trying to get in there so that he can begin to envelop you and take you take you completely over and push out and what does it what happens when the pressure begins to build up well there's two ways really to let that pressure out you got a whistle and you got wheels and a lot of times we think the way for the steam to get let out is to let it out with the whistle that's where a lot of confusion is risen up and a lot of impersonation and things where I got I can impersonate a whistle letting off I can just I can just scream out loud or office all sorts of things let that whistle off but you let some some of that steam power or get to those wheels get to those locomotive wheels and get that thing to rolling and that's something that you can't impersonate because it's really moving it's moving and it's got power behind it power to pull every promise of God now that I've said that I'm going to use the whistle for a little something different because when you're getting up to a crossing where you start hearing that alarm bell ding ding ding ding ding maybe it's a river Jordan in your life and maybe that's a the Red Sea in your life is a big problem in your life something a job interview or who knows what all we go through and you start I believe if we start doing like if you remember the story of FF Bosworth where he said he told Brandon I got the Lord gave me a sermon and and and I'm going down to this city to preach this sermon I got to preach this sermon and brother Graham said well that's wonderful what's y'all excited about he was he was starting to let that whistle blow in a different way he said well what I'm excited about is is is that I need some money to go down into this city and I don't have any so the Lord is gonna have to perform a miracle for me to get down in this city and preach this message that God gave me so what he was doing was he was blowing that whistle he was blowing the whistle that as he went through that cross and ding-ding-ding-ding thank God is able God is able to provide for my needs God is gonna give me a miracle and before long he saw it come to pass and when he got on the other side of that crossing after God had given him the money and performed the miracle he was able to let that whistle blow praise God like with the way they shouted when they crossed you for the river Jordan and they began to dance dance like David did when they were bringing the Archaean because I believe that when that wouldn't that steam against the whale up on the inside there's something that somebody has got to be expressed some way sometimes you know when you're alone in the car sometimes or in the shower or whatever sometimes that steam start swelling up and you just gotta let the whistle blow but the point is it's good when the whistle blows but let that steam power go to those locomotive wheels to get there turning them wheels so that the power is made manifest in a Christian life and you know what I believe if you were to able to kind of lean up against that locomotive or get real close to it as it was going by you would hear them wheels begin to say something like this works it's faith expressed works his faith expressed works this faith expressed because that's what the power of the gospel does and those in those locomotive wheels as it's going down the track speeding you to it to your destination it is works its faith expressed spitting all over this pulpit I pause yeah you know I'll be I'll be finishing up in just a second y'all hang on y'all doing good before that steam before that stinging for that steam to be released there's a little throttle in there that that that the the man has to he has to push and what that does is it opens up a pass for the power to come out it opens up a pass for it to be released and that's kind of what I'm getting at is you got that face you got that fire down here but there's got to be a pass open up for the power to come out Oh where's that quote come on now I can't find them that I'm just gonna quote it oh here we go praise the Lord number 8 the statute of a perfect man you mean this has been about the statute of man all this time Robbo I thought you did somebody gospel Lokomotiv the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him that right if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him is the first song that I ever loved in the hymns one of the greatest was to be like Jesus well if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have a virtue and a pass that it can pass forward from me to the people from me to give out and that's why you know I think sometimes we kind of gloss over we gloss over stuff like virtue we I want to get to the good stuff I want to get to to the temperance and and and and the things that you think you're struggling with you know but you know you can't have virtue knowledge temperance patience until you get a fire and you can't have any of the others until you got a pass for it to pass out to the other people you can't have any of the others how you gonna have brotherly kindness if you don't have the power the power to pass out how are you going to have brotherly kindness if you don't have that steam in there building up pressure on the inside produces something that will drive the wheels you might have a fire down on the inside but if you don't have the wheels turning how you gonna get brotherly kindness you gotta have the wheels kind of turning before you can have the others I'm just laughing because it you know it seems like a little simple message but you know another thing I think people seriously people struggle with so much is that the thing that you got to do something you got to do something to get virtue you got to do something all you have to do and we I know we keep harping on this all you have to do is keep shoveling coal all you have to do is keep shoveling those live coals and that's live because it's already knowing it just believe it just take it put it in that burner down on the inside of your heart and let it rise up through all the flus let it power the wheels of your life and what it'll produce is works is faith expressed what it'll produce is a Christian life what it'll produce is that the end of dirty Christians it'll produce a life where other people can look at you and say well that person is a real true born-again Christian and they'll look at you like that woman that reached out and touch the hem of her of Jesus's garment and say I know there's something in that person that I can draw from because that person is living a Christian life it'll produce something in you so much that when people say wrong about you other people will defend you and say I know that's not what that person believes I know that's not what my pastor believes I know that's not what kind of person they are because that person I know they've got real true genuine virtue a real true Christian life something real on the inside working this way on the outside to power the wheels of that gospel locomotive to make it move down the track to its destination I'm trying to finish and what is our destination we come down through all these Junction times faith virtue 7 Church ages Junction after Junction after Junction Junction chime there ain't no more junctions that's not that's not good English is it there aren't any more junctions that's the list the last Junction this is the last stop an off point this is the last platform they started in a platform in Ephesians they started a platform in that up room waiting for the manifestation waiting for the spirit to come and quicken the word that they had already heard a now it's time for us to get on the platform of this message and they be prepared get on the platform and wait to see what God will do in your life our job is not to
