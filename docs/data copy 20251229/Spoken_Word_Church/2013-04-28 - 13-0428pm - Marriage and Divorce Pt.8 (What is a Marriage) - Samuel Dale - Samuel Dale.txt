doing different ones from all going to New Jersey for her a ministers meeting remember them in your prayers and remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday and that will be brother Jonathan Jones will be preaching for the weekend part so just remember these amen Matthew 19 3 through 9 you have any father we thank you Lord for all games thank you for your grace and your guidance and to us and thank you for you thank you for Calvary because without Calvary there would be no hope for any of us Lord we see and realize that there is great hopes in you because it's always grace to those who will receive it we love you and we thank you and just have your way now as we read your words you come in ministering to us Lord and guide our thoughts in Jesus name Amen Matthew 19 the Pharisees came unto Him tempting him and saying unto Him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female said for this cause shall a man leave his father a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what God therefore hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives and for but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word we try to get on the into without talking about this morning about you know that we're supposed to marry believers and we were talking about what would be called believers and that brother Joe ran off the thing for me - you know this is taken from a message called paradox and brother Branham excuse me is referring to the fact that this man came to him talking about his son and he says now it's not easiest paragraph I got twenty paradox sixty-three I told one priest in Chicago now it is not easy to do something but you must be truthful and honest darfur the boy was a Christian as far as a believer he had repented had been baptized they had his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no so you can see what is saying about him of what he would be he was bad he was everything so much of a believer but now look what brother Branham says I think it's a paid you son dude paragraph 30 and watch what he says and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the poo I said I know my son has come to Christ I said that may be all right all of the awkward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers listen what he says but until he's regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of Christ comes in then it'll be a paradox in itself so what is a believer a born-again Christian in order to marry born-again believers right now listen to what brother George Smith says on his testimony about when he asked brother Branham about marrying Rebecca he goes through the point that he was talking with brother Branham you know and a couple of hours and I can't it finally says now I really enjoyed this but I need to know if I can marry your daughter that's George speaking the rest right sure George he told me you can become engaged now but don't even think about getting married until after you receive the Holy Ghost so what is a believer he goes only gives his testimony of receiving the holy God all right so what is a believer a born-again Christian a believer amen just pray for one another I certainly appreciate something to see somebody like brother Gary and his dad in the low time as it is but it is here today so that's a great testimony that's a direct testimony to him to be here in the service instead of being dark I appreciate that that's an honor to me because a lot of people want to have a headache to get to miss church but that's alright alright now let's get into a thought we've been trying to cover on some things and we went through it this morning and I hope that's my plane talking and trying to express to you at least what I believe and that way then you know you can consider the point and as we read that part you ought to be a Christian because you know now you say our will they all be that no only everybody won't be that way and everybody say with everybody here be that way now they probably won't not probably wouldn't either five back there I'm just honest but that's the way it ought to be we ought to be a Christian if we as a Christian that was to sum up what I was saying this morning what happened to the message of a Christian life wise the people of this message have to read to not do this or not do that when the Holy Ghost order took care of that you know in their lives all right you didn't have to come into the message to learn how not to see in you order Ben if he's a born-again Christian you're to had had no problem with it but that's that's alright now let's see I ended up talking about that you know the Prophet was saying that you could only marry a virgin well I I put that as much as blunt as I could and just say that yes and then continue on with the message Paul speaks of both man and woman having a virginity and the problems with it of things you know and how it ought to be done maybe we need to spend months on that you know just talking on it but still it ought to be sensible to know we say well now this only for the woman no no said he could put her away from you know he can put her away and marry again that's right if he's got the grounds scriptural grounds if he hasn't been he's causing her to commit adultery and he'll wind up in adultery itself because he'll go off and get married and claim his okay well I'm just too blunt and sorry to point you know to to be anything he said well they just no hopes for none of us well if I could preach salvation to get us to realize that I would be tickled to death if I could preach salvation that everybody in here got to the position myself to that we realized we were so lost and doomed and on our way to hell if we had no hopes but then we could do something about it you know we could seek God well I started off talking you know that the marriage and divorce has to be revealed seek God for a revelation about your wife your husband if we depraved before we married there would have been a lot of difference in the marital situations in people's lives but we didn't pray we just you know we didn't we wouldn't talk to pray about that in different things but anyhow now see the only grounds for him to put away his wife and marry again is for her to committed fornication or adultery all right that's not to just for any calls or any talk that's plain and blunt but it's the truth now you show me something else in the Bible and the prophets message see so that leads every one of us in a horrible situation of life but if we can believe in grace grace can make away it has made away and it will make away I believe that all right now so to get on from that thinking about it and doing as I said now most people think that the man can for any reason woman she can never and we agree with the woman that she can never but not with a man for any reason you overboard either way that you're trying to go so we're going with the basis of what he must be a virgin she must be a virgin and then that way you know when they remarry if something happen if the woman dies and she was a virgin to start with and she her husband's dead she's free to marry she's still a virgin well wouldn't he be the same time if he was a virgin when he started and his wife died wouldn't he still be we'll see that way you wouldn't be breaking any Scripture you wouldn't be causing any problems you know but see by misinterpreted theology which to me is you know by the fact that preachers didn't explain to us about the lives we needed to live they just wanted us in the altar I'm not throwing off on nobody but you know it's the truth they wanted a million more than 44 they wanted more members in the church and and that's why preachers won't preach on marriage and divorce in this message the others I know for sure why people don't want me to come to their church and preach I understand see they're afraid of me the afraid I might preach I'm an ex in divorce you know they're afraid I'm not preaching daniel-san new ways or something you know I understand that and there's no problem I don't know I'm tickled to death about it myself because I get to stay at home and be happy and not have to worry about it and I ain't got the burden of the world on my shoulders these preachers ought to realize so you've got this congregation is on my shoulder and if I don't tell you the truth you might make it but I won't if I withhold the truth from you I won't make it but you might be able to well see I've got to try to I want a clear conscience mad enough as it is it you know you go to bed at night praying and saying Lord what did I can I do what can I say to get us to realize realization if you don't know you need grace you won't work you won't seek I've tricked if you think you come into the world saved you're not going to seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost right you're not gonna seek after God if you think you're saved you're gonna say I am saved and then you're gonna have the theology that we had you know in the bag just well I can't deny that I'm saved I believe Lord save me now and I can't do that confide in I'm lost well Amen if you got it but what if you don't have it see how easy that devil with that old lie and that's what I told Mike this morning that old serpent seed it's not the end of course in the garden is in the course of the mind of the human being where Satan is planting his seeds inside of us and we're trying to get it old unmodeled in a brain that can't work you know in doing it but now let's just get on and you know and I should have preached this to begin with when I said I've said this time I'm trying to go through and just bar down on some points because I preached this so many times until a lot of you could tell the page numbers I'm going to on it but we're gonna finally get around to the one I should have started with or gently start marriage and divorce is this asking you what ground what is a marriage what does it take to constitute a marriage or what is a wedding what is a marriage see a lot of people believe is when you you know finally consummate it you know going to bed together so same ago well let's see the day if we can look through that and just disprove that totally scripturally out of the way I know that say consummating you know you know that's a bringing it to a finality of becoming one in the basis of that point but it's still not a wedding wedding should be way before then all right so let's go into it now let's just read some scriptures and just think about some things and and you know go on in what we're trying to talk on and then we'll be tickled to death to have questions and answers I have got a few comments and few things I appreciate it you know and I appreciate you you being honest enough to ask me and I'll do the best can to answer you as honest as I can well let's go with Genesis and just see because marriage started in Genesis now so let's just read what it says in Genesis and just follow the line and the thought what is a marriage what does it constitute to be a marriage see a lot of people think this when you come down to the altar then you exchange your vows then you're married and I said others think that it's when you go on your honeymoon you know live together then you're married but what does the Bible say and what did the prophets say about a marriage no all right Genesis 2:18 through 25 and the Lord said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him not a helpmate that's not the word diary's help meet mate can be two men together meet is someone with you together joining one Adam and Eve was one right he didn't go somewhere that he didn't go and even and make her a body from the earth he took it out of Adam to her be a helpmeet alright and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought dinnerland to Adam to see what he would call him and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but to Adam there was not found and help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made a woman and brought her unto the man now watch what God says watch what Adam said first and then God says it and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man we're gonna get to it in a minute that's when he proposed to Eve therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother this is God talking now and steal Cleveland to his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed now God twice calls them that his wife all right now they had not lived together yet but yet God calls it the wife I had you'll you laughed at that point I said with you wait a minute we'll see what brother Brown had to say all right but listen we know that Dyer when God made them he made them beautiful he made him one that's what I've tried to express to you about the people caught talking about my products so much you know that they're trying to make her this piece of hamburger meat and he's a porterhouse steak or something you know all kind of thing remember they were the same substance same substance he didn't even choose to go in the animal kingdom to make her make Eve from another substance like the female dog was made you know they come out of the ground made to be what they were huh so he went into Adam to get Eve to take her out you know all right now if there was so much wrong in that and there's a kept emphasizing if it was some way that she made that was wrong or was made that she was wrong then she come out of Adam that would be him wrong yeah yeah if you really just just sat down and insensibly oh but we're not supposed to reason brother tail the Bible says come let us reason the Bible is the only thing that is reasonable this message is the only thing that's reasonable it has the answer to everything if we just search for him a little while but now what 2 times God refers to Eve being his wife all right now then if that's true then we don't have to be concerned about anything else we have to be concerned about what is it that really makes a wedding what is it that really makes you married they look at number two with what the Prophet had to say on the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ paragraph 74 marriage is the oldest Institute in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden no as always say Adam didn't have much choice about who his wife was gonna be cuz he to run out of ribs if he'd wanted something else that's just silly but it's true she come from him he she has a great sacredness she must not Mar if she does she's marked for life we'll get back to that one of these days the statements down at the bottom look what he says on number three the law having a shadow priest in 1954 12:03 look what the Prophet had to say that's where you'll see that I said he said this is bone of my bones he's proposing right there Darcy was a beautiful species and he picked her up in his arms and he looked at her and said why she's flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone bone as sweethearts when Almighty God squared them off and performed the marriage ceremony and he took her by the arm and down through the Eden he went perfect God's children do you see when Adam said what he said he was proposing to Eve God gave a ceremony you said well that's silly good I'm always silly but I love it and God says this is wonderful now you got to help me you remember the story you know God was lonely that's why he created the animals we were still lonely grated angels created animals he was still alone will he be any creative man somebody to fellowship with that was of the same form and being and somebody could talk to but then he saw Adam lonely so he took part of Adam and he made even took her to Adam and Adam said this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bones she'll be called woman she never didn't even have a name you didn't get her name until the fall came cuz Eve is the mother of all living at that stage she was not the mother of anything so he says all right now you're one all right then what then would make up a marriage in scriptural terminologies as I said we've been taught that it's you know one brother one time told me he said you go up here at Hall County and check on it and see he said I ain't never been married but one time well that could be true but what about being engaged what about asking somebody to marry you what about those times you say I've just been married one time and have twenty wives cause you could ask 20 women to him like I said this morning about that fella saying that it was actually said here many years ago that you know the girl said I got a revelations been married four times she had a great revelation I guess each one of them was okay or either she'd been married three and then she got a revelation the fourth was really the one you know or something I don't know either way but it does sound silly don't it but let's just get down and think about it know if it's the ceremony at the altar then where are we if it's the consummation of the imagined us in the honeymoon you know my form of speaking it then what have you got what you see according to the Bible the Bible says by your words you be justified by your words you be condemned to have them written run off and stuck in a briefcase in there not to bring today but just in case it somebody needed it I have the vowels of going through Deuteronomy 22 23 and things that will try to get into probably in the next message if you vow vile and things like that you known how you're supposed to keep your word because see God takes your word and he just he just takes your word and what you say that's what he he does that's you know but what about it now marriage was first instituted in the Garden of Eden the Prophet said all right and then he had a ceremony then what about a marriage go ahead to number four everybody knows where you go and what you won't be bringing about Joseph that Mary but it proves the point Matthew 1:18 through 25 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wives when as his mother Mary was espoused a spouse the word espoused is 34:23 in the Strong's Concordance word of spouse it means to woo her and to ask her in a ask her in marriage it means to be promised in Mary's are to be betrothed that's what the word for spouse means alright now so they were engaged as we bring it and I'll get to the point in a minute with that we're in espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost okay well they came together then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately because the law was and brother Branham I you know I didn't bring these any of them but you know how he was he said there Joseph was thinking I'm sitting this natural thinking he was thinking that Mary had told him you know said I'm I'm pregnant they were just engaged they said Mary said you've been out and she said no said the holy God he's over shattered me we'll see it was still hard for the human brain to comprehend so he said well I won't just put her away but privately he because if he went and told him they'd kill her that was the law so he said I won't put her away privately I'm gonna do this real easy you know and back out of it and and protect her all right but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry that woman we didn't say that they can be married thy wife and they were just espoused engaged for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins but arrested him Joseph thought she's trying to pull something over on me to keep from being killed as he said that's what he thought because I mean you know you watch this coming to you I'm gonna have a baby and it's the Holy Ghost you're gonna think a little bit so God used even a secondary way he never used a prophet he'd never use different things he used a dream so he comes to Joseph in a dream he said fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife explains what it was going to be and everything Dean behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and I shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife now look the next verse and knew her not till she had brought forth the first one firstborn son you were not see we know what that means so it's not going to the honeymoon that makes you married you know it's not that what is it what made Joseph and Mary married because Joseph had asked her and she had accepted that made him married all right now see that's the point that I'm driving at the word engaged he's not used but one time in the Bible all right go ahead and put it up we can read it Jeremiah 30 and 21 and their noble shall be of them be of themselves and their governors will proceed from the midst of them and I will called him to draw near and he shall approach unto me or who is that that engaged his heart to approach them to me saith the Lord that's the only time the word engaged is used in the Bible that word engaged is to be it's the only time you use its 6148 it means to pledge or to exchange see so this person here says God is saying about him that he has pledged within his heart as I said we'll get to the vial maybe next weekend when you make a vial God takes your word if you don't keep that you got a problem not well go ahead we'll read this scripture where did everybody make sure it is right Matthew 12:36 what I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment or by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned right word you be justified words you'll be condemned okay now brother Branham we asking you the Bible speaks of an engagement or in being espoused and calls it wife and yet they hadn't lived together but they were engaged espoused now brother Branham what's your thoughts about it okay go to number seven and he explains from invisible Union paragraph 83 through 86 we've just read that the other day but the main point is what I want on paragraph 86 Joseph's fear not taken to the murid iy for that which is conceived in her you know the Holy Ghost he was minded to put her away privately see after he'd already engaged to her when you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her now he said well can we go live together no cuz that's immoral money you're not supposed to do that until you get the paperwork as far as God is concerned you're married but yet you got to finish the wedding up to do that because if you need them I'll be glad to find it I think I've got one in here but anyhow the Prophet said the law gives your right to live together where you won't be common-law but said you're married when you're engaged so now boys and girls you they're too young think about it if a boy asks a girl to marry him I'll read it in a minute in good favor in other words what he's saying what it would mean in good favor in other words both of them sound of mine both of them at a point both of them understanding it ain't some 20 year old guy that's a 12 year old girl to marry him and the 12 year old girls yes I'll marry you she ain't got enough sense to know what the word married yes some of them 80 years old they got that much sense either but what about it if it's in good favor the Prophet said so what's he saying if you ask a girl to marry you and she does not accept that's not a wedding everybody agreed on a wedding is a binding agreement between two people an engagement is that binding agreement of verbally asking and accepting you know you know so then it's an engagement in it when a boy asks a girl and she in her right mind and understanding is yes then they're married either one of them break that they better have just reasons for it but if not they're gonna have to answer to God but understand me now what I'm saying the boy asked a girl to marry him and he does marry the boy asked the girl to marry she doesn't accept that's no wedding put that down and just think about it that's not a wedding it's when she accepts that proposal and say I love the Prophet in the way he does a lot of things God he leaves sometimes things for you to dangle over you remember the armored meatpacking company the girl that you know the little markswoman girl and he said I'll come back and get you in a year now I had to go by those words for a long time then he'd say he'd come back it's gonna really never looked it up I finally looked it up one day and it said because they were engaged he just didn't say I'll come back to your kitchen she's no they were engaged that's what's your prophet said sister boys and girls don't go out and just ask somebody to marry kids even you young kids don't don't play with those games you know I mean don't don't go around and asking a girl will you marry me or or this out of the other you know boys don't do that and we're in a bad age because now the girls are nesting the boys that is bad but get what I'm saying now when two people in honest agreement you know they agree to get married as far as God is concerned they're married that's an engagement then we'll get on down to the invisible union one of these days and we'll talk about how they are engaged to God and then we're married and all kind of things but think about it the Prophet said if you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her shouldn't be any problem then go ahead with number eight let's see this is a long reading this is paragraph 193 through 195 or so it goes on down yeah questions an answer is real 264 823 the evening service the question brother branham what is the meaning of an annulment are people too free to marry or is this just another word for divorce you know annulment right some people would say an annulment is not a divorce you know you're not doing annulment would be another word it is another word in the English but now to bring it back to where that you'll click it in brother Branham and father of the girl that Billy Paul married they had two wedding annulled did that eradicate the wedding did that eradicate their vows no because brother Branham refused to marry joseph de los how many the paul nearly paul wouldn't marry it all right so there was something wrong then wouldn't he he said Billy Paul or nobody the falsity of married no no no but it's not to just say well that done away with it no that's just other words you use in a court of law so what did he say sure there was married as long as you take that vowel they're married long as they take that Val there man just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith no that's really meaning it's sincere and she answers back sincerely he's obligated to that girl he's just as good as mad as married her the only thing the law does is gives you a Bill of Rights to live together to keep from being common-law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I will marry you honey I will take you for my wife will you take he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow there's not no preacher can marry you no magistrate no nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you are married you promise well you were to be justified by your words you'll be condemned all right you said well we won't Bible for that that's what they said to him Joseph her husband being a just man her espoused husband already called her husband Joseph her husband being a just man was mindedly to put her away privately on this white privately on this wise but before they came together she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost he and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream and saying Joseph thou son of David you're not taken to the Mary that wife already married he'd already promised her what's your vows okay and all that little lady if you promise to marry that boy you're obligated to do it if you marry another after that obligation you will from now on anyhow he's got it blunt right don't you know it now you'll be living in adultery notice the same thing to a boy promising to marry woman what's that in a minute now let's cooling down don't you make your vow to anybody unless you mean to stick with it remember there's no Bible fart Joseph promised to marry Mary and God said that that was and watch him read the Old Testament laws on that now wake up click yourself and listen for a second on this one remember the Old Testament laws you had polygamy illegal look how close it gets all right everybody with me read the Old Testament laws on that see the Old Testament law if you promise to marry a woman and you married another member under polygamy that's legal is it clicking and you married another one you was committing adultery when the polygamy allowed happening why'd you want right but it's according to how you get them that was the whole point of the morning service he was committing adultery and it throws you out of the camp now he's on that Old Testament yes sir you have to keep your vows when you promise a woman that she's a sacred little vessel and that's to bring life into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her now under polygamy under polygamy if you promised a girl to marry her and didn't marry her you go marry another one you're living in adultery do you understand that me all right if you promise her to marry her he's supposed to get married to her now next week you might marry another one that was under the law right if you promise to marry her and you bypass her and go get you number two or number 90 yeah you committed adultery and you're put out of the camp so polygamy wasn't just I just marry anybody just give me a wife under polygamy you were not allowed to marry now are we backing up to the morning message under polygamy you were only a Mary allowed to marry a virgin nobody any word I want the Bible now don't play grounds with me I know what God one time told a prophet to go marry a prostitute and have children by my know Bible so don't come out something like that that was God telling the Prophet you can't explain that knock ain't either because that was God telling him what to do what you see no matter what a man or a woman either woman it's supposed to marry a virgin well what about David married Abigail Abigail husband was dead and if Abigail was a virgin when she married the guy that was called a fool that was what his name meant that her son he died and she married David she's still a virgin you got to get it right there's no gray areas right either right or wrong so under the law now you're brought your prophet is explaining said to read the Old Testament laws that if you promise to marry a girl and you didn't marry her and went married another he said you're living in adultery I'm like I'm sad now if he kept his promise and made the girl two weeks later he could married another one you know and that would have been alright long as she was a virgin but if you buy pies that when it won't keep you promise okay so Jesus is right in there by your words you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned gotta be done right everything's got to be in order if not it throws you clean out of the camp now your prophet was straight about the scriptures right he didn't twist scriptures brother down I don't give it a whole four nobody that's exactly the truth none of us have any hopes it's not how goody-goody you've been all your life and your got not going to die and go to hell because of polygamy you're gonna die and go to hell for unbelief the polygamy is wrong today cuz you don't need it to talk no more you're in the answer time and if you none at the top you don't have another time to go to you are the finishings finality Ben and his wife that's why he said go home with your wife people went dart with three or four wives for four husbands if it was revealed to him that day they went home with one I've told you when Paul came to the law of grace imagine divorce he wound up with polygamy situations he was facing what about a person coming up want to be a Christian didn't they say Paul what can I do I've got 10 wives that's all I can say is if you take the scripture put it together and what are you gonna come up with my thoughts is what Paul would tell him take one of them women that's your first one you're married when you're married first in other words you're true to that one point you started off right bigger and go home with her that's your wife but don't you live with your mother none because we're making things right but I'm straight - Paul would tell him cuz I would you make sure they are four supplied financially not just throw them out the door you know just get out of here you're not gonna my no that's his children God don't play games God's true we get any straight he's got a word to keep we don't keep that word what are we gonna do now with all of us in the bad shape me where I live house ever gonna be a rapture but you know there is a grace but you know the way I preach it is not only just a grace about our natural things our old husband denominational husband got to be dead not divorced mark and I were talking coming back now to hunting land yesterday you can take every doctrine and they all stem from one thing the two souls then it went to two Lords female Holy Ghost male Holy Ghost then it went to River Jordan doctrine and each one of them is making God into a trinity again they just come out of the open under the River Jordan doctrine what they were really saying when I loves the same doctrine you got two Sloane's you got two gods you got to have them you got two lords that's two gods you got a male Holy Ghost the female Holy Ghost you got two Holy Ghost you've got Jesus not being God through the river Jordan you got identically the same doctrine if they come up cut in rogue landed the first not seeing counselor 325 AD go home and read it that was the doctrine they were trying to get an inroad it's like I've told brother Mark I can make the statement of people just frown at me at 325 AD reads you're not seeing counsel they declared that that doctrine of Jesus being in light a different substance was wrong that he was very God that's your first not seeing counselor that's you're not seeing Creed because it could not get no inroad desire took us 606 to bring it up go home and read it on you encyclopedia but 325 they didn't read what it says see the men there was trying to get that doctrine that Jesus was another substance and not the substance of God and that's identically what you're saying today and yet people are always wonderful I just love that you know they do sales some truth in other words you just want to be a just a little bit sorry you just want to run around a little bit I think it's time to stop it and just get it down in a plain language forget it or golden you don't do whatever but you see I'm not popular well you don't understand that bro you don't understand things no I don't I don't understand how anybody could say that Jesus wasn't almighty god but to show you their Trinitarian you know what the brothers say it and we heard he wasn't saying he said you ain't nothing but a bunch of one this is bleak like y'all believe you believe Jesus was God now you just won this well if he believes this - he's doing this he's a trinitarian then what is he god what is that gonna change anybody no but it's to warn you do not let that jump get into your mind so all I'm doing with it I don't never hear it you're around sometimes you listen you just pay attention to what you're hearing anything that declares that Jesus Christ was not Almighty God the Bible says is anti-christ now that's what the scripture said I don't have to say it either deny that Jesus is a crisis what Antichrist what you see Church we play around with those little ideas we'll get back to that but get down to a point you say well what is I'm reading then brother there it's when you ask somebody to marry you and they accept you the only thing would annihilate that would be the woman to go off some way to do something wrong but there's no grounds whatsoever for her to be able to be engaged again unless that boy dies yeah but that's just too hard you don't leave us any grace not only no disgrace it's either God is not God the word is either God's words not God's words it is not let's quit go home and forget it we're gonna believe it it's like I said even your prophet covered under polygamy if you ask that girl to marry her and you don't marry you go marry another he said you're living in adultery and put out the camp don't fit surely wasn't right under polygamy which surely wouldn't have nowhere else to be right you ask that girl to marry you and she accepts you're married both of you married the only grounds that you have a breaking that or that engagement is for her to go out and do something wrong take another man yeah you say if he went out and got engaged to somebody else would that free her to marry no you can't free her to marry death death is the only thing that frees the woman to remarry now try to be nice and honest about it I know somebody in this message that her husband disappeared well she waited I don't think eight ten years or something him no she had to law to try to find him done everything she could and they allow law finally declared him legally dead well you know what I didn't have no problem for that you said well you don't know where he wrote or not but you don't know where he was or not either okay the law declared him legally dead she wasn't married again eyewitness had nothing this is straight listen to what he said now we have seen his star in the east and come to worship Him preached in 1963 12 16 paragraph 65 into 66 and he's coming down explaining about Christ and Joseph by dream and the Bible says you know Joseph was a good man and all he was a spouse to Mary I'd like to pass this on before we go further espousing in the East was the same as marriage his betrothed all as soon as they as they were a spouse they were married when that sacred vow between them was taken read Deuteronomy 22 23 now we'll get to that and you know later in the message on the vowels and you'll find out that when this woman and man agreed married yet they did not take the vials four months later now you understand it another word they didn't go down to the preacher didn't go through the vowels they didn't have the ceremony till much later if they even broke that vow they were guilty of adultery now watch him is he talking about just the man or the woman who's he talking matter he's on about everybody is he tying that together with the other is God doing it if they even broke that vinyl they were guilty of adultery that's right when they were a spouse they were just the same as marriage the law had not given them rights to live together a husband and wife yet but before God when they promised one another their words were sealed in God's kingdom and to break that was just committing adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to marry now look where Joseph was standing do you understand if Mary's right she's still virgin she hadn't done anything wrong right if she was not a virgin he had a right to put her away have her killed Mary was still a virgin little brown said she had to be virgin spoken words regional see she had to be virgin in mind and mm-hmm you ever thought about how God does things why didn't he just create in a little old girl with our name Mary that wouldn't engage to nobody you know just a young girl when engaged to nobody look how God knows how things has to be done to keep it right and she come up claiming I've got a baby from the Lord oh yeah they just took her out and killed her he didn't do it that way did he he went down to a girl that was engaged espoused to a husband to where the husband could protect her because I said a moment ago if Joseph had to protect her they too killed her that was the law okay so look how he does times their words were sealed in God's kingdom and the break that was just committing adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to marry if Minister brothers if you'd study that right good it's it clear you up on this marriage and divorce case that's so so hard and different amongst the people today and notice Joseph her husband being a just man see now we find out that this could not be broken you can't break that vowel if you do you're committing adultery what about it how many times did somebody ask you to marry and you said yes and then you didn't food that didn't go through boys how many girls did you ask to marry I'm talking about me in sitting here you know how many times did you ever ask anybody to marry you and didn't keep your word so you remember what I said this morning or what ago or some time about it that the brother said you can go to the courthouse and see I ain't never been married but one time but what about God's kingdom it's written in God's kingdom when you asked that girl to marry you and she accepts you I said God's kingdom why would you want to break something like that what about it it's a serious matter it's not a play time or you know something that we just play around with it we'll get back next weekend the Lord willing on the vial or some cover a few things how did it take too long you see you can always try to find a loophole right you go down and you get a law and you get it into law before the law is voted into law and the governor or ever who signs it into law before it's signed into law somebody's done got it figured out how to be a loophole in the things right well isn't that kind of the way it is in the gospel the people are always trying to find a loophole then like I was trying to say this morning see somebody come along and say well you know in my husband's divorced is anyway I get married again no but why would you want to if you couldn't make it on the first one 842 ain't go away why not did you say well God you be my husband and you you protect me and take care of me you be my lord let me put my life to you is that not what Paul says that when some men are what made eunuchs by man he said some are born eunuchs let's just one something happen went wrong but he said some make themselves eunuchs for the gospel and Paul said I've got every right to get married he said it won't and when did he go on to explain he said because yelling marry the married thing you know is what current you know I have to be concerned with my family my wife in the house and the cars and the taking care things and doing things I have to be concerned with that right I'm cause I'm married she has to be concerned with like this morning she got my clothes for me she does every morning picks him out and legs him down because she says I'm color blind bruh you don't matter to me whether it's blue socks and whatever it is long as I got on socks that's all I care about but she lays out all my clothes she got everything ready this morning she was in the bath he was in her taking a shower I could walk in there I said honey you got to do something my thumb this one is taped up it busted open you know and I was packing my shirt down in my pants well I had blood all over my shirt you know well she tried to eat it off with a little old contraption it didn't work she said you might as well pull it off I got to go iron you another one well see she couldn't pray too good this morning she was ironing two shirts she couldn't dedicate herself to the Lord to come to church as being set aside you know and and really serving God she's had to take care of her old man then she says one thing we will do come here I want to take that thumb up because she knew me I need no problem I just stick them in you know but listen jerk do you understand what I mean she tells me a lot of times that you should have been a Herman you shouldn't never married what I'm not made for that I'm not and it's not on account of a lot of things you'd be laughing about I'm just not made for those line my door in my study is never closed my door back door is never closed somebody pulled it too well ago by accident my door in my studies guards never closed you don't have to come up and try to get an audience with me you know you just walk in well the way the house is designed my study used to be right there where the play kids us the the then we're all their choices then well that's where I set them studied and I don't mean it wrong I know everybody's not made that way but you know you called some people how did certain time drew I can't interfere because he's studying what's honorable not you don't never get that answer when you call my house she might say he's in the study but I'll be in our in just a minute or she'll holler Sam pick up the phone well because she's my wife that's no problem but you understand a single person this dick can dedicate their whole life to God say why would you want to get married again to some sorry slob because you get a sorry slap to start with why do you want another sorry stop then you wind up later saying I wish hadn't got to slob do you understand marriage and divorce is a very serious matter a very serious thing its life then we say this because I know you ain't gonna like it but it's true there's a lot of men you're older than their wives I hope to god we don't live 40 more years because if we do some of you gonna be pushing your old man down the aisle to the church because you're a whole lot younger than he is that was your choice of marrying like that not mine and I'm not saying anything wrong with it Joseph was an old man married and had kids married married I'm not saying nothing that's just true I'm just telling you like it is you're looking for a wonderful time one of these days we'll get to live on the old man's money when he retires you push him in a wheelchair come on better life than it is to cry that's what mother would be said something one day about dog was running the deer off his land we're not know about I said a better life that is to cry life is a very serious matter so we can have fun and we can be jolly you know and talk about things and it be true but yet not be derogatory and aggravating yeah we're supposed to marry as I said this morning in Lourdes they don't matter if the woman's 15 and the boy to 80 if you're married in the Lord that's married in the Lord that's fine I'm gonna go say nothing I'm gonna tell you gonna problems but I'm not gonna refuse to do the way you thought it wouldn't be correct but listen Church we go out and we didn't know right we didn't know you know some of you younger ones or some of you in other churches and things it in this message you know yourself they don't teach this very much do you ever hear it taught where you used to go to church much on marriage and divorce I'm really what it is no that fraid to see the afraid to go run them off because I mean I have to be blown out to tell you hey you got problems you tell me got problem they're gonna leave now let's have less problems let's get me a job and go to work right now less problems I'm not worried about running anybody off I don't want to run nobody off heaven help now you think I do I know what and what do you think about me you think I'm trying my best run y'all know I'm trying my best to get you and I saved your to save marriage and divorce or whether it be just natural salvation that we need or whether it just be husband and wife living together I've even been some blunt way to tell you if you forgive that woman or to give that man forgive them you know when they've done something wrong and you bring that up again you're a hypocrite that's as much as I can say then you pout up and well you ain't like my first husband or my first wife now what kind of a situation is life like that I'd rather have two jobs and undies single and you know you know what I'm saying is true and what I'm fixing to say you will agree with it 90% of the men and women of this message is not going to live together when they've had a problem and not bring it up in some way or another you know what I mean you're going to say well that was the way your first wife treated you ain't the way I treat you you're gonna bring up stuff because you just can't keep it from sister Trudy remembers what I've told her years ago she's driving down here driving five hours to come to church and then driving five hours to get back home to get home at 10 o'clock at night I told her from this pulpit pointing to her and another sister I said if you go home tonight in your hugs wouldn't wants to go get something to eat I'm tired I've been serving as our dog day I'm not going with you you're not gonna win them that away right you're gonna win them by being the true husband and the true wife if you want to win your wife or you want to win your husband to the way you believe then live before them what's supposed to be what you believe hey we're gonna have trouble are we gonna I'll do it no car we're human we're not gonna do it all the time we're human beings you had Church we still what did brother Ron say he said I can't hear you words because of your life no but I'm a Christian like I've told you don't tell a lot of people where you go to church and you white seed are today well me and my wife just decided we was just gonna take off for a couple of weeks and just go out was a good time not worry about church is what it said about brother Gary man and his father laying there nice in the wave got every legal right and I would have said amen brother be there yet he's here that means a lot to me it means you want to hear and so might like meaning that doesn't mean a lot because there's not a lot of people maybe it wants to hear but I'll go to my part to face it to what I say and do and you're gonna have your part you're gonna have to face that part but you can't go there and say I didn't hear it I haven't been told you know that 90% of the message people churches can say they've never heard the truth you said brother Dale what am I telling the truth why are you here you left somewhere to come here because of what was there son you know there is a line and you know there is a way but her brother said God gave us a way to marry our wives let me write it away I don't believe in heaven it's going to be mad I'm you know husband and wife and we're gonna and Mama's gonna have a home here wage what one here Terrace got one here and has got one here and the grandkids got one here I don't believe we're gonna be that kind of family if I'm wrong I'm sorry I believe we'll know who we are yeah and I believe I'll know that's my wife we remember brother branham up beyond the curtain of time standing there wondering and here comes hope walking right down he said I thought you grabbed me and say my husband or something like that said she said shook his hand said my precious brother kept right on going Paul said they're not married or giving in marriage not gonna be a bunch of kids growing in heaven well we could be there me and her can be husband and wife and we can walk through the garden together we do now is what everybody around home thanks like I don't go nowhere that is why well I'm glad she goes with me that's fine we should deer hunt together I enjoyed it that's a wonderful times especially not the time I got her up on a deer stand and the deer stand twisted a ramp she's 12 foot up and her and I'm trying to get it straightened back up she's high Oh hard she got her stuff finally got damn I said honey I think we might as well go home ain't no beer need woods they are they're laughing their self to death I don't go out the gills once it on the mortars ranking lifted all of the gossip you know I go out there sometimes and I hear another come Watson heaven help me I ain't going back I don't even go keep nothing further store cuz you go in and everybody Obama oh who it over that you know this is that not problem you know they're always talking you know why don't we fool with that junk now if they're gonna talk about the Lord I'll be there when I walk in the Lord a mission he goes on vacation when I go to give or go to any mansion cuz I'm one of them nuts yeah but listen Church seriousness we'll get to it on the invisible Union when we get a chance to and God asks you to marry him accept him as your Savior and you accept it that might just be justification to chop off you PI sins that may just be the beginning of your Christian journey but God counts it is finished and sees no problems and no trouble along the road he just comes down and gives you the new birth we don't have to wait to get to heaven to be married no but we found out to it there will be a marriage in heaven the Prophet says it but we're already married to him now because we're engaged we're married what about it but Stan the Coen brothers what is a wedding it's an engagement then it goes through stages just like your Christian journey goes through stages of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring in the new birth your marriage goes through stages of what the asking accepting planning of the wedding getting everything ready and going all the way through and one day go to the altar and you know speak and do that's why they asked brother Branham said we said we were married by justice of the peace many years ago and said brother Brennan was we married he said yes because he was married by your vows and I and said she was married but says you ought to be married in a church well that's why we've had here many times over the years a marriage renewal and in that marriage renewal I don't single out and say you and you I you and you you and y'all can come up and we'll have a marriage know it's open for the church to come and say let's have a wedding is that wrong without you show it to men it's all right this is church we got just not your church is what we believe yeah but that couple stood up there and I know they had problems and you stand back there with a whole lot of them yeah what's the difference someone once said are we gonna get the right husband when we get over the IROC they're not married I don't know nothing about that I don't think it's gonna be a juggling of the books when you get turtle you got away you'll help me be home later he was married to three other women he'll be fine you get him that's not silly that's what a lot of people thinks yeah but we gotta have another half what the problem with a lot of people leaves they got another half and another half in another having another having another I haven't enough right they got a lot of hives a lot it equals out to be a few holes listen church girl's fat boy says will you marry me don't you answer him we'll get to it in the scripture that if you do something as a young girl and it's too young and ever time there's things that your daddy can take care of but it not for just any calls or any kind of sign it's got to be done correct can't be just done anyway well my daughter was engaged to four guys but I'm her daddy and I'm gonna say it's all right now don't talk to me I'm not I'm too old I'm
