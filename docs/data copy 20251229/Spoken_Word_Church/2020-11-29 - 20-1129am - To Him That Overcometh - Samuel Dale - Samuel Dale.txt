for being you and lord and just come on the scene now this morning we've had a great time of praying to you and and singing to you and singing about you and praying about you and fellowshipping together about you and all now we've come to the point of just talking about your word and we ask you to just come on the scene and be with each and every one of us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk upright in you we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen we do have a visitor so okay we say to you welcome you ever come here you're you're visitor first time you're part of a second time so glad to have you with us revelations 3 14 and until the angel of the church of the lady of sins right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that are neither cold or hot i would thou art cold or hot so then because thy art lukewarm and neither cold or hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now this is the age that we're living this is the time that we're living up on the earth all right you'll see i canceled thee to buy of me gold try to tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesight that thou may see and as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will shut with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my father's throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now what i want to do is is to try to just talk to you more than to preach you know getting lifted up and everything i just want to talk to you a little bit today about something i believe is very very important for us to understand i believe that we're living in the time that we read here this is to the ladies in church age this is the the uh message coming to this age and see each age had a a message that a messenger they had a a move of god they had a rebuke they had a a praising each age has had the things in it to show and and and show where we're at all right and i believe that we're here at the end i i'm this is concerned about this as i can be about one thing to try to get you to see what i'm talking about i believe we're at the place that god is trying us i do i believe he's trying the little bride around the world not just lula not just this but trying the little bride he's putting us to a test to see what we're going to do all right i believe that that's as serious as i can be about it that's not derogatory that's not uh you know uh anything of any problems it's just i believe that god tried he's always tried his people he he knows how to raise children you know he knows how to bring children up and and raise them and and get them to to see and understand and the main thing that what in the bible is to me is that everywhere you look it's always god trying to come on the scene to his people no matter what age what time old testament new testament it's always been that he's trying to come on the scene to you and i for us to realize uh not only who he is you know but to realize who we are and see everybody should get to the point we've always tried to preach it the prophet preached a message one time but recognizing your day in this message all right see we believe that we're in the end time we believe here that god has to give us a message that brought it down through the prophet of the age and time we believe that and we believe that he has given us all of these things that go with that the message of the hour is here the things you know that we can know and recognize where we're at and what we're doing and can say glory hallelujah we realize that but that's the point i want you to see we need to realize more and more we we should emphasize i believe the knowing and realizing what's taking place and and seeing the day and the hour i mean you look out there and you see the things and and you realize what's taking place out there the world's falling apart it's you know nobody has any cures for all of these things it's not just a virus it's a it's a virus to the way i look at it it's a virus for the whole world it's not just a virus that i can't even pronounce the name that's why i call it a virus you know but it it's there for the whole world we've never had a time as far as we would know of or whatever to do that the entire world is on the brink of destruction not from bombs not from all of the things you know that you would see uh that we could do with but it's it's on the brink of destruction of its own self because it's falling inward it it it's collapsing it's doing all of the things and there's no cure for it you talk about no cure for the virus there's no cure for what is taking place today because you know i mean you put in another president and he does the best way he can and he didn't we don't like ad we put in another one we go up and down and and all kind of things trying to uh you know find a way to come forth with some answer well there is no answer the only answer is jesus christ and and the people are not going to go for that see the people are not going to to to jesus christ you say they're not going yeah they're going to church they're going to to all of the things they're trying to live and do and you know and all like that i'm not throwing off on the way people are doing because probably more people in church today than has been in a long time because you know the i hope it's back like it was uh you know in some of the other incidents where people started going to church you know and got more concerned got more more uh to where they could want to go to church but see my point is one thing you the whole message now will be based on one thing i believe god is trying his people he's putting us to a test to see what we'll do all right and see that way then you read the uh part of the age that we're living and you can read how that they're so horrible of things that are there in the the reading you know and all and and then then you find some good things because that's the way it is to each ages it's it's down on one side but then it picks up god never leaves his church and it's always to the overcomer amen the all right it's this is not to the world a world can listen and get as much benefit as they can from the the gospel and all but really the little bride of jesus christ is the only one that has the uh uh the promise you know i i i remind the lord like this you know you pray sometimes and and and i'm serious in the prayer part because i remind the lord that you promised it you know but now listen don't don't get tied up into all of that to you you can holler lord you promised it lord you promised it to so much until you're getting in trouble now my point is always this way when i say lord you promised this in your word that you would be with us that all of these things would come we would know the age we're living by what's coming and what's taking place and all i can but lord you promised to come on the scene all right now this is the way i'll end up that part of the prayer lord i'm not trying to get you to work out something or do what we want done i am praying for you to just to fulfill your word you promised it now i'm not trying to challenge you on the basis of trying to get you to do it because i know you will that's the point i want to get to we're going to get into a strange thing in a minute but we're going to look back down and we're going to see that god has done what he said he'd do he's done what he said he'd do he's brought it right to the to the point to where we're standing today and he's tried every age every people and their tribe of god see because you want your children to be uh good children you know uh and brother gary atkins used to say about sister orr she had this little thing that them boys would do wrong and she'd reach over and go wow you could hear it i mean you'd be preaching away and you'll hear them cry well they they got corrected he said now she knows how to make them line up you know well that's true and god knows how to make you and me come to the right place all right so now get the point of what we're aiming at god is trying his bride he's putting her to a test and the prophet said she would prove that she wouldn't fall like eve all right so now we're going to prove what we are amen okay and see now sickness can't come on the people of god unless god allows that to take place all right and then when he does it's for our benefit that the sickness comes you say oh that's not a good daddy that's a wonderful daddy because he knows how to train us he knows how to get us to the right place he knows when the the rod of correction needs to be made he said be the child it won't die now what about god putting in his own word of saying that he wasn't saying you know come out here and take him and just beat him to death and all that no he was just emphasizing the point of the interest of put on a little bit every once in a while uh wade one time i remember i was spanking him about something and he's about probably 18 years old you know and i spanking him well i hit him one time and you know and he just stood there well i put a little bit more to it the next time and i touched a little more and he just stood there i said okay now one thing or the other's got to happen i got to break this stick or break that kid so i came back and i put a pretty good one on there and when i did tears run down there i laid the stick down i didn't need to work no more but you see i had to make sure he understood had he been smart he would have been like gary said that his daddy would do him then mama would tell uh brother gary said his mama would would tell dr atkins they were great friends of ours and say you've got to whip gary because he's done so and so and so and so well he'd take him in the bedroom you know and sell his lay down across the bed and and he'd get a belt you know he'd reach over and he'd hit the bed and gary said i'd look at him and think what's he doing and he hit the bed he said gary gary holler holler you know in other words mike make another racquet till grandma think i'm in here whooping you well god don't have to do all of that but he knows how to handle it he knows how to put to put the fire on just a little bit you know a little fire when we need it okay so he's trying us to prove that we are the bride all right now i want to think about what we want to get with you about because this is we're talking to him that overcometh that'll be the the point of the message go each age and as i said they have their word they have their their message they have their trials they have their things and it all comes out to to be uh uh uh a part of well like we'd say in revelation 3 15 there see you start out and it starts telling you the bad things all right real bad i canceled you to buy me you've done this you've done that it's a bad age you look out there and you see it you say well that's them no that's us let's don't never just put it all on somebody else and all let's get it into straight enough but yet when it comes to the end of the chapter it's praising the people and admonishing us to move on in god all right so that's the two things that we need to do first realize god will take care of it he will punish us he will mark us he'll he'll bring us to the right place we may not like it but he'll take care of it that's not meaning a dirty mean old daddy that means a wonderful loving father who knows how to take care of his children all right now thinking about that then we're recognizing that our day and its message seeing it right there in the scripture that we can like i said we can look out there and say this is them this is the world and we look over here and say well okay this is this is for us and all and that's all well and good because it'll bring us to a place to realize what we're doing see and you wind up saying to him that overcometh all right now it's not what we overcome it's how we overcome and how do we overcome by being in jesus christ and doing it his ways learning to know that our father has everything in charge he's putting us through to all of these things bringing us to ending it all up and to realize that we've got to see the message of the hour is the same thing this message was you know i mean you listen sometimes to what brother branham and boy he lays it down i mean he he don't play he he puts some hard words out there and things to show us where we're standing and to me then can you say amen and might you might have to say oh me to start with but once you realize what he's doing then you can start saying amen to what he's rebuking because you're seeing right where you're standing see all right so recognizing your message the hour because it's all going to wind up now and listen and then i'll get into the message it's all going to unfold to us if we'll just look at it correctly but he is not beating us you know doing all of those things that we think that he's trying to correct he's not doing that he's trying to guide us into the understanding of where we need to be all right because that's what the weapons are for that's what those things and it's to him that overcometh yes it's not what we overcome but how we how do we overcome by being in jesus christ all right he's the savior he's the doer of all things and and doing into that but now here's something i want you to think about because i want you to realize how perfect the word of god is let's just think about something that a prophet told us and then what i want you to think about and i want you to as we go through these things i want you to think about some of these things as way back some of them were happening right then some is still happening and i want you to get that point because that's what i want it to be i want you to see that god is directing us because he's telling us before it ever happens that's the wonderful part i think about the bible all the way through how wonderful it is to tell the future tell what's going to happen and then you can sit down and say you mean but that's what happened it's wonderful to think about and realize where you're at and you say well uh daddy told me so and so you know and then one day you see that come to pass talk about your natural daddy natural mother teachers et cetera you know uh he said they were they were telling me and i was living that do you realize no you started off with me so let's see how far you can go you started off with me of thinking about that god is trying us all right now if he's trying us then it proves one thing he loves us come on now children uh daddy mama has to spank you sometime but you know it's like i told the kids one day the boys they were sitting there and had to correct the kids or something and you know they they they looked over finally and said daddy now we know what you're talking about and because what i was talking about was one thing i'd always when i'd whip the kids i said look this go this hurts me worse than it does you that's hard to think about it i mean you take a belt and you just wearing somebody out real good you know and then you're telling them so this hurts me well they had to correct their children i said now do you realize what i was trying to say do you realize now what i was trying to say to you that that hurts me because you don't want to whoop the kid especially when they're standing there looking at you oh the miles you know puppy dog as we call it you know and and everything you just oh i'll do better next time say well you might have to start this time cause you know how now come on mama and daddy you know what i'm talking about you don't want to whip him children all the time you don't if you do there's something wrong with you if there's something you if it if it is if you're just wanting to whip them all the time or or beat them or show who's the boss then there's something wrong with you you're not lining up to to the way god raises his children god spanks his children yes but he does it with a hand of love you ever thought about being whipped with a hand that had a nail hole in it everything like that think that the rod of correction is in the hand of the one that hung on calvary and that nail hole is there it's more pain to him this is to you that's my point okay let's get a little bit of doing if you heard the prophet say this and i want to just go over it and i decided well i'll just read them and that way people on the internet some people have never heard the thing but you know brother branham in 1933 he had a vision and he saw seven things in the vision all right now we'll get to it in a little bit when we get down to it he says now five of those seven has already taken place well all right now what about god showing a man not only what would future come because where he stood with the 33 you got to go this way a little bit to get to world war ii totally in with it or you got to back up this way to get part of what would take care you know in this part of the visions and things so get the point he he's seeing the pious the present and the future all right and in doing that see then he showed these things and he says five of them has taken place well do you realize what that means we're not in the days of adolf hitler we're not in the days of mussolini and where are we at see where's the day and hour that you and me are living we're not in those days those days are priced all right let's read the things and just take and see what's pies and see what's present and then see the future and where is the prophet said that we miss it at by looking back or looking forward and failing to realize what's taking place right now that's the whole point of christianity to me christianity is a positive present tense word the bible is a positive present tense word in other words right now and when we realize what's taking place right now we might realize the prophet stood back there and knowed a whole lot more than what he said because one time i remember on the sixth seal he said lord i can't tell them that there's things that he just couldn't tell i don't know what it was and nobody's worried about it but he said he couldn't do it all right but see what i want you to do is look at yourself and think about god is correcting us but he's doing it by giving you and me not a whipping bout with a belt or or even anything but he's bringing to us the word and showing the day that we're living by the word right the hour that we're living but do we look at it like that's right well i want to see these great revelations well what about finding yourself written in the word huh finding yourself you know there's a lot of people that can take this and that and the other and they can do it with words and things and that and they put you right in the scripture your names and everything else but see that's not no good what i want to know is where i'm at right now i want to see what the word says about what we're doing so go ahead brothers and pull up number number one and let's uh let's get into this and if i take a little time let's just forgive me i want to read most of it because i want you to understand okay from the ladies in church age he says the latest in age began around the turn of the century perhaps 1906. how long will it last as as a servant of god who has had multiple multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict now he never prophesied 77 would be the the end of it he predicted but i've heard and certain services and i know you have preachers that have spent hours trying to prove that a prediction is as great as a prophecy well now your prophet says no that sounds a problem but yet they've done that and then they took and made dates out of things but you never see them when they wound up that their date don't work coming back and saying now you see them with more more dates coming up in other words they start on something else but now listen this age will end around 1977. why that's a prediction that's not thus saith the lord if you will pardon a personal note here i based this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one sunday morning in june 1933. the lord jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the lord was drawing nigh but that before he came seven major events would transpire i wrote them all down and down and that morning i gave forth okay from what gave forth the revelation of of the lord the first vision now watch let's go one two three four the first vision was that mussolini would invade ethiopia and that nation would fall at his steps that vision surely did cause some repercussions because people didn't believe it's going to happen by the way see all right and some were very angry when i said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over the natives didn't have a chance because they didn't have anything to fight with but the vision also said that mussolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as it was saying all right now do you believe that you know i'm asking you and i'll ask each time as we go did that take place did it happen the way that god showed him that mussolini would go down to ethiopia and he'd try to take over and everything and all and it would wind up that his own people would turn against him and kill him all right now do you believe that happened well what about a man standing in 1933 and telling you that see what about my point is let's see how positive back there he saw things and let's see where we're at can we see it as positive right now can you take right now and put it in the bible i'm just asking you can you do it can you take right now and put it in the bible and know where you're at all right the next which would be the next vision secondly or part of it you know vision foretold that an australian by the name of adolf hitler would rise up as dictator over germany and that it would draw the world into war it showed the cigna line and how that our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that hitler would come to a mysterious end what happened he pulled back in in a thing him and he got his uh little wife finally she according to what they said finally that that day they got married and things and and he took her underground and killed herself come to mysteriously and they argued that it wasn't him that's no problem so it's a mysterious thing that's the point do you believe that happened do you believe that hitler took the world to war and we fought it out with him and finally won almost losing it do you believe that happened okay the third vision was in the realm of world politics where it showed me that there would be three great isms fascism nazism communism but that the first two would be swallowed up into the third the voice admonished watch russia watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north because there's your king of the north in the bible that comes down to war israel you know when it come down and and hitler brought it all to a war and then after him comes the thing and then then you got communism coming up and communism ruled russia and all this for a long time now do you believe that happened not only did not only the prophet saying it but do you believe naturally did it happen because a lot of those things were naturally happening and taking place all right the fourth vision showed the great advance in science that would come after the second world war it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble topped car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared sitting in their car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of game to amuse themselves now there's one you can really move a lot because what about the prophet seeing that in 33 it only happened maybe they're just now still getting into the works of doing it uh they have it but i mean we'll say all right 10 years ago or 20 years ago they finally come up with that but he saw it back there you know what a prophet to me i this is the way i see a prophet in the way he sees things in visions and dreams and things present tense he don't see nothing in the past they ain't talking about not seeing the pies now i'm talking about when he has a vision it's present tense when the word of god unveils to a prophet it's present tense when are we gonna get to be there and think that away that you realize this message has brought the bible from undercover brought it out into the open that we can read it and realize what's taking place and has taken place but it's taking place now you realize that see he saw all of the great things that would come with the cars and the things he saw the future that would come that's naaman naaman saw chariots jostling in the streets which what did he see he saw buick's oldsmobile running into each other and the bible says they're running like lightning in other words there was headlights running down the roads and highway see the bible is perfectly pure in the basis of telling us right where we're at if we'll just read it that away and listen to it and we can see the very hour that we're living he stood back there and saw all of these things taking place 50 years before it ever come into a car being anything like that because he was seeing the future but to him it was present tense it was real all right now the fifth had to do with moral problem of our age all right centering mostly now forgive me sisters in this it talks pretty hard but you take your own place because if you get your feelings heard about what a prophet said about you just remember check and see if it's true if it's true then then you pitch your own feelings and get them off of certainly mostly centering mostly around women god showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hire which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but instead on either equal rights are in most cases more than equal rights she's adopted men's clothing and she's adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world now that's five of them and he says they've come to piss we can say it's come to pass why because we've lived in it we're living in it now right lady will see us here we can talk all we want to about glory hallelujah but just remember we're at the end all right not a doomsday preacher i've never been that way i've never done it even back years ago when i stood and said we could pass the year 2026 i never told nobody then to be afraid of anything i just told everybody to be ready you mean you've done that yeah cause you're sitting here listening to him because you know i've done it why because something spoke to him and told me all right now you you trying to make you a prophet i'm me what are you i ain't worried about it because i know i'm not but i know i'm a child of god and i know god can speak to you and tell you things i believe that all right now watch going to the next round now five of them he said had taken place now watch what he's dealing in the sixth vision i rose up in america a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power and this is where i hate it because i'm always getting myself in trouble because i'm always just plain about it now you remember when we had a woman going to run for president instead of going in the bible and seeing that that's what the bible said would take place the prophet had said it you know what it wound up being a joke there rose up in america most beautiful but cruel woman boy that was the ugliest woman i've ever seen that's all preachers preached about i said this can't be the one this can't be the one that'll wind up and do this cause she's so ugly and you know what the carnegie hey you know everybody just oh she's ugly he it can't be the end because she's ugly and she's a pretty woman you understand what i'm saying it always gets me in trouble because i expose people's ignorance what has it got to do with it it didn't say anything about the bible saying the woman and the thing it's because they were saying that she was ugly come on preachers where are you at now well i was just making a joke okay but look and in the sixth vision i rose up in america most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her com complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it would possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by the women all right so he looked at it as being that he never said brother branham never brought thus saith the lord on the part that i've been able to find to just say uh it says the lord it's the catholic church or it's thus saith the lord it's women you know he just left it he said it could be a woman well you know what he saw in a vision do you think naaman saw buicks and cadillac's running into each other i don't think he did i'm serious i don't think he did i think he saw chariots but was told what they would be chariots were horses and buggies and things you get what i'm saying but yet that prophet knew and when he said it'd be like charis johnson in the street that would be thousands of years later before it ever transpired what are you trying to get to brother dale all right that's the seventh thing the last one was wherein i heard a most heart terrible explosion as i turned to look i saw nothing but debris created craters and smoke all over the land of america he saw the total destruction of this land now when he stood back there that would have been [Music] probably 1960 because the church age book where it comes in here would have been a little after that anywhere 1960 somewhere in there he spoke of the things that would take place but do we believe they've taken place he said five of those things had taken place what about the sixes we know the seventh one hasn't taken place yet because that's the life we can know for sure till that but what about number six where that he saw the women and the condition and did he see it perfectly right of what the women are today and and the situation and the clothing and all of the things did he see it right and spoke of it sorry to be saying that but see our point my point is when we don't know what to come up with as an answer to some things we make it a joke we say well can't be hillary cause she's ugly we think that satisfies or says what god is saying about it god was showing the man this end time now i want to approach it like this on two points the biggest portion of the white house today is catholic right now i didn't look up to see whether biden is or this one is or that he is maybe you do maybe you know i'm not concerned i'm concerned with one thing that when i first come in this message brother branham said they'll worm their way into the white house i got every book i could get a hold of i got everything i could find that had any connection to do with the the you know the the situation at the white house and come to find out there was like 1500 catholic roman catholics already in the white house and you know a lot of those people that are put in those offices are put in there for life am i right see i was interested in seeing how many catholics it was not whether hillary was pretty or not to me that shows your silliness that you want to make a joke out of something all right let's see if we're in the end time where that is really right among us what about uh well let's go on i'm trying to find a way to approach it where you'll understand what i'm driving at not not to what a is doing but listen they started running women for president about what four turns back three terms or something like that four three or four turns back women started running for president on the tickets and getting a little bit and getting out and you'd wind up with enough to do this and do that and people begin to talk about say okay a woman in the white house a woman in the white house all right and said well there ain't no woman in the white house so we're okay we're running okay because ain't no woman in the white house well now what are you gonna say when you got one in the white house now have you really thought it over where you're sitting that you're sitting exactly in the number six that the prophet said you realize we're right in the middle of that when the prophet spoke of a woman in the white house the people just started laughing and making more jokes i begin to think about it lord let me keep up with these things you realize now that we have a thus saith the lord what's your prophet say it twice about the woman in the white house but do you think it's just another joke see you know you understand what i'm getting at out we laughed about the pretty woman oh that can't be because she's ugly we thought that solved all of those situations but you know what that was that was the first inroad of the woman into the white house she almost made it right hillary almost wound up being vice president or president well what are we looking at now when the prophet said thus saith the lord they would be a woman in the white house president or vice president or the catholic church now if it's true that the biggest portion of that ticket that's owned there that they have you know uh the democratic party and i'm not the one those don't i'm not a democrat or republican not just me if it's true that they're there having that the biggest portion of the catholic i mean biggest portion of the white house is catholic well that would put number one at the prophet said that it would be a maybe the catholic church so we're to fulfillment of that the biggest portion of the white house is catholic and we're in the time of that of them being in the white house and now you have a vice president a woman vice president which is what the prophet said would take place in 1960. a woman in the white house but are we serious or we just come up with some kind of a joke can you see that you're in the very pages of the bible being fulfilled right now amen because this is not just a prophecy he said it's thus saith the lord all right that's what a lot of people go through they say oh they you know back there for years ago there ain't been no woman in the white house now you have one what are you going now let's read a few things that he said all right go over to number two let's just read a few things that was said about this white house woman situation and the message of why priesthood shreveport louisiana we see the great meeting and conferences that was spoken 25 years ago just take place a week or two ago we see the atomic age in other words he's saying the things that's been predicted that i've told you and everything look at it i was quoting last night of prophecy that was given me back in 30 1933 of seven things that would take place germany this sig feed lead line and the president election and all these other things five of them has already taken place two left the coming of the control of a woman in the united states to take over maybe a church to take over to rule watch it's thus saith the lord so that's going to be one of the two well i'm saying they're both already there now they're sitting there now that's thus saith the lord it's there you ever thought that's serious about it it's sitting right there now you have a vice president a woman in the white house you have the catholic in control who's going to pay our national debt come on the coming of the controlling the woman in the united states to take over maybe a church to take over to rule watch it's thus saith the lord and then i seen them create like atom bombs and goes on the wheels and wrote all the things go ahead to number three from the revelation of jesus christ look at the prophecy the lord gave me in 1933 how that it would happen they're permanent they're they'd permit women to vote and in voting they'd elect the wrong man person seven things was give and five of them was all has already happened the next thing was a great woman a church a power or something would take over the united states to rule then i've seen it just like the ashes now if you don't see through all of this things with the viruses and things like if you haven't followed that to see how much control they have that they can do anything they want to they can close this church anytime they want to they don't have to pass no laws they're already priced everything's done done don't worry about rigory it's all right someday i'll tell you okay going up number four a few days ago now i'm not democrat not republican i'm a christian so i don't mention these things but i picked up an old book that that the lord had given me a vision in 33 now this is 61. all right and i just first become a minister going down to the baptist and thing and he gave me a vision that morning and i seen the first one i remember of an international affair and in there and seeing that we'd go to a world war then i've seen also that it would be the 11 years for the the signet magnet was built i seen the germany fortify themselves in this big concrete place also seeing that they permitted women to vote which was wrong and said they would they would someday elect the wrong man they just did it so now who was elected the crew cut haircut kennedy right all right so then i seen at the time the end of the coming and the five things that the lord and he said in seven five of them's already taken place now what i want you to get to i don't know roll it on up and we'll save time reading the woman stand up to the in the to the united states we can write this down if you do you can write this down it's going to happen i don't know she's on her road now exactly and she took over and then i seen the united states just like something that was blowed over so he looked down and saw what it was going to take place with the women go ahead number five the 70th week of daniel number five and now that brings us then to the election of the president kennedy and this car coming on the scene now he's in the vision right telling him bringing five things out of the seven that has happened exactly five of them in other words already taken place now i predict and said i saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed and real highly royals like purple and i got the little for instance down there she was a great ruler in the united states perhaps the catholic church a woman some woman i don't know her to be the catholic church in other words he didn't know it to be he if he had it he said this is thus faith the lord but he knew it was either the a woman or the catholic church that's my point okay i don't know to be the catholic church i don't know don't say only thing i've seen i seen the women that was all but this is a woman's nation this is a she's got 13 stripes 13 stars and she's a woman's nation so you can see that we're here but do you realize we're here or you want to make a joke you want to come up with some kind of a joke to people instead of coming up and telling them the truth you realize what i'm saying church we're at the end whether you want to believe it or not or want to no no we're not making dates we ain't setting dates ain't never said nothing because ain't nothing to it your life and you're making a joke yourself because no man knows a day or an hour but don't say god don't know it he knows it and he can reveal it right but let's read read number six cause wade read this one here a while back on it from that time so i won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation it's the number 13 it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything was a 13. everything is a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman rule before the end time now watch him she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her that's either president or a vice president or it can be the catholic church so we're still right right what's the biggest portion of the people are they're catholics so it's going to take over somebody's going to take over and i'll be done but my point is this your life and make jokes about doing but here's the prophet saying it and look what he says great warmer nation bowed to her it'll be one one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet now who would want to challenge like that who would be able to stand up and say i'll be a false prophet if this don't come to pass he was basing it on something wouldn't he he said thus saith the lord twice of what it would be all right we can say well we don't know we we we don't know we have the bible being fulfilled right to the letter the woman's in the white house are you looking for a woman to raise up and become ruling this nation she's already there she's in the white house she's the vice president even one step from being president all it takes is a bullet between the eyes and and she gets the job i ain't joking making no point i'm just saying it but see we we look at things and we live like say no that can't be this because of that we'll come up with some little something that always comes up with some little idea well now brother dale the prophet said it could be in the catholic church i preached that all the way through i've always said that where'd she come from where'd this lady come from that's vice president what's her background i don't know and don't care ain't got nothing to do with me ain't got nothing against her ain't got nothing against anything but i'm just saying can we realize we're here to him that overcometh will i grant let me say it this way to he that understandeth he didn't have the ears let him hear amen we're here at the end time from a thus saith the lord we're not life in it whether or not this lady is pretty or ugly we're not making jokes i ain't joking i'm as serious as i can ever be in my life well you're scaring me you're scaring my child if i scare you then there's something wrong with you because if the bible tells you yes if the prophet can tell you a dust saith the lord about something that it's going to be that away and that's the way it's going to be not a joke it's the truth we're at the end see anything can take place now i'm not i'm not trying to scare nobody children i'm not trying to scare you you've done okay so far haven't you i mean everything's running okay right now i ain't trying to scare nobody i'm just trying to tell us are we concerned enough to see whether we're where we are at because the message tells us where we are the message tells us where we're at we're at the end of all things see now look what i'm talking about back a few years ago when they come up with a bubble car and the thing oh where we that's what the prophet said that it's a volkswagen it's this it's that oh everybody was just so open in messages you heard it there's preaching and everything oh look and look at all this look we're where the prophet said it well what about now where he said thus saith the lord not looking for a bubble car looking at the word being revealed you understand what i'm saying i started off by saying asking you do you believe this message is the end time message do you believe that we've had thus saith the lord brought into our hands but brother dale uh you know we may be around here 50 years that ain't going to do with it i never said nothing like that but i am saying one thing we're in the time frame or whatever you want to call it the situation the existence of where this is being fulfilled right in their eyes you know there was one day when two cars run into each other that fulfilled the profit of him seeing charis jostling in the streets that fulfilled that you realize the day she that she walked into the white house that fulfilled what your prophet said that makes me more realizing that he was a prophet than i did before why because we're living in that day the bible is being unfolded right down in this age that we're living granted to sit with him in his throne where was his throne well he was here on earth that was his throne right then you move into different thrones you could take a long time on preaching a sermon on it but yet my point is this there come a time there come a time when the bible was fulfilled what if that was the last we don't want to be here when the seventh heaven helped right because that's a total destruction so we want to move that one out right in other words push that over a little bit to the side don't call that the end of all things the end of all things is what's taking place in your mind in my mind right now leading us in the wrong direction wade's preached it to you over and over about your two spirits about your your mind and where the controlling power is at and what it's doing see seven things and we like one there's no way like no don't we don't like two come on that's my whole point i ain't gonna argue with you i'm just gonna tell you we're already in the sixth one the minute she walked into the white house we were in the sixth one because the catholic people had already beat her there and i don't know whether she is or not i don't care i hope she's a christian that'd be the only thing that i could judge on anything or hope for her because i don't have anything against those people i've preached all the way down where we would wind up and what would be the prophet said on that fourth seal that said catholics and protestants coming together there's your war see church i'm not looking for something to take place if you understand what i'm talking about well brother dale i'm looking for this i'm looking for that and it hadn't taken place yet well at least the prophet said six of them have so that's of that part yeah but you're you're trying to scare us i can't scare you and i wouldn't tried if i could i've always told you parents i've told you from the pulpit don't scare your children with daddy with god being a booger bearer don't say god hates you doing this or that don't say it you're building a mental part of their mind that's that's going to hurt them later on when they need it huh don't do it whip them is anything wrong bible says be the child they won't die with them but don't try to scare them with a with a god that don't like it because here's one standing in front of you telling you i don't like it parents for you to try to scare i'm not trying to make you afraid i'm trying to get you to see we're here we're not having to wait to get here we are here the end of all things has come upon us the last thing would be the destruction of the world or the united states when nuclear which one you want to argue those things it'll be you know i just don't want to be there but i want to be ready against that day i'm looking at things in a positive attitude instead of a negative but did we say well we don't know because we you know there's a woman in the white house and everything when that woman walked in that situation there i i was looking at you and i was thinking how many chur how many of us church really see it and realize that when that woman walked into the white house it fulfilled the prophet's form of the word he said it he said president or vice president well why not say we're at the end because the word is now being fulfilled i knew i'd have trouble trying to bring this today because i've studied on it now for months trying to get a little point of where we can see church i'm not trying to get us to see that god is coming your prophet said i'm not saying god is coming he said i'm saying god is here what was he there yes you said well to him only well then when is it going to be to me and you when's the day coming when we can say i see what the prophet said he said there'd be cars i remember when that first started off and talking cars you know and they were trying back then because the volkswagen hadn't bugged out as much but there was more carrying than like the 40 ford uh old ford uh what was the 48 or which one of them was it was sloped over and and run all the way over they talked about it being the forward they talked about it being this then they come up talking about it being the volkswagen not realizing there was two more things that had already been prophesied would have to take place it would be more important than a volkswagen drove down the road without a steering wheel but would see women actually walk in or a woman walk in to the white house when i heard that i said thank you lord that's what your prophet said would take place that's thus saith the lord that's what the bible says go to revelation 17 now see i had all that wrote down i got a lot on it but what about revelation 17 of the old mother and the harley daughters and all of those things and you say well what if it is a woman or what if it's a catholic what does it matter that's the point that i'm going to end with come on musician i'm ending with this point what does it matter because the woman in the white house she's there she's vice president half of that that are there with her are catholics so the prophet has already spoken it's taking place or has taken place it's not to look for it [Music] it's to look at it and say thank you lord for telling us thank you for telling us showing us the truth let's stand together i'm not trying to scare nobody or nothing because ain't no need of trying to scare nothing it's to tell the truth like the truth is supposed to be told can we see where we're at by the word that has been brought to us by the prophet of this last day yeah i come out here one day and i told it or i told my wife and then i said you know one of these days they'll there'll be a bunch of people from athens that used to be here they went back and they're coming back well about that time old brother don ginn walked in the door i said come on come on how many more it just went one after the other until a lot of people came a lot of them went back they ain't gonna do it lot of them are backslidden and everything else but you see i believed that and i believe god spoke to me now i'm going to say this one about 40 years ago i stood in this pulpit and said the lord showed me that the biggest portion of the people of this message were going to die and go by the grave before the rapture and i said i did not say and it's dire as if we can find the table we have to dig a long time of course you ought to know it anyway i never said that they were going to miss it i said the biggest portion of the people of this message which to me meant born-again christians was going to die and go by the grave i didn't have no trouble standing up and saying it because i believe god told me he showed me from daniel 70 weeks we could pass the year 2026 and not break the word of god nor the bible he told me and i believe it you know what we're gaining on that right now you know and some of these other things that i've said are doing is there a lot of people dying and going by the grave because that was my point my point was one thing if we don't believe listen if we don't believe where we are at and what's taking place right now among us is the word of god being fulfilled then we're going to die and go by the grave because we have nothing positive to deal with well i just don't know don't know what the prophet said either a woman or the catholic church both of them is dire so don't come and argue with me but well it could have been the catholic church brother dale that he saw doing that i'm the one that's told you that he said a woman in the white house are the catholic church so he's he's right on both points because they're both there that makes it double to me you can argue all you want to about all these other things go ahead brother i'm sorry i've seen that course this is like let's see if anybody has an aide the older so find many people who can't understand why we are so happy and free we've crossed over jordan to canaan's pharaoh and this is like heaven to me oh this is like heaven to me this is [Music] in the name of jesus christ we lay our hands upon our brother he's had trouble with his back that's been hurting him so we just ask you to take it away from me from him in this the pain and devil of satan we're jury in the name of jesus christ we leave our brother and make all to be well we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen [Music] and this is like heaven to me oh when i get happy i sing and i shout the devil don't believe it i see but i'm filled with oh this is like heaven to me praise god this is like heaven to me man he's had these things before we've prayed and got taken away we believe he'll do it again so let's just thank god for it just believe it all right father our brother has what science would call a disease or a problem yeah we don't endure that we endure the devil that is causing it so we lay our hands there in commemoration of the word of god to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and we ask you now to just take away this problem whether they call it gout whatever you call we come in commit it to you and condemn the pain and the agony and the troubles and we love you and we thank you in the name of jesus christ and this is like heaven to me we find many people who can't understand why we are so happy [Music] in the name of jesus christ we put a finger on the forehead of this our sister in commemoration of believing thy word that by your stripes she's healed now take away all of these things that's bothering her with her throat in a different time we believe you in jesus name [Music] amen me oh this is like heaven to me praise god this is like heaven to me i'm crossed father in the name of jesus christ we give this prayer close to our sister or whatever she's asking for we believe that it's a finished product it's already done thank you lord [Music] let's pray one for another remember wade will be preaching to the lord willing tuesday and just pray for us we'll be going up and trying to do a little hunting and things and you know but we'll be back we won't be missing service because he's supposed to preach that sunday up there so we'll be tied up in services just as well it would be here but we all got to do is click on the button and everything works and that reminded me of what i wanted to say okay now i'm not one i haven't pushed anything on you uh since all this virus stuff started and trying to condemn you for not coming to church and you know and calling you a chicken for staying out or whatever you know i haven't done that because i leave each individual to an individual upon their bases what they're doing but i will ask you one thing are you staying up on the grounds of listening to the tapes my point is i'm not condemning you or not coming because that could be a human situation that's your fears you know over and afraid but now when you won't take because we'll make you the copy we'll do you we've done everything we'll do everything we can do for you to get the copy of the service and we just ask you to make sure you stay up by listening to those services now if you don't do it then you got a problem because it's not nobody making a way we're making a way for everything that you can do but if you don't stay up on the services you've got a problem you're showing you're the unbeliever not us now brother dale you want to be talking like that do you tell me that that i'm wrong tell me i'm wrong in what i'm saying if you don't listen to the services you miss the services we go anywhere i go anywhere or do anything first thing we do me and nanny we put that tape player on she's already heard most of but she sits down with him and we listen you know but i want to i want to stay up with what's being said i want to hear the word of god let's see it's up to you to decide whether or not you're what you're doing is wrong because if you're not listening you're wrong don't don't don't say well brother dale you shouldn't talk like that about me i've got well you got a problem with hooking up a paper player at home or or turning on your computer or something that you're doing that evening and sit down there and do it you're making an excuse you're doing what i'm saying while ago when the people were saying this woman is too ugly to be put in the white house so we don't have to worry about it you're making excuses you're making fun god put it in his word that these things would take place are we making light of his word when we will not receive what is being said that's all i'm asking you is just be ready yes because what are you going to do you say well we we can't get together well what are you going to do when the footman you know in the footnote what you're going to do when the horsemen get here what are you going to do when they tell you everything's closed you know what you're going to do you're going to have an excuse to stay at home i'm sorry father we just commit everything into your hands because we believe it and truly father we believe you that you've shown us that here we're here in the last days we're here at the last moments of time at firstly closing because the prophet said it would be there no one would be in the white house irregardless of whether it's a catholic church or a physical woman we've got both of them they're both there now so we got a double security double security of thy word we ask you now that you'd be with us go with everybody on the way home give everybody a safe journey remember these that are sick lord this brother ray montgomery there and sister rita we pray that you just be with him and bring him out of this thing because we believe you and we know that by your stripes we're healed have your way and commit we commit it all to you in jesus name amen you just missed oh this is like heaven to me praise god
