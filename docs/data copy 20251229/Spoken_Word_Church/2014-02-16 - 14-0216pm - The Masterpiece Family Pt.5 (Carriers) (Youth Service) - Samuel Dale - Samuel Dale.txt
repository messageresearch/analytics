lord forgive our sins because we want to be covered by your blood guide us now and keep us in jesus name amen okay john 12. now remember our thought is masterpiece family and we've been coming from isaiah and just not reading it but remember in isaiah 1 it says to whom is the arm of the lord revealed all right and the prophet when he gets into the sixth seal he's using that scripture he said the arm of the lord the word of the lord is revealed all right so if you believe i report i want to try to make a report today you know of what i believe and if it's the word of god then i expect him to honor that and to reveal it because i know and realize that i cannot the best i can do is uh stir up your mind of a way you know to help you and to understand but i know and realize that it takes the holy ghost to reveal all right so think on these things now and i would think a little bit today as we're trying to cover as i said i wanted to cover this in many different ways the prophet would speak from the masterpiece he's not able to shuck the many things that he covers and all to help us to see where we're at the day that we're living the hour that we're upon the earth and see i believe then the word of the lord is being revealed if we can see that to recognize our day in its message so look at the scripture we're talking about now in john 12 23 and jesus answered them saying the hours come that the son of man should be glorified now what's right what he goes straight to now and this is going to tell you how the son of man is going to be glorified right because that's what he's saying the hours come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except the corner of wheat fall into the ground and died abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life or life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him with my father father honor all right let's just stop right there because that's where our thought is at now we'll go to hosea 6 and we'll just read the first three verses come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he shall raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the mourning and he shall come forth unto us as the rain the latter and the former rain unto the earth you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we know that we were all and everybody was i was and everybody else was expecting us to be out of here by now and we talk about the 2000 years but remember hosea says there in the third day in the third day it would come forth a time all right now to not back up a lot but to review just a little as to what we're trying to bring on the masterpiece family and i believe that the old testament see the first masterpiece was adam and eve in the garden all right but then the next masterpiece family as you would call it was actually in jesus christ when he came forth to be as the old testament as we were covering this morning those prophets brought the word abraham isaac jacob joseph made a foundation and then the they were the patriarchs and then the prophets built the body and john the baptist being the last one to come to introduce the head and i hope you was following that this morning that he says those other prophets were only prophesying you know something to come but he wasn't prophesying of something to come right he wasn't saying there'll be a lamb come he was pointing right to him and saying behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world it was no longer prophecy it was an actual happening all right and i was covered this morning then that we're talking about down through the ages and how that john the baptist come to introduce to the messiah and the prophet in this last days come to introduce the word to you and i all right and he would be saying see not pointing or prophesying a lot of his message was prophecy and there are some things that are still prophecy like the rapture to come etc etc that hasn't taken place yet but a lot of it has taken place there and he said i'm not saying he's coming i'm saying he's here he wasn't that was what caught me when i began to read the prophet's message back there in the 60s and begin to hear about it is i i heard a man talking about something that was there i couldn't understand it sure but you know he didn't talk about a god up in heaven or or something to come we were good baptist you know i hope i'm saved maybe i'm saved i believe i'm saved but i don't really know where i'm saved or not but one of these days i'll find out they get over there that i'm saved you know you say well we didn't talk like that well probably didn't but that's what we meant you know that's what was doing because we were living just upon hopes or prophecy you know when brother branham was not doing it he was speaking personal he spoke of a god that lived where we spoke of a god that was or would be and you know he spoke of something that was real right there in his life and that was what caught me all right but now what i want us to do this afternoon is try to pick up a point and watch these places i'm saying using different ways of expressing it but making it the same goal starting off here winding up here you know in a great doings you know taking and going up each one is going that away and if you'll follow it all right now we know that they're in the scripture that we read where it says unless the corn of wheat die and fall into the ground that it'll abide alone all right we know that we're talking about jesus christ because he was the corn of wheat now remember as i said the other few weeks ago we just read corn of wheat well we're thinking about wheat and corn or maybe something but when you're reading that go back to the original and you find out because we already known that thought but see when you say corn of wheat it really means grain of wheat one grain one grain that's what it's really saying one grain of wheat all right because that's who he was he was the one grain of wheat he was the original seed all right now in doing that then you can see that the scripture is not it's playing around it's saying it right so that grain of wheat had to die go into the ground right man and come back again all right now it died one man one grain so just like when you're planting corn or wheat or whatever you're planting you don't plant one grain to be able to reap one grain that wouldn't be too profitable you know it wouldn't help you much so you plant one grain though and it produces mini grain but you know what each one of those grains is just like the original you know unless perversion is happening something wrong with it it comes forth just like the original but you got it in multiple form all right now remember the point even though the grain of wheat comes forth in a multiple form which is over into the bride of christ and she comes forth but just remember it's still one grain all right you know it's still one grain because that's the way god looks at it he doesn't look at it as scattered out bunch of grain you know and doing things he's looking at it as the original grain all right in doing that then that grain of wheat would be going into the ground at nicea you know down through the dark ages see it sprang up right here's jesus christ it came he was the grain of wheat he went into the ground come forth so that the churches could come all right then see in the bride of christ she started out on the dead pentecost a great masterpiece family a great thing on that day of pentecost on that book of acts all right but not long afterwards you see it dwindling down because what had spoken of him as i said this morning compound meaning come down to revelation the corner wheat that fall went into the ground it would have abide alone but it he went in the ground he come forth in a multiple form and a bride right so now she's going into the ground the church at nazi of rome he said well now brother dale i don't agree with you that the right will your prophets when it said it so you're going to argue with him i mean that the bride should've never went to nausea she messed up then he said well the real bride didn't well now you you got a problem there because you got the message to face but i've heard those doctrines and things and people say the real bride never done it well i solved that by a simple question of like uh where did we come from everybody sitting here come out of a denomination at one time or another or maybe was never any even was your own one but see that that goes to solve a lot of the problems i'll get back to that but we know that it was promised as we read in in hosea that after two days he would come forth again and it would be a former lighter rain you know a teaching rain harvest rain and it would be the same as we've already previously covered some of joel where it says you know i will restore the years of the cankerworm bomberworm locust caterpillar the prophet on the message of restoration of the bride tree if you read that message he covers that there were four great messengers took down the tree and they were the messengers of death that destroyed that and then when we come on over you can read it you know paragraph 40504 and go through and you can read down through it looking at it four messengers of death destroyed it the church started out beautiful it was a wonderful church in the book of acts you know god dealing with them and working among them but it wasn't long it started dwindling away and even there in the book of acts they had things already creeping in that was taking the real bride and deceiving her and then when you come to the restoration of the bride tree he says there's four messengers of death and they took off the bark the leaves uh the sap out of the tree the things and it went right down into the roots all right and then in the dark ages it laid there for all of that time kind of you know about a thousand years as it did then there was four messengers of life would come back to bring the tree back to the way it was supposed to be to fulfill joy which would one would restore the leaves one would restore the bark one would destroy the sap you know the life the different things and as it would be the prophet covers that see luther with the just shall live by faith would start off and what's god going to do now he's going to rebuild a masterpiece he's going to bring forth a church in the last days as a masterpiece all right and he starts with luther of the just shall live by faith and he brings that message see that's where we believe what luther taught her the truth now not the other things that he taught that the jews were to be taken out and be killed or whatever but remember he was not he was a church-age messenger but he was not a word prophet that was spoken of to to come forth but it was spoken of that he would come forth and he did because he was a messenger to the h and then wesley comes along and he starts on more of restoring and then azusa street comes along you know 1906 of the the pentecostals and they're restoring which was the baptism of the holy ghost but that's not the end of it because it would come forth then that they would have to be a messenger to bring the word back to the original condition now remember the original one seed that went into the ground was the lord jesus christ he was the son of man because we read there in the scripture you know when the son of man to be glorified all right then what are we looking for to come forth in the last days okay it's going to have to come back to the son of man all right and that was the first message i preached in 1969 is the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man and i believe that right i believe it's 10 i believe it a whole lot more now and but thinking about it see that one grain of wheat went into the ground and then it come forth into a bride in the book of acts and a thing but in a little bit it wasn't long till that same corn of wheat now the wheat corn wheat it went into the ground which jesus would be the same jesus that would be going into the ground again right where would he be in bright form that we're talking about this morning a body thou hast prepared me all right the bride of jesus christ has to provide him a body for him to live in all right he was happy to dwell in martin luther because of the great message that he was bringing others shall live by faith which is part of the word of god all right john wesley began to speak of sanctification a greater deeper depth and more understanding and that was wonderful because he was going to restore but you can't call that justification you don't speak of it being the son of man and that's why i've always said to you you go back and check it that you've got matthew mark luke and john writing of jesus's life and they speak of the son of man you know right who thou who the man satisfied i am he was constantly but even the great apostle paul he never mentioned son of man the writers there in the bible other than i'm saying now matthew mark luke and john but when it comes into the writings of the scriptures the great wonderful things are coming forth and i believe now this is brother dale right now okay i believe paul understood some about that son of man i believe that go to the great depth he was in the word but yet it was not the time for it to be spoken of it was not the hour for it to be done martin luther maybe had studied about the son of man because anybody read matthew mark luke john didn't know the word son of my hand is in there you know and they they would talk about that but yet it was not the hour to understand that uh sanctification the method is coming along and your presbyterians your baptists your your things see coming forth but it's not much said about that not saying they didn't read it or even talk about it but i'm just saying it was not the hour for that to be done all right then azusa street strikes with the gifts and the things and not a lot is said about the son of man probably through that one god it's not time but you go back and you pick up brother random and when he starts out immediately you know right in the first of his ministry in the 40s you know coming into the 50s he starts talking about the son of man and he started talking about the resurrection sign well that's what the son of man had see he went down he rose all right see then coming forth as his ministry progresses throughout he starts meets bringing more more about the son of man tying it together seeing it unveil it's like i was talking with some of them uh yesterday or day before one about it see brother random like in restoration of the bride tree this wonderful message he brings but yet he kind of seems to bring it up so far he talks about the bride now she'd be restored what she would be did she be the word made flesh because i believe that i i believe he knew that but he's not mentioning certain things that you see him later on as he begins to talk about it all right i believe he had progressive revelation now a lot of people don't like word progressive well i ain't got no sense figure out why i wouldn't like it to me progressive means that you're advancing right that's that's the best now if that ain't the definition for progressive i don't know what you you'd call it but i believe that it began to unfold unto him and he began to speak of and see the great things that he saw and like i said what i do is i take something here and i bring it up to here all right but you'll see it after a while that i take something here and i bring it up to here all right then i start and i bring it up and i'll bring it to here it keeps advancing in what i'm talking about you know because i was preaching these things back in the 70s all right but now it's progressing more and more and more of understanding and i believe that was what the bible is the way it's written and i believe that's the way brother adam was speaking all right and as he does then he coming forth explaining the word he's explaining what that corn of wheat is and he calls that corn of wheat in leadership he says that corn of wheat the bridegroom then he takes the life of that bridegroom and he keeps coming forth and it keeps unveiling all right then he begins to get into like masterpiece in 64. and he begins to talk about the stages he'd always spoke of it especially in like restoration of the bright tree he spoke of those four taking it down for bringing it back well see there's a lot of people in this message in the early days they they come up with a thought that they really thought they were smart and uh maybe they were and i was dumb but uh they said four is an antichrist number you remember that some of your older ones four's antichrist yeah that's all right the fourth restoration amen now see four's restoration see because four brings you back to the original that went into the ground all right that's restoration so you know uh i don't know i can't remember now where we have it we used to have a cross down here i don't know where it's there or not but you know like the prophet said one day he said the catholics don't have an option on the cross i mean we put up a cross in our house does it mean we're catholic you know no but listen the prophet is he gets into masterpiece he begins to talk about this masterpiece family and he begins to talk about luther bringing the joshua by faith wesley bringing sanctification pentecostals bringing the baptism of the holy ghost he said and then in the end time that was to come back to the original seed they went in the ground which would be the word and we were talking this morning that as john the baptist introduced the word which is jesus this prophet introduced the word which would be in you and i all right now as it's talking about it then you know what he went through he went through the the the little stalks coming up and he said see we've got wheat there growing and then he'd talk about how it would go into the next stage and he'd say that's sweet growing you know did he talk about it going into the next stage you know to the shuck and he'd say we got wheat growing and he'd say then you got to look down into that husk you know to shuck he said you can find this a little bitty specula he said that's the word as it begins to unfold or back toward the original seed all right then in doing it he shows it and i don't want you to forget this when that's talk when that two little shoots come out of the ground you can call that wheat but it doesn't look like the one that went into the ground but it's weed you don't plant corn and get a wheat you know when that was green that was original that's right all right right it don't come up brown comes up green then the little stalk comes up the little stalk doesn't come up brown it comes up green well you know what the two little especially saying corn because we're better more apt to talk about raising corn when it comes up to the stalk the stalk is green and even the um silks coming off of it you know we called it fodder in our days that was all of that the leaves they're green it doesn't die and the next one come forth as we look at it when you come around to the time and your corn is on there and it comes up to a to a shuck you say man i've got corn well you've got to wait until it comes in there and then but after a while you know it gets beautiful it's but you know what the shuck is still green right and you pull it off right then and boil it man you got something good to eat but you can't plant it right but until that stalk all of that has to remain green because life is there but then when the corn forms you don't cut the chalk down just because it's formed and you can take it off and eat it but you don't want to do that because you can't plant that but if you'll leave it there and that's the way we used to do brother howell back there was a farmer enough and some of you that we would go out and we would really cut the top out of it and leave the stalk and the ears standing on the you know costco we'd take the tops and feed them to the cattle or horses and uh you leave that for a long time because that stalk is still green it may not look too green but it still is but you don't go gather it to throw it in a barn until all of that stalk and everything is virtually dried up all right then you can take the corn put it in a barn and you can keep it and in the winter time you can take it and take it down and have cornmeal but if you do it too early what are you going to do you pull it too early you got corn yeah big old you know we just took ours and throw it over into a bin you throw it over in there and it still got green in it and uh and it longed to you got a rotten mess right it just doesn't do right so you got to wait until everything is dry and that's what i mean until and i believe the prophet is explaining it in the masterpiece until that corn is back to the original which would be capable of planting when we pulled it off the stalk to store it in the barn it was capable really of planting it because if it wasn't then it was rotten on you it had to dry and we'd leave it to way up in the wintertime because it didn't hurt nothing and we go out in november december or somewhere you know we gather it up put it in the barn then but you understand what i'm saying a lot of people think she just brought around the way he covered it that denomination he just dried up and died after nominated dried up and died well yes to me you got a problem because brother branham said what was the tape 58 right around and said the baptist has just now become a denomination remember that well i thought the baptist's become a nation about i mean a denomination about 200 years ago and you know as a whole a lot of it did but you better remember one thing as i said while ago the prophet will cover the minute was carriers of the life ain't no denomination with no carrier you don't know what you're talking about you're running a blabber mouth it ain't gonna work but listen if it wasn't a carrier where'd you come from brother dick where did you come from presbyterian right we come baptists some of you catholic bless god ain't nothing in that that's what i mean you're trying your best to make a doctor and it won't fit biblically nor will it fit naturally so the best thing to do is just read what brother branham says and believe it and believe what he's saying instead of trying to figure out well i just can't see that i was talking to two brothers out deer hunting one time and one of them he had got everything when he believed he's packed up ready to go and the other one said he didn't get nothing and all got his anointing and one of these days we're gonna get something and i said well brothers do y'all mind if i kind of stay in the between i said that's what i don't understand when he went that way one went that away i said all right with you if i just stay in the middle and i said that way i can follow it and and all and i said then i can quote brother branham and what i had done i had made a quote where brother brown said he met people with the holy ghost 50 years before him just exactly like the day of pentecost and both of them denied it preachers in this message they both said no that ain't right i said well you go tell him that it ain't right you know he's the one that said it but you see my point is there is a way to approach anything but if we approach it wrong we will automatically go in the wrong direction sure when martin luther brought the message there was a lot of people back there that literally died spiritually speaking but there was a lot of people like you know that wesley come from luther's message do you know your history a little you know that wesley was on his way to america to he was a missionary under the justified and he was coming to america and the moravians introduced to him the doctrine of sanctification he goes back home and he says lo i go to america to convert to heather and found out i needed to be converted see he didn't have any problem you can't people of this message don't want to talk about anything related to organization or denomination because they're scared to death but you know if it wouldn't for them right now taking care of us we'd done been having a lot of that's problems right i told them here to church one day i said i'm not a member of the national rifle association but i'm glad they got it the reason i'm not is they made me upset because he kept sending me bills that i didn't know you know i just called him up and don't take my name off i mean they were sarcastic about it and i had papers to prove you know i had done paid my dues for a long time and they were being sarcastic about it if you don't pay this i said well what did you just do me a favor take my name off your books but i'm saying if it wasn't for the national rifle association you didn't lost the rights of your guns so they're here to protect us you look after and you see the stalk standing there and you see an ear of corn starting to form if the stalk didn't stay there you can't hang your corn out in mid-air they don't have sky hooks right but the point of that is each one of those is green and stays green until the harvesting when it gets time to harvest then you can say everything's died and my way of saying it whatever you want to say about it but around said the baptist has just now become a denomination you know what they turned down this message that's right i believe that's when the methodists the baptists the presbyterian the pentecostals the catholics the oneness is the two this isn't a foreign assistant how many else when they turned down this message they were dying now there was a lot of people died down there a long time ago because it wouldn't have nothing to do with truth but they were good people that wanted to know truth and wanted to stay and you go talk to people there's good people out there that love the lord jesus christ you don't believe this message out well when are you going to get in right come on luther preach to joshua live by faith wesley stood on that and believed that and god brought him the message of sanctification there was a little line of truth coming down through all of it right they kept it alive whereas the majority of the world died and was gone you can't do that what are you going to do in a minute when we read it brother ryan said their denominations were carriers what about when he said the prophets were carrier what's he talking about that seems odd doesn't it but remember the stages each stage has to be there what was come through brother brown said in the rapture come up through luther was what made wesley what came up through wesley was what made pentecost what came up through pentecost is what makes the people of the last days and i didn't make these quotes brother brown said you pentecostals he said if you won't go in he said god will raise up baptist and methodist and take them in well i'm looking at them very few of you come through pentecost and probably out there on the internet that i'm talking to today very few of you come through pentecost you come from a methodist or a baptist or a presbyterian or some kind of eye anyway but church it's got life as long as it's a carrier you follow me amen the chutes coming up green when it moved on those didn't fall off see you want everybody to try to say oh if you don't believe this message you're going to die and go to hell all right let me quote brother branham i love to do that because it's true he said word rejectors go to hell i'll agree with that but don't make fun of nobody i don't make fun of no methodist baptist this man right across here what they believe you know what he's doing he's watching wade on statue of a perfect man and said man i've never seen it like that he said he thought he got everything he believed you know he didn't know there was a growth into things well okay there's good people in this world that are searching for truth but who's blinding him is what jesus said about the pharisees he said you stand in the door are you preachers he said you won't go in and said you won't let them go in do you see in this message you leave this church boy bless god you're out of it you've got to come to this church but when i say that you better get up and run because you better realize that there's some kind of big booger man got a hold of me to make me say it because it ain't done it with 40 something years but now listen a carrier is a person that carries is that simple that's webster all right now why would brother branham then talk about that he's bringing this up and he'd already spoken as i said restoration of bride tree and talk about how that it comes back to the original but then when he gets to masterpiece he starts talking about carriers carriers well can't you see that's what i was talking about the illustration of giving the stalk has to remain because it's a carrier the shock has to protect the corn to keep it from where dawn the son will kill it it's a carrier you know what brother branham said about it said masterpiece he said when the bride begins to say i and my father are one and these other things he says he said to shuck will pull away well all right let's start saying i and my father are one until we can believe it's it 40 years i've said it so i don't mind saying it again it's not when we realize what brother branham was is when we realize what we are because we can only do that by his message the people in luther's day could only realize that just shall live by faith because martin luther had brought the message so is it now what a greater honor could you give to a man than to tell him i'm depending upon what you had to say in believing that you know what he talked about in in the stages he talked about how that there were three women back there that were used and he talked about hagar you remember the concubine wife of abraham and he talked about sarah and he typed hagar's justification sarah sanctification and then he said then there was a mary he said the first two were by human relationship to bring forth a child but he said mary it was not so because mary said be it unto me according to thy word without any relationship to bring forth see well that's a beautiful thing that's wonderful but what about when he gets on over pull up let's go over and jump just a little pull up number eight if you can 97 98 the masterpiece save them to read all these i can scan down if you want them be glad let you have them but look what he says just like paul here this is paragraph 97 98 2. see not out with a shock 65 to 18. just like paul said here did not the seed of the of the free woman or the bond woman persecute the seed of the free one so does the seed of denomination persecute the genuine grain it's always got to be that way they'll not be heirs together and and i always say to you it's kind of funny to me why did he title that message that when did he title it the seed shall not be air with the shock when really it's to shuck that cannot be air with a seed right but yet he that wouldn't fit the way he explained it so he explained the seed is not air with a shot that's right why because a shot will go into their denomination the shot will dry up the stock will dry up et cetera and won't go in with the seed so he was exactly right but his oddity he said it that way once and so does the seat of the denomination persecute the genuine grain always got to be that way they'll not be ours together they're not associated together they're absolutely two different promises two different times two different people all together one is the bride the other one is the church no comparison at all with them now watch him but still they're not the seed that's promised to come neither was sarah neither neither was hagar neither sarah was or neither mary was the seed okay mary was mary was not the seed she was a carrier of the seat more than pentecostals probably was foaming at the mouth because they knew that he was typing mary as pentecost he does in masterpiece right you mean mary wasn't seed now what's he saying we heard him but what does he mean let me know what he said okay i agree with you you know what he said because he said what he meant but then what is it still what's the answer why would he say mary is not the seed because mary carried the seed right mary was not god the seed is the original seed which is the son of man which is the word mary was not god if you read masterpiece you've heard that over and over she was a carrier see how beautiful he's explaining it that's not throwing off on the carriers i got that wrote in here two or three times to make sure and explain it so i write down explain and when i do that that means i figure you don't understand what i'm trying to say so explain it all right mary was not god she carried god within her and she gave fourth birth right but she was not god god was in mary she was the carrier of the life and that's azusa street pentecost carrier of the life so that means there's got to be somebody now on earth to make manifest the seed original jesus made it manifest he was the corn of wheat that went into the ground he made it manifest he was the son of man i won't get there this afternoon but you know if i preached in 69 i sure got a whole lot more quotes now that the bride of jesus christ is the son of man he said no that can't be called brother brown was eight right but brother brown's in the body of christ over here remember this morning a little you know he's part of the body of christ in the end time i didn't say these things he did we must become the original grain that went into the ground but it's not going to be a rapture of a premature seed it's got to be back totally grand totally dried totally everything all the denominations got to die should it be that so look what he's saying no comparison but there's still a seed that's the promise but look what he says sarah neither neither was hagar neither was sarah or anita was mary was the seed mary was not the seed she was a carrier of the seed but she had nurtured brought forth out of her womb just like the shuck brought forth from its wound you see what he's what is don't die and rotten away and and do like we think brought forth out of the her womb just like the shuck brought forth from his wound the real seed but the shuck is not the seed it closes to cl it's closer to the seed it's hugged around it way back in the stalk the life is scattered all through the stalk the life is still in the stalk the thing and when it comes to the pollen it's gathered down closer but when it comes to the shuck it's right down here like the seed and forms it almost like the seed my wife will tell me when we're raising corn she says honey keep close check on it now cause them silks are turning any of you farmers enough to know what i mean you go out there and you got a beautiful ear looks beautiful but the telltale sign is right up in the top where the silks are sticking out wait till they turn oh you can get a little bit of corn but wait till they turn before you start trying to pull it looks good don't it formed it almost like the seed jesus told us what would be in the last days be so close it would deceive the very elected if possible but then the seed comes forth from there and the shook the life leaves the shuck the shuck is a carrier and that's just exactly what our denominations has been he didn't have any problems saying it a carrier luther wesley pentecostal now it's time for the seed to come forth he has no problem with calling mary and saying that she's not a seed well because she's not god i keep saying that because if you're reading the message that's what he's saying mary wasn't god she had god inside of her you and i are not god we're the children of god we're his offspring yet but inside of that is what you're talking about outside of here i'm still samuel dale until this is changed i don't have a body like under his glorious body i still got the stinking rotten one i'm born with but mary you read it all over and over and over mary's not the seed she's a carrier the denominations were carriers to carry the life forth a lot of people now i'm trying to say that where you'll understand a lot of the baptists when when i can go back there and and deal with that because i was there and you could start trying to tell some of them there was good people there that really loved the lord but then there was people there that would die hide born baptists and we gonna stay baptists don't even fellowship in guilds were they was well counting caroline road it was three but that's with all the regional baptist church out of that came forth pine grove and out of part of that came liberty all right there's people that will not go to any one of those churches beside their own old man there in pine grove he said i die don't you letting on them people come to my funeral and don't you take me to that church down there put me here that's the way we know what they were dead that's right right but there was good people there right there's still good people out there in them denominations they're really folks come on and i don't play games that make us ashamed of ourselves about their sincerity and do their doings in their love and their compassions and things that makes lula look ashamed of itself that's right but that thing of it is they can't see the word i told you what happened when i left the baptist church old man he was in his 80s he was just to fill in and he came and he asked me he said what's wrong sam because i told the church i was leaving he said you know what's what's the matter is anything wrong probably somebody cause problems or whatever i said no i said you ever heard of william branham this was 1958 and he was in his 80s so you know where he was at he said yes sam i've heard of william branham and he said i will not say one word against him he said there's other people i'd like for you to go talk to i said well bring him on be glad too but he said i won't say one thing against him why because he knew he knew the truth there's good people out there today you know the only difference in you and me and anybody else is the grace of almighty god that has been extended unto us to allow us to believe i mean are we some dna different you know you know you know what i mean are we some kind of something that born different how come it is just like one out of the family somewhere you know 13 of us then when one believed it see what brought you sister gail to where you are look at the grace of god that's been extended to you and i that allowed our eyes to be opened that we can see god's word i love those people out there i have no problems with them sometimes i could probably preach free or right over there to them in that baptist church then i can preach here i don't mind saying that because i look at faces and when i see you dried up like a bunch of prunes and me screaming my heart out trying to get you to see the truth or snoring right well why would brother brown speak of the mary just being a carrier and he would type mary as a zeus street which would really tie back to the original pentecost right so it's carriers carriers of the life see making the ability for the seed to be able to travel up through why would you want to cut down anything the way the people of this message preach today nobody got no hopes outside of this message when i hear them talk like that i think well they ain't got no hopes i'm honest i don't mind saying it because that's what i think when you think you're the only one and you got it all just remember brother dale will tell you you ain't got it all because he ain't got it all day none of us got it all but i believe around the world the bride of jesus christ has the ministry of jesus christ being made manifest we just got a little part let's just manifest our part just to be that part of it but see sarah wasn't the seed mary wasn't the seed they were carriers well all i want to know is now then when he gets over to run this number one make sure you read it number eight a which is the seat shall not be aired with the shock 65 429 now this is los angeles california not in jeffersonville so paragraph 81 what does he say now that same low goss has a part he has got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring the word to its full manifestation what which the prophets was carriers to the seed and the church denominations has been carriers to the seed and notice quickly but like the shuck hugs holds the seed now then it leaves her man stood here and i had tried my best to show him down at lula when he said luther was false wesley's fault pentecost was false i said brother branham brought it and showed what they they were the carriers they were the the bride of that time he'd come right on up here and just stood right here and preached that nun and he said pentecost and it was just false well there was no need of me tackling him after church and telling him again if he didn't hear it the first time he wasn't going to hear it the second time but i didn't agree with him you know why i don't agree with him and you've got to agree with this you come out of something god allowed what you came out of to be a carrier even if it's coming out of the churches in this message they were just carriers there's wonderful people in this message love the lord jesus wonderful but yet they're afraid to move they're afraid to venture out be afraid to listen to the truth freddie might get confused then there's a whole bunch of garbage kansas just trying their best to confuse everybody i've asked you to read masterpiece and see not already show i want you to tell me how many times brother brown mentions about matthew 24 24. and he typed it exactly to azusa street pentecost which would type exactly to the people of this message what is matthew 24 24 it just sees the very elective as possible ain't no baptist method this presbyterian catholic pentecostals gonna deceive you and i but the ones are the garbage cans in this message that's got their own ideas of the two souls two lords sevens under virtue of perusias jesus wouldn't gone to the river jordan any kind of doctrine they're just all kind of doctrines of the message blinded in the eyes of the poor people because they can't defend themselves i cried when i went to the philippines they didn't have the ability to argue with somebody they were just beginning to get the books and the tapes and people were going over there preaching false doctrine saying brother branham said well how could they argue with him he's blind in them that's matthew 24 24. it's got to be right up there against that seed all right mary had in her wound the seed inside of her all right now so you and i must hear the word correctly planted and have that word in our womb before we can talk about being the word we can't talk about being the word until we give birth to it just because we got it in books and tapes and can carry it we're just another carrier right and remember logging with carriers that's not the original seed oh brother dale i love to carry this message i do too but i want to give birth to this message what i can in my own life do you know that brother branham said that mary had a virgin mind and a virgin womb is that right now mary had a virgin mind and a virgin wound natural physical couldn't be just any woman who had to be a virgin now but she also had to have the virgin mind it wasn't for any girl and brother randall said she heard the word from her mother and she heard it many days in the temple that a virgin shall conceive when the angel come to mary he didn't say mary i want you to know this is isaiah i died whatever what is it 9-6 or something well they'd always get that wrong he just simply told her what he come for she had an ability to believe god which was a virgin mind that had not been polluted by the pharisees and the sadducees of what the messiah was to be she believed that it could take place she had a virgin mind and a virgin wound but what if she had a virgin mind with no virgin wound they couldn't have brought christ come on they had to have both of them come on spoken words original seed what was it virgin mind well virgin womb for the baby virgin mind wound right um w-o-m-b to be able to come down through get about 16 18 inches below her head and into her heart and she said be it unto me according to thy word no sign no sensations no nothing she believed it she's our representation well brother dad if i could see signs and wondered i believe it right in the devil's traps what it's like brother now we're talking well ago in the office and brother branham would say he said it's more been done in one service in his ministry than was done in the book of acts right he said that not greater he said just more done why i would like for you to do it sometimes to take the book of acts and read it and write down one miracle two miracles three miracles four miracles you know what i mean write down every miracle that took place and over the 30-something years or about 30 years it was covered by the book of acts you'd have a miracle taking place for about every three months or probably less come on i know it's not written i know the bible is not read whatever took place i believe that they were miracles and every service well brother brown said more done in one service than was done in the book of acts he'd stand there and there'd be 20 people healed that's greater than the whole book of acts because it's probably not 20 people in the book of acts and its recorded was healed right come on read the book of acts and see how many miracles and write it down and then divide it by 30 years but i've told you now i'm saying i believe miracles happen in every service i don't even think martin when it come up to him about the fourth church age that he wasn't satisfied with miracles happened in every service but you see we belittle it to the fact that we don't think we see anything going on you know why me talking okay is we don't first have a virgin mind for to receive and realize the word of god and what it is we've got denominational minds and luca eight minds you know what i mean by that don't you somebody's idea well don't you think it's this way but when are we going to start saying no no he said no that ain't right but you know what we well a little brother my sister and that's your way of seeing it i guess you might no no why not just say you ain't right if we are the original seed brotherhood said i'll be glad paul said to look them in the eye and say you're not saying what paul said you do that with a preacher sometime i know what i mean but i've seen y'all sometimes do that we had a brother came through here preaching one time and he kind of got a little offline and when he got outside i just wouldn't hear i was somewhere else at that service and you know preaching with somebody else i guess and some of the people begin to say that ain't right well he hadn't desired to come back because it wasn't me telling them he was wrong it was you telling them they're wrong right like i said the other day a good way to stop a gossiper somebody comes to you and said i'll tell you something now but we need to pray well let's pray first and the person comes said we need to pray for this okay stop it right now get out on your knees three hours later what was you saying it ain't going to happen right so what do you do hey are you willing to go to brother collie and face that that you said about him well now i i don't wanna i don't know to shut up because you're scared you don't have the truth i've had to come to some of you people here right and talk to you about things why because i found out the truth i'm not against you i'm against them things that well let's just let's we're all just we're all good brothers and sisters well that's wonderful that's what i've just got to explaining i don't have anything against the baptist the messages the presbyterian the branham ice the problem is in lula we say we are the original seed well you can mix up a lot of things but what is it uh k or which one is it which ones you want it won't mix mustard mustard won't make some nothing but of course you know that brother dale you're hateful well good i'm glad you found that out but did i tell you the truth come on like i say i'm the only one in the building that's supposed to be able to meddle in other people's business right and i'll i'll open up the can of beans how many of you find me meddling in other people's business how many of you do i come and talk to you about other people well i'd follow the example we're talking about we're the original seed the original seed is supposed to be back like it was in the original trying to get to an end it is the rising of the sun that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh it was flesh in that day by the sun the groom talk about jesus right it's flesh today by the bride and you know what he covers then he said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted and whosoever sins you retain to them they're retained he's not a catholic church has got a way where they want to do that but said if you want to do it that way we got water over here you know a good repentance and a good thing settles a lot of things but you see why he calls mary a carrier but you know i'm having to stop because but somebody has got to be the seed it's not a choice it's not a thing it means god said it and it's got to come to pass somebody is going to be back to the original seed we've got the opportunity to be able to believe it and work on making it manifest but what if he was in the church where he well now let's keep it simple now it was real simple now we can't venture out on these deep things because we we might get confused no honey you're already confused brother brown said one day he said i'm not trying to preach this as a doctrine i think it's on predestination he said i'm preaching it try to straighten out doctor what about it mary wasn't the seed why because she wasn't god will you go with that i don't mean you'd holler amen i just mean will you accept that little thought that the prophet is bringing that mary was not the seed she was a carrier of it now he never meant and never did he ever say that pentecost was false a sister street he said it was the move of god never did he say wesley was false he was a move of god luther he never said it was false he said the move of god you see somebody's got to bring forth the original seat we've had the prophet to introduce us to the word right but when are we going to believe that we are the word that's right well that's just hard to believe it's hard to believe the economy is like it is but we keep on going it's going to get bad we got that promise right but it should be a whole lot easier to believe that god's trying his best to make himself manifest in a group of people now here's my final thought somebody has got to make manifest the original seed now come on brother branham said i am not the son of man he said i am a son of man he said the prophets were a son of man but he said jesus christ was decent of me well now we'll get on down to it eventually we wrote around said the bride of jesus christ is the son of man well somebody's got to do that that's right why can't we believe we're part of it and until we do we're going to keep dying but somebody's going to say i and my father are one it won't be quotes running off at the mountain let's stand together it'll be because they have become what god has said they are but you see we look at it on the bases if i could see great things happening then i would believe it you'll never see it but see then i try my best to express something in words for us to understand and then people think well brother dale don't believe in signs and wonders there's nobody in this building believes in signs and wonders any more than this man that you're looking at i have had god to speak to me i have seen things that other people that don't even talk about the spirit of it but i'm also straight that some of the people around here to two different occasions has tried their best to make me a prophet in the five-fold ministry and i stood in this pulpit and rebuked it what do you think would do that to most preachers they think they think i'm a prophet i guess i must be a prophet i know i'm not i'm a member of the body of christ i don't know the office of a prophet i know what a prophet's office is i studied those offices to know the greatest office i could be in is to be a minister in the body of jesus christ to try to bring the word not to build it on any emotion or any sensation build it on the word signs will always follow the word right what do we got boys i think that's good thank god for these kids some of you might not understand but every third third sunday around here we have kids to come forth and play sing and do the things and we really appreciate them they do a wonderful job they're well in training to take over one day right go ahead boys him a little more today don't mom a little one brought into the world tomorrow we can play for a miracle to come tonight ain't nothing worrying about it remember how god wants to do it but we give you this all right the best thing you do is tape it right under there so you're gonna have that anybody said anything ask danny over there he said you see my watch prank log he had one there all through the years of all of his surgeries and things so just put it right in there and tape it to it don't worry about it they give you a bath you ain't gonna wash the anointing off right because we believe it all right is that what you hear about yeah yes my brother's wife is very sick she had an operation you'll have to tell me i have a hard hearing okay and singing the music rings in my ears can you send her a prayer clock he thinks you take it to believe it all right let's believe then
