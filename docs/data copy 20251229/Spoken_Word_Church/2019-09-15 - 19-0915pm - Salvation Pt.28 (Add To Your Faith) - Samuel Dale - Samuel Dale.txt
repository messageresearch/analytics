turning you scripture then we'll come back to Peter but I want to read a scripture in Habakkuk Ibaka it'll be 2 and 2 and verse 4 in Ibaka - just pick up the thought to where we can continue on like we were this morning you know the new predator Lord would bless remember now the fellowship meeting will be at brother Homer Longoria's on this coming Saturday 3:30 so remember that Wade in June or coming back sometime probably this afternoon after the evening service and just remember them brother Bob and brother Lewis they had them on video while ago whenever we're going at it so they're going to be probably late getting in tonight so you just remember these that are traveling and everything - Lord would be with each one amen Habakkuk - father we thank you for this day and thank you for the love that you have been so gracious to extend to each and every one of us that you'd give us an opportunity to be able to just study your word that we'd have a chance to be able to hear from heaven and be able to walk in the light of the grace of the love that has been given unto us in this last days and Lord knowing that our word is true and that we walk in your life forgive our sins bless those that are traveling this afternoon and today toward and just give them a safe journey home and let us all walk in your light we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen now I want you to just think on this and then we'll get back to it the way the scripture is spoken now in Romans 1 in 17 it says the just shall live by faith Galatians 3 and 11 says the just shall live by faith and Hebrews 10 and 38 it says the just shall live by faith but I want you to notice what it says here in Habakkuk behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith he's always talking about the faith the faith now it says by his faith Amen let's let's just you may be seated just remember Lord willing we'll be trying to if we can to finish up a little bit by this coming Wednesday on the the topics and things that we've been on about statue of perfect man so pray that the Lord would bless and give us the right understanding to be able to present it okay now we talked this morning we studied about the fact of knowing that if you're born again you're born again by faith because that's the only way the Prophet would tell us we are born again he said faith have faith statue of a perfect man how faith and be born again all right so then the the faith at the bottom of the pyramid as we see it is the new birth okay now that new birth is what it was has been within ever born again believer down through every age in time ever person who is born or was born again or is born again it's born again the same way and it's born again by faith by faith in God and believing all right accepting it and and you know realizing that he has paid the price done the work but unfinished everything up and then we can walk into the light of his love and see and as I said we've read we quoted from Romans Galatians and Hebrews that we know the just shall live by faith all right now that is not your faith your faith is really your faithfulness to believe God okay now follow the point your faith is your point of you believing God accepting him for what he has done for you and believing him in having faith in God all right now that's a wonderful thing but that will not save you it takes his faith to save you that's why I read hypocrisy for then the just shall live by his faith all right so it takes his faith to bring the new birth into being and his faith transmitted into you all right now it makes you and as we'll bring it back in a minute and go over it again it makes his faith living in you in a new birth all right now be in that new birth then it puts his faith in you alright now that's just not your faithfulness men it's by putting his faith in you then the just shall live by faith but it's living by his faith alright now when we finish the message we'll try to get back to that point in a minute you'll see the what I'm talking about that the just shall live by his faith when it becomes your faith then you got something to talk about okay so now let's hold that point the thought that we were trying to bring this morning to see what our point of the message and realizing you know the thing all right what did we talk about this morning the Prophet said the message paradox the new birth is a mystery he said just like the natural birth is a mystery the new birth is a mystery because we do not have it or keep it in line he said we belittle it you remember we belittled a new bird why because we don't count it to be what it really is it has to be him coming and living in us that gives us a new birth all right now that's his faith coming in to you to give a birth to the word or the revelation the and doing all right now what was our point this morning then all the virtues in the statue of a perfect man all right those virtues in the statue of a perfect man all are added to your faith yeah we'll get back to that and read it in a minute in the scripture that add to your faith all right now remember it's not just your faithfulness to believe God if something else has went beyond our faithfulness our confession we must do that we must confess him as our Savior we must believe him as our Savior we must walk in that and that is our faithfulness in ourselves you know are human beings of of believing God and accepting what God has done for us and giving us the new birth all right but then when here's when my faith if I can can hold on long enough see then God can come to that faith and quicken that faith and make it the alive word right and see then it becomes not his faith we'll get to back to this in a minute it becomes our faith you say yeah but you just twisted it around I said it the way I wanted to to see I we've got to have something that where he can come and live in us right that gives us a new birth but see you say well then it's his faith in me that's true that's exactly right is here faith living in you but then see we need for it to become our faith and not just our faithfulness to believe him we need for it to become us alright think on that now as we'll get back to the point now what was we talking about all the virtues are of the same material faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you don't know it's the same material you don't have something that a prophet said statue of a perfect man he said you can't have it to her that you tried to vulcanize a piece of rubber to a piece of metal he said it can't be see it's got to be the same all right so then each one of those virtues now watch what I'm saying if it was something different you would have a problem because you'd be trying to add it to the other and you couldn't say well add to your faith virtue we'll see don't try to make that something different make it the same material that may not be a good weight for you to understand but it's the best I can do to think about it that it's the same material all right see then if it's the same material then it will help us to be able maybe the Lord Wednesday to be able to comprehend how to that these virtues come and live in us in the correct way and give us a right understanding all right see then the new birth brings your soul to eternal life all right if your new birth which is the birth of the word the words you've took you held it you know and God has made it alive he's quickened it all right then as doing that then we know that it has to be the same and I want to emphasize this that the new birth is I've expressed to you over and over and over it can't be one thing in one age and something else in another age right if it is then you've changed somewhere the new birth is the new birth in each age probably even preached a message our whole thing gonna on the Holy Ghost in each age all right see the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in each age making the word that you've heard in that age come alive what not think simple now if that be true that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the word being made alive right thing then and that everybody has the same new birth you're not looking for different things in different ages and see you look at it and that's I know how the human mind works and in all but mine don't work too awfully good but see if people want to try to make well Luther them just had this Western em just had this and these people had this for today didn't have this they don't get tied up into those things you would be belittling the Holy Ghost in whatever age you would put it by letting it not be of the same value the new birth is the new birth what is the new work justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth all right we must go through those three processes to have the new birth all right now so if it is right that each age has that new birth right then it would be a very simple matter to understand you know what has taken place in mankind those no matter what age it is God had to do the same thing he had to come down justify sanctify and fill the individual see I know the mind of people in how they cite yo but looking with them they just had justification their justification was the baptism of the holy ghost what else you going to make it are you prophets wrong when he said the Holy Ghost in each age you see what you're doing with it you're you're tiring it dying are belittling it to her that you're making it something that it's not and not thinking about how simple it is know how simple it is do you realize that if you want if you're gonna try to believe that that we must all go through justification st. encasing the baptism of Holy Ghost to have the new birth now I believe that and that's where I teach it I believe that's where the Prophet taught him that's why I teach that way because I believe it's what he said all right now if that's true look how simple it is see when I read it like I said it's more than reading that quote from the Prophet that the the new birth that you're born again by faith that's the new birth you say yeah but I didn't get no revelation I don't remember when I got a revelation I just was there this happen to me well don't do away with this happening to me all right don't think that I'm trying to do away with anything I'm trying to put it in order now you're gonna have to talk to the Lord about this cause it's between you and him not me I believe it if every new birth is justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost then look how simple it is come down offered you eternal life right justification starting y'all sanctification to cleanse you set your side and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you went through that now listen we went through those things and you know us Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc we taught nothing about justification sanctification the baptismal old ago we never talked three works of grace are three stages of grace we just believed it we accepted it it was just a if it was that at least the Pentecostals was believing of justification sanctification the baptism an old ago and I don't mean them all I don't mean everything but the biggest portion of your Pentecostals believed in three stages of grace now am i right you older ones you that come through Pentecost at least some form or other you went through those talking about it nothing else all right let's see it was three things that happened but you didn't call the justification Saint case in the baptism home goes all the time what do you call it an experience with God well Arad God come down and called you right the no man can come to garden let's God Carlson right all right now if nobody can come let's go ecology what look how simple it is there's your revelation that's what I've drove that hard beaten is hammering it the faith that you can't be saved without faith you can't be saved without a revelation will re-enter got it now no revelation you come to the Lord didn't you you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior didn't you well would that not be faith would that not be what I've been talking about a revelation then you realize that hey yeah you know I need to quit this I need to quit that I mean we did at least have enough badness about us to to be able to preach a little bit about those things to give up some of the things I mean you know we got delivered you know what delivered you the revelation that Jesus Christ had cleanse your soul now I'm trying to get you to see what I drove at it and it's what seemed like the blank all right to get you to see what a revelation really is then you're not having to say well what book do I need to read to get a revelation of the new birth well I showed you this morning to book your rig you're just read the Bible that's a good place to start and your prophet said read your Bible and pray alright so you don't realize you went through stages you know in other words I say okay come up and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior well so you come up and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that's a revelation you're accepting the fact that he died for you there's a revelation to you then you were going through life and you realize hey I don't need to be doing these things somebody maybe preaches on it or something I said I mean you I don't need to be doing these things I need to quit this drinking smoking so it's you know well that's a revelation to you do you see the simplicity that I'm trying to make it and then you say well the baptism of the holy ghost Laura you believed it accepted it God accepted you and gay he's a baptismal oligos that's a revelation of Jesus Christ do you understand that that's what I'm trying to explain that's a revelation you're looking for something that you've walked through because I believe that I've always told you what was it this morning how's the canoe yes right through the baptism of the Holy Ghost just in one little message 3,000 outside right to the baptism of the Holy Ghost just by hearing a message but the disciples went three and 1/2 years right now do you understand what I'm saying some people go through real quick some people that takes a longer time I don't know what to express the wording of it but it takes a longer time I was two years in after coming into the message before I accepted anything to be called the baptism of the Holy Ghost well you believe the message you've done this is doing that you've baptized correctly what Oh because I knew that we we wasn't talking about what this prophet was talking about he said what's wrong brother Dale what what's your opinion of why that we're here 50 years after the prophets come what's your opinion you and me so you're not seeing what I'm talking about on the point what caught me in this message one thing was a man that was so honest that he'd tell his own stories of his life of the things that he'd done wrong you didn't get preachers to admit that they want to tell how good there was but I mean he didn't mind telling you how you done this and how you done that and things was wrong and he he had to repent here to do that was number one but number two was a man talking about a living God he was talking about something alive he wasn't talking about over yonder we're gonna get to heaven what's what we badness one day we'll get to heaven if we doing do it Methodists if we if we if we were okay if we don't we'll just jump up and down from justification sanctification and somewhere in there maybe we can get cleanse one day and if we happen to help fall rot and die we might go to heaven prophet never talked like that he talked of a reality of eternal life right here that was a wonderful thing to me I'm not looking for something to come if I never can quote anything else let me quote a one time brother unsaid and quote it for myself I'm not looking for the coming of the Lord I've preached it to you for 50 years the new birth the Lord started his descending he started all the things he was doing when he come into you and a new birth you were on your way to heaven and didn't realize it everything was settled he turned a life had already begin here we Baptist will I hope them safe maybe I'm saved I don't know I'm but you know I'll hope so I feel like it sometimes sometimes I don't feel like it too good you saw I didn't talk like that well I hate to call you liar so many times but that's alright I'll just do it one more cuz I know the human mind and how we work we all come to basically some form of something like that looking for something way out in hope in one of these days to get to that place that prophet never talked like that when I'm listening to him I'm listening to him and it sounds like to me and my understanding it sounds like that we're up in heaven already and what's closer can you get to heaven than have an eternal life in your soul right well that's what you owe if you've got any turn a life in your soul there's no way to die there's no way to be lost I like the way brother Moe had a say in things and it don't sound good but it made a good point he said you can't sin enough to be lost if you're born again then or something you probably remember him saying that but it was just the truth you can't be lost if you're born again now here comes the point you might not be born again now that might be the whole case but that ain't got nothing to do with the statement of the truth of what it was think you said yeah but you're not gonna stand out to be in a Christian well now you own all evening to stay where the Prophet said we sin every day unless you want to say of him saying you backslide every day well you're throwing off on the Prophet now he's the one that said it and my Thor novel him no I'm saying what he said because that was the honesty of the man that caught me the basics of the Bible and the things I had a decent understanding maybe you don't understand what I mean would rather moat said if you just could you know knew much about a prophet then maybe we could talk on these things if brother Branham was a prophet I said look don't tell me about the things you saw he said I've seen the sick healed the dead raised the thing I said don't tell me that cuz I wasn't there but I said tell me what the man taught in the Bible I'll know whether or not he was a prophet by the Bible because at least had that much understanding you know the story oven they don't like me telling the things would forget it when I read the Bible the first time and I really read it on this basis from will be a Christian I need to know the word that was the places that took it oh and I started reading I come to Malachi for I told my wife I said according to my understanding what I'm reading here that in the end town there's gonna be two prophets come we'll see I hit Malachi 3 Malachi 4 well they're gonna know where to straighten it out when brother Modi said brother Brad was a prophet I said word that Aetna Volvo see we've had this we didn't take too much on to being having prophets know it except a teacher occasionally we'd accept a pastor and an evangelist but we didn't deal with possible to prophets but they didn't exist to us madness so when he said that I said where's it at in the word and he told me Malachi for well you know what I've said I said to him I said all right we get this from Ellicott three I won't know about Malachi 4 or excuse I went through medical 4x they don't know about Malachi 3 he said that's John the Baptist okay so we got that stripe see I run into somebody they knew a little bit about the Bible he says that's Malachi 3 it's John the Baptist and he took me through the scripture look 117 or desert filming through that you know I had read those things and studied them and I knew what the Bible said about those time I'm just saying that to you was you looking for a prophet to God in your understanding of the Bible was you looking for a prophet to come I didn't know what I was looking for I just knew that if I will said it well then when I saw God when I was 11 years old from that day I will own I wanted to see that God and when I heard this man starting preaching there was that man that was said that builded talking to me through a man's message that he was bringing I wasn't looking for that God anymore I could see him in my hand because at least there's one thing about it he talked about a God I could I could kind of so say I told you about it I've told some women and then I was a deacon 23 years old you know I told one God one day about some things and that God had spoke to them about and that's over deacon and he said you need to go to Pentecostal turn well see I didn't know what he was telling me the truth well I didn't know where knowing he was telling me the truth I never did get to the Pentecostal church I come right on to this message uh-huh now Church listen all those virtues are of the same material it's all the revealed word it's the word made alive now in doing that and it being that word made alive to you and I then think about what it says so go ahead a few well brothers and pull up 2nd Peter 1 because I want you to follow a line Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith now how long did we dwell on that like precious faith like precious faith means the same faith that recruiter alight precious faith means the same faith so now everybody's got the same new birth never new birth is a sign it's like precious faith come on man with us through the righteousness of God intersect Grace and peace and multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God in Jesus or save according had his divine power hath given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue or by our given unto us exceeding exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the what divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust the new birth gives you his divine nature it's the same like precious faith it's the same faith come on why don't we listen to brother Branham he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost then my name is quote there's a harbor to be closed he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you now have within you is the same baptism when the Holy Ghost that walked on the shores of Galilee the same Holy Ghost you have living in you is the same Holy Ghost he said that was in the early church see that's what we don't want to believe that there's something within our human abilities and it cuts off when that is stated why the Bible says it's one faith one Lord one baptism one God and Father of us all and in you all right to look those of like precious faith no words the same faith so ever born-again believer has the same new birth the same faith the same revealed word and each one of them had justification sanctification the baptism with the Holy Ghost which is the three stages and each one is a revelation in that stage I remember when God took the world from me I remember when I come to the Lord but you see that's why I know all of these things they said brother Brian said don't don't you know go back to somebody and try to get them to come to the church or don't come to the Lord I've told you about it my sister she came to me in the church hour one night in a revival with heaven and I guess was opened was already married yeah you know she said Samuel said you need to go to the Lord get to the Lord and said now you know JC which was her husband he got killed in a car wreck you know JC said he was lost now but said he won't never be saved that he is lost well you know what I thought more of his life and doing because I lived with him day by day sure he had his problems but I know she had more problems than he had problems so she wouldn't want it needed to be coming talking to me I've told you about the Deacons coming to my house to try to get me to come to the Lord and get saved and I told him I said look I'm living a better life than your Deacon board is living and they certainly didn't want me to tell us stories of all the things I knew let's see how serious but one day something struck within my heart and said you're letting the church get in your way when blood around them said that years later and I heard him I knew exactly what he said we let the church get in our way Oh God that's exactly what I'd done I'll let the church keep me from coming to you and I was already coming up toward this message time by the end you know getting close to coming into the message you see that's why I know what the new birth is I don't confess my new birth is just I walked up and shook the preacher at hand my new birth I can put it right through the Bible from where I started in in my whole Christian journey then walk right down to my Christian journey right out to where I am now and know that God is real I've met that God and I'm not talking about brother Brandon being that God I'm talking about run around and brought me to that God he's not that God but he brought me to God I don't care what you tell me he done or is you know or whatever you you can come up with all these tales all you want to I'm gonna tell you to get on leave me alone because the man brought me to God thank God for that and I can honor him on that basis and say I don't believe all these stories then and about it because I know what he done he was a human mortal that made human mistakes right when I was admit to this much he was the closest thing that we'll ever see the guard while in this journey of life I will admit to that because that's what I'm trying to tell you about trying to get you to see about well God is real and then he's give everybody the new birth that won't sit and receives it it's far you well how do I accept it what I do just start praying just ask God to forgive you just asking to accept you you've accepted him say Lord I've accepted you as my sniper now you accept me don't what he's saying when I got here I throw all that away look listen now let's get to the one point for this afternoon if it's true that everyone's faith is the same then everyone would have to go through justification same case in the baptism with Holy Ghost to get worth in a hat now if that's not true I want somebody to tell me illness I won't know a shortcut you know what I mean I want to know a shortcut to this thing if I can find one but I ain't gonna find no shortcut it's all the same everybody's responsible to sign make your calling and election sure right search out God for yourself you'll find out he's been searching for you the whole time right but listen see then if it's true then as we were reading coming down we didn't get all the way down but that's ok if you will pull that up brothers and we'll go over to verse eight and get started try to get get through like this giving all diligence verse 5 bruh add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and a knowledge temperance and to temperance patience patience godliness for these things be in you and abound they make you neither something neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ have you ever read to not first and you put it on that brothers and get the ninth verse have you ever read to not first you know what it says but he that lacketh these things it's blind and cannot see afar off okay now watch the point if you're born again hey they're getting it we hit lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and that's forgotten that he was purged from his old sins now remember the point though if you have the faith the light precious faith the born-again experience you can never be lost so it's not saying what we're reading we read that for what we think but he that lacketh these things is blind how could you have the things how could Peter be saying of light precious faith and divine nature and adding these things to your faith virtue or knowledge temperance how could he be seeing saying that and then say what we think he said we think he said we can be lost that's not what he's saying it's impossible to be lost if you're truly born again so why don't you read it correctly he that lacketh these things is blind if I'm born again and all the half of us faith I'm still pretty blind so are you because you don't have eyes to see he's healing don't my huh we want to read it one way instead of reading it the correct way but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and that's forgotten that he was purged from his old fence now come on if you have one virtue I know this is carnal but I'll give you the pulpit to explain that Scripture if you'll just give me the opportunity to ask you a couple of questions that's all I ask in return all I asked is if you have the divine nature if you have the like precious faith and Peter had it and then he turns around and tells us add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patient alright or if these things be in you and abound heap up you know they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ if these virtues are in you there's no way you could be lost I don't get the scripture but he that lacketh these things if I have one virtue I don't like these virtues I have one you say you sure are carnal you explain it he can't be saying that you can be lost you can't be lost it's just telling you he that lacketh these things is blind if I don't have some of these things I'm blind but if I have one that's all I need right if I have the new birth I can never be lost so he's not talking about me but if I lack all of these things don't have any of these things I am blind cannot see afar off and right but if I have one of them just to do path oh you thought about something that ain't bad this folk I think that old once saved always say thing they brother branham said if he's truly one saved he's in your face right come on let's quote him he that lacketh east thing if you like every one of them yes you're lost you can't see afar off but if you got one of them and that's who the man is talking to up here he's talking to the church or for the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure make sure you're saved now you can be upset with me all you want to about me hollering and screaming and repeating myself to you and you say well he just turned down mind you my experience that I had he's he's taken away my my hopes that I had with a much hopes if it's just fit if it's just built on something flim-flam Z and your prophet would call it that if it's built on any thing that you can say you've done if we put our salvation on anything we've done or didn't do where has he got anything to do with it do you understand what I'm saying here if you don't have these things sure you're totally lost cannot see afar off and forgotten that you was all purged or forgotten that you had a rechristening journey aren't you got justified or you gotta yell but he that lacketh but if I have one of them I don't like them buy of the new birth I can't be lost he's talking about salvation to a Baptist you talking about eternal security when I heard that prophet explained eternal security I wasn't a Baptist no longer I didn't have them ideas in my mind I had what he's saying he's telling me hey if you're truly born again you can never be lost well if you got one born in one thing if you've got what the new birth that's not talking about you now let's get down to the serious part of it now back up now brothers verse five come back down to verse 5 it says a very odd statement it says add to your faith don't say at his faith come on he says add to your faith what you see my faith of my human ability is just my ability to believe God and stay on to that so that's nobody's only add to your faith but can't you see if you have the new birth he has given you his faith right if you have the duper he has given you his faith but it says there to add to your faith but I ran them off of a message called oneness he's talking about Mary and the seed of the woman nor the seed of the woman number one wouldn't have no seed right so what it was back in Genesis I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman that was a promise of the coming Messiah right now come on that was the promise genesis 3:15 again was the first definite promise of the coming Messiah I'll put enmity between thy seed the seed of the woman the woman doesn't have a seed she was given a seed but you know what once she was given that seed it became her seed coach Jesus Christ is the seed of the woman right he's the seed of the woman he it's not the seed of the woman that he give her no he gave her his seed it became her seed now in that sign the references of Mary he said he gave it or give it to her then it's her seed now watching this is my that's what I'm reading he said God gave it to me it's my he gave me my arm I'm reading this is my hand he gave it to me this is my voice he give it to me and the seed that was Mary had nothing to do it was something God did himself I'll put enmity twins I seem to see the woman the seed of the woman was Jesus Christ given to Mary it became her seed right this is my God gave it to me it's my now you reading add to your faith because God gave it to you well once he gave it to you becomes yours he ain't an Indian giver come on and then to get Ringo take it back that's why you can't be lost if you have it that's once then that can't be laying right or what are thinking he's it lock up these things you can't put that in the new birth this is my God gave it to me he gave me the new birth now you with he gave you the new birth it belongs to you now what's it be the same material it does not say that he gave it does not say in the writing of the Bible let's see this is faith add to your faith it doesn't say add to your virtue it doesn't say add to your knowledge brother Branham uses that away and it's correct but it doesn't say that there does it add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patient why because it's emphasizing more that it's the same thing virtue is the same thing as faith because it is eternal life it is the word that is revealed virtue the word revealed knowledge the word revealed what it doesn't say add to your I do your add to your doesn't have to because it already give it to you when you gave you his faith you accepted that as your Savior then that's your faith it belongs to you why don't you take you to the way you see Church that's the positive point that I'm telling you then when I heard this prophet I quit looking out younger well I didn't look well maybe you didn't know how nothing about looking and I'm not being sarcastic I'm just trying to tell you to get out of that stage of trying to think different I'm just telling you the truth I quit looking in heaven I quit 40 years ago trying to go to heaven this son I'll go ahead with this I'm not looking for the rapture oh no because the Bible says the Dead's got to raise first so the resurrection has got to come before the rapture quit looking for the rapture the resurrection is a nice next thing then the rapture comes after that to get it right then you win an order or what you're doing I'm not looking for some kind of something here that old ones these days that rapture is gonna take place you hear the preachers preach and not even thinking about what they're saying you realize you bypass the resurrection if you're if you're not putting in there is importance and it must not be important to you what the resurrection is the next thing right don't know there the next one is the the triplet no no don't get over there now get off of it and get in the line the next thing to the bride is the resurrection we sure hope will II don't believe we're gonna be here in the tribulation no surely we don't believe that so the next thing is the resurrection now I'm gonna say this and I'll drop back and just quit they said why are we looking for something to come instead of looking at what's here the Prophet made a statement one day he said I'm not looking for his coming he remember that he said I'm not looking for his coming what because it was there to him see he had something positive he wasn't looking for something to come he was looking at what it was and knowing that was already there they've always said to you maybe don't mean anything I'm sorry but I just say it maybe don't mean anything some things the Prophet says would you realize he made a statement on the raptured miss wraps her message he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass now here's the way I think he was looking at something positive right he was looking for negatives no he was looking at something positive do you realize that he never said that that had never been a rapture he spoke it into existence that's how much I believe that he spoke it into existence it would be the capable of coming to pass when the people believe it now and quit looking for it but looking at it a lot of difference in looking for something looking at something what do you think I think we've been around here 50 years for the purpose of Almighty God to fulfill his word in somebody it ain't been no haphazardly no problems no this out of the other he knew before the world ever begun it was gonna be that away he hasn't had to add any time to it he hasn't had to take any time away from it it's all different exactly on line and when somebody realizes it may I quote it this way what are we supposed to do then brother Colley he's been diagnosis it huh he had a good point doctor said well sometime said you'll die with this or something told him some way he said why does it matter if I die with that or something else now I'm a mix up his words and get but it's pretty close he was plainly telling that doctor what that make any difference but I live right now that what make a difference huh I positive just put it back and just say thank you bye stops I'm healed and just walk into it well if they don't never come if they don't never come to PI so I'll meet you on the other side like what oh brother Howard Carroll said he said sage I'm getting he said somebody now for misquote it that's pretty close when he said he said something's gotta happen to me pretty quick god I'm going one way or the other no I think that's about a lot of his waitress what was he's reading other nights and brother Joe can probably give it to us but he was telling how many people here is 17 but above there's a lot of us it's almost the largest single group look I think it's it's 25 to 50 or something is the largest group you know amount of people that's a lot of people here everybody this 70 years old raise your hand hey I'm looking at least 30 hands or something but what does that got to do with it I never thought I'd get this a home I never wanted to get this home and I enjoy life I do I enjoy living but I never thought I'd get here but that's the way the Lord made it so I'm supposed to be happy about it huh like I've always said don't told it in the fellowship meetings you know that if we didn't get away from here pretty quick we're gonna start having a fellowship meetings in a nursing home well if we don't get out of here pretty quick there's gonna be a lot of us and the nursing home well do you know one Terrence has already got one picked up here he's looking forward he kind of looks forward on things he said you know we're the dumbest people let me say this no quick come on music he's talking one day you know where the dumbest people has ever been I said I knew he meant something you know that's what you talking about he said when brother Branham was here he said gold was like $35 an ounce you know back in his day he said he told us all the gold is going to Rome he said if we just took ten thousand dollars and bought gold he said look where we would be right I mean you realize how many million that would be billions probably we don't believe ready random you see oh yeah we do no we don't we believe what we want to let you know okay forgive me for that all right go ahead brother Joe let's sing that little song let's do a given to me keep in mind what we're talking about we find many people Allah how and why we are so and free your little paintings Fairland and this is like heaven to me oh this is like an opportunity this is
