just continue to watch over them and bless them until you bring them home and father we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen first samuel chapter 17 we're going to begin at first 26 and uh just titled this called to stand alone and uh i was i was talking to the i got to speak brother boyd's sunday school class sunday and kind of come some things come to me and just won't speak on that uh verse 26 says and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should divide defy the armies of the living god and the people answered him after this men are saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him and elia his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and elijah's anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mighty see the battle and david said what have i done now now done is there not a cause and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner and when when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth amen so god bless you not you may be seated and i was speaking i was speaking to the young people in the sunday school class and i was i was talking about where you know paul was writing to timothy and he said let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believer and you know i was talking about david david david had a real encouraging report but you know david had had an experience david had david had a a relationship david had um he had a walk with god he knew who he was and so when he went out there david had a testimony and you know and and we we go back into into the scripture here and and you you i you know many people have read this scripture and many people have preached on it but i i just love i just love the the types and and all the things that are in this whole chapter and you know i was i was talking uh sunday the sunday school class you know you see how you know the the the philistines had gathered on one side of this uh valley on the mountain and and israel had come out and they had set everything in a ray and you know you they look like they were ready to fight because they had everything i mean they played the part i mean they've done the part because they come out and brought everything and set it everything in order just like they were going to battle but as soon as goliath come out there nobody wanted to fight him but he you know he had he had come and and made his boats before him and you know here they they come down into this valley and set everything up and everybody was so afraid of what they had seen in front of it and you know and how all this great massive army had come but they had just had one person and that and goliath was the only one that come and boasted and challenged them and so you know and and you and you start to see how how this all plays out and um i was reading on this and what was so interesting was i was i was reading on this and the next thing you know i was listening to brother branham and he started talking about the same thing and i was i was listening to a part of a sermon from another brother and he was preaching on the same thing it was like well i think i think that maybe what the lord wants me to talk about tonight because it just seemed like everywhere i turned it was it was covering the same thing and and uh this is from this is from the the message jehovah jireh 1964 and brother branham says now just take a look at yourself in god's mirror and just see if you can identify yourself tonight if you had been living in the days of noah in the time of the flood what side would you be identified with if you was living in the days of moses what side would you have been on if you had lived in the days of christ when all the churches was against him he had to stand alone out there and the things he did only thing was god was with him that's the only thing even all of his disciples nearly walked away from him but what side just your presence state now where would you what side would you be on what side would you be on right now when you see him again right amongst us and i tell you that done something for me because you know sometimes we fail to realize that god is amongst us god is with us god is in us but he said what side would you be on but you know you know because god has called us to stand for the word and you have to stand and you sometimes you have to stand by yourself and he said now he is here and he can turn on the light in your heart just fill your life with the holy spirit and then he says how many of here with heads bowed hearts you pray for me so how many and because if you don't have that peace if you don't have that deep settled peace if you're not in that place then you know what it's time to today is the day of salvation today is get to that place but let me tell you if you if you have a question in your heart if you've got a challenge if you're facing something tonight greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world and you know it just it just struck me because when you begin to see this this man in this situation and the part of this story you know because we know all the things that had went through and and we know that the the greatest man that israel had at the time was saul and and saul was a head and shoulders above everybody else and he should have been in in a great position to fight this man and and everything but you know he didn't he was brother ma'am said he was a coward but what struck me was you know here's here's this man this little boy that had a testimony that had known and you know what it was it wasn't what nobody else nobody else knew what david had been through nobody else had known what kind of experience he had but you know what david knew where he was standing david knew what his experience was i know where i'm standing because when they went out there and when he heard brother madam said the worst mistake goliath ever done was say that in front of david why because david david knew who he was and david knew because god had done something for david and we know that we know that david had been called and had been anointed king when everybody else had overlooked him when he come to the place when he come when samuel had come to jesse's house to anoint a king the last one had almost forgotten about was the man after god's own heart the the least at least in the whole family the least in the whole king in the whole and his whole father's house but he was the one that god called why because god knew what kind of man david was and he began to you know and then he began to go and he began to no no doubt david had had known the word and he had and he had a relationship with god because he he saw god and god's soul what kind of man he was and what kind of man he would be and then when when he began to walk in in these things and you know standing on the backside of the desert doing other jobs that probably nobody else wanted to do because he was the youngest but you know what he he had time to fellowship with god he had he had time to look at nature and see all these things and and have a relationship with god and and for god to speak to him and you know you know so so if he just had a little bit of just these few sheep to take care of in the backside of the wilderness you know what god was able to use that to mold his character to mold him through experience into the place that he ought to be and so many times we look at we look at situations in our lives and we wonder why things happen the way they do well lots of times we don't we don't appreciate the things that take place the way things happen in our lives you know i always like this when you when you think about the the children of israel when they went out to battle and here they are standing on on the mountaintops but you know brother brother brandon said you know everybody loves to have a mountaintop experience but he said real growth takes place in the valley and he said you know that's where david ended up david had to go through the valley he had to be in the valley because that's where the battle took place you can you can have you can have your mountaintops and stand up there and everything looked great but you know what nobody nobody got anything done up there but you know he was he was out there in the back side of the desert probably nobody knew where he was at or really cared but you know what he was he was having fellowship with god when when a lion came and and the bear came well you know what he didn't he knew how to fight why because he when he because his testimony was it wasn't in his ability to do that let me tell you what i mean when you when you look at those things because i tell you what as big as i am you know what i wouldn't want to be in his shoes i tell you what there's a lot there's a lot of guns that i own that i wouldn't want to be holding and trying to shoot one of them because you know when he said he had a hold of that line he said i had him by by the head he had him by the mane when he slew him that's a little bit too close for comfort for me but you know he said but he said god laid them in his hand so when he came forth he said he said god put that bear in my hands now you know everybody talks about the wonderful davie crockett and everybody talking about david crockett killing a bear when he was only three well you know what that's folklore and here's saying fantasy but you know what let me tell you i can take you to the scripture where a young boy had a bear put in his hands and he got slow but you know everybody can sing about everything else about everything but they won't they don't know anything about david brother brown said you know everybody knows about matt dillon and and davey crockett and all the rest of them but they don't know who is in the scripture you know we could see somebody that god took a young boy that was that was ready looking and he wasn't wasn't the the maybe not the most educated wasn't the best looking wasn't the tallest but you know he didn't have a whole lot going for him but he had one thing he knew who god was and god knew who he was he had a relationship with god and then all of a sudden when it came time that he was watching over those few sheep yet he had an experience with god that he knew that when those animals came in and they were only doing what they were called to do a bear is only going to kill lambs and they're going to cure sheep one because that's their nature and the bears the same way they come in they're going to do the same thing but you know what they were put in in david's hands and david slew both of them and then you know then when he began to speak to these people when he began to speak to the children of israel when goliath came in the camp and he began to speak to him and challenge them then listen i need somebody to come and fight me we don't all have to fight and he said he said that's the way that that's the way david that's the way the devil is when he thinks you've got what he thinks he likes it when he thinks he's got the situation the way he wants it he's going to come out and he's going to boast and he's going to brag and he's going to lay this challenge out there but see that's the way brother said that's the way satan is he like he likes to lay that challenge out there and everything everything looks the same everything looks that so well for him and yeah and it it done exactly what he wanted it to do he wanted them to be afraid he wanted them to be to fear what was going to take place and it starts at and it starts at the very top at the very top of this whole situation was saul and saul was a coward well you know what when he was a coward then you know what it just creates cowards when you when you when you have leadership that doesn't have a backbone then you know what then the church doesn't have a backbone either well you know because you you see when you have when you have a preacher that will compromise when you have when you have a leader that will compromise then you know what then everything else falls apart why because that's the reason why it's so important for us as as laity that it's us is our job to support the five-fold ministry this is our it's our job to uphold the pastor why because it's his job to shepherd but he's got to lead but you know what we've got to get behind him we've got to be able to support him and lift him up why because he's got a job to do [Applause] well because you've got to get behind him but you've got to you've got to find a pastor that's god called and has a has a vision of what's supposed to take place and has a has a way to go and knows what's going to take place and when you have that then but see saul didn't have that brother branham said saul had a lot of theology on how to fight but he never had an experience so he he had a lot of ideas had a lot of thoughts but when it came to put it in practice he never done any of it so he had to go find one little boy that that had that you know was still wet behind the ears so to speak but he had an experience and he had something that he could draw on and tell those people about that's right but he went out there and you know and when he heard goliath speak when he heard goliath calling out and challenging them well you know what that was just more than david could handle david they was like oh no he said oh he said is there not a cause and it's like why is it that every every god called soldier in this army is just standing here looking at this guy what is it because every one of you have been called into this army you have been equipped to be and that's the reason he said why is he that he has defied the armies of the living god why because he knew what i mean this is the battle this it never was israel's battle it never was israel's battle god never called them he said it's always when they followed his plan it was always the lord's the battle is the lord's and so when he called him into this battle he's like why is it that y'all cannot raise up and fight this man why because when it just just fear breeds fear absolutely amen and uncertainty and doubt breeds uncertainty and doubt but you know what he wasn't in that camp he was not under that that headship so to speak why because he had his own experience and so when he went down there to see that he was so fired up so to speak you know because i mean something kindled inside of david when he heard those challenges and then he began to speak and he's like is there not a cause he said you know he want to know more about it you know what's going to take place if somebody can defeat this man so what so what it what is what is the you know no doubt there had to be some sort of after this challenge was made no doubt somebody had to offer you know saul had to offer him something you know i mean you know so what i mean you know if you don't if you're not motivated by the word if you're not made if you're not motivated something's going to motivate you but you know none of that hey there wasn't enough money in the kingdom going going to get some of them to go out there and fight goliath but it did that didn't matter to david david knew who was on his side it wasn't it wasn't because when david realized that he had made those challenges to to the living god he made him to he it wasn't just the army it was to the living god he had defied god he had challenged god and so when they when they came forth you know he's like nobody's going to raise up but you know his brother comes out there and tells him a liability comes out and you know it's like well you're only here because you know you're just you're just naughty you know you're you're jo you're just playing hooky and you're just mischievous and you know you're not doing what you ought to be because you ought to be down there taking care of them sheep that dad told you to take care of and you don't need to be down here and he's like well you know my dad sent me down here with gifts and to check on y'all but you know he didn't say that no no no you're just down here because it's all your pride it's all about you no it wasn't about david david realized it was all about god it's all about serving god it's all about standing for the word that's what it was all about but nobody saw that but then here comes david trying to talk to him is there not a cause is there no any reason why to rise up and fight is there nothing inside of you that's kindled by what this man says amen no no we're we're we're staying over here we're waiting we're waiting don't kings all we're waiting on and see what this other one does or this one does well you know what you don't have to wait and see what everybody else does you know people come to church and they won't clap their hands but they're going to wait to see if somebody else claps their hands wait wait if somebody else stands up you know if so if somebody else does you know it's like you know you have you know blessed the heart sometimes wait and and guilty too but you know sometimes sometimes sometimes well lots of times uh if if i'm i'm trying to think and i'm writing stuff down sometimes i don't say amen but i try to say amen but you know there's a lot of times people don't people don't say amen it's like you know it's like but i mean you know the other the other night the other night when that when the ball game was going on you know let me tell you when people when the ball game was going on there's a lot of folks that got excited and there's a lot of people that got upset but you know what people wasn't just sitting there looking at the screen there's a lot of people sit on the edge of their seat one because it was something excited and one because it was something that stirred something up inside of them but when but when the devil comes against your family when the devil comes against your house when the devil comes against your health when it goes when the devil comes in and then you're just going to well i'm just going to take a seat back no no david was like no no no no no no no let me tell you something because david realized you know what i'm i'm i'm the hands that that god has these are god's hands and these are god's feet why because i've been anointed for something that's right and you know so if i've been anointed god's called me to this then you know what i can i'm gonna take up for god why because god has done something for me and so when he come out there and he began to speak to all of them and nobody would agree with him and a whole and a whole crowd a whole army all these people are all standing around and not just soldiers but but all the support people that were with him with the army all of those people that were there and he couldn't find a single person that would agree with him oh no no no no no not us no why everybody had to get out there and they were all showing that they had a yellow streak a half a mile long oh no no no no we're not getting involved in this but you know what he was so adamant at what he believed and what god has showed him and it experienced that he had been through he was so adamant about it that you know what everybody was started listening to david and they finally went and told saul we got this crazy kid in the camp and he's down here thinking he's gonna whip this fella yeah right and then you know then all of a sudden they said well bring it so i want to meet this guy and he's like well don't let everybody you know get all upset and their hearts fail don't worry about everybody fearing and and everything don't worry about it because you know what i'll take care of it you know no no listen listen you can't do this david now that that has to be that has to be a very a hard position to be in when no i mean when you're standing and you know because god has called us and god calls us and what puts us in hard positions and hard times to see how you're going to stand how you're going to react would you stand there like david david's standing there and he was he was the only one that's going to stand up for what the word said oh no no david listen listen you're just a little boy you got a lot of growing up to do but just fell out here he's just massive just huge i mean look how big he is and like you got no you got no chance against this guy i mean he's he's just so look david how big this guy is it's like well they don't you know they didn't phase david you know because when when he began to look at these things he was just like when when elisha was standing there on the mountain he was speaking to hazy you know he stood there and said you know i'm not worried about the army that's gathered all around me so why because there's more of it with us than they are with them hey guys stand there going who's he talking to then he said lord open this boy's eyes and then he realized there's a hole there's a whole mountain full the heaven the host the angels everybody the army it was all gathered around them well elisha elisha didn't know i should knew he didn't have to fight this battle it's the battle was the lord's he knew where he was standing so when david walked out there david knew where he was standing david knew what god had called him to do and so when he walked out there and he stood there and he said listen i know you i know you think that that i'm wet behind the ears and i and i can't do anything but let me tell you something i know what i'm where i'm standing i know what i've been through i know what i come from i know what every step of the way let me let me tell you something king saul i was there on the back side of the desert there wasn't nobody else it was me and this sheep but let me tell you something the spirit of the lord came down you know it's just like you know driving riding in a pickup truck and uh and the angel of the lord you know the spirit of the lord comes into the truck with you and then all of a sudden you realize hey you know what i ain't by myself anymore it's just like sitting on a loading dock or laying on a loading dock somewhere and all of a sudden you know what you realize you ain't by yourself anymore wherever wherever you at when you're out in the like brother luis was out there in the water and all of a sudden you know he was getting rolled out there and you know he called out all of a sudden something come up behind him and pushed him back up on the shoulder all of a sudden you realize hey i'm not alone sometimes we fail to realize what's that what's around us what's inside of us he said he said the angels of the lord encountered about those that fear him so he didn't you know david knew who he was and he knew where he was standing and he began to tell saul he said listen king saul he said when i was on the backside of the desert and he said i know this lion came in in the lion no doubt was bigger than he was but you know what he said the lord laid him in my hand and i slew him and he said i was still out there praising the lord and just living on the backside of the desert all by myself and he said and the bear came amen and you know what i didn't worry about the bear why because i knew who i was and i knew who my lord was and he laid him in my hand and i slew him and that was it and he said let me tell you he said the same one that came and met me when i slew the bear and when i slew the lion he said the same one he said because he said those were only following the natural elements of the world and what the what their desire what they were created for but let me tell you something this one he's defied god and now all i got to do is stand i'm going to stand for him and i'm just going to stand in the way and then he's going to come because all i got to do is be willing and he said the same one that slew though that slew the lion and slew the bear he said he's going to slay this un un circumcised philistine but you know in all and all that was said and done and all the things that they came about and all of that you know what saul saw what saul wasn't happy with that so i wasn't uh he couldn't he couldn't go along with that you know they just didn't satisfy him he's like no no no no no listen david what we got to do what we got to do we got to get you equipped we got to get you set up in the right place we got we got to follow the right thing because there's a certain pattern that you got to follow and let me let me tell you saul i got to put you i got to put on you what i got listen i got a sword and i got a helmet and i got a shield i got a breastplate now i got to give you all this i'm going to show you how all this works and you know what david tony none of this fits on me and you know it was it wasn't a physical thing that set on david now it was but no doubt david walked there and said listen listen king saul i respect you and all that you've done but let me tell you something you've had a spear and a sword and a helmet and a breastplate and all this other stuff and you know what it's got you nothing you know what you had all that stuff to lay on you and you're nothing but a coward you got everybody around here shaking and fearing and everything else everybody's in a whole terminal and you've got all that stuff and you're gonna lay this on me no thanks i don't need it and why because everybody wants wants to give you the same thing why because if the doctor wants to come and say listen i want to lay this on you because i'm going to tell you all about this because you know you got heart disease and you got diabetes and you got high blood pressure and you got kidney failure and you got all these other problems that come along with it and you got acid reflux and everything else now let me lay this on you about how this thing works let me tell you because we got we got big pharma out here we got to help you with this stuff cause we got to get you some pills and we got to get you we got to get you some pills to get you up in the morning get you some pills to go to bed at night you know and everybody you know and everybody you got to have you got to have this and you got to have that and you got to have this and there's whatever whatever you're going on in your life you got to have a pill for and next thing you got to come back every 30 days walk in walk in the room stand with the doctor so he can talk and look at you for five minutes talk to you send you a bill and walk back out of the room and haven't done anything for you write you a little piece of paper and hand it to you so here go fill that and take them but it's the same thing no no no no no no god never laid that on us david walked out there and said listen i ain't never proved any of this i never i never fought anything never had to fight a battle where i had to carry your sword and your shield and your helmet i never had to deal with any of that but let me tell you what god has done for me god equipped me with a little slingshot and i have proved this and i know this works and brother branham said this little slingshot is deadly i know what this thing will do so you know what he just shook all that other stuff off and told him said you can keep it because you know what i've seen what it proved what it does what the end result of all of that is and but i tell you what the end result of what i got i know what the end result of this will do why because i'm overcome i've had an experience of an overcoming so that's what i'm going to hold on to i'm not going to hold on to any of your ideas i'm not going to hold on to any of these the things that you've got why because people people want to come and play church and and all these things but you know what he never gets them anywhere but what we need to have we need to have an old-fashioned x2 experience where we know where that we stand and know what god who god is and actually know that we are standing on the words [Music] what god has called us to that's do because you know many times people want to sing i'm one of them i'm one of them but you know the thing is it comes a time not just to be singing or saying it but it comes time to prove it it comes time that you've got to stand and prove who you are and david come out there and there he was standing there and he began to prove who he was he said no and so dave you know saul finally just told david listen you you go about your own business you you do that well because he had to shake all that off and many times you know that's the way it has to be you got to stand out there all by not only you have to argue with people no not argue but you know you've got to state your case just like david did he let him he let everybody know where he was at but no doubt everybody stood there watch david as he walked out there this boy's getting it yeah this is just gonna be bad and it's just like you know everybody talks about you know watching a car wreck you know you know it's gonna be bad but you can't take your eyes off of it but you know it didn't it didn't faze david it didn't faze him at all because he knew who he was and he knew who what god had called him so when he began to walk out there you know he didn't have to worry about it he knew where he was standing so he just went he just went on about his business to do the thing that god called him to do so brother brown was speaking and he's all about you know we've got to come to a place and and you know what we see that he was about people being uh full of the fighting theology and and all these things but you know you got you got to come to a place where you you got to put god to the test and you know he began to talk about these things and and he said you know he said there has to be a need there has to be a crisis in your life you've got to come to a place where where you meet god and god and you show show god who you are and where you're standing just like david did and he said brother said he said if there ever was a crisis it's now why because now now's the time why because the devil's on the on the on the rampage we see all these things that are coming about but then now now is the time that you prove who god is [Music] you know and a lot of people they they they get tired and they get weary and and you know you know people get you know they begin to almost like lose their faith and and you know they begin to you know just get run down with things and and you know and the thing is and now's the time and all in all the times that you that you have that you're facing all these things now's the time to put god to the test and do it and take god at his word and put god to the test and show that he'll come on the scene because you know many times you know brother speaking and talking about in the coming in the people coming in the prayer lines you know he said you know people come in and you know and they don't even come in the right mental attitude to come into the prayer line and he said he said he said born again christian people will come in he said don't miss their healing but he said he said you get some prostitute off the street can come in and get healed well because she knows how to approach god anyone when people come in and they and they're standing there and and you know brother branham began to in the in under discernment he began to speak to these people and he was standing there and he said he said you didn't realize that you had that much faith and he began to call him out and tell him said you were just praying lord speak have that man speak to me but he said you didn't realize you had that much faith and lots of times he'd tell people hey just call him by name and tell them that you know you're already healed that's right it's already left you right amen well but but see they're they're out there praying for something to take place and then brother madam begins to identify to them hey you know you're already healed it's already gone it's already left you and they don't even realize that they're free that that's already that's that has there's been a change there they don't even realize that until brother brandon begins to speak on that we see all the you know all these things brought around and began to speak about all these things and you know all the things that have has taken place and uh i just wonder i just want to read a couple of quotes here and this is from jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever this is number three brothers and he says in this time jesus had done done great things in in these early days in his early ministry he was misunderstood as most everyone so you know there's going to be times when you're when you're misunderstood he said did you ever come to think of it that most men who ever do anything great for the kingdom of god stand alone did you ever think of it you have to stand by yourself jesus stood alone and all down through the ages other men who stood alone vinnie sankey calvin knox even abraham lincoln that's right stood alone men who do great things meant a vision men of spiritual understanding stand alone he said i think that's because that jesus had to stand alone himself he said now the principle is being here trying to help you and only the only way that i know christian friends to help you is to get your faith the best that i can by the word of god centered on the will of god for you see if you can only see that it's god's will to do these things for you it's god's will to save you to save you all it's god's will to heal you all and he will certainly lead you into deeper depths and higher heights if you'll just trust him he said don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night let's build it a little farther up the road tonight never build it in the same place you can't stand still he said you're either backsliding or you're going forward so when he began to speak if we're going to do great things for god then you know what we've got to be moving on and we've got to and many times you're going to be standing alone and god has called us his place to stand alone but god but god has a place for you amen and he and it i love that where he said he said i want you to get your faith centered on what the will of god is for you that's the best thing that somebody can do is show you what the will of god is for your life and many times it's it's you know we can speak we can speak the word but it takes god to speak to you to put you where you need to be to answer your specific question now i can't i can't just call somebody's name and tell them what they have need of but but i can tell you what i can stand here tonight and be a and be in a vessel that god can speak through to speak to you and whatever you have need of will speak to whatever your situation is well because there's many times that somebody they'll be preaching on something that's totally different than what but god will speak to me in a way well because the spirit moves and and the veil's broke and all of a sudden something takes place and even when he reveals his word it'll be totally off to the subject of what they're preaching on but some that will be quickened by that the lord will speak to you and give you what you have needed and someone you know when we come to the house of god and we and we gather and we listen then you know it's not just you know the devil wants to stand in your way the devil wants to try to hinder you and all in every aspect of that well we see brother branham was speaking here this is this is from the message the ever-present water from the rock and this is number four and and brother ram says he said you see many times people thinks that a prophetic gift that god just says i'll pick you up right here and set you down here now you just go right over here and and says and he doesn't tell you and he doesn't tell you all those things if he did then what overcoming faith did you have see see he lets you stand alone more than anybody else see you all can come to me and ask for certain things and he's never failed yet but what he gives you the answer right that's right yeah i can go ask him for things for myself and many times he just leaves me alone see just let me go ahead and walk into it i have things now that i have to solve out myself and decisions i have to make and this is such a vital one till i cannot exactly make it until i'm sure that it's him speaking to me and and he won't give me a vision he just lets me alone so i'm just setting as an orphan like this morning i don't know which way to turn so i have committed it to the lord so when you think uh this prophetic gift that brother branham had you know it wasn't for him you know because when when even even when they had the car accident and you know when when he was laying there and you know the the testimony has been that you know he couldn't pray for himself when billy paul got to him but you know what he could reach back through the window and he said get give me mama's hand and he got to hold a sister meet his hand and he could pray for her but it didn't but it wasn't for him and when he came see it was it wasn't for him why because if the lord just told him to be a zombie right he just and just you know walk this way walk that way you know just like just like people think you know predestination you know you just you know you don't have any control you don't have any say it's just like you know it's like it's time a predestination of the days like you know what's so funny he's like it's like you know all of a sudden your legs start moving you start walking he's like well i don't know what i'm doing i'm just walking this way you know then your arms start moving it's like what is it i don't know but that's how people look at it it's like you know you just you know you're just i'm just i'm being loud of the lord it's like well i don't even think you know just i just get up move no he knows what your what your desire is he knows the things that you're going to do and that works into his perfect plan so you know it's not it's not like you know we're just you know he's he's a puppet master and he's just moving all the strings and we're just going right along with it no god has a choice for you to make it believe that so if if i have a desire and if i have then god knows what desire i was you know and the decisions i would make he would know the mistakes i made and you know what he he would know that ahead of time so you know what none of that ever took him by surprise so you know you know what all these things that he knew what was going to take place in the end he knew the beginning from there so he knew how all of it would take place so then that there is an overcoming absolutely and so many times you know you know when when you walk with god you know he he leaves you just like brother man said it's just like an orphan he puts you in places that you're going to decide whether you're going to what you're going to do and he's going to see what you'll do see just like joke he knew he knew who job was because he he spoke to satan and told him said have you considered my servant job he knew what kind of person job was but he wanted to show job who he was all right all the way through the scripture everybody you'll see somebody as brother said all these people are standing alone right i was listening and brother i was speaking i was listening and he was speaking on daniel you know and daniel being out there you know daniel knew that when they made the decree that he couldn't pray to his god you know it didn't stop daniel brotherham said that daniel went right then and went and got in the in the window and opened it up and prayed just like he did every other time well because he wasn't he wasn't afraid of what the men's law said and you know what he identified quickly he went right on the wrist right that that second he wanted him to know where i was standing well you know what you tell me i can't i can't pray to my god well guess what i'll show you i'm not changing i'm not changing for you or anybody else why because i know who's the living god i know who god is and i know what what he's what he's capable of and what he's done for me and i know that y'all are only doing this to get back at me to try to hinder me because they didn't like daniel it's always he always got those ones everybody's got to be jealous of somebody else why because that but that's satan's plan right i mean you know that's that's one of the most terrible things that you see people get so eat up with jealousy one of one another and they just and you know it's just like they they talk about you know carrying grudges and and having having jealousy and all these type things you know it's just like they say it's like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die you try you're trying to get back at somebody by carrying a grudge you know i told that story years ago about about that teacher that had all those kids and she wanted to teach them a lesson so she had a bunch of potatoes and a bunch of sacks and she took them out there and she told them said listen i want you all to write down every grievance that you have every grudge every problem everything that you've got against somebody everything that you the resentment whatever you got she said i want you to write it on a potato and put it in a sack and she said i want you to carry them sacks around with you day in day out sleep with them everywhere you go when you come to school you better have them so you know what they started carrying them potatoes around all the time well you know what after a while them tata started rotting but you know what she still made them carry them potatoes and then all of a sudden not only that you know here they go and they start to stink and next thing you know they're starting to stop those drips start coming out of them bags but you know here they are toting them sacks around everywhere they go come to school can you imagine the school room and everybody setting them things down and whoo but you know what it taught them a lesson because she said see that's what happens when you carry downward grudges when you're carrying this resentment and you don't get rid of it one because you you said you you saw how how much you hated carrying these sacks around and you how much know how much nasty mess they are and the smell and all that and it's the same way with you carrying a grudge well because it's something that's going to stand in your way that's going to hinder you from going on with god and you're growing and everything else because you know and nobody wants to be around you if somebody come around carrying a you know a sack of rotten potatoes how many people want to come up to them so you can stand right over there and then take a step back we don't want to we don't you know and it's the same way but you know what if you can get in the spirit of god you know if you if you if you become under that the spirit of god you know you know and you know because you you can you can be born again and still have and still carry a grudge and you you can be born again and still be you know still make your life make your life miserable you make everybody else miserable too but you know what you can be an overcomer and have and have a sweet disposition about you right now where people just can't wait to get around you but you know that that's your choice what kind of what kind of life you're going to live what kind of fruits you're going to produce that's totally up to you but but you have to make that decision right so we see when when all these things were coming you know when david when he went out there you know he went down into that valley to fight fight goliath and everybody else was watching him to see what he's going to do and he walks out there and he walks down into that valley down to that creek that little stream and he gets those rocks up and here he comes you know carrying those rocks puts them in his bag and he goes out there well then all of a sudden you know goliath becomes incredulous that they said this is all you're going to send me i've been doing this for 40 days day and night i've been coming out here calling for somebody and y'all gonna send me this little shrimp you're gonna send me this little twerp out here and that's what you that y'all that's all you're gonna send me and he's like you know i'm just gonna stick you on the end of my spirit i'm gonna stick you up and feed you to the birds you know he was like he just couldn't believe that all you said all this army in a ray you've done all this and this is the best you got that's all you're going to do and no no doubt goliath every time he come out there he looked at him you know he saw the fear in their eyes because you know that they just fed his ego oh just kept going and all of a sudden when he came out there dave was like listen i want to tell you something you come at me and you find military armor and all this stuff and your spear and your sword and all this kind of stuff and i'm tired of listening to your mouth but i've heard it all but let me tell you something you come with at me and all your training all that kind of stuff but i've got somebody i'm going to tell you about i'm coming in the name of the lord of the god of israel and this is his army and i'm coming in his in his stead and i am anointed of god and i'm going to stand before you and i'm going to tell you something i've heard you talk but that's the last time you're going to be talking because i want you to know something today i'm going to take your head off and then you know all this is going to be over with right soon you know and glad that you know he was i mean he was just beside himself with what was going to take place that he couldn't believe this little guy was telling him this but you know david went out there and he had to pick that stone and put in that sling then you know what he didn't worry about where he was slinging it right man that's right you know because i i i with everything that was within me it didn't matter where david slowed that slung that rock all he had to do was throw it right that's all he had to do was put it in there and sling that thing around and sing it why because the the lord took a hold of that rock and put it exactly where it needed to go and it didn't matter if he threw it backwards or straight up in the air it would have ended up exactly where god wanted it to end but i'm sure david went out there and slung that thing around and he and he let it go why because there was something that stirred up inside of him and no doubt he probably got his arm all wound up and he was really doing something he came out there and he slung that rock out he let it go and it went exactly where it was supposed to go and all of a sudden goliath's standing there and you know what kind of what kind of deal do you think when you when you're nine foot tall ten foot tall however tall he was you know this great big massive man and you see this guy will come out there slinging a rock at you i got a helmet that's an inch thick and you're thinking about all the things that goes through his mind about you know what all this stuff that he's standing there thinking about and then all of a sudden the last thing that goes through glass mind is david's rock but i mean he stood there but you know what david done exactly what he said he was going to do why because he knew who he was and when he went out there he did exactly what he was going to do and then all of a sudden then he went out there and he pulled that goliath sword and he cut his head off and then all of a sudden when he raised that when he raised goliath's head up and he stood there and he stood on back of glass back and he stood and shoulder showed everybody here's your here's your champion here's here's the man that gives you all of your your faith and gives you all your strength and everything here he is oh yeah as long as goliath was out there you know it's like i can handle this then all of a sudden when goliath is dead then all of a sudden it changes that's right then everybody gets their running shoes on and they can't run fast enough then all of a sudden when this takes place then all of a sudden then then you see that the the army of israel's like did i just see what i thought i saw then all of a sudden they they began to get faith and rise up and next thing you know they start chasing the philistines you know they and they go to war and they begin to chase them and they and they chased and they killed them they kept chasing them and chasing them chasing them until they destroyed them and so it's the same way god just needs one person amen and it may be you know because we want to you know if if a church is going to fail if a church is going to succeed then it takes the body together and you know many times we say well you know it's going to be it's going to be brother wade it's going to be brother bob or whatever no it may be you it may be me you know maybe maybe the reason why we hadn't got to the place that we need to be is because each one of us does not receive got to the place where we need to be when we come we all we all have a part to play you know there's there's no big eyes in little use but each one of us has a part to play each one of us has a job that we're called to do that's right and if it's going if we're going to be successful if the church is going to be successful then it takes everybody we don't you know because well you know i'm just i'm just insignificant well you know what there's a lot of insignificant parts in the body and you know and and paul said you know even even the uncomplete parts you know every every part has a has a function and you know because you know no nobody nobody wants to do without one little part right right because you know you if you you think about just little tiny things i mean you know even even if you you get something as small as a splinter oh yeah you get a splinter in your finger and you know and and and you know it just it just festers and man you just mess with that thing and oh my goodness and then and how many have you ever had a paper cut you don't know you have a paper cut till you get something in it and all of a sudden you feel like you're going to go through the roof you work you're working in chemicals and stuff and you have alcohol different things to hit it and then it'll it'll stop your whole body and it's just and you say well you know that's that's insignificant well you know what it all plays a part [Music] and we all we all have that little part to play but god called us to do this to to fulfill the part that god called us to whatever whatever it is god called you to do then that's that's we be faithful in what god has called you to god god called us into into this body and you know and and and jesus had to walk alone and all the rest of them and you will too but you know the thing is is is many times it we you look back in and and times and and all through the scripture and and that's what god wanted he wanted one person to believe him when you have one person to believe and believe the impossible god has called you to the empire from because you know when you realize where you came from before the back part of god's mind before there was ever anything amen you were a part of him amen amen amen when you when you look back before there was there was anything god saw you as an overcomer amen that's right and then we come down here and we wonder if god's going to bless us we wonder if god's going to heal us if god's going to save our children when we don't when we realize where we came from and what god and god called us and then god called you to believe the impossible but with god all things are possible when you when you you think of mary when mary went out there and that was married she was standing out there and and all the times that she had heard heard the priests talk about a virgin shall conceive the pro the great prophet isaiah speaking of the great things that's going to take place that we're going to receive a messiah why because it was spoken of in the scripture all the way from genesis all the way through each one of them began to speak of what was going to take place and when they began to see these things that was going to take place and then they hear all these things and then you know everybody says wonder when it's going to take place when is it going to take place but you know what it came a time when it when when the angel came to mary you know mary didn't marry didn't fit the mold for the for the one that the messiah was going to come to but you know what she fit the mold for what god wanted her to do that she was going to bring forth the same that she was going to fulfill that word and let me tell you something brothers and sisters brother brother random said you know he said the bride is just like he was that christ he came and he was stood alone rejected of men but you know the bride is the same way the bride is called but you know what god called you god called you to this day to this hour to this age to be an overcomer in this age he knew where he was going to be standing and knew what you was going to overcome that you were going to stand and do what kind of battles you were going to face but you know what he made a way for you to overcome he's already sent his word and he said he sent his word and he and he healed him and he delivered them from their destruction he made you an overcomer he made you more than an overcomer and he brought you into this age to be an overcomer to fulfill the word of god why because he saw in the mind of god what would take place why because you're going to stand alone but brother said the bride would stand on the word she would stand alone on the word she's called to stand she's called to speak it's her job one because she god has called us to this hour it's our job to stand and speak well because he came and spoke and he said he said the things that i do when he began to speak he said he said the things that i do shall you do also amen well then you know what it was it wasn't just speaking to the five-fold ministry he just wasn't speaking to the pastors he wants me but the thing that he done what did he do he began to walk in the word that he saw of himself when he began to look into the word and he began to proclaim the word when he began to see the and open up the scriptures and said this day this scripture is fulfilled well because he has anointed me to preach the gospel he has anointed me to do these things and brothers and sisters that's exactly what god has done in this day he's anointed the bride to overcome to fulfill the word to stand to declare the word to this age that like he said he said this this eve would stand and declare to the world that she won't fall like the last one did the first one when she stood there and compromised on the word this eve is not going to do that brothers and sisters that's telling us that we won't compromise on the word that we won't fall but god called us to that place many times we said we can have the devil stand on it and stand on our shoulders and talk in our ear until we just get tired of it but let me tell you something brother sisters god give us enhancements right right then the brothers and sisters we got to stand up and take it and believe it i don't have to i don't have to listen to the devil's rotten lies i don't have to put up with him one because you know just like just like jesus he took by the word and he began to speak and he said it is written and he tells satan to get behind me amen and brothers and sisters is the same way with you and i hey man sometimes you think you're standing all alone and it's like well you know there ain't nobody here but me brother brown said when you think you're all alone you know what the lord's there it's you and god he said on this journey he said there's no there's no extra room it's just you and god and you've got to make that determination for yourself we've got to i've got to make that decision for myself whether i'm going to walk in and be an overcomer if i'm going to overcome if i'm going to walk in what god has called me to i don't have you know because if if i try to if i just sit down and think of myself as of being what god called me to be you know what i would i would just absolutely just like abraham i'd laugh because if you know if you look at why because you you're not supposed to look at yourself you're supposed to look at the word the word is spoke let's see what the word says about us just like david when he stood out there he walked out there and stood and knew who he was let's know who we are god has called us to tell you who you are to speak to you to let us know that's right you're the beloved amen to to realize the apple of his eye to know what god has done for you and brought you to this place and you know and all the all the time all your journey all the things that god's done for you and then he's like well you get to the end it's like well you know i'm going to leave you on your own right no god will be with you that's right that's right let's all stand and the musicians come god has called you to a place yeah god puts us in places that we don't like to be [Music] hard battles and trials and stuff but you know what every time every time you have a a trial a battle a temptation whatever comes your way he said he gonna make a way he gonna he has a way made for you to get through many times we don't know which way we're supposed to go what what the answer is but you know what i'm going to put my trust in him i i you know i don't i don't know what the future holds
