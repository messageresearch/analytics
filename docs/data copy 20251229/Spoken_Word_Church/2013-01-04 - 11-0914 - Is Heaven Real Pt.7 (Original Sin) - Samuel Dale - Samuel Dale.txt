========================================

open the eyes i want to see pour out your power and love holy holy pour out your power in love i let's just open the eyes of our hearts good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you like turning your scriptures to hebrews the 10th chapter we'll just read a verse here and try to continue our thought home when we left off from here we had a real good time at the richard wilson's over the weekend i know you had a good time here we've heard one service but we have one to go so i know you had a good time and good fellowship and all together but just remember now the lord willing to fellowship meeting will be this coming saturday and we have a good mini going so if you want to go with us let us know or we can make all the arrangements get everything set and all like that we're probably what leave 11 o'clock 10 30 30 10 30 lay here at 10 30 not 10 30 leave wade's house at 10 30 excuse me i'd say here and we'll leave wade's house at 10 30 not 10 35 10 30. all right we'll be ready to go okay and just pray the lord would bless if anybody wants to ride or whatever let us know where we can get all the arrangements made to do that okay hebrews 10. father we thank you for this day in the hour that we're living we thank you for grace love and joy and peace in our hearts thank you for all things and we know that you said you give them to us freely so that all that means is we have to do is just receive it we thank you just have your way now bless us as we try to speak about you and lord as we try to read your word and talk about the things the prophet has said unto us we pray that you would just come on the scene now and be with each and every one forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace we know that there's many sick among us tonight and you said you said it you promised it he said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so lord we commit it all to you have your way now and guide us in jesus name hebrews for familiar scripture with all but hebrews 10 will begin reverse about 19. having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holy holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from evil conscience from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he that is faithful had for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love into good works that means to encourage provoke means to encourage all right not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as a matter of some is you know what the prophet said that is a man of unbelievers but exhorting one another and so much more that more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins you may be seated the lord had his blessings with reading of the word now i'm still crooked as i'll get out and as of now i go tuesday to find out this they won't operate now they first told me no and now they said yes so we're going to worry about it that's right you're going to be concerned either way that's right so we just got the lord to to do it and if they'll tell me that it'll help me then i'll be all right if they tell me it ain't then we ain't gonna worry about it so you know we just leave it into the hands of the lord but i'm still creepy and i can't shake that part but i can still croak it out i'll get it out one way or the other amen all right now when we left we preached on the wednesday night there and trying to bring out um how the sin originated in heaven that's right it didn't originate on earth the first battle that was ever fought was fought in heaven now i know that's hard to comprehend and as i said we we don't know any of the theologians etc and all that would even talk about these things but a prophet told us what took place in heaven and uh you know so then maybe we need to consider this a little more i spoke on this up with brother richards on the the uh evening service and kind of took it in and just a you know not reading a lot of quotes but just doing and and trying to cover a large scale of what we've been talking about and they seem to enjoy it so i i enjoyed speaking it so i guess it made to enjoy it anyway but you know now i tried to get you to see that how could sin happen in the presence of a perfect eternity right if you wanted to call it you know right heaven all right then we found out that satan was not satan in the beginning right right he was the anointed cherub that's right amen he was created perfect he was not created eternal but perfect and his ways was perfect but he became exalted in himself and it was there in heaven that just took place because the angels were created and and it could have been millions and millions and millions of what we call life of life you know our our time uh before even the world was created in all of the things and and all like that and it probably took satan a long time i call him satan because but back there it was really lucifer right so he wasn't satan until he was cast out all right so then you know he was the anointed cherub the scripture says that he stood beside the lord all right but i wanted you to get one point and that was what i emphasized to them up there whatever the first lie was in heaven whatever the first sin was see then it would have to happen in the garden of eden right with eve and adam and you know satan and that that would be also the same lie the same sin that would happen in the end time and i told you here i was talking about alpha and omega so whatever it was in the beginning would have to come back around to be there and we're we are the only people that this could take place on because the bible says they must become a fallen away right now all right now you must be somewhere to fall away now you cannot have the holy ghost and fall away from the holy ghost and be lost now don't get that thought into your mind and when we get into it in a little bit there were that we we covered it or read in verse 26 that if we send willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth that's right the prophet of god said that's not born again christians he said that it was borderline believers people who had received the knowledge of the truth all right now around the world today we have the ability to be able to understand uh the bible and to understand the words coming straight from the mouth of the prophet of god to come in our day and bring us the truth so we're the only people that can really bring sin into an attribute form and display it you know in the way that it would really bring it out because the bible says that god winked at the ignorance all right right now luther was as we've always said not disgrace degrading him but he sat in a pub and drank beer and and talked about the bible and smoked a pie well god winked at that well it's not supposed to be that way now right right because we're supposed to be back to the end of it all coming forth all right but see now keep in mind what i'm saying whatever was the original sin would have to be the same sin in the garden and then it would have to be the same sin at the end time all right and we covered and they really enjoyed the point i was bringing out about you know that if we say smoking drank and gambling and running around with women is sin the prophet said that wouldn't sin he said that's attributes of unbelief because those angels had no ability to do those things they didn't have an ability to smoke drank chill running around so we need to get rid of all of that right from even our thinking and in consideration and get down to looking at what is sin right all right see we say well we know what it is his unbelief but what was the thing that we we we look at the garden of eden and we see that there was a uh an act that took place between eve and the beast all right but that act was an attribute right all right a display of unbelief because if she had not disbelieved in her inner being her spirit part of her she would have not done that right and that was the first things he done she disbelieved all right so the sin has to deal with the inward parts of us and not with the display of the outward right so we look over here in the end time and see then that we are the only people lula georgia we'll say like that everybody else that's her business lula georgia has the ability to fall away from the knowledge of the truth right right sure because we've heard the knowledge of them that's right now if we fall away from it then there is no sacrifice all right because that would be the the wrong thing but now let's go back what we were talking about and we looked at lucifer i gave you the quotes there the other night on it so you don't need to have them that he uh he was god's right-hand man that's right he was the anointed cherub that stood beside the lord well why would he get all a problem you know was it some way that god made him no you would make god the author of sin so don't do that we think about eve in the garden that she was made lustfully you know on those styles to make all of this work and why she was already an unbeliever before she'd done anything with the beast the sin had originated before she done anything right so why are you even considerate of of anything that would be that god would make her in a way oh we got the quotes yeah read you quote but just remember god couldn't make her wrong right and then judge her for being wrong that's right you could not make lucifer wrong and judge you for being wrong right he made him perfect he made eve perfect all right but the choice they made is where the wrong became involved well what was the choice that we were talking about of lucifer he just couldn't comprehend now did he disbelieve god in a basis did he not believe in a god another prophet of god said he wasn't that away right she believed god i ran off a couple of quotes and they can give them to you but run around and said the greatest lie that's ever been told is 99 true all right what satan or lucifer whatever who you want to call him told eve in the garden was 99 truth that's right amen the only problem was was the interpretation of that truth or way all right so then lucifer was jealous with reggie of michael right being brought around he called him his boss you know he was jealous why mom went to be jealous of michael now i hope you caught this point i just made some remarks about what i did preach i hope you caught the point that if it hadn't been for michael lucifer would have been annihilated when he done what he done that's right i hope you caught that point michael is what kept god from destroying lucifer right but yet that was who lucifer wanted to destroy right come on that was who he wanted to destroy he wanted to destroy michael or christ his brother around him david when joe's got a couple of americans shoot him up let you written while i'm talking but you know brother brown said on beginning the end of the gentile dispensation that my should stand and i said michael was christ of course right all right he was christ okay then he goes down to christ the mystery of god revealed and talks about how on paragraph 543 that satan was what he wanted was a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had see michael was christ that's why it says over in the book of daniel that michael your prince a prince is a son getting ready to be king right you come up to the prince then you become king right all right so then that would show who it was that it was christ all right but why would why would you want to destroy now i know satan didn't think that lucifer you know he didn't realize but why would you want to destroy your savior but well now brother dale i wouldn't want to do that for nothing in the world well evidently that's what lucifer wanted he fought with it right i don't believe it was a physical battle you know right but all he was doing was trying to set a stage to be able to house michael out of the way right because he couldn't comprehend michael you can see all the angels he could see all the things right he knew how he came but yet he just couldn't comprehend michael he couldn't understand christ right but what about now i hope that this digs down deep inside of you that lucifer was wanting to destroy michael and michael was the only hopes he had right i had michael turned around and said lucifer you are an annihilated he would have took place man all right sir but see michael knew christ knew that there had to be something caused to fall to take place and the things it would have to be and in doing that then he knew that he had to preserve listen he could throw him into outer darkness down to the earth and give a dominion here and things but he had to protect him right you say well well well that's some kind of a of a devil well i asked the brothers and sisters up to our question simple one why is it that seemingly the last two or three major doctrines that have developed in this message people like the two lords in the uh what was because of river jordan those people that believe that jesus wasn't god isn't it odd that these doctrines and i told you probably 30 years ago or close to 40 that if you think the the two souls and all that would be a deceiving doctrine now how many times did most of you heard me say this at least 10 times have you i said you wait it'll be closer than that see now they're destroying christ or jesus or jesus christ amen right see if you say that that jesus is another identity or another person you're just the same thing there was at nicea council in 325 a.d you're the same thing as the catholic doctrine right the catholic doctrine did he that he is the what the third person of the trinity you know all right see what the doctrines how they destroyed christ you ever notice brother brown says preached a message one time called raising jesus from history go listen to that message see we dethroned him totally by our denominational doctrines of the trinity we actually took him totally off the throne and exalted satan to the position he wanted by believing a trinity right well really you know it's not too bad how much does it take that's right i've got a quote in here where brother brown says well whether it's initial evidences or not whatever you know he said that's what they done in rome he said well you know why are you all so mean and arrogant and hateful about being so strong about something or a doctrinal thing when those are good people yeah and that's what they came to moses the day after the ground swallowed up a couple two or three hundred thousand of them or so many and you know what they said the next day they come to moses and said you destroyed the people of god yeah they couldn't even remember the day before how many of them went in the ground right but you see satan wanted to get to that place that he thought was rightfully his was the right-hand man and had he not got exalted look what a position he would have had right wouldn't it be something to be god's right-hand man amen but by being that close to god you know that he knew a lot of the secret that the other angels didn't know right now didn't he tell eve one of them right you'll be his god that's right amen knowing good and evil lauren said he had a knowledge of the principles of life that's how he knew the monkey and eve couldn't work you know what i'm saying so he had to bring in the beast to get the closer into the human race to be able to mix the seed that's right satan knew these things what about it church you mean you would want to destroy your savior now anybody got any sense wouldn't that goes to show you that it's spirits right demons and not people anybody with common sense sit down for one minute and think about it they'd say no i don't want to destroy my savior and i'll preach you 49 sermons well he died for me but if you make him a second person right what have you done that's right if you make him a different identity these are words people use that i can call the name to fit the doctrine and they say he's another identity and that he's another person you see you say well why would you be so uh strong to to try to warn people because what they're saying is so close to the truth sure all right amen now get the point satan disbelieved god right right because that was his unbelief god had a way of doing things and satan wanted his way right to do that right you see how easy elias i've told you the doctrine i'm trying to get away from calling the names to spit them but there is a doctrine among one of the big organized religions that says that satan wanted to save everybody but that jesus only wanted to save so many of us and that god rejected satan's belief now if you want to go i'll give you the people to go to and you go talk to him brother dick likes to do that he likes to find somebody and go out there say okay now what do you believe well that's good because that way you find out firsthand right but see what about a a devil wanting to save everybody and god only won't say so many it looks like the devil is a greater god than than our god but it shows his deceivingness he shows what he's trying to do he didn't say there wasn't any god he just couldn't understand where michael came from and his position in the situation because that was withholding from him all right but he set out then in his own jealous ways to preach the gospel yep that's right he preached to the angels and the angels believed his doctrine amen what was his doctrine i don't understand this guy michael i don't understand this i don't understand who he is and what he is i just know god told me i'm his right hand man if anything takes place supposed to be through me now may i drop this in what about the preachers of this message that's right what about the preachers of this message that say if you don't come to our church any of you ever been told if you go somewhere else now the roundabouts fly away now not outlandish remarks from the mouth we're going down to it in a minute what about those who try to destroy the faithful ministry right amen when the final four ministries on the hope the bride has amen that's right you agree if not you're just going to listen to me you know saving trouble driving right now well see at least you must have some dependence upon the fifo ministry to you know because we know what the bible says about them that they're given for the you know to watch for our souls well if they're given to watch for our souls we we you know we ought to depend on that brother dale do you depend on fifo ministry yes sir amen that's right there ain't no one fold in this look on his mind and never has been right i believe in the final full ministry amen amen i bring them in to you to preach to you because i know i can't preach at all never have thought that never had no thoughts about it but now watch what would be the original sin would be that lucifer would become in his own way of uh jealousies and and things to worry that he would want to to get rid of michael what about trying to destroy the effects of the faithful ministry that's right there's nobody hey i write it down i write down so i just see what you say you say but brother dale they don't want to destroy you come on i'm human i've always told you i don't believe my worst enemy wants to get rid of me maybe they'd like to shut me up a little bit once in a while but they don't want to destroy me i've never believed that about anybody i believe there's a lot of people respect me right all that all right but what about destroying the effect of the word that the person preaches right amen wouldn't that be the same thing that lucifer was doing in the beginning see to destroy a man's influences destroy the man but see you see how simple it was in heaven that satan told the lie the eli brought around says he said it was the same lie that he told eve he should have said it he said it says they lie there he said i looked it up said it should be translated eli and what about a lie that would take an angel that would be in a holy pious condition no sin no drinking gambling smoking no no problems and bring them to believing it right we read with the other day where that brother brown said satan wanted to make his heart more beautiful he said we see it in the garden he said there's abel with a little lamb to just kill it you know bloody mess but he said there was cain a beautiful altar so that evidently lucifer was thinking you know i'm greater than michael i'm more beautiful than he is look at my side he was over the north which that's the worship part satan loves worship as i kept trying to tell you until him in tennessee satan don't want to go to the bars the bar flies the prostitutions the things like that he ain't out there right even if little wentz as we talked about the other day they don't even like being out there they like to go to church right they want to hear and you watch it a man starts moving especially when they come in this message he'll start moving and he begins to get a following the first thing you know people are just flocking to that following and boy he just straightened it out everybody you just tell him where everybody's wrong well then after a while you either see him settle down and just become one of us you know or either he goes back where he came from right or into the bed of adultery or whatever but wasn't it something for lucifer to think i'm god's right hand man i know all of his secrets he's confided in me these great secrets i know how to explain them what is it with the ones and the preachers in this message i once said one time he said you can call it two so whatever you want to he said i just believe what he said you know well wasn't it as i said a moment ago the fact that satan explained what he thought was god's plan to eve that's right and you know he told her she was made for that purpose you know what that's 99.99 she was made for that purpose but the prophet said she mixed the wrong seed in the words too quick she was the one to have brought all of us into being right amen she was to reproduce adam how close to the truth but when satan then as he begin to explain to her about this as i've said many times to you then he begin to say adam and god won't tell you but let me tell you how to do this see then it went into the natural act right but but the rather said the church spoken words original seed that's not on the planet he said the church couldn't wait let me add a few words to it let's see what you think the bride can't wait for the true faithful ministry to get the word to preach it unto her i've never done away with your reading you're studying i've always encouraged you to read and study and pray and seek god and let god speak to you and you come and tell me what god's telling you and if it's right i'll amen what you're talking about right but the word comes to the faithful ministry after the prophet has brought it unto us amen but you see the women today ain't talking about when come at churches we can get it ourselves that's not a new one that's old it's the garden right but let me say just a few words here and then we'll get back down to something see the original lie that satan had according to genesis that he tried to explain to eve was you'll be his gods knowing good and evil now there's a lot to start with because god don't know good and evil right there is no part of god that could know evil he knows of evil but he doesn't know evil to no evil would have it to be part of you there is no part of god that evil could ever come from amen all right but that was satan's first words you'll be as god what was it in isaiah be like the most high right stronger than that but what is it in thessalonians showing himself to be as god sitting in the temple of god all right now let me emphasize something for a few minutes and see you're going to have to know whether you're right or not by your own holy ghost that's inside of you that's right if you don't have it there's no way to know except intellectually so we'll get back to that in a minute if you receive a knowledge of the truth and you turn away then where's your trouble but let me get this point across but brother dale you've always preached to us that we are god made manifest that's right we're not a second person amen amen we're not a third person we are god made manifest well how close is that to what satan says amen as god like god and then showing himself to be god what how close is that to the original truth don't remember satan's not the barfly guy he's a slicker in the pulpit right where his stronghold is you agree his stronghold is so strong in the pulpit until that's where he controls the people from that's right amen agree amen that's why the and doctrine see conquer the laity so lucifer would say don't you think yeah hey i'm supposed to be the number one guy i'm supposed to be god's right-hand man don't you believe that we're supposed to be the offspring of god right don't you believe that see it's all in your approach you approach that in one direction and you're antichrist you approach it in another direction in your jesus christ amen right how close is it it's up to you right you see it's like i've said it i've heard people uh especially the one brother that preaches the river jordan real strong i heard him preach a message one time that was so beautiful about the children of god the offspring of god and that we were not a second person we were always i mean my wife beat me to death with her elbow said where'd he get that you know i ain't saying he hurt it from me i'm saying all you gotta do is read the prophet's message and you'll see what i'm talking about you and the lady can read it and find out but then later he preached that jesus was the second person well jesus is the second person but you are the children of god that make you more a child of god than jesus would be because he'd be a second person it couldn't be a child of god simple but who's the most popular who's trying to be popular i'm trying to tell you the truth that's right i ain't trying to save the world we just opened up where they could hear anybody listening you've got a knob you can turn me off you can do what you want to that's no problem because they're going to make a dime a difference we're talking you're in this church i'm talking right here i'm talking about the unbelief here not the unbelief somewhere else that's none of my deadness how much are we really true believers is our confidence in the fifo ministry that's right in a way now you know what that means when you say in a way now jesus wasn't in the way he was the way so it's got to be talked about somebody else if you say in a way that might be right brother i believe you when you're saying that we are the offspring of god which means god in flesh but in a way now see that means you've got something in reserve that just in case that ain't exactly right then you ain't gonna stick your neck out what about it what do you believe about the offspring of god remember how close it is that's all right so let's just think about some things now let's consider something because i said it was the same lie that was told in heaven it's the same lie that was told even in the garden and then it would be the same lie that would come in to come into being in the end time through the preachers because i don't think i'm nobody i never had no trouble with that that's right it's preachers yep amen because preachers are not going to first off 90 of them are not going to tell you what they believe they're going to preach it and let you decide what they believe and then if you get it right you know oh they're on your side and the rest of the congregation just ain't caught the secret yet okay but if michael is christ and christ is the only protection we have and he works through the fifo ministry i didn't make these statements i didn't write the bible and i didn't say the things the prophet said he said to five full ministries for the perfecting the science to bring these things into the body of christ amen now the bible says that the prophet says that but where's the people at i'll just get it from the prophet well then the other side of it is i'm the guy that was to take over that ring of bell does that ring a bell what happened in heaven i'm supposed to be the one in charge how many people are preachers in this message come on when i first came in 1968 the point then was was who do we follow came in 66 but i'm talking about when we really got on the end of the message first time at jeffersonville they were still trying to figure out who elijah was trying to figure out who is to take over and be in charge and i know they didn't like it because i thought i told myself i thought the bible said the fivefold ministry was for the perfecting of the saints i thought the fifo ministry was to take this message and break it down i didn't know it was a one-fold guy to run it right but how many want name around the world even in foreign countries that they believe that they were god and drive down here about 45 miles below us and pick up a guy and see what he thought about it but why then would we want to destroy it means there's got to be something about disbelieving and wasn't that the original sin right amen to disbelieve god's word the word says the five full ministries for the perfecting the saints the prophet said it was but where's the people more people are sitting at home listening to tapes than are in churches that's right and some that are sitting home tonight listen to tapes hey you're the ones i'm talking about so i'm sure we're telling you goodbye you know i'll wave at you on the internet in case you're watching it live you know i don't mean jokingly i want everybody to be there that's right i may be the devil because he wanted to save everybody you know brother dale might save everybody all right amen and i wish there was some way it could be done but then we realized it can't be coming satan tried to get eve to disbelieve what god said and believe what he said do you know that a man years ago indicted us they talked about brother brown that in doctors come on there's a man in this message that indicted us for believing brother branham but you know what they're still following him around the world and he wound up with two or three young girls up there moved to florida to keep being caught all over but you know what they still believe him he took the doctrine to take it to eve to try to get eve to believe who she was now they ain't a preacher's ever come forth in this message and i'll challenge you let's see if you can do it anyone that ever took a leadership and a doctrine and led off with it and all of the doctrinal issues and the things of believing their god and all that they didn't start out believing that right you know what they started out doing trying to get you to believe who you are look how close to the truth trying to get you to believe who you are we know what he said to he you'll be his god he didn't say i'm your god look at me but come on folks we ought to realize and this is where preachers don't do it preachers come along especially some that's come through here and they don't know the turkey as we call it about the message they say they don't and they stay here a while and they say they learned a whole lot and then they leave well how can you leave somebody that led you to the lord i mean come on but you see everybody after it comes up so far in them that they think they know everything that's why i always try to keep something danging in front of you it don't bother me to tell you that the lord revealed this to me the other day if you listen he'll reveal it to you don't bother me because that's god's channel you know why because i learned that away you know from other people that's right amen and i go constantly listening but satan tried to get eve to disbelieve the word because that's what he disbelieved right there stood the word which was christ come on is that right now did he move over in the form of the word theophany logos christ the son of god etcetera etcetera etcetera the child playing before their father's door the son of god that was who lucifer was trying to attack right and when he come to eve he was still using the same tactics and so is he using the same tactics today right now you got everything that's messaging you know from kooks to real good people but you notice those people in this message preachers you can't trust what brother brown says he changed here he changed our he missed it here he missed it there and you know where to con phrase that the phrase i conned out of it years ago if you straighten brother branham out just get your shoe off i want to kiss your toe because you've got to be almighty god because only god could straighten out a prophet but you know that ain't going to change nobody they didn't make one convert right probably made a lot of people think i exalted i thought it was but brother branham said eve was fortified going for letting that brother joe number three which is a big prayer of 160-162 with the second seal and look what he says the natural first bride of the human race before her husband came to her she fell by from grace by listening to satan's lie after he had fortified after after god had her fortified behind his word right and she was fortified behind the word right and he said don't move away now let me just go ahead and put it plain didn't in other words didn't he tell eve said if you need to know anything you need to talk to adam would that be true now am i degrading anybody your sisters you know come on now is that degrading to you he had her fortified behind the word he had adam there to be her real true have meant if she needed to know anything she should have went to him but of course like women preachers we can get it too you know all right but look if she'd have stayed behind the word she'd have never failed now that's in the natural nature see the natural woman and what was the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word and remember she believed about 98 of it but you just have to leave one thing go look how close one thing though see she believed a whole lot of it oh certainly she said this second admit it that's right if he could just get you on one corner that's all he wants only thing you have to do is give the bullet a little twist this way and it'll miss the target see that's all now she's believed so much of it but yet missed it and what's the results the whole human rights all that she took was you shall not die and god said she would see she still believes he's right right the church still believes she's right all right look at the next one we have a true prophet 1963 paragraph 238 you know you you have to deny the truth before you can believe a lie amen okay that's right that's exactly he first had to deny god's word for she could take satan's lie they had to get away from the word then now watch this reading here sign now letting rome now we're spread around covering letting wrong take over without firing shot they don't know the word of god about these things that's what the trouble is what's he saying read that you gotta deny the truth before you can believe a lie so it's what she done what did rome do at nicaea what did rome wrong do it the first and i see in council you see what he's saying letting rome take over without firing a shot you know the devil is not a uh you know the devil's real slow fly moves real slow as i've told you it took from 3 25 a.d to first nazi and council that they developed that jesus was a light substance not meaning he was the substance see because they had it would have stayed with the truth and it took to 606 before the trinity concept was really almost 300 years that's right and you know why satan done that with pictures little small doctrines and pictures because that's what he used a drawing in his first drawing he had mary holding jesus and a halo around jesus well after a little while he just makes a couple of light strokes up above mary's head you know and after a while another picture comes out first thing you know that just as big a halo around mary his ears around jesus hundreds of years to develop that trinity he's got patience satan's got patience he knows how to wait but look you've got to first deny the truth so now here's where the scripture is there must be a falling light and if there must be a falling away you got to be somewhere to fall all right so the truth would have to come forth before you can fall away from that truth see this is the only age where the truth has come the full truth you say no the book of acts paul didn't understand what we understand about the thing come on quote brother branham so you do what you want to see they didn't know back there what we know now that's right i'm sorry they didn't have the opening of the seals and the things about where the prophet to bring right amen i didn't say there was an era i didn't say that was even in false doctrine but you know yourself that the very first church age was what thou is is the one that now has left thy first love right amen that's right brother brown emphasized like he said said i wish you'd get back to it but he said in that very first beginning said they would look the people in the eye and say you're not saying what paul said that by your antichrist you've got to hear the truth before you can fall away so this is the warning to rule the church we talk about the word the amount the uh the volume or what you want to call it that the church at lula stands upon the word then that way it means we're the closest ones if you want to argue that you're the one that said it i didn't so that means that we can fall quicker than the others because a lot of the others ain't reached that yet right right so we have the ability to fall greater than others so don't grow don't crow so much about what you know look at the next one divine healing 1954. and we'll have to do this one kind of like what he did the other night on the evening service he was talking about the the uh forming ladder rains and the different things you know how this with that and that with that now before we start on this before we get into it the prophet i told you to start with it's impossible for a christian the prophet said to disbelieve god's word you know and be lost right then we talk about what is the black theme in the holy ghost and we call it the unpardonable sin and the prophet said it was to make light or you know of someone with the holy ghost on them and bring it down in simplicity now look where he starts off here with the unpardonable sin maybe not on this one but look up in the next quote let's just see what it is that you and i can do now we read in the scriptures if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there are remains no more sacrifice i didn't write that but look what your prophet had to say he that sins will flesh receiving the knowledge of the truth there are laments no more sacrifice for sin hebrews 10 i believe 47. is that right he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth that remains no more sacrifice for sin but a fearful looking for the fire to the judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversary now he that what willfully he that sins and what is sin unbelief he that will turn his back on truth when it's presented to him there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin okay did you ever read it that like that he that disbelieves willfully after truth has been presented to him because his church believes different that's when you cross the line he that sins willfully actually after he has received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice he that sins willfully acts receiving the knowledge of the truth and to receive the knowledge of the truth means you've got to hear the truth amen how many people have you talked to come on how many people have you talked to that people have turned you down right when you tried to tell them the truth right see i like to do that because that way you can't throw it all back up here and sit there and grin at me or look at me and all kind of things and say yeah you talk about yourself no i like to talk about you how many people have you told the truth right and they turned your name how many times you ever talked to anybody about water baptism right your simple water baptism that's right yep that's it they say my church don't teach that what are you getting upset for they just read it you say what revealed to him it doesn't say that come on folks receiving the knowledge of the truth is not to have a revelation of the truth that's right it is a knowledge that's right a knowledge is is something that is laying in front of you that you can't argue about right well in a way i guess you could be right he said anyway i'll tell you what the bible says right amen you say are you judging those people no no god judges the people i don't have anything to do with it you don't have anything to do with it you just tried your best to help them you want to save them don't well you know you can't say well if you keep it in your pocket right right you sit down on it like brother ernie i really thought that man made a point brother ernie going away we were talking about that feller that he'd known him for quite a while the man come up to him one day and said you mean you've known about william branham all these years and hadn't told me about it yeah right so we can sit down put it in our pocket and say we don't want to hurt feelings well i guess you'd rather the person burning hell then if you'd hurt your feelings i'm fine but not arrogant you see we can justify within ourselves right and say well i i just don't i just won't talk to nobody because i don't want to offend them well you know i wonder what would happen if somebody had to come to you that's right right and a lot of times the thing did you right first time you heard it you got upset you didn't like it you know you right see brother after you talk because he's been around you a long time i've seen a lot of you come up the line shouting and hollering and kicking and fighting okay but what about it see we can fall away because we know the knowledge of the truth that's right brother explained it come on now he said that's a borderline believer that was the guys that went over and got the grapes and come back borderline believer those that was facing it at cadence barnea they could see the grapes and couldn't eat the graves right and they could hear ten guys telling the truth and two guys lying and wait said them ten line preachers that's right i mean two telling the truth and tim line but look at the next one to see jesus program e43 41 1954 look what he said drinking smoking gambling doing evil things that isn't sin that's your attributes of unbelief you do that because you're an unbeliever if you was a believer you would not do those things it bears the fruits now what's the truth it bears the fruits of joy peace long suffering gentleman's face with me that's the fruits of the spirit but the fruits of the evil spirit is doubt he that believeth not is condemned already then if the truth comes to you in such a way that you have a knowledge of it and then you receive refuse to receive it there remains no more sacrifice for for your sin but a fearful looking forward to the judgment what is it then if the truth comes to you in such a way that you have a knowledge you know what you see is right right now come on just be quiet sensible with us you know and i try to be that with you now you know yourself that even it doesn't matter what church it is the simplicity of brother brown explaining one god should have been received by everybody right amen right and especially the water baptism when he said it don't take a revelation right it just right here and he said we can show you in the history where they changed it at the word that it didn't used to be father son holy ghost it was lord jesus christ all of this and the other and that's simple in it why didn't they receive it because it would cost them their church their families their things but you have to have knowledge that was right i told you about the man at work down there i talked to him about it he said the lord spoke to him and told him to get baptized name the lord jesus christ he said all right now you get it done here so i came into work maybe a few months later he said got baptized over the weekend i smoke praise the lord he said yeah i should call his name said he baptized me and i thought hold on just a minute let him finish he said baptize me both ways i said before you say another word i want to tell you how you got baptized hold it don't say nothing i said that man baptized you in the name of the lord jesus christ and then he baptized you and father son and holy ghost am i right he said exactly i said you don't have no baptism at all you erased everything you've done right he withdrew from he wouldn't have anything to do with me but see i knew that man was a methodist preacher and with no way in the world he's going to baptize him in the name of the lord jesus christ but you say when a man was just sincere that's what i told him i said if you're sincere why didn't you have him to baptize you father son and holy god and then lord jesus christ i said because you know he went and done it i said you've been right back with me and i've had it done but you see the lord spoke to him and he's what he said so he received the knowledge of the truth that's right and be totally in disobedience look at the next the unpardonable sin it'd be good to take this whole message and read it paragraph 120 1954 here's the whole capping off of every verse in the bible that's beautiful isn't it in other words he's going to sum up the whole bible right and he's going to cap it off right we'll just take it in a few minutes to show you that every place it was full of of the unpardonable sin unpardonable sin then paul comes over here to cap it off said if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin then that's got to be the unpardonable sin is sinning willfully is that right he that sins willfully now what is sin the next thing you have to find out what is sin sin is disobedience sin is rejecting now look here the first sin unpardonable sin now brother branham says we will even willfully do things wrong it's christian but what's willfully doing things wrong as christians you better not have nothing to deal with the word it better be this life and doings and you know you remember that i've teached many times on the works of the flesh that a christian has works of the flesh but they better not have fruits of the flesh because we do the lost right amen the works of the flesh can be in all of us amen you could go out today and get a temper tantrum strike and you kill somebody you're a murderer according to the bible no murderer goes to heaven but did you do it wrongfully or what was it so what is the unpardonable sin rejecting god's word somebody presents the truth to you and you turn it down because of what somebody else says first off that would be a very carnal thing to have is to to not be able to have something on your own why can't you stand on your own two feet that's right amen that way you can either say i'm lost or saved and it'll work but you know what the bible said no man can call jesus christ except it be by the holy ghost a personal experience inside of you because if not then you're saying what somebody else says right does that mean you're saved no you're only saying what they're saying see that our knowledge of the truth is not a revelation of the truth amen it's a knowledge you remember back there a while ago when i was trying to illustrate a little bit that god has only one way of doing things satan wanted to do it another way so he disbelieved god why wouldn't he stay with the original plan to reject the revealed word that's the next one which is still in the unpardonable sin this is paragraph 122 that was 120. to reject the revealed word now look what he says he said even webster in other words if you look at his footnotes he said he said that sin is rejecting the revealed word of god sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of god what god our will of god will have god's word right when god has revealed something as his will and to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject god what was the first sin let's look it up you go back here in genesis 3. you may read it when you get home if you want to genesis 3 when god put the garden of eden put adam and eve in there he told them things that they that was his word that they could do and things they could not do notice when satan come to eve he said god hath said thy shall not eat in there but surely thou shalt not die i see then eve willfully you get it he willfully doing something that she knew god said not to do is that right now look at it when you see willfully the first sin that was ever committed what this was her willfully continued she already just walked over there to adam and said adam this thing over here talking to me but no i wouldn't make a remark about most of the women of this message but would it help because most of the women in this mess are not going to listen to their husband is that going to change anything because they think you're right and you know about a lot of things they are that's right but we're talking about the word amen don't you think that that brother and sister is good people yeah when i found out one day one day the prophet said hell is going to be full of good people and we may be a lot of them that's going to be there good people but now he got down to use blaspheme unpardonable he said what i always thought blaspheme was to to make lighter to to do yeah but it's all you got to do is just say that i don't believe what that preacher says right and if that preacher's telling the truth what have you done that's right yes sir well there's any hope for me the only hopes is back in god's word and remember if you are truly born again you cannot do it because something will stop you right now come on we ought to be human enough to realize that sometimes things does talk to us and tell us not to do things right you know we'll listen to it right brother brown said quote if there is any doubt about what you're fixing to do he says don't do it right that's simple all you got to do is paragraph 125 with the same message because joe number nine all you got to do is say one thing then what is sin he talks about saint john the third chapter in a moment he that believeth not is condemned already is that right then sin is actually unbelief now we we want to get that uh uh believe it or not it's condemned we got that as a the people that don't know nothing don't haven't heard nothing don't know anything about it is that where our minds run you better get it on over close to where we're at that's right come on see that sin is actually unbelief satan and his enticement to eve told me that god said that but he didn't mean it see how he whitewashed the word well now he said now god said it but he didn't mean it in other words you'll be our eyes will be open you will know know a lot more knowledge okay and now that same rotten lie is told by satan to preachers and church members today to say the word of god says so and so but it don't mean that god's word means exactly what it's saying right brother i know he said that but he didn't mean that but what did he mean who gave you the right to tell us what it meant i thought a prophet stood before god and god only amen i thought brother brown even told us that you just said the way i said because i'll be responsible and you know what i've always told you if you didn't know the message didn't have all the message or anything you know that brother around his way was bringing out something that brought around tall and you know what the white horse rider was the holy ghost sure you know if you've been back there going around the country preaching that run around and would have shook your hand said brother tell it like it is come on he was deceived brother and i want to say boy let's start off listen you know more goodbye right no problem now you go read the book and see whether he was deceived or not he said i'd have made a horrible mistake if a holy ghost had to come in the room to correct me on when i fixed the preach but once that was preached if you still didn't know the truth and you also were not able to receive you were still okay but when somebody come along and said here brother brown you listen to this tape he corrected that you better not preach it the other way anymore amen because you're an unbeliever unbelief in god which is the word you don't have to pull up now joe that's number 10. i sent you one brother oh bro next okay okay i'll get sorry about that i just know until y'all in the room all right which is the word he made me do it he got it but listen all right all that's well and good lord i know what sin is more to see how it is and where the day and the hour that we're living in the time we're going to see that we're the only people that can really be caught into the position of being able to fall away right but i don't never like to leave anything behind me pull a license brother this is what i like to bring read we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like ever she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by the word what do you think's been going on for 40 years the man said she is going to prove to satan she who the bride can you believe something that is not true if you are a child of god come on you mean you've got the holy ghost but yet you believe that the two lords might be right or the seven thunder virtues might be right or the river jordan guys might be right or you mean you're still so sympathetic with all of that unbelief that's right come on i thought the holy ghost was to lead us into the truth and according to what your prophet just said he said the bride is going to prove he tells you about what eve happened and what happened you go to spoken word original seed he tells you what happened to the early church ages right but there's got to be a bride in the end time that's going to stay with god's word no matter what anybody says she's just gonna take god's word and keep on walking that's right i ain't got time to fuss and argue with nobody i preach here anybody out there wants to listen that's your problem you you've heard the knowledge of the truth so if you don't believe it you're a sinner goodbye because i can't do anything about it because i don't want nobody to be lost i want to preach to the bride of jesus christ and i want satan to know that he's been in the battle amen i don't want to face god with a little 65 two lords seven thunder virtue perusias son of man seven thunders all kind of doctrines that are around in this message that even a a 10 year old kid could take the prophet's message and show them where they're wrong if they listen to him i want to go down and fight i want the devil to know that i ain't on his side right that's right i wouldn't believe that that ain't on his side and it ain't gonna give up right but why is it you can't believe that the holy ghost can keep you straight amen i'm afraid to listen to anybody else because i'm not getting all confused no you're already confused you might listen to somebody else and find out you're already confused that's what the preachers say let's say these simple things now well isn't that doing what i said a while ago isn't that destroying their very savior right is it destroying your savior when you won't listen to someone else what about it church there must needs to be heresy among you that they that are approved may be made manifest that's right ain't no need to bring it off the street now let's get straight in here to where we prove what's wrong with it no don't worry about it satan will try and real good brother years ago preached here many times i was gone when we came and invited him to come down he preached two lords to the team you're no better you ought to know better as a brother i'm not going somewhere else when i know somebody's contrary to what i believe about predestination one god what about i mean i'm not worried about this so really you know i'm not going to preach that right i'm a brother when i went to jamaica i told that pastor that was over our pentecostal preacher i said brother branham taught us not to do that he said well there's two brothers came here and really messed up a lot of things and i called her names because he told me i said but you won't you're looking at a man that won't teach nothing no different i said now i'm not going to compromise with you or nobody i said what i preach i'll preach it to the letter and straight to the truth but you're going to determine how far i go because i will honor your pulpit as our prophet taught us to do amen he said teach all you want to anything you want to on the morning service he said the only thing i do is ask you at night to keep it more simple said because it won't be my people it'll be people all over the island well some of you was there and heard what went on i preached one god so straight and they rejoiced to the tea about it i didn't have to back up but i still wasn't going to go contrary that's not the spirit of christ man told brother branham one time said brother brown said you know that most of my people are legalists in other words if you would you know honor that he said i loved the man because he loved his people but preachers you know how to bless god i've got my time and i'm gonna tell it well now where did jesus do that right where did brother branham do that truth is true but truth is not made to fight with truth is made to be lived not argued about come on that's right what is sin any idea or thought that i have contrary to god's word and i hope he's listening to the reason i gave it all the way through because you see if we turn down the bible ministry we've turned down part of the word of god if we reject the faithful ministry we reject god's plan but if a sister comes and tells you the truth you better listen donald donkey straightened a profit out one day a rooster crowed to correct the preacher if we ever get to the place that we can't hear what other people has to say about it and brother brown said what did he say most people do he said they're only listening for you to shut up where they can refute what you're saying that's his word amen go home and think about it what is sin how simple is it to be a sinner from being disbelieved anything brother brown said i'm a sinner i know he talked daniel 70 weeks but i just can't i just don't don't believe it find somebody that does listen all right we're going to get down down and start over in genesis okay we're going to preach about that last quote brother around said that there's a bride in the last day is going to stand on god's word and no matter what anybody says or does she's going to stay with me and she's going to prove to satan brother branham you said we could live so close to god to the devil didn't know what to do with us that's what he said that's right just keep quoting the word that's that's right amen when he comes to you something says what's the word saying oh beautiful but what's the word say dreams and things why did the lady have it the man had to dream and he said run around i'll straighten you out on this thing yes brother was talking to him because he was traveling about the country with this woman and had a bad reputation the man said i'll straighten you out on that i had a dream first i think doing that a vision for everyone said he saw it was a dream and i saw my wife running around and then she'd come back and i just love her and i just you know over and over and over he said now your dream is not right two people think it's so beautiful they said it can't be right it doesn't matter if it's visions dreams or whatever we have her word of the lord you better compare with the rest of the world that's all i've ever asked anybody show me where i miss this show my word i've preached wrong out of this bible that's all i want people to do coming that way i can be helped all right go ahead know what the truth said let's deal with it how to take this we are ain't nothing but the devil whose shots have done everything they can it's a demon i faced it i rebuke you disagree they want to take it out i don't care but what does that matter is god i'll come forward because this is not our battle this is god's battle but it's our bible to stay with his word to prove to save it we won't believe his this yes is anybody else discipleship when jesus said why don't you go to town say where can we go right where can we go what can we do believing that god is going to take care of everybody you mean that we believe that he would hear his child right before he would even hear an angel unless your prophet said that now wouldn't you hear your children before you hear the neighbor's kids i mean you're out there in the yard and hear your kids over here screaming bloody murder and neighbors kids over screaming bloody mary you won't help the neighbor no i'll go help yours and then go after the neighborhood that's right you've been in a store you mothers especially and there's 49 kids in the store hauling mama and you're four some yeah you mean god won't hear us that's right no but he loves to try he loves to prove it i've always believed that what right around said he said that he didn't want to get down to the red sea with moses and find out that he had the wrong fellow now that's paraphrasing but that's what brother ryan said about it so he didn't want to get down there and find out he had the wrong person now who is he talking about to try to find out or get to really know who the right person is was it god or did he want moses to find out who he was we are his offspring we are his children one more before we go over there let's just sing his course he brought me out he brought me he set make sure you let us know
