message believers wrote i believe and it makes you wonder if if they knew it seems like that's a song that really only message believers really know what it really means so we just we just thank the lord it's good to be here tonight tonight i'm going to preach on i'm going to take a look for a little topic from from luke chapter 24. current events made clear brother bob you're you're plagiarizing brother brown uh that's i i that would be the one of the best compliments you could give me is that you're just saying what brother branham said so i'm just obviously what sermon i'm going to preach from tonight is modern events made clear by prophecy but you know there's a lot of things going around uh today a lot of things in the news things happening and things happening over the last couple of years and it'd be it'd be nice if we could make sense of all these things wouldn't it the only way we can make sense of it is by looking into god's word so let's read uh well before we read let's go to the author and and ask him to bless the reading lord jesus we're so grateful to be able to gather together lord and look into your word and we just lord we pray lord that tonight will not be a vain gathering lord we know many have traveled for a long way from different parts of the surrounding area and come lord not to to see one another or to see me but lord we want to see you as we were singing just now lord open your eyes of our heart lord god because we want to see you from our heart by faith lord as we look into your word and we just invite you lord to move among us tonight lord jesus and whatever the needs of your people are lord jesus you know lord i don't know but you know as you look into their hearts lord jesus whatever their need is their desire lord and this in the middle of the week here lord jesus that you'll strengthen them lord god and speak to their need lord because we know that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart lord and we ask lord that tonight you'll just let it strike exactly where it needs to lord we ask that blessing upon your word now in the name of the lord jesus christ so luke chapter 24 reads and if you remember at the beginning of luke chapter 24 that jesus had risen from the grave and everybody was everybody had been going in their little groups mary and joanna and the other mary the mother of james went and and they saw the two angels there and with the shining light and they went back and told everybody and nobody everybody thought it was just idle final fables because you know it was it was a group of ladies and they went and told all the men and none of the men believed because you know sometimes that's how it is sometimes and and and and and uh different and then peter ran and he he looked into the he looked into the tomb and and uh he come on now peter looked peter looked into the tomb and he he uh he saw the grave clothes laying over there but he he he ran back to tell his story and he said i didn't see any i saw the grave clothes but there wasn't a body laying there but i didn't see the body so that kind of sets the the the background as we read this that everybody's looking for truth everybody's looking for evidence and and and they were wasn't it it wasn't clear uh something they could really hang on to yet and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three school furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew dear and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him are thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done we trusted him and today's the third day and we haven't seen any evidence we we've heard a lot of stories and a lot of things we'll we'll we'll put up in that category of idle talk peter coming back and saying well i saw the garments laid over there but i didn't see a body yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found nada's body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not we didn't see him they didn't see him then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken what's he was he admonishing him for not not for not for not listening to those people but for not believing what the prophets had spoken all not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now brother branham said when he preached this sermon he said if the people in the days of the lord jesus would have only sought god and knowed what was just about to take place they would not have condemned jesus to death but the reason it was because the scriptures had to be fulfilled because the jews had to be blinded we all are aware of that now he's talking about the jews had to be blinded for the word of god to be manifested now these two cleopas and his friend were walking along and they were blind that it was held from them and brother branham will explain a little bit later in this sermon why they did not understand who that was talking to them and why did they not they did not understand what had taken place and brother adam said do you realize that that's promised again in this very age that we're living the very age that we're living those things those same things are promised again the laodicean church age this seventh church age that we're in now is naked and miserable and blind and don't know it this very the same church age is blind and doesn't realize the day and the hour that we're living in so now now think think of that what we're talking about tonight that the current events modern events the things that are happening today right now are made clear by prophecy now when brother man preached that sermon you would think that maybe he would talk about politics or maybe he would talk about things going on in current events that you could read in the newspaper but he never talked about those kind of things he talked about what did he talk about he talked about the word of god he went to back back to look at the word of god and so you know there's a lot of strange things that are happening in the world today they're the with the the war and uh somebody asked me i think it was one of my kids dad are you going to preach on ukraine tonight are you going to preach on joseph biden that's what they say are you going to preach on biden and there's a lot of things that there's a lot of things to talk about in current events but you know really if you want to see what's really going on today it's it's actually something that's something that's secret so something that's a mysterious happening something that's taken place in the supernatural realm something has taken place in this building and all around the world all in different churches all around the world something's taken place and what is happening is the word of god for this age is being fulfilled now now the laodicean church age was blind and they're they're they don't recognize it just the same as they didn't recognize it in that first church age just the same as cleopas and his friend failed to recognize it brother brown said the same as he blinded them back there for the purpose of getting his message through to the elected people he's promised to do the same thing today and when was it promised in a day as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of noah when the world would be would be in this sin sin-sick condition and this horrible condition perverse men and women not knowing what gender they are what they are confused a a state of confusion that's past understanding so confusing that when you talk to people in the world they're in a state of their mind is in a condition where it's almost it makes you your jaw drops sometimes how you wonder you know in one place brother adam said that the only people that would be really have a sane mind would be a holy ghost field christian and you can just go out to to talk to people at work and people people going into a panic constantly constantly in turmoil and to see that god's word is being fulfilled and now look around and see that the condition that the earth is in and you can recognize you can begin to understand by looking at god's word that god some something is happening and understand with clarity get clarity about what's taking place modern events made clear by prophecy and brotherhood said this is a horrible time but it's the most glorious time in the world to preach the gospel think about that now this is a horrible time a horrible time when the whole world is in sin sickness and darkness and it's even the people that proclaim to be christianity now they're just they're just drinking starbucks in the church and they made they made christianity even like a laughingstock where all the all it is is showmanship and stuff and and so forth but yeah this is the the greatest time to preach the gospel if you really know the truth of the gospel because the word and its truth has been poured out and now more than any other age any other age now we've got something to preach we've really got something to preach what are we preaching about when now we're preaching the fullness as the whole bible has been opened up to reveal christ in his fullness back in the church again and it brother adam said if i could have stood on the brink of time before it come into existence and the father would have looked at me and said what time down through these ages would you want to preach i don't want it right now that's right just before his coming why why right now because you know i think in the days of luther you'd you'd be preaching kind of through like a little a little uh slat in the fence like like like it were you know like paul said we looked through a vatice or a lattice you know where you can't quite see the whole picture and the picture began to unfold a little bit more in wesley's day and a little bit more in pentecost as the gifts were restored but now we can see plainly we can see plainly what the things that paul preached and maybe darkness and the things that irenaeus preached but now we can see it plainly and brother ram said about sodom and gomorrah today he said it looks like it's a true time of perversion man are trying to wear women's clothes and women wearing man's clothes and man leaving their hair like women and women having hair like man you think about what he saw back then and now what has turned into now where where they got men going into women's bathrooms and men changing their getting surgeries that look like women and all different kinds of things that's turned into just a mess but it's because god's word is being fulfilled he said what's the matter with this people anyhow he said as the real people this world and if i say this to respect and all my brethren and sisters in christ one of these days somebody's going to say isn't it written that these things should happen first what thing should happen first the things that are happening right now the things what what things that god would send a prophet before his second coming that god would god would god would have seven messengers down through the seven church ages that god would have people in every age that god would have a predestinated people in every age and that means in this age that you would be part of that part of that body that he would call you out that he would he would have you set aside before the foundation of the world and have you reserved to believe this word and this day and somebody is going to eventually look back and say i thought that these things were going to happen and they're happening right now you see why we can have clarity where we can look into what god is doing look at look at this current events of this age and see with clarity why because not because we watch fox news or cnn or because we watch any news channel or reads any newspaper but because we read the news of god's word aren't you glad that you can look into god's word and read it like a newspaper that you can open up the pages of revelation and know what the seven church ages are and know what the seven seals are and know what the seven thunders are you can read first and second timothy and hebrews and know what he's talking about because it's become like a newspaper to you and you can read malachi 4 and you can say i find myself in that scripture you can read revelation 10 and you can you can read luke 17 and you can say i find myself in the bible because you can read it like a newspaper you remember back when the news would come out and it would say and say maybe well the oval orville and wilbur wright they made a little they they were bicycle people and now they uh they repaired bicycles and now they've they made a little airplane and they took off and they were able to fly put her around in the air for a little bit and then then you'd flip over the newspaper and you to read about how that now they're launching up rockets and they're going into space and uruguay and went around the earth and came back and then a little bit longer neil armstrong went up and landed on the moon and did all the things that he was doing it you know all those things are typing you can look at the news and see that things are advancing but you can look at god's word and see that something is advancing what is advancing the strength of god's word and his people the strength of the power of the holy ghost is advancing and brother mohammed said now we want to be posted to know what's to take place for this age that we live in god has allotted his word to each age so much to each age he said what good would it done wesley to continue on with the lutheran message what good would it done pentecostals to continue on with the mess of this message what good will it do pentecost to continue on when the bride's being called see we're right up into the sea time we're coming up into the sea time into the time where all of those things that's grown and it's grown until all of that strength is bubbling up into the seed everything all the power of it everything that went into making that plant grow up from a seed out of the ground into the shuck every little part of that plant is coming up into the seed we're right up into the seed time what are you saying brother bob i'm saying look into god's word and see where you're at look into what the bible says look into what the message says and see where we're at and when you can see where it will give you faith it'll give you confidence of what you're doing here it'll cause you to it'll build up your faith and what our faith is being built up to a place where we can take a body change where we're going to step we're going to step into a place where you'll see the limbs restored you'll see you'll see your body be able to be repaired you say well brother bro i don't i don't i wonder how that could even be possible we're talking about a body change we're talking about your your atoms of your bodies the molecules of your body being changed how hard will it be to for god to heal your toothache how hard would it be for god to hit your leg tonight if we're coming up to see time see time is the strength and the power of the holy ghost back in the body of the believers back in his church the brotherhood said we're living in the day when the manifestation of the word of god has to come to a different age than the pentecostal age it's got to come to a different age it's got to come to fullness what kind of fullness the fullness where christ is manifested in his fullness back in the church again now brother adam said notice he likened it to a grain of wheat the bride the reason that god had to let it go like that that fine real genuine church that was established on the day of pentecost had growed and grow since the day of pentecost into a great church it had to fall into the earth in that dark age and be buried like all sea does it had to die so we could come forth in the reformation again it come forth in the person of a reformation martin luther and from there just like a stalk of wheat coming up the first thing comes up there's two little blades then it keeps adding more blades up come martin luther and then zwingli and on down calvin and as they moved on finally it goes into a tassel now that was john wesley in the wesley age it had a pollen drop back from there come the pentecostal age so close just like a real grain of wheat if you look at the stalk but if you'll take that wheat and move it back there's not one grain in it at all it's only a shuck in the shape of a grain but it's set there for a purpose to shelter the grain until if the sun hits it like that it'd kill it it's got to stay in there until a certain time it's got to stay in there until a certain time and all the life now you know what time it is how you know what time it is in the natural you look at a calendar and you can find out what time it is you look at a clock on the wall and you can see what time it is how you know what time it is to look into god's word and you can see that it's time and all the life leaves the shuck as it left the stalk left the pollen leaves the shuck and goes into the wheat and forms again just like it was down in the ground and he said the life goes through that and goes right on to make the wheat and when the week comes that life that's traveled through that wheat the resurrection brings the whole thing out brings up for the rapture now see he talked about how in the in the life of jesus christ his message started off with divine miracles it started off with him feeding that feeding all the ones with with the loaves of fishes and the and the bread it started off with him he said look at himself when he come the wonderful little prophet the brabha the prophet of galilee why his ministry was wonderful he was welcome in church and his life his ministry went through different phases and you can see brother branham's ministry went through different phases it went through three stages it went through three fools and pulled and just like brother branham brother just like just like jesus where brother brown said one day he sat down and he said i and my father are one he said oh my that was out away with such a fella except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life and you why he's a vampire get away from such a person see see there was something had to follow that sign something fallen the shuck held it but now the pulls away it has to you can see in jesus's life his ministry that was three stages and in brother branham's ministry there was three stages and what about the church you've got to have three stages of your life three stages where you move from from grace to grace until finally you come into a place where you too can say i and my father are one how are you going to say that not because you agree with the filth of the world not because you agree with all the different churches and all the other false doctrines but because you have eaten the word precept upon precept lying upon line until you become in union with the word and to the word and you become one and it's christ manifested in you just like it was with jesus just as jesus walked in flesh on the earth the bride is going to walk in oneness in the flesh because she will be the word she will be that germ wheat she will be that coral and wheat come forth to manifest brother brown said we're at the end of denominations the wheats taken shape but what's the matter with the wheat now it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up why is it gonna lay in the presence of the sun to ripen you get tall and you caught tall and tall and you you begin to understand the word and the word begins to open up to you but now now it's got to live now it's got to live and you it lays there and it ripens and ripens until it actually becomes what's happening is every strength every molecule of power in that plant is being funneled up into that little wheat plant and the whole into that corn of wheat and the wheat plant begins to bow over in humility because something is being trans something's happening something supernatural as the wheat plant begins to bow because life is in that wheat and then that corn of wheat white life is in that seed and you can look at the whole rest of that wheat plant and a lot it's all changed because the life has gone into the corn of wheat and now the life is back just like it was when that wheat plant was first planted in the ground when that seed was first planted in the ground my brother said now the events that we see taking place the events that we see taking place it's absolutely showed in the bible of every age we think we're all out of cater but we're not everything's moving just exactly with god's word everything that is everything that is happening everything that is happening is made clear by scripture you know you can read the bible and understand everything that is happening you can understand the king of the north doing things you can understand you can understand what why the world is the way it is you can look into revelation 13 and see the history of the united states you can look you can look through the bible and see exactly what's taking place now brother brown said the bible the bible is a different book from any other sacred book there's no book like the bible because the bible is god in word form now you think about that the bible is god in word form the bible that we read here is god in word form what what does that mean now what does that mean for me you know if you if i wrote an autobiography of myself my my autobiography might have things about my commute to work and how long i sat in traffic and different life events that would make people laugh and be funny and things like that but this bible this bible is not just an autobiography of god it's god in letter form now if you could take every if you could take everything about me for example and all my characteristics and things and put put in a book it would be it wouldn't just be an autobiography it would be me in letter form you could read that and get an understanding of all of my characteristics and everything about me and and and and and and you see what god did when he put himself in letter form as is everything that he is it's the three stages of redemption it's the seven seals it's everything uh the story the stories and and things that were are unfolded in people's lives of abraham and ruth they're more than just stories but they're actually the attributes of god his redemptive power and him manifesting himself in healing and and things and so he took himself and he actually put put himself in le that's why jesus said in john chapter 6 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you are not just words they're not just words but they are spirit and they are life they're not just they're not just things that like an autobiography of me or a biography or think nice little stories about me but they're actually myself that's my the things of myself spoken out to you now what that means to you and i is if we read the bible and the spirit quickens what we have received then it will actually make it will transform it into god within us brother said a word is a thought expressed god's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets and they wrote the bible which is in word form and jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere it's got to come according to the word if it comes from god because it's to vindicate or to prove god's presence and he foreknew all these things by his foreknowledge he ordained for ordained it's called in the bible predestinated every age to its place and every man to its place and every messenger to its place he is god the devil ain't pulling nothing over on him and he's god and he has ordained everything to take place and falls just exactly in line with his word so if we can see by his word by his word what age and what time we're living you'll see it right here in the bible these are brother brown's words you'll see it right here in the bible of this age what's supposed to take place at this time why why is that because in this bible in this bible is what god will do in this age in this bible are the names of those the attributes of those written to that will be redeemed in this age do you realize what that brother brown said that when when uh i think it was elijah when he got in a mopey condition and began to wonder if anybody else believed but him god opened up the seven seals to him and he began to recognize that there's seven thousand uh that believed like him that also why because he showed elijah the names i know that's maybe a kind of a mystical concept but when you read the bible and you begin to recognize your place in it it begins to open up because it's more than just an autobiography it's a supernatural spiritual book it's actually god in letter form that he put all of his characteristics and all of his attributes in a form that you can read and meditate on and sit in your closet and think about and when you believe it something supernatural takes place that the letters on the page leap off and they become a living reality to you do you realize what you have access to that smoke does not tonight that you have access to you can sit alone in your house and open up the bible on your table and read the words of life and it will come off and change your life and change your heart and change your thinking and change your mood it'll change your home and change your atmosphere it'll make you think different it'll make you not worry about ukraine and worry about covert or worry about the things taking place in the world because there's power in the written word of god there's power in his word it's not just a book said this book is a prophet it's a different from any other but this book is a prophet this book is a prophet the bible is the word of god for telling the future it foretells because it's forewarned he said if god sends anything he says and promised in the bible that he would do nothing upon the earth until first he revealed it to his servants the prophets now so this bible was written by the prophets by god speaking through the prophets bringing that supernatural element of himself into the written form and then this then that makes this book a supernatural book that can prophesy of the future that speaks of things that are to come and that's why when you read this the bible the scripture says that he will when you when the holy ghost comes he will open up these things to you and show you things to come bring things to your remembrance what's he bringing to your remembrance he's bringing to you the supernatural element of the things that you read and he's showing you things to come because he's making the things that you read leap off the page and it becomes a prophet to you where you don't have to stand confused but you can look you can look with confidence knowing what's happening in the earth what is a prophet an inspired teacher a proclaimer of the word will of god somebody that can speak by inspiration and lift from the letter of the page make it make it the living reality speaking a proclaimer of the actual will of god and brother of said and to reveal this word one say well i got this and bless god it's like that that's just the way it was when jesus came the first time everybody has a doctrine everybody has this it'll have to be something sent to us from god see a man can say anything i see why we had to have a prophet in this day because man got so confused a man could say anything but less god interprets that word see now we have our own interpretation we say it means this so what day are we living in brother and said what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in and you look at god's bible to see what age we're living in he said we're not living in the methodist stage the baptist stage we're living in the bride age what is the bride age the time not you're past all the little petty things of of of playing around like we've gone beyond the precepts we're coming into he said the calling bringing back to god through a channel that he promised to bring it back in through a channel he promised to do it what god has promised and what god does proves that it's god doing his own interpreting of his word i know it's wednesday night i'm going to slow down a little bit so we don't get tired i know how it is in the middle of the week you're like i i can't take too much doctrine brother brother said the pharisees missed seeing the confirmation of the promises of god's word being fulfilled the pharisees had their idea the sadducees herodians and oh they had their ideas of how the messiah would come but he come contrary to every one of them but exactly with the word jesus said the same thing was here if you would have known me you should have known my day now think about what story we're trying to tell we're telling the story of cleopas and his friend walking along the way and they didn't recognize who that was walking with him and they didn't recognize that the things that they had heard about that jesus was risen from the dead were true they didn't recognize that jesus was walking in flesh among them that he was right there beside him actually you you wonder you and i put that in present tense do you realize that that god is manifested in flesh again back in this day and he's sitting on the pew next to you he's actually in the church with you he's here he's moving down the aisles and and and they didn't recognize it do you recognize it do we recognize it do we and how will you recognize not me even maybe so much because of what you can see with your natural eyes or because of what you can feel with your emotions but because you look into the word because you look into the word he said jesus said the same thing was here if you would have known me you should have known my day you say well moses we have moses said why if you would believe moses you'd believe me because he wrote to me if you believed moses you'd believe me you think what a powerful statement that is now that that what that means is if you take somebody that's a believer you can put them in any church in any age and they're still going to be a believer you could take abraham and put him on the ark he's still going to believe be a believer you could take noah and put him in laodicea he's still going to be a believer that means that means now that means now if we if we carry that through by let's reason that out now that means if you're if you're in a church where you think well if i be over at that other church over there i could be a whole lot better believer no abraham wouldn't have been a better believer on the ark and noah wouldn't have been a better believer down there with elijah or elisha you're going to be a believer wherever you are you're going to be you're going to be a believer because a believer is going to believe a believer is going to believe now now now take that and meditate on it and drink it up and think about it on the way home maybe now in hebrews chapter one we've been reading uh it says god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets and brother abraham said in hebrews 1 1 god in sundry times wrote the bible by his own chosen way he never wrote it by theologians and neither does he interpret by theologians there never was a time that the theologians ever had an interpretation of the word of god the interpretation comes only to a prophet and the only way we're ever going to get out of this mess is for god to send us that prophet which we believe he did just exactly the only way it's going to be done now now listen what he said that prophet is now he begins to compare the prophet that we've heard with john the baptist john the baptist had a message and his message was brotherhood said there was coming a time when god would make a sacrifice out of the lamb of god a man that was john the baptist message that god's going to have a sacrifice i'm not even worthy to loose the buckles on his shoe i'm not worthy i'm not even worthy to be i need he said i need you need to be baptized in me but jesus jesus said we've got we've got to go through with with all the things that the scripture says but go ahead and baptize me and john said he said he would know him when he come that john would recognize him when he come now come on now think spiritually now i know it's a little deep for wednesday night he said he was sure of his message he said he's this is what john said he said he's standing right among you now and you don't know it that's what john's message was his message was to declare that he's here right now he's right among you and you don't know it now think about the message that brother branham came to to preach to us that he's and you will see it in in later on in this message that he's here that that we've come back to the corn of wheat and he's here he's he's in flesh here he's manifesting himself now and do we recognize it or are we like cleopas and his friend walking along the way with god and flesh right next to them but he was veiled from their eyes because they couldn't look back into the scripture and they didn't understand the things that that had been taught by the prophets the prophets were the one that had written the bible the prophets were the one that gave us the word the prophet threw the prophets through the prophet's word and they failed to recognize that god was manifested in their midst because they didn't they didn't know what the prophets had said brother and said the man who's seen the vision or heard his voice never altogether understood it in many cases he didn't know talking about prophets they just they would speak the word because it wasn't their word it was it was god speaking through them he said it's god's thought expressed through man's lips a thought course is a word expressed he'd done it in every age he set forth a man for every age what's he doing in every age it's he's taking this word this word is being planted in each one of our hearts every belief there's there's there's there's a predestinated amount of believers in every age that are going to believe it and the word is sown and that actually makes the word being planted because romans says for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection first corinthians says so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor this planet is sown it's like the word of god is being planted in you and that's how you're going to be resurrected because the word of god was planted in you and if the word is planted in you you're going to come up from the ground even if you die you're going to come up it's sown in dishonor it's raised in glory it's sown in weakness it is raised in power it has sown a natural body it's raised a natural body there's a natural body and there is a spiritual body that's why brother brahma said if you were a son or a daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew listen to this he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted he knew the age that you'd be planted in so now you're made a creature a son of god manifested son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour what's your predestinated plan and purpose what's your purpose in this hour what's your purpose in this church to meet the challenge of this hour that means when you go into your workplace and you hear all the all the cussing and all the violence and everything you're you're there to meet that challenge to be a light to the people that you work with to be a light to the people in your church he said that's right you was done there before the foundation of the world because god always knew that you were coming well what a blessing and a promise that we had think about that to know that god always had you in his mind there on the cross he had you in his mind now now if you're planting if you're planted what happens when a seed is planted when a seed is planted it starts adding nutrients and it grows and it grows and grows until it comes up brother ryan said when a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother when that one cell goes in there another cell builds on top of that it's not one cell of a human the next of a dog the next of a cat and the next of something else is absolutely straightly human being as human cells building one on top of the other now now if you're feeding on this word of god then what is it building it's building word upon top of word on top of word until you come to a full stature he said when a man is born of the spirit of god he don't inject anything into his life it's unadulterated word of god vindicated for that hour he takes the full word of god he don't put no creeds nothing else into it it's purely unadulterated god's word made manifest among us so look at the bible look in the bible and you can see where what age we're living in then when you see these great things being made manifest what great things are you talking about brother bob i'm talking about the bride coming into fullness i'm talking about these great things that you as you eat the word it builds word upon word because because we're not reading an autobiography of somebody we're reading the actual we're eating from the body word of god and we're believing on something that's not just like a book a self-help book that you can get in the christian bookstore and these things are being added on to us until it comes we're growing just like a little baby grows in the womb until it comes to a place where we've been built up so look look in the bible and see where we are look in the in the calendar of god's word to see what time and what age we're living in brother am said when a man or a woman has said undecrees and coal formal religion if he's ordained to be a son of god and he sees the word of god preached in his power and god vindicated he's an eagle to begin with he'll run to it as sure as twos two is four he can't help it because his very nature loves the word of god that's what happens when you're born again it'll take you right straight to the word why because that's where you get your nourishment this we're running to our ill shadow this is like a little baby that gets all of his nourishment and all of his strength from his mama turns to the breast when we have something that we when we we know we need something so we turn to god's word and that's where we get all of our strength all of our source of everything the source of our life the source of our of our strength in time of trouble is our el shaddai and you can't help it because your nature loves the word of god he said now we realize that we're living in a tremendous time and a great time but when the truths of this bible believers have seen that vindicated the very vindication of it is the evidence that god is in it when you see god's word being made manifest in your life and in the church and in the bride and the people that you love and in your family it's the vending that's the proof the proof of it it's then that the promised word that god god's promised is made known the seed is bursted forth and they see it and they believe it others just can't see it somehow they'll set and look at it maybe like cleopas and his friend just walking along and said and look at it that's why the bible says in matthew 7 jesus said not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he hath do that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven what's his will is his word his will is how are you going to know what you're supposed to do if you do if you look in the word that says you need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you're going to do his will that's his will if his bo if the bible says you need to be born again then your heart will be set on doing the will and you're going to do everything you can to be born again now if the bible says that not to forsake the assembling together even so much as you see the day approaching then you're gonna do his will because the bible says that's what you need to do and you look in the into the bible to see what you're supposed to be doing and if you're not acting the right way and doing the right way then you your heart will be motivated to match up with that because you want to do the will of god but there's going to be a lot that will just say lord lord and not do his will many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and then thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity and brother brown said there's many people just can't believe it even spirit-filled people i'm going to give you one that'll choke you these are his his words you think about many spirit-filled people won't be able to believe it he said the baptism that holy ghost doesn't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have nothing to do with your soul that's the baptism see he said here's the inside soul and here what's the inside soul faith or doubt do you believe now not not based on whether you have emotion or whether you went to a camp meeting or whether you went to a a nice youth service and you and you ran up and down the aisle what do you believe do you believe here's the inside soul in here that has to come from god remember in that spirit in the spirit you can be baptized with a genuine spirit of god and still be lost see that means you could be baptized in your spirit and you can sing good songs in church and and you can do all the things that looks like a christian would do and and see it amongst people and and put on a good show but he said it's the soul that lives that was ordained of god it's the soul that lives now now look at all these examples in the old testament of like caiaphas that he said didn't caiaphas prophesy he was a devil then priest and great man was supposed to be great leaders in them days with humility and everything else but failed to see the word of god itself made manifest before them caiaphas failed to see the word of god there on the cross being crucified he failed to recognize that that was the word of god what did he fail to believe that that was god in flesh balaam when balaam went out as a prophet brother and said it went down there a bishop preacher whatever you want to call him he was a great man but when he consoled to god about going down there and cursing israel god told him don't go but he didn't believe he didn't believe and he said now we find out balaam of course he couldn't see he went out and looked upon the people and said now just a minute we're a great big people up here you're just a scattered bunch you see and we all believe the same god what was balaam's doctrine let's let's sit on this for a little bit balaam's doctrine was we're all the same what's so wrong about that you see where the the world council of churches believes that it turns into we're all the same we're all the same in other words it doesn't matter what you believe it doesn't matter if these people are baptized and wrong over here and they these it doesn't matter we're just we're just all you see what a great deception that is so when you begin to say well i don't understand why ministers are so critical of these different doctrines and things or i don't understand why you're saying these people over at this other church aren't preaching according to what brother rahm said are you say you got to be careful that you don't say well we're just all the same now now now let's not go too far and start putting people out and say well i don't believe they're not born born again or nothing well i'm not saying that now what i'm saying though is it matters what you believe it matters what you believe now see balaam was saying let's it don't matter what we believe let's just all mix together you're it's okay if you're if you're young people go marry people that don't that are wearing pants and makeup and don't even believe like us it's all right to do that because i just believe in mixing that was balaam's doctrine was let's mix unbelief with belief let's mix it all together and put it in a pot and stir it up and we'll just say we're all we're all because that's what his doctrine he god doesn't want mixers he wants separators what a strange thing to think about that god god wants now see what we'll think we'll think in our mind sometimes that that god wants us to just we want to be kind and loving to one another and and lead people to the gospel but he doesn't want us to do like eve and just throw down the barrier and say well it doesn't matter anymore i'm just going to go out and and listen to whatever he he wants us to to discern the word he wants us to be able to look at things with a discerning heart and say that's true well that's not true and when you say it doesn't matter anymore then you're doing like balaam see how dangerous i really want to stress that it's dangerous when you begin to say that it doesn't matter i could maybe nail that down a little bit more but i'm i'ma back off a little you see balaam balaam couldn't see the difference he couldn't see the difference you think about that statement now couldn't see the difference what difference between right and wrong you see what a great blessing it is to be able to see the difference because there's many people you know that i've talked to many people that that can't tell the difference when you listen to a wrong doctrine can you tell the difference when you listen to what some some of the things that are being preached out there does it matter does it matter to you does it can you tell the difference when somebody says it's like we're just well brother around said you can't mix that leaven with the unleavened oil and water will not mix darkness and light will not mix light's so much powerful that just puts the darkness out and so we cannot mix it together neither can you mix sin of the world together you can't mix church and denomination together you can't mix church and creed together you can't mix the world and the gospel together it won't mix come out from among them be separate you see there had to come a time when abraham separated from lot he walked along with him far enough and then he kept look as you're walking up the statue of a perfect man there's going to come a time where you have to pull back from people and say well you you know i that's great that's i love you as a brother i love you but you know we're we're marching on why because you got to stay in line with the word you got to stay with what the word says it doesn't matter what the what the top tier preachers in the message are preaching it doesn't matter what the great men of the message were preaching i'd rather stay with the word and these soda crackers and sit by a branch and all the different things preach to a fence post that then then then then grab on to the coat hails of the great men and the giants so-called great mens and the giants of the message and go let off into some something that will keep me from being able to take a body change because wow because we're coming to a place where the the life has got to go back into the grain and it's only going to go back into the grain by the word and the word is going to cause difference the word is going to cause separation you see when you begin to say well we're just all going to lump together in a great big ball of love and it just don't work because the bible is not meant to to be that way he said i come to i come to bring a sword it'll cause division in the house it'll cause people in your family to be like why don't you believe like why don't you come to our church where we have starbucks and everybody they take the pews out and everybody hops up and down while they while they have a light show in the church and oh you you can't do that because you can't just lump everything together like that because that will make you a balance balaam's could not see the difference there's a truth and there's a false there is a truth no matter how we want to just lump everything together and just say well we just love everybody we do love everybody but you can't love false doctrine because false doctrine a lie a false doctrine a false doctrine comes from the devil anything false is a lie and it came from the devil brother i said remember the sin that israel did by balaam saying they're all the same that sin never was forgiven israel the sin of saying they're all the same he said pharaoh couldn't see it pharaoh balaam couldn't see it pharaoh couldn't see it though vindicated it right before him dathan couldn't see it he went out there said you try to think you're the only one in the bunch the whole congregation is holy god never deal like that he ought to have known better than that he couldn't see it he couldn't see it what does see to discern now i'm not i'm not talking about the discernment like brother branham had the supernatural desire to be able to tell whether somebody was looking at pornography at home or sleeping around with somebody or something i'm talking about being able to tell whether something is true or false like where brother where jesus said in matthew 24 there will arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect if it were possible but the elect is going to be able to tell to discern how will you discern by what comes out of somebody's mouth and if what comes out of somebody's mouth is it doesn't matter what we believe it doesn't matter we're all the same can you not discern can you not tell brother i haven't said so close look the bible said in the last days the two spirits would be so close it would deceive the very elected if it was possible that shuck looks just exactly like the wheat but it ain't the wheat it looks like the wheat but it ain't the wheat it isn't the wheat but it looks just exactly like it it's going to church and sitting there saying i believe a prophet it's amen in the church now i'm not preaching something where we're going around pink finger pointing at one another i i'm what i'm preaching is that that we should come to a place where we know why because the strength of the power of the holy ghost has come up in the church where we know what we believe we know what we stand for and we do stand for something if you don't know what truth is how do you know what to stand for you've got to stand for the truth he said remember the wheat just keeps going on past all the carriers passed all the shock it just keeps on going going on and the resurrection all that strength of the wheat will come right up into the wheat all that strength of the wheat will come right up as it goes to make the head to come out in the great resurrection all the strength of that wheat plant that makes you that makes you as a believer it makes you unique it makes you supernaturally unique that's why he preached that sermon one in a million to think that he said what it what if i'd it'd be that way tonight there's 500 million supposed to be i think christians in the world about that figure just a round figure if the rapture would come tonight then in the living there'd only be 500 people one in a million one in a million that would go because when you believe the word it makes you unique so why didn't coral see that why didn't dathan see that why didn't they have to see that let's let's let's meditate on ahab i know the the time's getting away well i'll be closing in just a minute hang on with me just a little bit longer why didn't ahab see that and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah will thou go with me to ramoth gilead in second chronicles chapter 18 and he answered it i am as thou art jehoshaphat answered i am as thou art and my people as thy people and brother brown said oh he'd do it he first of all he starts off like balaam saying we're all the same but they weren't all the same now you can't help being different it's not you that says i'm going to be different but you know you're not the same you're not the same as the world you've been called out and you've been made different he said jehoshaphat being a great religious man he said well we should go up sure to our church we're all the same people but they wasn't the same people they wasn't the same people you don't look like the world you don't act like the world you don't dress like the world and sometimes you don't dress like other churches you don't act you don't maybe you don't believe like other other people do he said but in the bible it says but jehoshaphat said is there not a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of israel said unto unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me you see how spirits work in the church sometimes ministers will be preaching i remember i remember growing up in church and i remember some of the older ministers preaching about how when they came into the gospel like they'd want to like run somebody off the side of the road or something because it's like you know there's something warring in you until until something strikes to change your nature and see that's why sometimes people will hate the ministers and hate the things that are preached they'll hate you and you're in your for for proclaim for standing for something because if if you the truth when the truth comes against you it it something in unbeliever will rise up and lash out ahab said i hate him he said yes brother brother said yes there is there's one micah the son of emolum but i hate him always that way i hate him because he's always just bawling out our people out and cursing me and telling me all the evil about me i hate the man he said i i don't let the king say so joshua says go get him i hate him now you see in second timothy it says that that's how people would be in this day without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinence fierce despisers of those that are good in amos chapter 5 they hate him that rebuke it rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly in galatians 4 16 paul said am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth because i say the truth see how we won't we want the truth the truth is what will set things in order you know honestly i even i even i i said in my mind when i got married that i was gonna if my wife gave me okra and i didn't like okra i was gonna tell her the truth i don't like you know even to this day i don't i don't like sweet potatoes and i i i told her i don't like sweet potatoes because i i don't want sweet potatoes so the truth you know a lot of people will get all drawn up they won't they won't tell their wife the truth because they're scared of her well you can say it in love i'm not i'm not talking about being being silly or something but you can you can you can have a frank conversation at your table with your family and just just speak truth to one another you can you can because the truth the truth is what will set you free now i'm not talking about be to be without discretion don't be saying saying things without wisdom to to one another but but you can say it in love and truth in a way that will that will that will change things you know if you if you know if your wife's walking out of the house with a dress that's too short or too tight you can pull over to the side and speak truth to her and say you shouldn't wear that and then she'll respect you more for it why because we want truth the truth is what will set you free [Applause] that's why brother roman said there happened to be a god to be that god had a man that they couldn't put their hands on him god had his hands on him he was just the reflector of god's truth he was the reflector of god's truth truth and the second chronicles that goes on to say then zedekiah the son of chennai came near and spoke smoked micah up on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord for me to speak unto thee and micah said behold thou shalt see you're going to see on the day when thou shalt go in an inner chamber to hide thyself you'll see then brother roman said the big bishop walked up and slapped him in the mouth said which way did the spirit of god go he said because i know i had the spirit he he might have really been anointed by the genuine spirit of god but down in his soul he didn't believe he said i danced in it i've done all these things see i had the spirit on me which way did it go but he didn't believe he didn't recognize the word that micah was speaking and brother iran said i'm being a son of god or a real prophet of god he examined his vision with the word he looked back to this book he looked back to god's word that's not just an autobiography but it's a supernatural book and brother ryan said remember it was one word that caused the whole mess to come eve let's disbelieve one word of god in the first of the bible one word caused the trouble jesus come in the middle of the bible said man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and at the end of the bible said whosoever shall take one word out or add one word to it it's the whole word all the word the word of the hour what and micah said i seen god setting upon the throne he called the delegates of heaven said who can we get to go down and deceive ahab said in one lying spirit come up and fell before god a liar a lion spirit and where did brother brown say that lying spirit came from and a lot of different places he would say that lion spirit came up from hell because that's where lion spirits come from anything that's not the truth comes from hell now now you think about that sometimes it's it's human that we're talking about listening to truth truth and sometimes many times it's human nature to not want the truth that we'll we'll listen it's like almost inclination to just not not want to hear somebody tell you the truth somebody somebody will say something about your behavior or or the way that you act or whatever even even sometimes maybe maybe we we don't want to hear the truth about our children we'd rather we'd rather listen to the lie of our that our children tell us than to have a holy ghost field uh believer come around and say well your kids are not doing right or your kids are smoking pot or your kids are living in adultery or kids are going around in the in the church parking lot kissing people between services or whatever it might be i'm just i'm just coming up with examples i'm just saying listen i'm speaking truth will you bear with me as i speak truth because because truth is what we want and listen a lot of times a lot of times you know a lion spirit a lot of lions a lot what is a lion spirit a lion spirit will get on somebody to cover up something to cover up to cover cover-ups to conceal something you know herod got so offended when john the baptist told him the truth he was telling the truth and and he he began to preach marriage and divorce to him and herod herod didn't want to hear that truth because he was it would he he'd rather he would rather listen to a lie from somebody and live in his condition of sin than have somebody tell him the truth why is it human nature to prefer a lie over the truth maybe that's a question to meditate on we'd rather hear a lie out of somebody's mouth if it'll make our life more convenient it'll if it'll make more things easier for us a lie is some an untrue statement with an intent to deceive a lie something to with an intent to cover i remember i i was i was telling my family the other day i remember when i was young and i'd get in trouble and i didn't have the holy ghost and i could lie i'd lie i'd lie to my mom and she'd say she'd say well bob did you do such-and-such no and i could look her in the face and eye like a rug i could lie and then you know going on and then my kids would come around and they'd you know i would i i yes i'm gonna preach on y'all they'd come around and i'd i'd ask i'd ask him but did we'd ask did you do something like did you do such thing no no they they lie they'd lie and you see see now listen now i'm gonna tell you the truth if a holy ghost feel believer or minister comes around and points out something you better take a step back and evaluate things because your kids if they're not if they're not filled with the holy ghost they're going to lie if they're not filled with the holy ghost a little kid running around is going to snatch a cookie off the counter and say no i didn't get it are they going to put a big old dent in your car driving around and say no that wasn't me that did it and they'll they'll have it down so perfect where they can grin and look at you in the face and say no i did i didn't do it and what is it it's you know if you were if you're really living right you don't have to lie or even if you're even if you're not living right just just telling the truth will set you free if you know if you know there's a problem in your life think about how much freedom you would have if you just come right out and open say well you know i got this problem i'm dealing with i got a temper or whatever and just just say pray for me i got a temper and i don't like it i i ran into a car at work and i dinged up the the bumper or whatever and i it caused a big old mess and i i just i just need y'all to pray for me and just tell the truth just speak truth but you see what the devil is a lying spirit that that lying spirit that came up against micah where did it come from it didn't come from heaven it came from hell and any lion spirit because anything that's contrary to the truth the truth is from heaven a lie is from hell when pilate was standing there talking to jesus and he was asking he said what is truth a truth was standing there right in front of him and anything contrary to the truth is a lie and that lie come from the devil and the lie is to deceive a lie is to twist the truth a lie is to distort things so that you don't find out the truth isn't that what the devil did in the garden was distort the truth so that eve wouldn't have power over him and that's why that's what the lion spirit does it distorts the truth to keep the young people from being free it'll distort the truth from keeping your home in order that's why a lion's spirit will get on some adulterous person or somebody and they'll come home and say no i wasn't at that place no you can't look at my phone no but let's search things out and prove them and you know what the devil will do the devil get on some young people and make them do something and tell lies about it to cover up and get them get them get them in a horrible place he'll get it make a young person do something horrible get him off do something terrible and then he'll turn around and point that finger right back at you and say look what you did and then he'll make you hate yourself he'll make you get feel so rotten and so terrible now you know there's a there's a remedy for that the remedy is to run to the feet of the cross remedy there's a remedy here laying in these words because this ain't just an autobiography this these are the words of eternal life and there's a there's a remedy for that when you get in that spot and now look what the devil will do the devil will make you sometimes he'll make you start hating yourself so bad that you'll get in your claws and you'll i hate myself and you start cutting on yourself you'll start slight doing stuff that that don't make no sense and then maybe your mom and daddy will find out and what what does mama what's mama and daddy's reaction a lot of times when they find out they're kids of god in the pit of despair and the devil's making them beat up on their self and make them hate themselves the mama and daddy a lot of times they they react without wisdom and they get all they get they start yelling and and scream what's wrong with you what will i tell you what's wrong with you the devil has got them in the pit of despair and what you need to show them in that moment is not to to drop an anvil on their head but you need to love them show them some love and and lead them lead them to god and tell them tell them now listen i know the world it looks like the world's against you i know everything this ain't in my notes it looks like the world's against you and everything's against you but but there's a god in heaven that loves you and i love you you know you know you should you should always have your home set up as to be like a sanctuary for the young people so that they know no matter what they do this is what i've always told my kids no matter when they were doing things they should no matter what you do or where you go you don't ever forget that your mama and daddy love you and you always have a sanctuary here in this home no matter what you do you can always come back here because this is a place when the world gives you lemons when the world takes you down and throws you in the gutter you can always have a place where you can come come back here and sit in the rocking chair next to the fire and pull up a quilt over you and listen to a tape playing in the background and hear mama and daddy crying out that god will save you why because you got to show somebody love love is how you win one another love will conquer a lion spirit if you show somebody that you love them it'll change it'll change everything now now brother brown said now people say signs and one look at what a lion spirit is he said if people say signs and wonders don't follow it's a lying spirit because it's contrary to the word if the bible says people tells you the holy ghost ain't in this day the same as it was in the other days it's a lying spirit anything contrary to the word is a lying spirit why it because it's anything that will take from you a blessing that god has given from you or add to you all these requirements that you don't need to satis to me anything that will add to or take from the word of god is a lie it's a lying spirit it's them false prophets they're telling you a lie if the spirit just says old liberation of women and do all these other things and go out act like the world it's a lying spirit it's not lined up with the word stay in the word that's right stay right there now look look at all these that couldn't see it and i'm gonna i'm gonna wind up in just a minute he said no caiaphas couldn't see it and judas couldn't understand it but believers can see it believers can see why can they see it why why could cleopas and his friend not see it because they didn't know what the word said but believers can see it because they know what the word says believers can look into the word and they can recognize the day in the hour that we're living in now yeah let me i'm gonna close right here in just a second god sent his prophet as his word had promised of malachi 3 john the baptist a messenger i'll send before my face to forerun is his coming and watch what his message was now brother brown said his message was he said watch that foreigner of christ in that age watch what he said what happened the grain he said i now he said in this message this is what brother rahm said i hope you're not asleep [Laughter] he said i hope you're not asleep he said the grain is here the grain is here it was that bride that part of it but what did he say will happen to the stalk it'll be burned with with quenchable fire and notice in luke 17 where he said in the last days it'll come like sodom and gomorrah again have we got it we got sodom and gomorrah again in luke 17 it says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed when it's back to that sodom and gomorrah condition and the day brother brahman said in the day that the son of man will be revealed the world will be in a sodom condition we've got it haven't we in romans chapter one for this cause gave them up unto vile affections for even their women to change their natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another and god gave him over to a reparate mind to do those things which are not convenient why because they they did not want to retain god and their knowledge so they turned away from god's word and he gave them over to a reprobate mind so in the age of the maturity the maturation of the works of the devil that's when the son of man will be revealed when all the devil's works come to this mature form that's when christ is doing something you see how how you can tell by looking at god's word what day and hour that we're living in so how will he be revealed how will the son of man be revealed how will he be made known how how will a believer be able to tail and the rest of the world will not be able to tell how will you be able to how would you be how did you recognize the prophet's message as the truth how did you how could you tell out now brother i said notice how g i'm winding up right here notice how jesus made himself known to these disciples these two disciples cleopas and his friend he's here the same today as he was that day and revealing himself more today than he has in any other age since that day come through the wheat and stalk and shuck is all past now we're into the wheat again see we're back into the grain watch how he made himself known to these people he said now remember as their messiah of the promised word of the age watch him he refers back to the word of god he never come right out and told him don't you know me i'm the messiah that's resurrected he never said that see he just give them the scripture like john did and the rest of them see they have to pick that out themselves that leaves a job for you and i that you gotta you gotta discern whether it's true or not they have to judge for themselves now brother brown said again now don't go to sleep judge for yourself judge for yourself he said he as john let the word of the bible identify and what he was to them that should have been plain enough if the word had identified him that should be plainly who the promise was they was looking at now wouldn't you love to have been like you you say to fly on the wall to to listen to just kind of buzz along next to cleopas and his friend and jesus walk down the road wouldn't that be wonderful to be able to do to listen to that conversation do you believe that because listening to a prophet you can go back and understand what jesus told him that's actually what brother brown said in this sermon he said now let's let's listen to the words that he quoted think about that you can listen to a sermon and brother brown can replay to you the scriptures and the topics and the things that jesus told these two these two brothers as these two friends as they walked down the road he said would you like to hear what he said to them let's just carry their conversation everybody's awake now so this is what brother brown said that jesus said as he walked next to cleopas and his friend who did not recognize that jesus was in their midst that god was in flesh he said he started off the the bible says he started off with moses he started off with deuteronomy 18 15 and i'm going to be closing that after this he said deuteronomy 18 15 says the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brother and like unto me unto him ye shall hearken and zechariah 11. now brother raham said these are the things that jesus told cleopas and his friend zachariah 11 says and i said unto them if you think good give me my price and if not for bear so they weighed for my price 30 pieces of silver and psalm 41 says yea my unfamiliar friend and whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me and zechariah 13 says a wake-up sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn my hand upon the little ones psalm 35 says false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that i knew not now think about jesus as he's walking and he's he's he's where's he going black to the word and he's pulling out of the word these scriptures that paint a picture of who he is and as these words bit as the story unfolds they begin to realize that he's in their midst isaiah 53 says he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth and not his mouth isaiah 50 says i i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting psalm 22 says to the chief musician a psalm of david my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring isaiah 9 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and psalm 22 says they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture isaiah chapter 7 says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel psalm 22 says all they that see me laugh me this corn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him psalm 22 14 to 18 says i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth through my jaws and that has brought me into the dust of death for dogs have come past me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture and all these things were what jesus told cleopas and his friend and brother branham replayed all these things in this sermon he listed out all these scriptures that jesus quoted to them isaiah 53 says therefore will i divide with him a portion with a great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressions and isaiah 53 9 says and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth psalm 16 says for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption and malachi 3 says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts and he said it was now that they began to see who had fulfilled these scriptures that was promised of that day it was then after it was late they began to see as the day grew down and that sun began to sink the evening light began to come on and wha what are the evening lights the evening lights will shine in this in this latter time as the sun sinks as it gets begins to get darkness when you believe the word for your day and the light begins to shine in your heart you actually become a light to shine in this evening time you are that evening light and how will you be identified as the musicians come you will be identified just the same way that jesus was identified that you can look back into the word of god and see what the word says about you that you can recognize your place in the word that you traveled the same journey that abe abraham did you came the same way that ruth did you came the same journey that david did that you did not disbelieve the word like eve did and you you came through all these battles and things like the children of israel did through the wilderness and you came into the promised land of the rest of the baptism of the holy ghost he said they knew you because see they hadn't been briefed on the scriptures but if you believe if you look into the scriptures and you believe you can look back in the scriptures and recognize your day and it's a message let's stand to our feet and just worship [Music] there are souls to rescue there [Music] sing the lord [Music] forevermore [Music] [Applause] say [Music] let it shine from [Music] let us pray that [Music] like spirit everywhere [Music] [Applause] [Music] let us [Music] shine from
