didn't he that's our desired that's right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 24 it will go from Matthew 24 to James 3 Matthew 24 James 3 remember the many sicknesses among the people and things and all the all this old bugs going around just keep praying one for the other now remember the the Bible study will be the first Saturday in December remember our Christmas time together will be December the 14th uh one service that day remember that what's not service will be on Wednesday December the 31st and brother uh William borlavon will be with us breaking for that service so remember each one got a good report from the stress test they said that I had no heart diseases we appreciate the Lord for that and no heart diseases you know they do confirm I have a heart no diseases of it so that's the main thing right but Matthew 24 in James Street the heavenly father we thank you for this night that you've given us that we can come together Lord and take a little time in the middle of the week and just sit down underneath the shade tree and and let you speak to our hearts and our lives we ask you to forgive us of our many sins and cleanse us of all unrighteousness and may your love be made manifest in each one of our hearts and our lives this night that we may see you living among us and father just remember the sick you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered from destruction so we believe it just have your way now and just let your grace be sufficient for all of our needs may I speak Lord what you would have me to say and close them out to what you wouldn't want to be said we love you in Jesus name amen Matthew 24 I'm going to try to continue on a little bit on what we were on Sunday afternoon so then we'll pick up this part and fit it in here all right so you go to Matthew 24 15. when you shall see the Abomination and desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understand that we know who that is what that's the mosque of Omar right all right then let them which be in Jerusalem flee into the mountain let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of this house we know that happened Titus in in ad70 right neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days we pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day because the Judean heals were snowbound and Etc right so for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no Nar ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened now if I fail to get to that in a minute I want you to think about something what if World War one had not ended when it did you know they don't know why it ended what if World War II had never come to an end you realize we would been blown to smithereens why can't you connect that together then if he don't do something himself is going to blow everything and it did would have if it hadn't been for him getting it ready for us all right so think about that except those days should be shortened or should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened therefore If any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shows show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect all right now to a little part to go with it to the pickup in James three and we'll go with verse 10. out of the same mouth proceed as precedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things are not so to be got the fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree by my brethren by Olive berries either of Vine figs so can no Foundation both your salt water and flesh all right let's just stop fresh excuse me let's stop there you may be seated all right now we Sunday we spent quite a bit of time covering some things and and I want to just review back just a little bit and then come up to where we want to talk about tonight and uh you know we saw that Sunday the real you the real you was what we were talking about and we were taken from you know the scriptures there where it says there's a a new heart and a new spirit you know and I'll put my spirit in you all right then we know that most people misunderstand that and they think you know a new heart and a new spirit and then they they think that's the Holy Spirit that's the way the prophet said it all right but he said that's not true he said then you've got to put my spirit in you all right now oh I wish we could understand one thing we uh talk about the new birth all right and it's so massively confused by the people of this message until now they're saying that brother Branham changed his point of what the new birth is and different things and Wade was bringing it out so marvelous the other day from there in the future home where he said I've taught three processes from the beginning well then where did he change of course they got it all laid out you know but uh the same people is doing that is the same people that were confused over the scripture of a new heart and a new spirit and then put my spirit in you now what do you think that means I want to get this off just a point see I'll give you a new heart now we know he doesn't take the heart out and put another heart in that's not at all all right but what does he do he works upon that heart to Mellow that heart to the point that it can be unusable all right and you know it's not taking it out and putting another in it's it's working upon the nature if you want to call it of that of that person and bringing it out all right then when it says to give you a new spirit well the prophet said you couldn't even stand yourself with that old Spirit but now what does he do did he take out your spirit and put another spirit in or do you just work upon the nature of it you know did he just work up on the point of of you know converting it but see we read you know he gave us a new heart boy I got a new heart back then you know and he says I give you a new spirit well oh yeah we got this new spirit go to my spirit went out and his Spirit came in well I I can't see it that way I'm I'm sorry if if uh if you don't agree with that that's your business but you know we can read the quotes from The Prophet to where he says these things but the people are not going to believe it anyway he says he doesn't give you a new spirit he said he just changes the nature part of that spirit all right he just works upon it he doesn't take it out and put another all right now when it says and I put my spirit in you all right now I thought we believe that that was the Holy Spirit you know all right and I thought now the Holy Spirit was the person of Jesus Christ in spirit form that would come into an individual and that it would not um take out as much as we think but work upon what we are to bring that Israel trying to do at the end bringing it to Redemption me and you you get all of these things of the two Soul doctrines and all kind of doctrines it goes in there and people trying to prove this point prove that point and simply missing the Simplicity of salvation and what we're here for you know I mean we we do talk about a change of the body that that mankind didn't talk of down Through the Ages but you know that they did talk of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and they did teach that in the book of Acts right well well see then when we talk about and the prophet say you know we were saying we received the Holy Spirit that they did on the death Pentecost because there's only one Holy Spirit all right and the Holy Spirit being the person but do we lay on that as a person or is it just some spirit well you can be this a little bit here and Float over here and Float over there I thought it was a person now it's not the person of Jesus the flesh man that comes and lives in you at the new birth or wherever all right that's plain sensible you're not need a revelation for that you know the human fleshly man no it was the soul that was in the man right but that soul that was in that man according to the prophet was almighty God or else yours tied up in trinitarianism all right but see being the person of Jesus Christ not the person of Jesus to come and live in you it's not those type of things like I said we read I'm giving you heart oh he just took my heart Out Boy when I was when I was 20 years old I got a new heart I could have went down to the doctor the day before and My Old Heart would have been going boom boom boom boom but I I got a new heart now it's going on now really I hate to be that arrogant but that's just plain stupidity you know so then do we really know what happens in the new birth and what is a new birth and brother Branham would say it's God and you and are together now watch him as persons well that's what I argued with the two Soul people they were talking about two Souls you know before you I said brother Adam taught Two Souls after he was converted if you're going to teach anything the old Indian you know the white dog black dog when I said that wasn't his point you know as he's trying to explain the Plan of Redemption all right but now do you understand what I'm getting at now whether you believe it or not understand me because I I'm not responsible for for revealing it I can't do that I can only speak to you about it and try to do the best that I can with understanding that right which is very limited okay now then we got into talking about the the three Realms of the human being and we we showed you because I've done this for 40 something years that I saw it back then that brother Branham up until 62 basically taught I said basically because he interlaced the words because it was inner able to interlace back and forth all right but up until about 62 right in there on the uh you know speaking on the greatest battle ever fought up until that point he would cover body Soul spirit right but then afterwards he comes along through the opening of the word and I invite you to even listen to spoken words I mean the the greatest battle ever fought and watch him floating between Soul and Spirit and seemingly you know talking back and forth but he gets on into the message and then he after the seals is open and things what does he say he says body spirit soul all right well I've had him to say it to me you know people say well we've already correct that at he didn't have to correct it I said that 40 years ago I still say it today he didn't have to correct all of that it didn't need correcting he always gave the body five senses she tastes feel smell in here amen he always gave the second realm memory reason conscience imagination Etc he always gave the center Realm Faith or doubt not faith and doubt he gave it Faith or doubt greatest battle ever fall where he covers it and he covers it on when Divine love is is projected he talks about one sins it can't be two in there you can't have God and the devil in your soul at the same time now you can have God in the soul and the devil motivating this rest of you yeah but that's what I just read there in James a fountain can't give forth bitter and Sweet Water see something's got to happen all right then what is it see it's always been as I said he didn't have to correct it because he was right he just had his wording of the realm that he would be speaking up and he called it Spirit or he called it soul would you check it now and see if I'm right well you can come pick it up I just don't believe it well okay we'll be but listen he never changed right the senses of the realm that he was speaking of that is a great major point of being under able to understand the message it is to me now it may not mean a thing to you because we're going to get into it a little bit in here and I'm going to ask you some questions as we go along and to see what you think about it the Bible said it's the soul that's sinneth shall die you know it's your soul lives on after death your body your spirit is gone but your soul lives on right so which one is the most real of you you see where he would have been and that's where the people of the messenger see they take a quote and they'll they'll bring it and say well look at her I read you what the prophet said but they won't take the understanding of where it like I said where he would say Body Soul spirit but he senses is lined up then he'd say body Spirits oh in his senses is lined up you know he was a prophet but you know being a prophet he had to learn he used he used to say it if you agree with this one he said I used to think Jesus loved me and God hated me he said until I found out it was a self-sane spirit or person all right now in in doing it remember what we've done with the bottle and showing I brought them back out because I wanted to you know to use them again now this is one bottle but I got to show it with three bottles all right because they ain't but one of you all right now there we are without Redemption Body Spirit and soul lost now then by the new birth in the finality of redemption you come forth now that's the same bottle I just have to illustrate it you know but it's still the same bottle Body Spirit and soul when we walk off of this Earth Body Spirit and soul is going to be right would you agree with that at least so it's the same person but the person has went through Redemption it's not taking all these cups and put them up here put this cup in that in this one and no you'll never get the story because you can't come out with one and use one thing I can take a one cup and put the black in it pour out the black pour in the clear in one cup but that kind of get messy up here so if you don't understand why I use the two different ones but that's the same bottle all right now see you can't have in you in your soul God and the devil living together because God won't dwell in an unclean Festival well it's just lay in our dormant but it was eternal that's your two Soul doctrines well if it was eternal you didn't need salvation that's plain sense of what took care of that Jesus didn't have to die so that wiped out all Redemption and we were a messed up bunch of people but remember now if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight whether you agree with me or not I want you to understand one thing the soul came into being first so it's more real the soul is in being as real after the body and spirit is taken away in what we call death so the soul is the real you that was what I was trying to get out Sunday the real you that's what you are now if I don't even get into the notes or anything about it just remember what I'm talking about the real you Ezekiel 18 4 says All Souls are mine the devil can't give you a soul and that's what your two Soul people talks you know they will give you one God give you one all he had to kill was one the devil had because God already gave you the other and it was eternal you'd be surprised how much people believe that and deny the two Souls all right your soul was made up before the foundation of the world all right you want to read it demonology but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Spirit of man not a man in his own image it's not m-a-n if you'll check the original used to be in the book not m-a-n not man in his own image but man in his own image not man this is not the image of God this is the image of the Beast the soul of man came first all right and as he did according to my understanding if I'm wrong I'd like to correct me but I thought that that man was in the garden that soul that man was in the garden to lead the animals before he was put in human flesh now that's my understanding I don't know what you've got and I'll be glad to show you all of these things in the prophet's message but see we think about the soul of man as not being now we're going to get to this in a minute so we'll use it the two Soul people said the soul is just the nature of the spirit there is no quote for that in brother Reynolds message I want to hear it if it's dark he never says the soul is just the nature of the spirit because that would mean it's just anything it could just be this or it can be that it can be anything he always said to soul is the nature of the spirit well that's just being technical well then okay the next time you want to get baptized I'll baptize you and father son the Holy Ghost okay do you understand what I'm getting at we're going to be technical let's be technical because if not let's go back to our trinitarian Doctrine but not think about it soul is the nature of the spirit now what about where he says the spirit is the nature of the Soul now you just got some nature or some form you got cats and dogs with natures bird dog hound dog bird dog points hound dog don't you just got Nature's right now with our understanding and with the illustration of the the two bottles one being an unsaved person the other one being a saved person I wrote a random used in in uh future home where he said draw the heart he draw two hearts but to me that's the same heart this heart had everything in it garbage you know and a sin and this and over here had to dove that's before your salvation and after your salvation well he never said it was one hey I'm glad you're able to read but are you able to listen to the Holy Spirit what about that because you see the way that we look at it we look at the spirit if you don't make that to sin around you know the older quotes the new parts you don't want to make it soul we still just say it's the nature of the spirit or nature of the Soul now what makes a bird dog point when it doesn't have to be trained you understand you've got to train it to do the right and to do everything right but it's automatically born you've ever around dogs automatically born you know to point we said well that's his nature well now you've got the hound dog that he likes to run rabbits and true raccoons and Chase possums and damn but he don't point he don't stand at the bottom of the triangle why because that's not his nature are you Gideon his nature is just to chase the animals and you don't have to train them to do that right yeah when you're thinking about Soul being the nature of the spirit or spirit being of nature so what are you thinking about well it's just the nature because either ones you want to put what you're talking about you know it comes out to the same word right soul nature the spirit Spirit nature of Soul comes back to the one place that you're looking at something and whatever you're looking at is the nature of that whether you want to call it Spirit or whether you want to call it soul and you're looking at it as a just what it does huh now why do we get to the end of the message which I'm sure it'll be Sunday but you know the prophet talked about anointed ones now if the Holy Spirit had not corrected his language where would he have been when he tried to preach souls in prison he would have been preaching Spirits in prison and he couldn't have got it lined up now our bodies are pretty real we dwell on that but you know the spirit within that body the body is worth nothing by itself right right it can't do anything right even the sea taste feel smelling here will not work unless there's a spirit inside of the body agreed all right now so of what we think of the body being real but the spirit is what motivates that body but is that Spirit that's within us just a spirit you know something floating around and we look over there our hours of spirit remember you can't see a spirit right unless it makes itself manifest through some natural form and that's what everybody's scared of they're scared to go walking down through a graveyard the fear is not in the graveyard the fears in you his brother Harris said the best place for them to go at night and get a good night's rest you know where it was at right down in the middle of the graveyard he said because them people were scared of them spirits in the dark and it wouldn't come in the graveyard huh but you know there's never been a spirit able to hurt anybody right right it may make you hurt yourself it may make you hurt somebody else but that Spirit can't hurt you it's just a spirit but see that's where we get tied up with making then the third room of man whether you want to call it Spirit or what do you want to call it soul we want to make that as just some Spirit be in or something when we just read where the Prophet said the Bible says All Souls are mine the prophet said All Souls were made up before the world well that's pre-existence brother Dale well that's pre whatever your Prophet said right you want to argue with him and we can go back and cover how that that was in the mind of God and spend great lengthy discusses upon it discussions upon it to get it right but I think we ought to be having it about right by now you know after all of these years that we've had to study the message I think I want to know a little bit what are you trying to say brother Dale I'm trying my best to tell you that that Soul that's within you is more real than that body that I'm looking at or that reaction of a spirit within you to cause you to raise your hands or to do or whatever or on a rare occasion Say Amen because you see the soul is going to live on after we're gone into the ground and the Soul has to be destroyed the soul that sentence that shall die doesn't say the spirit of sinneth didn't say that so look where the Prophet would have been had he kept covering the center Realm and spirit well what did that matter it mattered enough until God corrected him and you show me after the seals broke where he was talking about Body Spirit Body Soul spirit no you'll find it Body Spirit and soul he had it in the right order but if you don't get nothing out of the message or not remember I'm talking about the soul of mankind as being more real than anything you can tangibly think about right see it's real I can cut your head off that'll deliver your spirit in your body but your soul will live on now but I remind you we will get to this the bread of random beyond the curtain of time he calls that Souls under the altar he calls it theophany and you know he could feel in people come on they hugged him but see that's where you separate soul and theophany say you want to do that and try to put this way off up you under somewhere you got your problem but now I want you to think about one individual and saying the soul is the nature of the spirit you know that's right that's what I showed you with a bottle that is an unregenerated person his soul is the nature of his Spirit or his spirit is the nature of his soul because why because the whole individual is lost right So when you say soul is the nature of the Spirit Well I'm going to say spirit's the nature of the Soul it doesn't bother me because it's one individual then when it's converted you don't leave them up there together that's two and last time I counted anyway you know but you got that and you know what that is a born-again Believer as I said ready for the Rapture because I did tell you we still have some problems with the body and spirit if you can see the lines around the side the body and spirit is what's giving us our trouble but one day when we leave out of here it's going to be that but you know what this is a born-again experience inside and there ain't no devil in there so whatever is inside of you wants to come outside but we're human and we have troubles all right but then I can say the soul is the nature of the spirit why because or say the spiritual nature of the Soul wherever you put it at just remember to put three rims one two three adiram second rim surgery whatever you want to call these if you want to be to where you can't stand it though it's got to be sold you know body souls and spirit well just remember whatever is on the inside of you is displayed out through the second rim of memory reason conscience affections whatever you want to call that and it's displayed through sea taste field smelling here right right if you want to say the soul is the nature of the spirit fine with me because you're saying that whatever is inside of you is coming outwardly if you want to say spirits of nature of the Soul whatever you're calling the center Realm that's what's in charge on the prophet one greatest battle ever fought said it dominates you that's right all right so it's not Faith or doubt right it's doubt before the New Birth it's Faith after the New Birth and then that Soul within there the way I believe it it works back out through my spirit but my spirit is not born again another way I'm saying it Body Spirit soul because I'm lining it up to where I can talk about anointed ones because if you talk about anointed ones with the early quotes from Brother Branham you got a problem but you're too dumb to think about it or consider it excuse me for that language but there's one thing about it you don't wonder what I mean right so you say well it's just a spirit where are you going to make the soul is just a spirit where are you going to make the interim of mankind this is some spirit you can't do it you got a problem you're just getting a replacement of things do you understand see then if the spirit is the center Realm then where are you going to go over to where brother Brandon says that the anointing is on the spirit so that put the anointing inside you're going to swap women now he said you're going to be happy to jump back out because see you're going to have the soul a problem then you can't just keep saying well it's just the nature of it you get it you're gonna have to make up your mind one way or the other but if you hold a point that the spirit is the center Realm when you come to anointed ones you're going to be putting that anointing into the center Realm and that gives you the new birth and it won't be anointed ones it'll be the anointed one yeah you see what I'm getting here yeah but this is the way I believe it well that's all right play what you want to I'm just saying that if you're listening you're understanding that when you say the soul is the nature of the spirit putting the spirit in the center stole the second realm the body outside then when you come to anointed ones you got a problem because you're going to be giving them the new birth we'll run around and says you can have the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit on your spirit and be lost so you better get your senses lined up and get the fire for the body and to fight for the second realm into one sense for the center Realm and get it lined up Body Spirit and soul see then you can make the center realm to be the right one all right see what my point is whatever is on the inside is going to work outwardly so when we were lost the devil was on the inside he was the one kin folks to us right according to the Book of Ruth and God had to come down to be kin folks to us to take away that deal that Satan had on us because see I don't have to make many different drawings I can understand what the new birth is ever what you do of the new birth you've got to put God in the center Realm but just because you're born again doesn't make your memory reason conscience you don't get a birth in that we need one I agree with brother Lee Vale when he said we need a baptism when the Holy Ghost on our brain I agree but I don't know if it ever coming what are you listening now see that inside of you is the real you more real anything you could think of because it came into being if you want to call it God's mind whatever you want to do it that's fine but he was the one that said that those Souls were made up when God said let us make man all right so when he made it up he he made a soul right now let me run real fast if I can go to number two this is the cruelty of seeing 19 in 53. and look what he says made him out of the Dust of the Earth now not in his own image it already made the man what did he breathe into him the Breath of Life and he became a living soul now therefore the 99 of the people the message today believe you come here with eternal life but I don't believe that I believe we need a new birth and to do that you must go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings eternal life now that's what I believe all right but look and he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living Soul sold the soul of the man of man is the nature of the spirit now watch when you're born when you're reborn you don't get a new spirit watch him you get a new nature of that spirit it's the same spirit but a new nature of it you take two men stand them together both look alike one of them is a sinner the other one is a Christian one man said I got a spirit in the same as you have okay but one of them is different his soul his nature is different he's been changed I want to keep emphasizing one thing there's a lot of difference between a spirit and a soul a spirit Works through your brain has to to make your sea taste feel smell in your work but it works through your brain in your memory your reason your conscience and things and it's the spirit within you that soul is the real you and if you could some way take that soul out of that individual and stand it right here do you know what it looked like it looked like you not 70 now come on we got a little more sense it would look like a 20 year old man but it'd be me and you know what if God allowed your eyesight to be able to be moved and the things to happen you could see me you could feel me you could talk to me when brother random went beyond the curtain of time he was there with people that had senses I've even told you before about it see that was where years ago that I was wrong and I've told you because I'd always seek theophany and soul but see no senses but yet brother Brown does emphasize one thing he says in that theophany beyond the curtain of time they said we don't eat but he said they had all the senses now watch when we get to it where Jesus went to hell and preached to the souls now what's in the need of preaching to a bunch of spirits that are just floating around us you can't do nothing with them you know that when he went to hell he saw people and he preached to him right he came back up by Paradise and picked up not just a spirit right he picked up a person and we'll get to it in a minute where brought around the city he was in his soul in his theophany when he went to hell well he was still in his soul it's theophany when he picked up Abraham and all of them and brought him up and you know Abraham was so human-like until he said Sarah we're being recognized we better get out of here okay what about him look at this one on souls in prison now 63 11 10 paragraph 36. now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit that's right exactly right amen God whatever is displayed which Rim you're talking about it comes from The Sinner and displayed outwardly but just remember the reason you better agree with the spirit is being the second realm you can still be tempted in spirit you want to argue the case the Lord Jesus may I quote your prophet could be tempted of women it had to be an experience certainly wouldn't any soul well it was just his body your body can't be tempted without a spirit to motivate it it's dead the body can do nothing all right are you listening and when the nature of a man when he said we're dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hidden God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died come on the nature which is the soul so the soul is the main point come on the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living Soul then you begin then right so when we come into the world God breathed the breath of life into her so but get to Point the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the devil okay can I put the bottles back up the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's the devil that's simple plain simple let's don't get in these gray areas people want to do that today yeah but you we got to have a little great no you don't have no gray areas in God he's either inside of us or he's not inside of us you're either born again or you're not born again now the title of the message is not is are we just anointed ones are we just anointed so he breathed into the nostrils and he became a living soul I've got some down through there about that and we're the man in the garden and whatever but if you don't know what I'm getting at now so the soul is the real you more real than your spirit or your body see the soul is the one who lives on after death all right we know that the soul then says is the theophany the Earth's worded it gets hard for people to follow you to say the soul is a theophany no no no no now brother Dale the theophany is off up yonder somewhere and we're going up there well if that stature of a perfect man is you then I don't see love being too far gone up above us it just needs to be made to our connections what are you listening you see why that you can go to church and be good exactly right you can shout Glory Hallelujah cry pray and still be lost now where you lost at but is that soul to you real or is it just a spirit it's just the nature of it it's just it's just the nature of it is the of God no you're either born again or you lost let's see go to number five jump a couple of them save a little time let's go to Hebrews number five all right this is paragraph 279 Hebrews chapter 2. but the difference between a man an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal now stop there and think God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal but an animal has a certain amount of reasoning factors it has a certain amount of emotions right it loves its Offspring it'll die for itself it has certain amount of those things what in the memory reason conscience you see it can't think like I've always told you I know I get hard would you take an old male buyer that has really got old an old board they call him and you know what he'll do he'll be sire at what the word is he'll have a baby bye female buyer and you know what he'll do he'll go kill that baby and you know what that Mama most of the time will die trying to save her a young one because that's the memories the reason the conscience is what little bit they have but you know what a few months later that female buyer will be looking that male up to mate again yet it's the one that killed The Offspring because there's your memory of your reason your conscience but there's no soul there the man has a soul and watch him God put a soul in a man put a soul in a man you know now then here's the man so he put in the man a soul because the soul that was in the man is that theophany no no brother Dale theophthany's up yonder it won't be converted from it anyway but what are you going to do with the rest of the message what are you going to do with number six questions and answers on Hebrews here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also and was witness to them that they repented not in the long suffering but see you don't even read the scripture but brother Dallas got to be up the undercover the Bible said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one lady yeah if we don't reach this place we got one waiting now for us right call love what are you thinking look at adoption 1960. Paul says it does not appear yet just exactly what kind of a body we'll have we know we'll have a body like his what did he ever have what did he ever have that theophany body yes yes amen Jesus says yes sir when he died the Bible said that he is a personal pronoun again he went to hell and preached his souls in prison Hallelujah how did he do it he had senses of feeling come on he's in his theophany he had censored a Feeling he had sensitive hearing he had sensitive speech he preached with that same kind of body I saw those glorified ones in the other night he preached to the souls that were in hell every penny not in the long suffering in the days of Noah so evidently his soul was his theophany but he had the senses go ahead at number eight Hebrews chapter 6. it was the only visible form that the spirit had about the son of God and it was a theophany it means a body and the body was like a man Moses saw it when it passed through by The Rock and he looked at it said it looked like the hind part of a man through theophany is real what I'm trying to get you to see Jesus went to hell in theophany in his soul so his soul was his theophany but you still want to say my soul is here and my theophany is out yonder read the scripture if question this Earthly Tabernacle were you read your Bible if this early Tabernacle were dissolved we have one right right is it there or is it here which one is it all right look what he brings it out to me that was it and that was the theophany which was the son of God that son that logos became flesh because we were put in flesh and the theophany of the logos became flesh they're among us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place or the entire Fountain dwell in him or do you see it there it is that was the one what about it back part of a man that Moses saw what did that back part of that man looked like I believe it looked like Jesus Christ you can take your own opinion and do what you want to the theophany have things look at the next one questions and answers 385 going up number nine it was a theophany to God that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see a better eye it didn't have ears like you hear but a far more hearing see it was a theophany and all this rainbow condescended into the Moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back parts said it looked like a man now according to Hebrews 7 4 melchized it says the man you remember but around him explaining that all right look at the next one questions and answers on Hebrews this is paragraph 841 number 10. well my dear sainted brother my dear signage sister before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image or created the The Man In His Image and created a woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in it theophany and Moses saw him Moses cried Lord let me see you did you catch the and it was the back part of a man did you catch the quote about two away from this one where he said that theophany is the son of God I thought New Birth made us The Offspring of God I thought that it was Son of God down through seven Church ages I thought a Son of God you can't talk about it Son of God being an eternal sonship we test this offspring he made it theophany just like himself when he said let me get this part okay if you're not catching on then you're just pray uh look at number 11. this is taking off in the north at knot and God he talks about making the three rings he says God that's God he made the three rings he said that's God God in a Trinity is One to remember the tree rings is one person not a trinity of persons follow me watch now and God God is a trinity a trinity in one we're down here without a trinity he's not God he can't be manifest any other way and neither can you be manifest without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit soul without either one of them you're not complete see you don't have you didn't have a soul and what he's he's saying it like if you didn't you know you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be or nothing you know you wouldn't be nothing you didn't have a body you'd just be a spirit not a body now so as God is one so are we one Body Spirit and soul right you know why because my body is displaying what's in my soul right now in my spirit Within Me is trying its best to reason every factor in trying to to look at you and saying well some of them is agreeing some of them are different some of them still Sourpuss and some of them just smiling so at least some things are working okay let's get done in a hurry go ahead and North it not what's this about anointed ones and north at not which is number 12. what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is what you're talking about now people can live in this Spirit they can dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost and just as devil possess as they can be that's right with that spirit so now you better make sure you get your soul and your spirit right okay and I'm still with you the soul is the nature of the spirit the spirit is the nature of the Soul I've been through all of that whatever's inside of me is going to come out here's where the trick comes a genuine Holy Spirit can anoint that Spirit of that individual right now watch it because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she was wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her Bobby and her hair was wrong well what's your higher Got to Do With It Well it did the Samson okay whosoever so I had one word to this or take one word out of it you got to have the ultimate somewhere that's why you can't tell that woman it's wrong to cut her hair and if you are cutting your hair just to end off to straighten it up you can fall in the category of anointed ones not as true Christians is it a question are we anointed ones but remember back up there are you shouting the spirit you go to church every day in your life you can get a gold star when you die until put it on your casket and say they're going to heaven you notice nobody goes to hell anymore all right but look at him so we know he's talking about the spirit realm right anointing ones are anointed in the spirit Realm now can I take a second to explain see in body he was my brother right in spirit he's the spirit of almighty God in Soul he is the the Eternal person amen amen all right now so then you and I are body Spirit come on Soul right we're born again in Soul not in body and spirit so God can come down and anoint and listen anointed ones are anointed ones I'm glad to be an anointed one oh you don't like that you better be glad to be I'd invite you to go home in your computer and run in the word anoint all right and run it back through there of the oil and the ways of the things you'll come out with a different thought you'll say brother Dale I really want to be anointed I just don't want to stay as those who are anointed ones but are false not the anointing is false the anointing is genuine but if that soul is not born again what good is it but what's the difference in you or somebody else you're not born again in your body the Holy Spirit comes down through the goodness the Bible said to call us to repentance and makes our spirit start Desiring and longing for him and if we stay in that realm we can be anointed for great things but if we go on to the new birth you see the anointing on you quickens the word in your soul that's right that's why I said I'm glad to be anointed because it quickens the word of my soul but if the devil is in my soul he can anoint my spirit and it won't do a bit of good I'm still lost are you following me the new birth is the anointing of the spirit that cleanses the unclean Spirit goeth out of the man walketh in dry places find us rest then it comes back right Iran said the most dangerous stage is sanctification because see you think you're a Christian that's that new spirit he spoke of in Ezekiel I know that I've stirred some thoughts in your mind tonight because you see I look at two people sitting there and I look at those two people and I see both of them crying out for God I see both of them Desiring God and what are you going to do the good old-fashioned way is brother Dale let's just leave them alone because they love the Lord you can love the Lord every day of your life die and go to hell it's whether or not that soul is born again or not did Balaam have the same anointing or was he anointing on Elijah anointing on Elijah was not in his soul because he couldn't be born again so the anointing on Elijah was the same as anointing on Balaam what was the difference the word you remember the disciples there were many walked with the Lord Jesus but it says that some of them took the word and held it when they went to the upper room there's the New Birth the anointing coming down because remember especially in the last days come on I went through it right he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh how can you tell the difference in them we'll read that in a minute you go back to the word see that's why you're missing it you think this is a goody goody Affair sometimes I got to be rough I remember brother dick one time was talking about a certain situation he said I'll pick up some stones and say who's going to cast the first one I said I'm the pastor I got to cast the stone I have no choice you want to swap places with me I've got to cast the stone why because I got to stay with the scripture you can Petey pattern how much you love and you lovey-dovey Duffy's don't lovey-dovey with me you go right out there in that church system and find more love and displayed then it's displayed in this building right here well where are they tell them the word all right let's read a little bit where'd we get to we get number 12. yeah we're at number 12 go to 13. works is Faith Express the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it it don't mean you're saved think of it conference prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him remember the conference the condo priests the lovey-dovey guy yeah till he crossed him this rain falls into just the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with a wheat but it's what it is at the core now here's where you can intellectually can accept and say oh sure that looks good I believe that I still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still It Isn't So because if that Soul hasn't come from God let me rephrase if that Soul hadn't been born again that's right okay it can make all the impersonation out of there but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have it you can act like you should receive it Christians act like they're Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean that you're saved right that's exactly right see the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life then it come from God it goes to God if you have eternal life tonight you're going to be happy about it if you don't have it you're to be crying you better get something settled and we're running out of time he said with my soul I don't know where it comes from God or not well how do you know what it comes from God or not see what I'll do with the word okay look still on works is Faith expressed roll up to number 14. now remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person like father son the Holy Ghost I love to read but one person three attributes to the same God father who had three officers like fatherhood sonship Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul now the outside body has five interests endless to it to contact your Earthly home see taste feel smell in here the inside which is a spirit it has five senses conscience and love and so forth but the inside of that the soul has one thing that's where you live that's where you live the Inside Man all right let's see okay keep on going because I gave them these on a two-part and notice that it's got to be five if a i t h outside Spirit j-e-s-u-s on the inside y o u see that's how stand here looking at you I don't know a one of you the spirit can anoint me still I don't know none of you but when the inside of the inside breaks in that's God you want me to show you one thing the prophet said he said let me show you one day this discernment is a revelation you've heard that one it's a revelation that's where the outside can reason like a man said well you know I know not supposed to commit adultery all right roll it on up you can read all in between tell him I shouldn't commit Adele to bring it on them because again that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body so when I so and outside whitewash don't make any difference he says and religious people back there call it whitewashing everything else but inside of the inside the soul that just believe it that's the reason I say people can jump up and down and speak in tongues people can shout lay hands on the sick Judas did it and healed the sick and so forth by faith all these great things that are by the spirit still be lost anointed ones on up 15. modern events make clear about prophecy the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean that you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul whoa now if you read that one before you read the others look where your mind would be going I read the others about that the anointed ones are anointed on their spirit so that you'd follow it down to this line if you read this without reading them what would you have I don't have any that's the baptism here's the inside soul in here that has to come from God but then on the outside you have five senses and five analysts to contact your early home inside you have a spirit to find out let's conscious love and so forth remember in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost is the soul that lives that was ordained of God didn't Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord have we not cast out Devils none Great and Mighty works prophesied the great gifts of God he said depart from me he that work iniquity I never even knew you many will come in that day never knew you because you never had any birth all right leadership the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outside expression expression shows what's on the inside right see the Kookaburra many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right so now you know he's talking about it's got to be on the spirit right you see where you just take a quote and read it without it put together what have you got anointed once the end time 17. let me get just a few more leadership going to 17. it's the dolphin only once the end time do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet their faults going to the next an anointing once the end time I just got these where you could read I wish you'd go to anointing once the end time and I didn't mark this one so I'll have to pick it paragraph 46. the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to say Souls that gives them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust it's the same as the Josh the very same Spirit now you can't make it any other way and understand anointed wants with a genuine thing but false prophets false teachers of it or to make a man want to be a false teacher of something that's truth you get down to the mark of the beast he says what would make you want to follow something they cannot be proven to be true the Bible says prove all things let's get to next from 19. this is all still off of and only ones Parker 74. all right notice both of them I'll have to yeah motives both of them both of them anointed now how could you tell which was right in Rome watch what the word promised to Ahab one Prophet following the word right you read all they're talking about one Prophet followed the word one said he didn't give a who what the word said he was anointed are we anointed ones are we genuine Christians look delicious I got two or three more but we'll go on this one the watch Jesus said that in this end time again the two Spirits would be real close together again is that right congregation says amen notice now it will be closer than that was talking about what was behind this is the end time all children God have mercy upon us till it wouldn't even be so real till it would receive the very elect if possible now how are you going how did we tell it in them days how are you going to tell it today the same way stay with the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen just in case you think I can never be totally deceived I agree with you but I want to read one final quote quota number 23. we'll quit look what your Prophet says about it he predicted that the spirit in the system would be so close be so much like the real thing and it deceived the very elected if it was possible the elected whose name was put on the lounge book of life before the foundation were now before I read this let me state it again I believe that the prophet and the Bible the elect cannot be deceived that's right now watch though and frankly it got them so tied up until he said if he didn't cut the work short for their sake there would be no flesh saved upon the Earth frankly it got them right he said brother Dale I just can't understand that puts you in a category of most of all of us without the Holy Spirit to keep us right what do we got right without him to lead us what have we got where can we go well there's more love out there okay that don't mean it is only the word you see why that they've made a lot of Lula I wish they did you should word word all they believe is word word word well that's all I ever known it was yeah but I I know people's got a whole lot more love than you got brother Dale go chase them but let me go with you for a minute and let me cross them and we'll see who's got the spirit of love and I don't have to go with you you just quote the word to them and you'll find out that they'll just slowly back away and I'm not throwing off on nobody you know better than that come on I've been here your pastor a long time you know that I've always said there were people out there just like you and I are people they may make it and we may miss it I don't mind talking like that yeah but I don't want my people to hear stuff like that I won't mind to hear the truth and then you can make up your mind what to do about it I thought this Prophet come to bring us the word I didn't know he come to bring us the spirit promise of the word you see you don't like it you don't like what I said while ago but you draw them three realms and you look at it that Holy Spirit comes down and anoints your spirit but if that word is held in your heart correctly Why didn't it do it to all of the disciples they never held the word right scene of over 500 Brethren after his resurrection 380 of them didn't make it to the upper room oh but the condo you know condo priests carthus just crossing I love everybody and I want everybody to be there but I've also got to stand for the truth and I got to tell it to you like it and tell it to you the way I believe it well don't you think them brothers or are good Brothers I ain't got no problem with being good brother the pope is a good man you ain't never been shot for what you believe they had one a few back from this one they got shot for what he believed his lovey-dovey brought him a bullet am I right yeah but brother Dale you're just too hateful you won't say that when we get over there you'll say thank you come on brother you'll say thank you for telling me the truth you see the difference is whether the word is being revealed to you well I'd rather have the love than the word go ahead but why can't you have the love of God and the word why can't you fall in love with the word why take the sky full of all the things when we've got the greatest it's ever been we've had a prophet to bring us the word sometimes it got pretty rough as a matter of fact I please would plead with you to listen to anointed once the end time and I want you to listen all the way to the end of it to where brother Reynolds said the altars were full people crying out because they were wondering whether they were anointed ones or not because he made it so strong until they were wondering if there was any opportunity for them it's a serious matter what we got brother let's stand there is a fountain of blood what about the word there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from anybody have a name and sinners time and Sanders my sins away the dying live thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God are saved to sin no more saved to sin no more are saved to sin no more desire Lord we know for surely what you do you look down to the desires of an individual honest and then you'll answer that heart so we pray that you would manifest yourself come on and sing and speak to our brother help him to walk very in the Lord just bless him and got him in Jesus name we love you Lord anybody else remembers I know I love the Lord I know I go to church I know it and you can still be lost songs what's your Prophet saying but what about the words is it just our word no there's word and spirit but all we can deal with is planting the word it takes the Holy Spirit to Quicken it everything so you can't turn the word down you gotta you gotta walk according to the word he said but you know I just don't see the love well you know what bless your little heart darling I don't see it in you now what have we got under argument over who's got the best love I didn't think we're supposed to argue we had the best I thought we're supposed to be concerned about being the love of God made manifest in our hearts and our lives to walk in the light of the hour that we're living what do you think about it Lord Jesus just bless us now as we're going our way home sorry for being a little empty tonight Lord but you couldn't stop and to finish I pray that you'd help everybody and give them understanding of what we're talking about we're talking about an inward being and of a man that is eternal and cannot be comprehended or understood in any way because he's an odd person and all of those who walk in the light of the love of Jesus Christ are odd people never understood by people because they think it's something else but Lord you as that man that walked and you was that man that loved but yet you had to condemn you had to say it like it was because you was God and just bless us now and give us a safe journey home that everybody Lord be safe and let your love be with us touch the sick among us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismissed yes is fearless and closely hear him calling now of your name is you man
