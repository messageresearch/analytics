the sick ones among us and just touch each one forgive us of our sins lead us by thy grace in Jesus name visions 5 verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God while submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord hey we're having to speak to them out there you just think oh you know we'd say we want to today because the sisters are at home viewing in but just remember they can get their day back so you know all right why submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's in everything husbands now coming down to us that are here what love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself art that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church now remember what he's doing and that's what he's gonna say here a minute he's describing husband and wife but he's really speaking of Christ in the church all right we all know one familiar with that but I want you to get this part see that he might sanctify and cleanse with a washing of the water by the word they might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love your wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes in churches even as the Lord the church where we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and she'll be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church he's he's he's typing it but he's speaking of Christ in the church all right what is it this is a great mystery all right nevertheless but every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband you may be seated at the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we want to try to cover back and because we've been off services from the different things but I want to kind of tie in the thought back to a couple of two or three weeks ago when we were ministering the clothes see Paul is saying here that he's describing a husband and a wife and their relationship and and their life together and their things and how it should be and he said now I'm speaking of Christ in the church all right I'm bringing it down to Christ in the church and and it's the mystery so I remember the life thought we were bringing that there's a mystery involved in this that's more than just I was trying to express then that you know it is true in the Bible that there's a mystery there of the engrafting of the Gentiles all right them coming in that's a mystery that was not known in the Old Testament even though the people could read they couldn't know it couldn't see it correctly but once it starts unveiling then no that's my whole point once it started unveiling when you come in to Jesus Christ and the crucifixion you know and the different thing and then the life coming and then here you come with the Apostle Paul picking up the Old Testament to express from that Old Testament what is taking place actually there in the book of Acts and during that period of time and all of the things and he's describing Christ in the church as a mystery he knew of the engrafting of the gentiles paul knew of that spoke of it in the scriptures there and in describing it that there was a great mystery there that was not known as I said down through the Old Testament but once it was Prague you know begin to be revealed through Jesus Christ and then their disciples and then Peter turn doing the call turning to the to the Gentiles and Peter going on to the Jews that was not a division in the basis of of troubles and problems it was just a separation in the basis that it would bring Paul to - you know this is where I said it would bring Paul out in the open who would say it he would he would raise up because he would see you know he's seen the mystery he could look back he had that Old Testament background he had that studies of the scriptures and things that he had done all right then all it took was just a few little clicks as we call it a few little points hid in his mind and first thing you know he's covering the whole Old Testament then he can look back in the sea and he can see that Abraham that Abraham was a Gentile see because you didn't have that you didn't have the word Jew till you come over about the second two seconds Kings I believe it is where he comes into the tribe of Judah all right and you know then you wouldn't have a description of dividing between Jew and Gentile but they just wouldn't know Gentile back the Old Testament put in front of the line now you have little points you have Rahab the harlot you have the different things that happens in that and akka said you have them looking back and as Paul looks back and sees that he says are some history already he describes the mystery that the engrafting of the Gentiles was a great mission well I like that because see that's what we are we're the Gentiles I like our part of knowing that we are in the scriptures and we spoke of back there but yet it had to wait until do and really come in a complete point it would have to wait until the end time to come forth to fully understand the Gentiles you know all brought it out and described it at all but yet in the end times when the Prophet came to bring the message then we could begin to see that the situation that existed of the Gentiles coming in to a certain position and what I mean by that certain position is what I tried to explain then that see when when Paul as I said bring in that Gentile dispensation he could describe that he could you know or say this about it and speak to us of the mysterious part but still they were something left for the end time that this prophet would pick it up and bring it in to and show then and bring in the bride and bring in then you can look at all those tops and shadows now you can look at all the Old Testament you can compare it with a New Testament you can see the Gentiles coming in and you see those things do it but remember the Gentiles were not coming in until it comes to a certain spot even though you begin followed the point you begin the the day of Pentecost and the baptism with the Holy Ghost coming forth and all but those were Jews all right even into the book of Acts the Prophet said those were basically Jews will maybe just a little hearing younger of a few Gentiles in and brought in why because it was still a mystery all right so Paul picks that up and he brings it out and begins to describe the mystery alright then holding that mystery would be then as that would be you know we followed it like I've always told you we Baptist we preach to the Gentiles being and grafted in we preached adoptions we preached things like that some of those people back there had pretty decent understanding you could read Scofield's writings you could you know you could bring in the different things and and have a pretty good understanding but you wouldn't receive the real thing now here's the real thing that I've come up to it now so we're gonna drop the bomb shield and then backed up okay see to me of what I'm trying to describe the mystery of the engrafting of the Gentiles is not just an engrafting of Gentiles thing but it is coming to a point that as we've read from Paul saying I'm speaking concerning Christ in the church all right showing that the church right now what was our lifestyle says we were on through the message a couple of two or three weeks ago see the bride is part of the mystery alright now we can follow that we can comprehend it thing and get our thoughts onto that but just remember the bride is part of the mystery all right now here's the thing to be is the mystery of it all though you over the book of Revelation and it says you know that they were that they would be a mystery there in about the tenth chapter and it would come down to the mystery the mystery singular what is the mystery singular that the bride of Jesus Christ Jew Gentile whatever to make up we are because it come into that through Christ is to the point that we are the thing that has to finish this all up alright then finishing it up then the mystery the mystery is that he's going to reveal you now get that point and then we'll back up into and you'll see the day that we're living and what the Prophet tried to do and hopefully but see the mystery to me is all of those things Gentiles coming in all those things happening but each one of them left just a little bit of understanding the great Apostle Paul could bring that mystery in and he could could bring it in to the Gentile dispensation but yet he could not see the finishing up because he didn't know the seals he didn't know those things that would be later to come on see that would be part of the mystery because to me it takes the seals to open to reveal the mystery that's the mystery I'm talking about if those seals opening brings the revelation of Jesus Christ to a complete revelation fullness bringing it up to all finish it up and will bring a rapture we'll do those sign because it's the mystery of Jesus Christ all right but the great mystery is the seals the following the seals not only revealed Jesus Christ you know you know I'm sorry for saying it in the wrong way but seemingly to me the people of the message they can get Jesus Christ out of the seals they can talk about those things but they never bring it back to the results you know I swear I think they're missing the mystery I don't want us to miss it I've tried my best to appreciate for 40 years that the mystery is the engrafting are bringing into existence the real mystery that all of that typed and said in motion and brought into order and as it brings into order now in the last days through the opening of the seals we see the bride across see the seals don't this route follow me now don't mean I don't mean they don't reveal the seals is not to just say the revelation of Jesus Christ as the person as the the you know the the one true and living God all of that star but it goes into the greater in this street which would bring in the bride of Jesus Christ then it would bring and show who we are what we're doing what we're doing here we're here to finish this up all right and there's no listen if she is part of the mystery we'll read it in a minute from cross the mystery if she is part of the mystery then she's got to be revealed that's that's all that I've ever tried to say it doesn't mean that we will be revealed it doesn't mean that you will be made known all right that's good but it means you've got to be made known you are the finishing up of all things the bride of Jesus Christ finishes this whole mystery all that's throughout the Bible ends in summing up into a group of people who will take the Word of God hold that word declare it to be there but to see that she's that part now that's what I said a minute ago now see the people can handle maybe Jesus in the seals or our Jesus Christ in the seals are or they're seeing the Godhead and in a different thing but what about seeing the Godhead in the correct order what about seeing it as we'll read in a minute we get to if you don't well quote them we've got them here then the bride being part of the mystery you know then he's not complete brother branham said without you know we say no no we're not complete no see that's right that's alright we know that we were - no we're not we're nothing but the thing of it is is she's part of the mystery then she's got to be revealed and when she's revealed it's revealed that tor the Prophet says it so drastically that he are the Godhead is not complete without you all right that should be the thing that is prevalent into all of our minds is the thinking of how much he thinks of me and you that he thinks enough to put within us all of the word the message the seals the thing and bring it out to reveal yes Jesus being the Christ but to reveal where he's at and what he's doing see now if Paul is correct saying it kind of way we know he is but if Paul is correct that he's speaking of Christ in the church but describing it as a husband-and-wife situation and bringing it down even to from more than just being a husband wife but being so much that we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh he's going all the way back to the Old Testament bringing it all the way down and laying it down within to her that you and I are at the mystery then can you read the seal book and see the Bride of Christ come on you got your line your ups your man in the Eagle now we know Jesus Christ is be revealed but get the point of what I'm trying to emphasize to us we're in the day when all things is to be made known all right we look out here in the world not to say much about that because that's nothing to us I don't even that doesn't enter this situation but to see the world was pitiful horrible way it's going but yet to say that we could stand back 40 50 years ago and here in a profit now a lot of the people that are listening today hurt literally said under the ministry of the profit literally so and were there when the Dead was raised the sick was healed and the things that happened all right then you can associate with the fact of brother Branham saying that the Ministry of Jesus Christ is back exactly like it was when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee all right but now let's don't stop there see you can come up to a point and cabbies down on something and fail to really move on in all things so then where is it being tied together my point worth if we are the brought across then the Bride of Christ is flexed with his flesh and bone of his bone and he's now revealing her brother branham was part of the Bride of Christ come on right we look at it in a way I preached hard sometimes people back up from that brother Branham was part of the Bride of Christ he was a member of the Bride of Christ he was a born again believer sure he was a prophet he was all of those but he was also under way I love everything all the way you said he said I said that New Testament preacher he said he's just he said he's just a preacher said you know prophet said he's just a preacher well he ain't belittling it he's putting it in the correct order but it sounds like he's belittling the ministry no he's describing the ministry and he was constantly I'll give me these over and over constantly referring to the ministry of Jesus Christ would have to be here well that's what I said back there that's what I've always said we can look at brother Branham amen we see the ministry of Jesus Christ repeat maybe some of us didn't see him physically but we see him by way of the tapes the the things you know and we see him that God was using him to bring the same ministry that the Lord Jesus Christ had all right now the Lord Jesus Christ went on beyond Paul and him right because the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24 priests wat the seals right see then Paul and him never could understand what he was saying but they knew that he was bringing something but see now you and I by what we see to me the something that he was bringing the something that the Lord Jesus was bringing throughout the Old Testament something that God was bringing into view was to try to get the people to realize who they are that to me is the whole goal of all of it that to me is the greatest mystery that could be you say this mystery of Chris this mystery that ole Anderson now the mystery of what who we are who we are and the purpose of being here the Prophet said it he said when the bride begins to say I and my father are one what's him and these other things I like that one he said to shucks we'll pull away we'll see you want to see this shirt pull away get into the word oh well we're told that's where I loved the title of the prophets away he titled signs you see I remember when that was first we had to you know we started getting a few of the types back in the sixties are you know in doing where he would bring out you know like seeds shall not be heir with a shock well I remember thinking I don't know if I preached that message I'd say that shook does not air with a seed you know but I got to thinking about what he's saying the seeds shall not be heir with the show the shucks is going to the ground the shuck is going to the tribulation the bride's not going so the bride's not going to be that seed is not gonna be heir with the shucks it's the shot that pulls away it's not the seed the shucks pulls away to unveil the seed that's why I asked you to to read the mighty guard unveiled and then our the unveiling of God and then the mighty God unveiled and we'll try to get in to a few things and maybe pick up something in into the seat shield on the air with a sugar on like that you know the manifest masterpiece the different ones because my goal is my thoughts is like I said a person asked me brother Russ Duncan asked me the other day said work words you're thinking what are you what are you thinking you know what do you your your what is your sayings you know what are you bringing right now I said one thing for certain I believe in things being positive so right now the now listen to the wording and listen correctly the Ministry of Jesus Christ was back there right but not on the way it come forth when he walked on earth it begin to unfold what he was coming to do all right what was he coming to do oh he was coming to preach this precept well if the bride is part of the mystery come on shirts if the bride is part of the mystery she's got to be revealed he that if she maybe she's got to be revealed know I'm looking for Jesus Christ well you don't understand what I'm saying that's what I'm looking for but I'm looking for him in feminist form I'm looking for him in the Christ I'm looking for him into the point of who he is really one with he just think it just started on the day of Pentecost it's the end here but to end and what to end in me and you alright so the Prophet would constantly say we have the same ministry that Jesus Christ had when our people can take it and I've even went to Forrester's try to say it you can say well that was in brother Branham that's good because that was where it was that it was dire but now take what was dire and put it what is here now me now you're coming to her that this God's going to pull away when you begin to say I and my father are one what did they do to the Lord when he declared I and my father one they crucified Him what do you think their spawn gonna try to do to you when you're telling them you're his bride and that they are declaring are manifesting to the point of sure that they're not the bride they're the sharpness pulling away and that's the danger stage C is like waves preaching on sanctification you know and some like it that's the danger part it's for us to come to a place that we can talk about something being real to us but it not being reality there's the danger right C will not declare and I've always have up I'll always tried to preach it for forty years at least that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the Word made flesh the first sermon I preached in 1969 was what the bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man I believe that how much is more do you think I believe it today than I did then but we only had a few things to go fried rice we had a few books few types we didn't have anything to to declare you know and I had to speak it just from my own point a lot of it and you all have seen it with the people in the church and you know they would you know I mean look brother branham was not see their their thoughts brother branham's D son of man we've had brother branham now you talk to the faithful of the messages especially the the some of the older returns in a different thing they're going to do choir we've had this we've had that okay I go along with it we've had it but we didn't house the completion if you go along with me that the Old Testament never brought forth Jesus Christ in a complete fullness until the day of Pentecost you know it had to come to pinnacle it couldn't just be in the Old Testament if you go with me I'll go with you on the other see that's worth yeah but to me see that's something that's a mystery and I remember the first time after coming into the message I remember listening to a tape and and you know and just thinking this man you've heard me tell it I was looking for something positive and here comes a man talking about the God that I've seen when I was 10 to 11 years old that's not exalted to tell that it's just telling the truth which me it didn't stop there had it stopped there it wouldn't have been truth it would have been part truth if we get the mystery of Christ has been into being and find it to where we can bring it in to the bride now we're getting to the place that we can walk on what we're talking about now we're not concerned with what the world was doing and what's taking place we're concerned as human beings about the sicknesses and the things like that but these other things there's just part of what's got to be I mean they're doing the best they can do you see yeah but they're shutting down these big companies well they're doing the best they can do to try to get rid of that flu bugs or whatever you call it but you understand what I'm sayin if the bride is part of the mystery what is it to be revealed what is to be revealed you sorta bride-to-be reveal okay we got that now but who's the bride if he was the son of man right if Jesus Christ was the son of man and we would declare he was right all right then worse the flex of his flesh and bone of his bone see that's got to be in Bride form that's put my point the mystery that weird and it's supposed to be dealing with in our day in town of whatever we're here is God in bride form well you have a brother there that's just a little bit no it's not enough that's what I'm trying to get you to see this because if you take it it's the title of the sermon brother Branham in Jeffersonville Indiana preached the unveiling of God and you read that and you listen to it he put his whole emphases very little is said about the bride or anything his whole emphasis is based upon the unveiling of God then he turns and goes to Philadelphia I think it is I forgot work but just shortly thereafter he preached a message called the mighty God unveiled now read that message and look into it and you'll find that he spent not as much time describing the one god of this being you know not being free and not being there and not being that and ever you know and describing as he did in the unveiling now he's describing something else why were that Godwin the mighty God unveiled the showing where he went where did he go on the day of Pentecost he come right back down into the bride and begins to declare those signs and see that's what I've been trying to get us to see all right this the statement let's just read a few of them think they've got needs to go and we'll get pick up a little bit cause this is what I want you to see I want you to see that the part that we're part of the mystery and got to be revealed what find wonderful say it again where everybody understand it's what I've done had to do in Athens when I was saying that the brighter Jesus Christ into the Son of Man I constantly said brother Branham was not the Prophet brother Branham was a prophet do you understand yeah under a minute I'd come back and that thing and go you know it just like slapping you in the face and I'd say listen folks now understand brother Branham was not the Son of man he was a son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man now I'm not the one that made these statements I got written in my Bible running the front to keep women where brother Brennan said the bride is the son of money that's a great mystery mr. bride you realize if he's the son of man where the son of man not making us different making us what we're supposed to be but all right let's just let's just read a few of these go ahead to stand it in the gap because we got two well-known mistakes the first one all right this is from sirs we would see Jesus as the church like a pyramid comes into a point twisted hurts in the days of Luke their days of Wesley days will Pentecostal and now just before the headstone comes into it that church has to be home now notice he didn't say maybe it will be hopefully it will be I liked his positive statements What did he say the headstone comes into the church has to be so be home so perfect til the side ministry that he had be it he did here he did here his same spirit so predominant in other words right here alright let me stay what I'm saying over and over we can look back we can look back in the Bible and see the Ministry of Jesus Christ all right we can look back into the end time where the Prophet was preaching the message and bringing it forth to us we can look back to there and say that was God made manifest in a human being not a not demand being God no God was using a man but then we stop when we see and it bounces back at you when you say about now when he's using men what about now when he's using women when he's brought he's bringing forth his bride aren't we saying that we've glory in what the prophet has done with what our glory is right he said something's got to happen to the church by this message that will home the people that will bring us to a position of Jesus Christ all right go ahead get the next one standing in the gap he's talking about the Pentecostal message right in the middle everyone will bring the church this minority and a ministry will be among those people till it'll be exactly the same ministry that Jesus cried did that brings Jesus and catch the whole time yeah but brother Dale that's brother Branham brother Branham had diminish through Jesus Christ see everybody would agree to that look at this and look at that a man but now he's going to the church with it look at the next one watchman what are the knot and what's he's doing he's reflecting reflecting the same light of the Sun that went down years ago and is rising again what is that true church's ministry what is the true church's ministry the Ministry of that church will be the Ministry of the Sun because it's a reflection of the same Sun power and the same sunlight that the world would know when the Sun rises the same ministry reflecting his coming if you're going down into that message he said he's been he's here tonight doing the same thing okay I praise God for that see everybody don't understand me when I and I'm sorry to even have to mention it in a way to where people thank you against what they're saying but see I believe in the return ministry I do because I believe brother Browns gonna rise from the dead and according to him and his message after the resurrection there can be a 30 40 day period are we gonna do set around hey you know resurrections come Gloria okay no it's going to be a resourcing time you say are you thinking he didn't go across the country and all of that just you get all of that in your mind and you study it all out and you decide what you believe it is I'm just telling you that he's going to raise and he can preach to it for 30 40 days we can have great services and wonderful times glory but you remember we've got to get him here first that's the only thing that I've ever said what do you think well no he's no that's worth see there's everybody's got a we got to go through this room we got to do this we got to do that putting in their their own thoughts about what it is instead of seeing just what he said the same ministry of Jesus Christ what is that true church's ministry what is the true church's ministry well they're gonna start with the fivefold ministry so that's gonna be downgrading to most people right because they don't want it to there they want it to start I start with wrote around them and then they've come to the thoughtful ministry brother Branham had the message a man will agree with it he's the one that brought the message but now it's got to be delivered through the fivefold ministry and said take these and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord that's all I've ever looked for in that way then I don't have to worry about it but I'm not sitting down twiddling my thumbs well one of these days one of these days no because I've always said one time I told the church there's one time and I mean it and meaning what I said if if brother Branham came right out here in front of this building put up a tent in etc because these were can't believe it I said you wouldn't know what he's talking about well that heard I'm sorry but it was the best that I could say it I said because the reason you wouldn't know what he's saying you don't know what he's already saying I said that's all I'm saying because I had just proved it because I had quoted to this some people standing there and this brother he said that ain't brought brother damn brother Brown didn't say that I said he said I just listened to the tape the other day and I know he didn't say it I said what brother he did I said I'll bring you the book but when I brought the book I said read that was word-for-word what I've said I wasn't against anything I was just trying to show the people I say it to Lula right now today speaking to you cuz that's who I'm talking to what's holding off the coming of the Lord is you and I will get it a chance now and I thank God for it to prove the side you're standing on the word that people come as I said Wednesday it was like 60 here and a lot of people couldn't come you know but there was like 60 people I didn't say we wouldn't go the house services or know that we were gonna house earlier wouldn't have I just laughed it and if we left it totally open the building would be full today I believe that because the people are getting to the point of seeing hey this is us this is us but if we get along with the government and the agree with your emissary quickly and all of that which is scriptural did we do what they say we have the small amount we do the thing but yet we put it on the internet it's not going to end in what I preach but it's not going I'm not going to beat the government to death I'm not going to beat the Catholic to death it's not time it's time to meet me and you to death just to stand up and say all right we're here this out here in the land of West proven it's got to be the plagues and the things that are happening it's here how long that's going to be they're saying now that could be two or three more months or or you know they're maybe not even how school to the end of the year or different things my lord shirt you realize what this is doing to the economy what told you there on the other Wednesday this is the beginning of the end but let's don't count this to be the end and be such a doom days until we can't be in resourcing in crisis and said hey we've been looking forward to some of these things the way things are tightening up the priests of it 4050 years ago how it was coming well that that to me was the ministry was back there brought it correctly so let's go ahead feel bit more than will hey we can take all day today okay let's see we're on number to read or yeah let's go to number four roller no not what you can see in the other one already the same ministry that he was here when he was leading Christ the same way the same ministry Christ head is in his church tonight okay I can say was in brother Branham as he was standing there but now in Brad form to complete the next Street because the mystery was not to in a listen the mystery was not to end in Jesus back there it would have to end in broad form alright now it wasn't to end in brother branham when he was back there it's to end in broad form but listen that's what I tried to get you see listen brother Brad it was part of the bride he wasn't Jesus but he was part of the bride he's part of this mystery so we can look back and see the mystery of the things that the happenings and what he preached in time and see that he preached these marvelous mysteries which is to end in the bride in bride form okay listen I get tired of living one of the other same ministry Christ had is in his church tonight same time same wonder same spirit same kind of works that Jesus did here on earth the church has to do the same thing if it's not it's not the seed of Abraham so if you don't believe Christ is up with us living in his bride form in the life day then who you understand what he said you're not the seed of Abraham you're not the Bride of Christ go in them see what do we got number five and when Jesus returns now listen let's see what is it at Scripture Oh Willie find faith when he returned will he find faith I remember mentioning that to brother hope one day and he got out and he said thank will he find any faith because the faith is in you and me all right this and when Jesus returns he'll find a church that's washed without spot or wrinkle and it'll be the same ministry he had it'll bring back the headstone same ministry that he had go ahead Mona where we can see a little bit further it's got to be that all right well now then there will come a message Oh hallelujah we know that that same pillar of fire that led Israel we know that the same ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by the pillar of fire that had him anointed is accompanying the church today okay I'm on a man and start it here put that in brother Branham and his message and him delivering it okay but bring it on to the bride form bring it on to the complete mystery that's all I've ever asked and all the tried to preach don't just stop here but don't look so far out you're under two you can't see it either because you'll overlook the whole time look he said science has proved it no this is back when he was talking about the clouds of different things all the right but now look this is what I like science has proved it we don't need that well we don't need science proving it we believe it wonderful for it to be done but we don't need that that away listen we don't need that God's proved it see it's proved in our hearts and lives that's all I've ever tried to preach that's a personal revelation to each and every one of us because listen if Bob is part of the Bride of Christ you know that Bob's got to be revealed but he don't have to be revealed like we're making reveal to put him out here to do this without of the other no he's doing it himself and what he's doing he's proving his own self and what he's doing is that hard to believe well brother Dale we got the ability now we can just cut you okay that's not I had no problem I'm just joking cuz you're not gonna do it said we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that headstone coming yonder that's brought the church into a place to where the minister is exactly like it was when Jesus Christ left okay I'm say it again we've seen that in brother Branham no problem we've seen the same Minister Jesus Christ we've seen that the dead raised the sick he only thought when I bring it on over to see the masked that in this way without you misunderstanding me see he spoke of the bride if you don't want I mean if you want to listen to a message a coach a spoken word is the original seed and read it over and over to messengers remember he says in there he says talking about the baptism of the whole go he said it brings it back exactly like it was in the beginning he said I never seen that before that baptism with the Holy Ghost brother into your heart brings you back exactly the way you should have been in the beginning that's how much I think for the Bride of Christ I'm not looking for the world and what it's doing that's all natural but to find the people that are believing who they are that arrested when the bride realized who she is and what she's here for said she'll be an invincible army who is she she's him that's my whole point that's all they don't try to do cuz let's go let's see what we get - I'll go down to number seven okay okay rolled it up just a little more we can see down ever how you look now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell Zin his church how much more simple now now say it correctly we understand brother Branham was not a prophet outside he was in the basis of his ministry and the way it was used in the same I believe he was above the FIFO ministry I go we had our because he would end up the one prophet that was are predestinated to come to this position all right I don't go either but just remember that's got to come into the church okay motor Brenham didn't say my message look hard snow listen once a little random never said look how my message has stirred the world it's done this and it's done that he just kept on preaching but you see the brides when she begins to say I my father won and he's other thing she's gonna disturb are you looking for a disturbance yes sir always been looking for one maybe not seeing it maybe because we're missing it well what we're looking at but okay come on listen the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was was poured into the church the believers now I'm not making this as a smart a true statement but you know how that's been made they said brother all God was he 14 to Christ all Christ poured and brother branham he died took it with him we had nothing left you ever heard that statement made let's see I don't agree with that I believe we're here at the end okay let's just read this go ahead and I'm right then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery are you listening it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals his church and raises it up by the same word it's a part of history fo mister all God was reporting across all Christ in the church take him back to the Garden of Eden she's part of the mystery let's see that's always been my my thoughts I'm you know like I said somebody asked me one time cuz they knew I'd preach them the bride being the son of man said how do you feel about that now I said how did you think over the field I feel it oh I think more about it today than I did in nineteen in 69 when I preached it what the word made it alive is the son of man right the son of man is that word made alive let's just trying to find out what we're okay boy number nine let's get this and then we'll we'll quit okay you see if you were in the foreknowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you well because he imparted itself unto you you his wife that's what he thinks of his wife he thinks more of his wife that he does his own self he never bragged on his own self he always bragged on his wife the church the bride and there was the prophet able to stand there with the hills and the signs and the wonders and the thing and he would have had the ability to say listen do you believe who I am because I've got the Ministry of Jesus Christ you know he'd be telling truth but how did he say he said to Ministry of Jesus Christ is here rein it in to him he's here but it's going to be in the church the fullness of the Godhead bodily wells in his church what a wonderful day what a wonderful time let's see what was will God is not complete without you it has to be because there is one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and him alone has eternal life see now and you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug toward him that's what has to be quicken some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it that's all I never throw it off on anybody into what they see or what they preach or anything the only thing that I've ever said when are we gonna realize who we are you realize he chose you he chose meaning you like I said we were chosen in him and he's not complete without me and you let's really do one more let's go to number 10 get this and then walk with the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it's Dermott eyes so the Holy Spirit waters it until it has grown and serves his purpose they do only his will amen I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still well see I believe we have thus saith the Lord the prophets message made alive in you and I what would be the difference in God's saying it are you saying it if you're his wife if you're speaking in his place what's the definite yeah but that's just not that ain't enough they where it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he now listen listen to this last few statements as he did complete now holder in his days all think when he was here now watch him he's correcting it as he did complete in his day he never completed all of his work when he was here let's see we read that and can use that statement apart but not reader s often when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet how do you follow me he didn't complete it you know why because his wife's gone completely his little Brides gonna complete it she's gonna be him made manifest she's gonna walk in the word of the hour and believe it believe what he says about us it's to be true see that's that's all that I've ever tried like I said that brother asked me what was my thought that's my thought that's my point has always been a positive attitude about the word of God I'd MIT I mean I'm a human I've read a lot of things that I didn't know what in the world the Prophet was talking about and you I mean maybe a pawn or a thought or anything he just didn't didn't get it but you just keep reading instead it in one day it just comes up hey he was saying the same thing all the time but it just wouldn't be in quickened what about the little ride making God manifest for the life stage waiting for a waiting in the sky come on musicians I just pray that it was out there on the internet and the things that listen to what I'm saying God I know that I try to make statements and I do I hurt feelings because they think of this or that I've never had anything to try to hurt anybody's feelings and say well I see I've stood a lot of times standing there with the word to know you could cut a person to pieces with it but I'll never do it because it's not made for that it's made to preach it's made to live it's made to be what he says we're supposed to be Stan what do we got ready anybody has a need and those I don't internet just remember where you're sitting now you can reach up and touch God for whatever you have need of same as you can here [Music] when I awake in the morning when I I am ah anybody having a I am every day that I am when I wake up when I am [Music] all that mankind had done for 4,000 years cluster to back me over if they give the paper to realize who they are and what we're here for so you know how to raise up say what state is under challenge you do you better be careful at work let him challenge you that's why we didn't write it up what they said is well we've got a constitutional right no I would just go along with it because it's right trying to help mankind or try to make you believe a doctor and then we have to make our stand then it'll be time because it'll be them challenging us don't try to challenge somebody may be careful there was a little over us Terrence knew him I thought that way do you Billie free he's a big mouth he was he was just a big mouth and and but I've seen him too worth it you know a lot of people didn't know him like I did then so one day some guys was hollering about he was talking about something about him huh and then just a minute there was a couple of them was needing some plaster work done because he was the kind that would back up what he said when he was pushed most people didn't know that about him but I knew him I knew to leave him alone I knew he was feisty lightning and I knew he could whoop any deity whooping eyes artwork and everybody beginning a little different respect for the old boy because but just remember my point is why we don't challenge them they challenge us cause gods on our side amen all right we starting back at one o'clock so you hear and we'll get things to going for the way like we did you know just what twenty minutes before one or something or whatever and then we'll just have a little bit like we'd normally do of the services and to all of you at home we hope that this is been a good thought and you just pray for us this afternoon if the Lord would bless man father we thank you for these things and we ask you to just got us helpless now as we go to see little natural meal and come back together this afternoon to serve you to be guided by your love we thank you Father may our attitudes and all may always be positive Lord we see you in the reality forgive our sins guide us by thy grace in Jesus name Amen you dismissed [Music]
