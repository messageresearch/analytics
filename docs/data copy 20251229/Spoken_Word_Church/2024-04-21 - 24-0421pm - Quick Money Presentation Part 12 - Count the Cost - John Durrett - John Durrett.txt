guys I have a um prayer request for my dad by God's grace I had an opportunity my husband he actually had to go out to California last week I had opportunity to stop by try to see my dad it didn't really work out like he didn't answer at the door he was really upset I want him say everything he said he basically just like really went off really went off on us like really really bad I haven't seen him like almost 30 years like really so a little time when I was like 15 then I saw him again right after I got married and so it's been like he hasn't really been in my life in 30 years truly but it's been about 24 to almost 25 years since I've really seen him and so he really went off really bad as y all pray for him he's very bitter very bitter in his heart and so you know he wasn't there for my high school graduation it's not a pity party wasn't there for my graduation wasn't there when I got married when I was there no one would walk me down the aisle to be married married and there's a lot of hurtful things that to go through in life but God knows and he just sh me he's my heavenly father over and over again he keeps showing me not to depend on man don't depend on man depend on the Lord Jesus Christ he loves you more than everybody and a couple I mean maybe about 15 to 20 years ago I wrote my grandmother a letter and she does not wish to receive any of us as her grandchildren cuz we're biracial I have Indian black and white in me which I'm very proud of there are different things that I believe are fine with me CU I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the way it had to come to pass and um anyway she rejected us as well she never saw her son again she passed away and you know just keeps teaching me over and over again she did receive a different biracial child through one of um my daddy's brother's children she did receive that child so by God's she had a little Mercy in her heart for that I guess but anyway it's pressing forward God's teaching me over and over again depend on him even though it was heartbreaking when we were out there in California it was heartbreaking and I'm still heartbroken now but I'm just God just keeps teaching me I keep getting whooped over and over again I'm your father come to me come to me I will take care of your needs cuz when I was really sad I came home my daughter one of my daughters bought me a stuffed animal it was wrapped up she gave it to me I wasn't expecting I was like man look how God cares for me I come home and something is there for me I wasn't looking for anything my baby Anna got me something that me a lot to me so I thank the Lord for her thank the Lord for my children thank the Lord for my Godly husband which I don't deserve cuz I did come out of that world and was nothing good in me nothing good from the head to toe there was nothing good in me it's all been him so want just testify to y'all stay encouraged in the Lord man will let you down I'm going on to guarantee y'all that maybe your family might let you down maybe your parents might let you down the Lord Jesus Christ he won't let you down and I sang this like about 20 years ago after I got a letter from my grandma when she didn't want to accept us or whatever and it still means the same to me today as it did then I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found in him a friend so

be here uh on my birthday so I don't know whether to cry or Shout amen I'll do both amen amen well I I thank the Lord and I thank the thank the Lord for my wife and her little testimony I certainly appreciate that yet the Lord allowed us to go out to California and didn't turn out the way we thought things would turn out um and seeing her dad but I said the Lord knows all about it the Lord knows all about it you know at least you can see when I stand here and say that we're fighting it's always a fight it's a fight you know life things you don't expect it turns out totally different than you could even imagine you know we thought we'd go out there maybe we' see him for for lunch I hadn't seen him we saw her last I was a teenager and um things were nice and we had a good time so I thought we'd sit down and talk and have lunch and catch up it didn't turn out that way you know and um so of course you know being human like I tell my wife I said I'm very jealous of her she doesn't believe me I said you you yeah when your heart is bleeding for something else I get jealous I said I need all that heart you know and I'm pretty strong so I say I want all of it don't get sad because of him I give you everything I can give you amen but she's absolutely right only God can satisfy that portion you know so uh just want to thank the Lord certainly this is uh Financial Jubilee Part 12 counting the cost and um we we'll go right to the scripture and uh then I'll let you sit down so we'll get started so the scripture says for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it less happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish Amen Let Us pray precious Lord Jesus we thank you so much father that we can gather in Your Name Lord certainly Lord I've done the part of trying to prepare but Lord we need you to do the rest Lord Jesus to come down anoint the thought speak to your people Lord you know every season you know every place where every person is Lord and you can speak to each heart this afternoon strengthen everybody Lord bless everybody bless brother Wade our pastor Lord bless him strengthen him his family Lord God meet every need Lord Jesus all of the changes everything that's taking place father you be the center of it all father we love you we appreciate you again bless your people bless this time now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated praise the Lord Jesus amen so yeah throughout this morning I mean it's just been a blessing just to see the Lord just lining things right up with brother Ryan's Sunday school and um he he hit it right on the spot talking about choices you know choices what you're doing why you're doing talking about those big choices of Salvation and marriage amen and saying hey marriage is a sacrifice coming into that and um you know brother Wade coming right on in talking about character as a victory you know we don't realize what we got all those things are right in line with counting the cost counting the cost of everything we do and counting the cost when we talk about financial Jubilee we're going to get into some Hands-On some of the details of getting a plan getting a budget we're going to talk about some of those things but certainly when we talk about financial Jubilee I know being Christians that and I pray that the Lord let you see higher than just this it's much much greater than all of these little things that we call little things but it's so much greater than all of that you know when you look at the scripture says sit down you know Jesus is saying for which of you intending to build a tower sit in that damn first so he's basically telling you to sit down you need to pause you need to sit down take a little time when it comes to decisions that you need to make sit down first count the cost now what does that mean count the cost whether you have sufficient to finish it counting the cost we have to reflect and I thank God for this church because it's not a church that we try to spit everything out and it's very fast it is very training slow to make sure you get it so this scripture count the cost couple things he's talking about you want to think about what what are we counting what are we trying to do okay so what are we trying to do first of all that's two things you want to ask yourself about the what so it's what why and how with what what are we trying to do and what is required okay what are we trying to do and what is required sit down think about it okay then you're going to talk about why like why do we want to do this what's the reason behind it in the first place okay because your what is going to give you those what we call pros and cons it's going to give you the cons like it's our brother said about marriage if I wanted to get married that would be the what I want okay what's required like he was saying self-sacrifice that's something okay that's what required of course we know you need a job you need to be able to take care of your spouse those would be the whats if you think about it that's counting the cost okay why do I want to get married well because I want a companion with me on this journey of life there's another half if God has that for me that's going to help complete the picture of who I am in Christ we're one husband and wife so I want somebody to go with me through life's journey that's going to be the why okay and is that why greater than the cost okay is it greater than the cost that I want to pay well if you think about that why enough it can give you that inspiration for what it is that you want to do okay my wife and I were talking about of course marriage and say had you get older my goodness you know that spouse you don't know what may happen to one and who has to take care of who okay who's going to take care of who so you better treat that man or that wife very good while you together she was letting me know because you don't know no matter how strong you are today it doesn't mean that's going to be tomorrow okay and that wife may have to do things that she never imagined or you never imagine she would have to do for you this is reality okay so how in the world I'm going to treat my wife like she's nothing today because I feel strong and empowered and big when tomorrow everything could change and the same thing so my wife could be like you know what I want a companion with me in my later life I'm going to try to keep this marriage together the best that I can and I'm going to treat her like she's already doing that for me amen and she's going to do the same and we had a great conversation on that why why so that's why we would want to get married now how how is extremely important that's the training and the fighting okay if I'm going to know how to self-sacrifice I need to know how to do that I need training in that area I mean I don't know we both come from broken backgrounds and broken marriages and all kind of things so I don't have all of the skills for the what I want to get married the why is greater but I need training on how to do that amen and thank God for that word that can help train me in sitting there and listening praise the Lord amen so that's just why what and how when you look at this for financial Jubilee Financial Jubilee when we talk about what to me I hear that trumpet sounded brother Bram said when the trumpet sound every man could go free if he wanted to go free if you didn't hear the message before pre-service he said we are free we're Eagles praise the lord we are amen and that's what I want I want to be free in every area of my life that's why I'm bringing Financial Jubilee why because the scripture says therefore if you have not been faithful in unrighteous Manon who will commit to your trust the true riches amen I want those true riches praise the Lord so if I can take something small like money and prove myself faithful in that God already says if I can handle something small then he's willing to give me that additional responsibility of managing something greater true riches amen I appreciate brother Wade this morning just saying are we impressed are we impressed with what God is able to do for us and that's the truth are we impressed amen are you thoroughly impressed that God is able to supply and take care of you and provide these precious promises amen so I feel that I feel that in my heart when it comes to money I feel that with anything that God has given us okay and I have that little note said multiplying what you have been given that's a responsibility we all have been given blessings and grace of God and things like that that started our journey of life and I see that responsibil of building off of that that's what God wants to multiply he's in the multiplying business he gives us all talents your talents could be that you had a Godly parent or maybe you didn't have a Godly parent but maybe you had a home hey that was something maybe your dad worked every day okay maybe your mom was doing something but you had something to start this journey no matter what it was someone else had worse regardless okay and that's just what God chose to give you to start on yes okay but are you impressed yet can you see that as still something you're thankful for Lord I Thank you my dad wasn't this way but Lord I still thank you okay I still thank you Lord I Thank you father because I could have been this way or that way but Lord I wasn't you gave me a start that you chose to give me now Lord what am I going to do with what you gave me to start on Amen so I see that I see that in my own life as I reflect and then when it comes to financial Jubilee it's how and fighting and I see that word that has provided all of these things for us that we can grow and multiply what God has given us amen praise Goden Nehemiah he says and I looked and I rose up and I said to the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your houses praise God Amen I take that to heart for my own self I'm fighting for where I come from I'm fighting for my dad I'm fighting for my mom I'm fighting for my sisters I'm fighting for my children I'm fighting for the generations that have come before me my brothers and sisters I'm fighting for that and that's what Nehemiah is saying fight fight for your kids fight for your family but remember what I said you have to train you got to know how to fight right okay and that's where the devil wants us to go so fast that we don't know what's going on and we can't keep up and then life goes by but we have an opportunity praise God our Prophet said we have an opportunity that all of the Saints before now did not have we got an opportunity praise God praise the lord we got that opportunity amen but we got to get that training we got to get it and so an Army first in getting ready for battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting amen that's bringing you the how what we're doing so you know not just fighting for financial Jubilee but all of these blessings that God has given us amen the last Financial Jubilee it was about fighting fighting training knowing that's that's what you need to be equipped my brothers and sisters you know I come from a a background that's very very difficult for sure and as you hear my wife bring out things and short my sister shared many testimonies you know but we thank God because we still grew up in a Christian home okay but my dad and parents they come from a a long line of history of stuff this is a picture of my dad Becky is not in that picture my sister Rebecca's not there but I'm in my dad's lap there that's my brother and that's my older sister okay sitting there and you know I got this quote why so you say why you know John why you you seem passionate about financial Jubilee well I I want to give you some of that context like why am I why does this mean mean a lot to me right okay well you know my great granddaddy was a slave okay my dad is in his 80s now his dad was 60 something when he had him so his dad was born right after slavery literally right after slavery right you know so his dad my great- granddad was solid in slavery just solid that's what grew up in Hartwell Georgia solid slavery you know and I read this emaciation Proclamation yesterday I said Lord look at this Abraham Lincoln signed this his name you can pull it up it says all persons hell as slaves shall be then then thenceforth and forever free labor Faithfully for reasonable wages amen you know I said look at Abraham Lincoln my goodness sign that thing in amen set my great granddaddy free they tell us my dad told me he said the day he signed this I believe it was a day he said the master who was his name was durett in Hartwell they came in said hey he signed it said he had a heart attack the master had a heart attack and died right there on the spot right there on the spot that's part of the history wow so it it goes way back so my granddad you know coming up and then of course they got right into sharecropping and things like that and sharecropping my if you didn't know what you were doing they would suck you right in and you would be in debt and they would loan you money and now you had to plant and do these things and continue doing all this stuff and you could never get out if you didn't know what was going on you would be stuck forever right it's like they give you a gift and say yeah we'll we'll pay for this today that's going to cost you about you know are season or planning well I I'll take it okay so that's what my my granddaddy came out of sharecropping my dad got it got it together like you know what I'm leaving the South I'm heading to Atlanta hey they businesses up there you know and him and his cousin I hear him and his cousin he said yep we left Hartwell Georgia we came to Atlanta Georgia you know and he's got into a little neighborhood that I was born in but this was early on you know they came was lywood park over there near Brook Haven and my dad came in there and you know that that time you know all the black people living in that neighborhood they was a little bit trying to get their s together drugs had not come in just yet so they was working my dad got to train with this old little guy and learn how to do concrete okay he learned how to do concrete so by the time we came along although he was struggling my dad worked every day he was up hitting it every morning no question you know 5:00 he was up gone working every day never had a problem seeing my dad do that and I praise the Lord so he gave me and my brother that that work habit we learn how to work it was no play now he did not learn how to manage money he didn't know I I literally but he didn't know what to do you they just get it in and come out and that was about all they could do and still had situation come up cuz the car would break down things like that and he didn't know how to manage all this stuff he didn't know how to maybe say let's say maybe be a good husband to a wife he didn't know how to do all those kind of things that was a different season different times you was just firm and hard and the woman needed to listen or that was about it you know you listen or not you know it wasn't like we we a little different in this generation thank the Lord for that right but you know at the time they didn't know all of these things he didn't know that your marriage could fall apart right that's the thing we didn't get that after a while that lady at to have a mind and after a while what you do may not last and you got to deal with it so he faced all that okay he literally never thought any of this would happen Okay so he just figured you work all day and that's enough if that don't satisfy then you got to deal with it you know I'm working you know but that's not enough as our brother was saying you got to come in that marriage sacrificing sacrificing period that's what God wants so it's not because his background he felt like I did much better than my daddy that's how he thought look my dad he he would say my daddy told me sometime he said my dad you know being on the farm and being poor like that he just ran around you know ran around with ladies that was just something you did had stepsons here and there and you was a farmer and the wife at that time she would just stay home so the man would farm and he would be busy and that's how they relieve their stress and pressure cuz they wouldn't serving God okay so he came in like I'm doing better I I'm working every day that's that's enough at this point okay but it's not because the word says it's not the word gives us instruction says love that wife self-sacrifice that wife love it like Jesus loved it and he gave himself you see so those some some of those things at that time you know maybe wasn't talked about as much as they they are now so we grew up in that type of environment coming up so as I said we grew up poor but I saw my dad worked and you know early on you know we didn't have much of anything you know literally my dad the money would come in it would go out okay I remember how much the rent was it was $375 a month and my dad working every day he couldn't come up with all that money wow every day he still couldn't come up with all the money why because he' be paying people he had a business he would be paying people but then he wasn't tracking it right and before you know it taxes and he tried to go to somebody to do their taxes and they you know didn't tell him all the deductions he had so by the time he got to the end of the year like I they say I made this much and I owe this much taxes but I certainly ain't got this kind of money see he didn't understand he didn't have that training to be able to do that you know but we saw something not him not having the money right around us you know we started getting our ideas even as kids because my dad worked hard is like you know what we could we could have some businesses and we did we had our businesses you're looking at it right here this is some of our business it's called the trash can we collect aluminum cans so we would we would roll out amen we would roll out you know Becky Rebecca my brother and sister my mom you know we would head out and man that would be my trash can it was like we would say this mine that's yours all right we're going to work together okay so that's my business right there that means all the cans that come out of that belongs to me brother y'all stand outside you get the bags I'm jumping in I'm going to throw the cans out there you go that's mine said Gary that's yours that's yours and that's what we did so we started saying that God would provide and even in our neighborhood full of drunks and drugs by the time I was born it was drugs and alcohol and all of the men around us pretty much was done they sat on the corners and they drunk and they did drugs and they drunk and that was about it very bad situation and they would take all their cans and throw it out and you would see 20 guys and after a while we started seeing all those cans that we were collecting so we start getting our bags me and my brother come on let's head out and they would throw their cans and we're like okay there money put them in the bag you know they say they would point it out hey man look over there there five over there thank you you know and we would load our cans up you know and they started saying them little boys over there working and before you know it we would take all of our cans and selling and start getting like money 50 60 80 100 you know my goodness so by the time I was a teenager we were still doing this we got our confidence up like I don't care if they laugh because they going to laugh but we going to have money so we about to do this and we would do it praise the Lord and the word says He that teth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough look at that promise even in that type of environment the Lord could prove himself amen so I know the Lord has precious promises for all of us all of us if can overcome and apply ourselves with this word praise the Lord this was proof to me that God can supply in any situation that you're in any situation you find yourself in he can supply that need amen as we talked about last time fighting and we talked about our Prophet coming along and we told the story of this this elderly woman and her son of course he had been providing her with money she didn't know what it was she was rich and didn't know it you know and I want challenge us today I believe the same thing I believe the same thing we don't have to act like the world you don't have to go around all bound up you're rich okay where do you find it in the Bible you just looked it over and thought it was just a picture book or some other true story but it isn't it's God's word you are rich praise God now I don't get so high that you don't see I he telling the story about this sister with money okay we know he's talking about spiritual things but I believe it's all of these things because this is what the word has okay so Us in that neighborhood growing up where we did it was around us tilling the swore working we could come up we could get money same thing that shows me that God supplies he will supply your every need okay he will but you have to be trained to know you have to know how to do it how to get him to act and he's going to act according to his word every time every time every time he's going to act according to it so we have to line up with the word of God if we want to see that we're rich you see and you said well Rich yes Rich financially well you said I don't have it in the bank well God has it in his bank he just hadn't given it to you yet okay he had transferred it to you yet okay our God was able to point out a fish and say go to that fish and there it is so he has it he just haven't given it to you yet he's waiting on something number one to see how we can handle it that's the first thing okay and anything just to give you the little the idea of how God works he's not going to give you anything if you think it's rich is the way we call it but he will gladly give you a responsibility he will glad to give you a responsibility after you have proved that you can handle the smaller responsibility he's a good dad but I truly believe brothers and sisters we're rich we're rich in everything that we have need of on this journey we just have to do it the right way I love this quote this is from a um a Christian Author he says there's a right way to live and it is a hard way it is work but it works and it will save you countless detours in life amen reflect on that quote there's a right way to live and it is a hard way y it is work but it works and it will save you countless detours in life amen see the whole thing behind life is that there is an enemy yes is an enemy okay his job is to make it complicated difficult hard confused until you can't see what's going on that's right brother our brother brought out I like the quote he brought out he says God in Simplicity greatness of God is revealed in simplicity but the devil don't want that so he's there as an enemy to make life complicated okay to make it point to you to take the easy way there's an easy way he's going to always try to point out to you okay but the right way is always the hard way the hard way because why because you need character okay and that quote this morning as well says Hey character is simply simply not made without suffering you know and come to my mind I think about my kids and they're getting older and you know parents we want to come in and just make it easy for them you know you can't come on brother you know then that character if they not suffering you suffering they're not suffering you suffering but they need the character you want them to have the character okay so we can't bail them out all the time and this is some of the things we're going through we're going through this in our journey okay we can't bail them out we can't come in solve all their problems and keep a smile on their face we got to let them go through it and we can pray and that's what we do but some of the suffering they have to have that to learn from their own choices to learn from their own choices and then they can start finding out my that hard way is the right way amen and avoid some of those detours amen amen but the enemy of course on our journey of life not just in finances but he wants us to be ineffective ineffective confused and disarmed that's it even as Born Again Christians disarmed and confused okay and we can see that you can see that tangibly with money you can see it it happens but I tell you what the one thing I do want to say you know especially as we get into Financial Jubilee there is Grace there is Grace if we start applying what God has done there is matchless Grace amen you see it in marriage and divorce as our brother brought out but in every area of your life once you start on that journey and that's what I saw okay coming up I like I said I we didn't know I didn't know any of this n everything I'm talking about I had no clue I just came right out of from where my dad left off he we learn how to work that's about it but soon as I started getting money it was going out the door every money every piece of money I got would just go out the door I that's what I thought you did you got it and you spend it you know what are you talking about saving my dad once told me when I did start learning how to save he said John you can save he said I had a cousin that could do that it was that big to him like he had never imagined anybody could save so he was like wow they was impressed with that you could actually save Say Yeah Dad I'm I'm learning I'm learning so everything I have is the grace of almighty God learning on this journey learning from God and seeing wow Lord you can make up for maybe where we didn't have this training or we didn't have that if I apply myself to that word Lord you can make up and he will in every area of our life and in this day and time he's going to make up for everything that has happened through history all of the trials and the tests that you've been through every single thing that all of the Christians from history has been through he's bringing it right to us right to us and once we get in that channel that Grace will take the rest amen I believe it praise the Lord Jesus all right Financial Jubilee so God's principles we talked about this but I want to reiterate it as we get closer I want to get closer to giving you guys some handson things that you can do amen okay but we got to keep this in mind that God's part he owns it all amen he owns it all and look what this word says the Earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell in it okay the silver is mine and the gold is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts that's God saying that it's all his that's why I told you he already got it so you're talking about your dad has all of this in his Storehouse the silver is mine the Gold is mine sayth the Lord he controls it both rich is and honor come of thee and thou reth over all and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand is to make great and to give strength unto all the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich he bringeth low and lift it up that's the word of God he controls it he provides it but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen but thou shall remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth amen that's God's word he owns it he controls it and he provides it amen let's say that together just to make sure nobody's falling asleep he owns it he controls it and he provides it glory amen that is the truth that's his part brother now what's our part our part It's God's money you are the manager you are a steward amen whever it is required amen look at that being underlined it's required if we say we're Steward praise the lord we know we know every all of the virtues we know that's a requirement but look what the scripture brings on this about being a steward it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful amen that means we need to get to training and learning and fighting we need to know how to meet these requirements amen and if you can meet these requirements then you will see God in his part okay and you will see him in a small thing that we call money but then you will be prepared to see him in these greater things that's promised to us amen that's our part you are a steward it's God's money our Prophet said someday I'm going to have to answer for every penny of money that's been given me every penny and therefore I know as a steward of his money I'm going to have to answer for it at the day of judgment do you believe it do you believe that he's saying he's going to have to answer for this God God has given you money don't spend it for things that satisfy not spend it for things that satisfy spend it for things that satisfy amen so we know we need to know the mind of the lord we need to seek him that's why counting the cost means sitting down think thinking about the things that you're doing praying about the things that you're doing okay learning growing training and fighting so as a steward when it comes to financial Jubilee what you need is a blueprint you need a blueprint you need a guide you need a budget okay you need a budget you need to be able to sit down and understand a little bit what's going on in that area of your life okay and that's called a blueprint to the next slide we're going to see if this not sure if this will play but we'll try you know we we'll skip this part here but you need that blueprint what I want to do I want to take a moment I want to go through what I call the money guide okay and I want you to to pay attention it's it's it's very simple okay but if you can see it then I think it'll give you an idea maybe of of maybe some of the challenges challeng challenging areas that you've faced that you've had and all of us I mean we're in different seasons I I definitely understand that okay but we're all on this same Journey we're on the same Journey but we may be in different seasons different seasons of our money we got the young people that's coming up I got a a 18y old daughter now she's working so she's saving her money and of course I'm trying to challenge her to help her grow but she's she's good at saving um each child is different put it that way but she is very good at saving U then of course you know I'm right in that that middle season of life you know where it's like okay man hey retirement may come you know soon and some of us are there you know so you have different my dad is certainly in that that age you know so all of these things are different seasons but you want to take it and ask God to show you what you need to do for the season of life that you're in and how he wants you to handle what you have okay because it's not based on you having a lot or a little it's managing what you do have right okay so the money guide you know when it's starts out for income right that's the first thing typically that happens you start getting an income you start working okay that's the first thing money's coming in the word says prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build thine house okay so God is already putting things in order okay before you start building these great things make sure you know your work and that's in order what are you going to do what are you doing you prepare your work that's number one that's the scripture okay the next thing money comes in okay okay as Christians what we should be doing is going right to giving amen okay we should be paying our tithes okay you're making the income you should be paying our tithes because God asked us to do that he said hey bring in your tithes into the storehouse okay and he will bless you he said prove it prove it so pay your tithes he wants to bless you so bring that tithe into the storehouse he said he will open the windows for you prove it he's saying that okay so you can hold him to that if you are doing your part if something happens and this is what happen this is what got me to first start coming to the Lord about money because I lost a lot of money but I had this I said Lord but I hadn't failed to pay my tithes I I've been doing that since you got a hold of me so Lord it must be something else that I'm doing wrong and he said yep that's exactly right you are doing something wrong so that's the Lord we serve but if I wasn't pay my tithe see I would be already confused I'd be off the right wrong track to begin with so I'm going to him he's like well John you ain't even paying your ties we we ain't even on the same page have you counted the cost so count the cost of not paying your tithes count those costs that should be the first thing hey he said it he going to open the windows for you if it's not opening then you know you can move to another step Lord what else am I doing help me help me Lord right amen then the next thing of course we got taxes they're going to jump on there the government says hey I'm in it so I like to say hey which want you be first you're giving taxes hey you should have enough to pay for both of those giving in your taxes and God and Jesus Christ himself he didn't fail to pay those taxes is that that we got to give Caesar with Caesar's he said it now the next are going to be your living expenses okay and that's be your houses your cars what are you going to do how are you living this is your money coming in you've given your tithes you're paying your taxes now this should be what you have to live on okay then the next thing that happened okay because unfortunately we got an enemy so he jumps right in there he say huh we Ain we ain't going to let you go that much further we we about to come in here and and get involved in this nice picture of you earning money thank the Lord you can work huh I want a part of this you're giving God some you got taxes you trying to live uh what about me you know pay me a little bit and that's where he comes in right with debt and now I ask the question is there anything left after that you know is it anything left any savings anything after all of that you're giving your taxes you're living and in debt is anything left and I like to call that short-term money plans you know and that's just shortterm you haven't even gotten to those blessings of multiplying yet okay and that goes on so as we go on down further if you can get to that and there's savings and things left over you can start getting to what I call true investing you can start investing investing means that your money is able to go to those money changers as God Jesus said himself and is able to multiply okay can you get there with your money can you get there some people never get there for their entire life they never get there and I think that's where the superpower comes in superpower when you're able to get the true investing and now you get to what we call the long-term money plans and that's where you're investing true investing you can start looking into things okay without the pressure okay and there's many things out there you know we listened to a tape this morning and our Prophet said a business these these false business businessmen and systems and things like that he said they will go through every effort to let you see one side one side to get you into it one side of it right okay and you don't want to be trying to do true investing when you got your living and your debt all messed up that's not the point that's not the time to do it you want to really get to where it's extra it's what you got left over that you can start saying hey because true investing involves risk you could lose it okay so you want to be in a position where it's like okay I can lose that I'm taking care of my living I'm taking care of my tithes and my taxes I'm doing all that this is extra okay and then at that point you can start making some lifestyle choices okay when I say lifestyle choices that's where you can start acknowledging Lord Lord what do you want me to do Lord I have this now father do you want me to do this you want me to do that or you want me to stand still for a while Lord what would you have me to do you're able to make some choices at that point you're able to grow a business you're able to do more giving and I i' like to say the last is what I call Financial Freedom this is free to be used by God you have trained you're learning how to do all of these things okay that is the money guide of course that's where you get your reward when you get financially free means everything is taken care of and you're in lineing with God you see his blessings you see him there and now it's just like Lord I got to wait until you show me what to do and that's the same thing with all of the precious promises that we have that God promises to give us we have to get to the point just like Jesus Christ himself where we said father I only do what you want me to do I got all this great power Lord but Lord you didn't tell me to go to the hospital and let everybody out Lord you didn't tell me to do that I'm waiting on you because somebody slapped me in the face and I got power I'm still waiting on you Lord okay I know it's a responsibility I can't do what I may feel to do I'm going to go and say Lord forgive me help me to get this anger out of me and Lord I'm not using the power that you've given me to curse somebody right okay I'm going to look like I know nothing and I can't do anything because Lord you ain't told me to do anything okay that was our Lord Jesus Christ he died with that kind of power he could have done he I could call Legions of angels if I am everything that I say I am and I got that character to stop to pause to say they crucifying me but I am not going to use it because Lord I'm going to fulfill why you talk about character Lord my that's what God's trying to do this small thing of money to give us character to give us some tools that you can restrain yourself okay if you don't have it you know you don't spend it you don't have it so stand still stand still pray said Lord God I it's the devil want to make it easy for you to just go here or do that but say Lord let me bring it to you father help me and watch him watch the Lord give him a little opportunity yeah give him that opportunity as I said the devil right within that living right there he tries to trip you up trip you up you see he never wants you to get to that end so he brings living debt and he causes this great confusion and you see that little spinning around it just spins and Spins and you're never able to get out that's what happened to many many many people okay that was sherop and you know for my great-grandfather and those kind of the system that they had they would get caught up in that thing and never get out never ever get out that's right okay and stuck working working working working and can't grow can't train on anything okay and that's what happened to him but the devil doesn't change so he just brings it along in this day and time and just say hey I got another easy way it's called interest just take your credit card or go borrow or do this okay and I'm saying I want to say you know this pray about those things that's what I'm saying each person has to make their choices I understand that we all do I'm saying pray about it give God an opportunity give him an opportunity see what he will do you know talk ask you know we're not designed brothers and sisters to do everything alone we're not we're not designed to do it alone no okay but we need character all of us because sometime it is hey we can pray with you we can we can wait on the Lord too as well because we have to see what the Lord can do and what he wants to do in your life but I think together as we get that kind of bond and that kind of love where we are real we're praying see as you get character yourself you're able to give that to someone else okay not so much give it but you know yourself see for example let's say I don't drive a Lamborghini okay so I got the character not to get a Lamborghini so if my son wanted me to get him a Lamborghini I got the character I'm say no you see it's very easy it's not a problem you know if I can drive the minan then John you can drive the minivan too you know I mean I I got to do it you see the character you see or you're able to give them that because you got strength okay but if I did everything I wanted to do and I'm just free then he could come and say Dad I say well God I can't let him go through all this hardship John I got you you don't know but I'm gonna let you make your choices John I'm going to make you make your choices an Melody I always tell me you know you got choices you can make them you pray about them take Proverbs 3 I told were telling that the other day y'all take that just acknowledge the Lord bring him in every decision you're going to make acknowledge Him He said he will direct your path as you get older Mom and Dad can't be with you and make all your choices for you we wish we could but we can't cuz you ain't going to let us either so we better take a step back cuz you're not going to let us make all your choices so we want to give you the tools so you're trained you can make those choices and then we let God lead you absolutely and that's for each and every one of you so as you have questions and you have things in challenges in your in your life you go to the Lord and pray about these things and you make those choices prayerfully and regardless if you make those choices prayerfully then God will train you sure we we're confident in that he will train you he will definitely do that so that is the key to it to any particular situations that you have to bring God into the middle of it no matter what don't let somebody rush you through it now bring God in it and then you walk with the Lord right amen so the right spending plan shines the light on the financial path to clearly see how to navigate that's what a spending plan will do for you amen all right now as we look at spending plan I want to kind of give you an idea to get a little handson we're going to look at Bill and Sarah's Jones spending plan all right and this is what we had to do as I was growing as I looked at my own life and I realized Lord God we been paying our ties but something is wrong okay so I started taking a spending plan and learning how can I manage what you've given me I thought I was managing it but Lord apparently I'm not so what I'm going to do so this is Bill and Sarah Jones and this is just a a a past of and um the employer is work till you drop employer Lo located on 1 2 3 4 Dead End Lane and it's an exhaustion Pennsylvania and um Bill Jones he live on foreshore tired Lane and help me Pennsylvania and the bank is called bailout Bank Corp that's it and the company hey they'll trade your 16 63,000 lifespan hours for Cash you can take your life and trade it in for cash but anyway so you pull your pay stub you you look at how much you're making right this person's making $2,000 bill and Sarah and of course the government takes their taxes out and they are bringing home every two weeks $1600 $1,600 that's what they're bringing so you should know how much money you're bringing in even if you have a variable income you should have an idea of what you're bringing in if you got a variable income you can look at your last year taxes divide that by how many weeks or months and you can say okay this is what I'm expecting to make this year okay so you can have an idea of how much you're going to make of course those are work again you will have a pay up okay that's number one know how much you're making okay number two what do you owe as far as your debts okay do you have a mortgage okay do you have cars okay and all of these screens that you're seeing here we do have copies and we have sheets that you can use and they're going to be in the back you can take them with you we can get copies if you need more copies but these are sheets that you can use to list out everything that you owe right everything that you owe you want to list everything out you want to put those interest rates and I understand you know some of us may not even know what interest rates are and what does that mean see interest rate is the cost of you borrowing that's what it is the cost of you borrowing money and the higher that is then the more expensive it is to borrow money if you have 18% and you borrow $100 if something is 18% that means means you can get $100 today but if you give me back that money a year from now you need to give me$ 118 okay that's what that percentage mean so the high higher that is that means that's how expensive it is okay so put your car loans anything that you got you want to put that down and you want to start noting your monthly payment with a spending plan we're trying to get how much I'm bringing in and how much is going out okay remember all work works so you got to work this you got to put it down you got to get it in writing and if you got some easier way to write it down get a napkin piece something let's get this stuff down out of your head okay and that's good for any spouse get it down so you both know what's going on okay what you owe you may have some Bank overdraft charges that you owe you may have some Hospital expenses you may have some credit cards why did I do it credit card that I did it you may have some money that you borrowed from the family that you thought you going to never pay back but as Christians guess what you got to put it down you got to put it down and start talking I know it's hard but get everything out you want to get this stuff out of your head what do I owe what do I owe on this journey because we want to clean this thing up remember our Prophet said clean up your lives pay your debt so we're doing that you're bringing it down you're bringing it to paper to put it down you're writing it down okay then the next now you want to put it on a spending plan again we have sheets these sheets like this and this is where you're going to write down all of these categories everything that you spend money on should be able to fit in these categories how much you earn your salary your ties how much you're paying your taxes you can get that off your past du or your last year taxes and divide it by the same amount your rent mortgage all those things your water bill your house all those things you want to have listed your gas how much do you estimate that you're spending a month okay any payments you have that listed in there all of that's going to be there okay eating out how much do you eat out okay that's very important people do that a lot your lunches your snacks any subscriptions of course we got Netflix we always talk about around here that add and in you know they were saying I read something the other day it said people the average subscription cost now that people are spending is about $200 and something dollars a month that's Hulu Netflix Disney plus Amazon Prime you name it so it's about $212 a month but you want to list everything that you're spending have that listed here on this sheet and ultimately you'll come up with a ending amount is going to be everything that's coming in minus what's going out okay and you're going to either be over or under that's it okay and this is what we call estimate you're just pulling it out of your head what what do you have putting it on paper getting some idea of what's going on okay then the next thing you want to do is go and look at the actual try to get it as close as you can pull those bank statements look at it write it down okay you want to get it as close as you can to what's happening after this this person that were spending about $500 $75 over $575 over a month you say how world is that possible well again the devil has made everything so complicated we got credit cards we got these things that we use and all of a sudden we're just assuming we don't know anymore okay hearing about a young guy he was making $15 an hour and he didn't know where his money was going so I said well well uh what's your rent he was saying I get about 2,000 a month my I'm only renting a room it's 500 $ a month I said well where's the other money it's $1,500 left well I I don't know it's like it may be some gas that's what happens just but guess what even at $15 an hour 100,000 200,000 is well write it down write it down all right but anyway they were spending $575 over a month some of the work is sitting down and mastering your money making decisions once you get it on that sheet you need to balance that that means you need to make choices and so that you're not spending more than what's coming in okay and look at everything so they went through and oh they realized they weren't paying all of the ties that they should so they increased their ties okay they started saying man if we're making about 50,000 that's how much they were making with this 50,000 you know then hey they should be able to save something so they squeeze and said we can at least save $21 a month but that was a start we can increase our credit cards we can increase the payments that we're doing by $10 they say hey we can use less electricity we can turn off the lights hey these are all things we had to do my wife and I had to do this we we were trying to squeeze because we were out of control with this business loss and squeezing everything reduce telephone options you can look at that say do I need all the cell phone plan they got some choices you can make hey make some choices other things in the house we could do groceries we could drop some of that reduce eating out okay you can drop some of those subscriptions drop Netflix put that on there for anybody who's struggling amen you can reduce some clo clothing allowance gifts you know husband allowance you can drop that husband you can sacrifice wife allowance leave that as is if you're smart children allowance you can drop that hey these were things we literally had to do we had to do this I had to put it on paper and start making some choices and we would go through and I would say oh well gosh but if you get it in those categories once you do it you're getting very close to getting some control okay and God wants us to have control he wants us to be able to master the money that he's given us and this is stewardship you see it's it's work this is stewardship you're making those choices okay and they made those choices before they were spending $575 more over spending after they balanced it they were spending what they brought in by making those choices and you can see some of those were simple some of them were difficult choices but they could make those choices and balance that budget all right once they balance the budget now you got the balanced budget as you see listed here and they're balanced okay now what I want you to see and and this is really what what what started happening for me after I balanced my budget I got Balan and and this doesn't have to take long you just got to get it on paper you got to get it down on paper that's the start get it down but once I got balanced okay and we're going to talk about how do you control that balance because that's that's part of the problem we we lose that control but how do we control it but once I got Balan and I started looking at every line item now because I'm like my goodness I'm balanced okay everything coming in is still going out but I've given it a home I've given it something and I started saying okay well you got I got this car payment that's here that's 307 so man before I was 575 spending more for okay and now this auto payment is still there so man if I got rid of that that's all of a sudden I'm not in the negative anymore I would have 307 extra huh and if I didn't have these credit card loans credit card payments and things like that 180 1050 my goodness wow I I would be 500 and something over instead of under I would be over if I just counted the cost [Music] my before 575 after if I got rid of the debt I would have 548 over and that's that's exactly what it is you say well that's simple that's it but the devil is hidden in that so you can take someone in this situation if they can apply that character they can flip the script now they have 540 extra okay so you see how the money guide would get this person to where they can move on to True investing right but along the way right they had to make some sacrifices that mean they paid off the loans they didn't get another loan okay they didn't go right back into the same thing that they came out of they paused and got out of something and didn't go back and that's what we have to do that's the character that we need so just repeat what we just said so number one you got to create your estimated spending just try just try to get something down writing I think this is important for anybody just to get it down what's coming in what's going out what's your estimate what do you think okay once you do that then try to prove it try to see the actual pull your bank statements your credit card statements track your expenses for 30 days if you want those are all options but how would you take something that you kind of estimated you want wanted to estimate okay how much you make and you would say well I think I make you know let's say I I think I make $2,500 every two weeks well then I said good that's a great estimate now go prove it well go get your bank statement or your check stub and say oh it was no it's it's 2100 Oh I thought it was too that's what you need to do prove it okay my electric bill I kind of estimate it's probably around you know 185 a month huh now last month it was 375 okay get those actual expenses and build that plan okay that give you your actual and then work to balance that if you see that you're over what's coming in then you need to make some choices you have to decide what needs to change so your income equals what you're spending that's what you have to do and then you create a new spending plan that becomes your blueprint what are you going to do with that extra that you have okay that's your new spending plan after you've changed everything okay and then you need to do what it takes to keep that plan so if you get down and you say you know what my groceries last month it looked like I spent $895 on groceries and I was over I'm going to have to cut out some of that grocery spending okay then you need to do what it takes to keep what you've decided you need to cut out okay and I like this quote said would you rather have the pain of self-discipline or the pain of regret you're going to have to choose one of these methods and decide what do you want what do you want through this so that's creating that spending plan that some of the Hands-On there there are copies of those sheets back there you're welcome to take it also we got Excel sheets I got the same thing in Excel I'm happy to share that with anybody who wants that if you want Excel versions paper versions whatever you want and if you don't want any of that just try something but at least take that start start something that's going to get you on this journey okay and God will give you the muscles as you start something and that's what I love about his grace as you start something you take that step he takes two you know he takes it further when you do it always remember you know as you get into a spending plan it's going to be no no is a very important word that's being lost in this day and time but I want to remind you no is not a bad word no say no say no to yourself so no I'm not going to do that you know I'm going to wait on the Lord I'm going to trust the Lord I'm going to try to apply something I'm going to try to train myself because remember that's the how I'm going to try before I start doing anything I'm going to say no the world is full of it advertisements and television radio and newspapers and if the American people fall for such as that that's our prophet in the message investment he says full of it the devil is good at what he does as I said there is an enemy and that enemy he's targeting that he knows if he can trip us up on the journey then that's what he's going to do and that prevents us from ever getting to those precious things that God has for us if you can see it in the little things of money think about the greater things that God has has for us that's what I want us to keep our minds on see this is simple simple simple simple just don't spend more than you make sounds real simple I love it it should be it should be that simple if it wasn't for an enemy but having a spending plan it helps you properly divide your income to meet your needs okay take per check you can do that you have annual bills all those kind of things you need to get that all to a monthly level so if you have property taxes things that come annually they come every time you know Christmas gifts is you're a great spender that coming again so you need to decide how much per month you're putting down it helps you see what's coming in and where it's going it helps you determine your lifestyle can you afford your choices it helps you live on what you earn it helped you see the true bondage of debt it's helped you start to pay off debt it it helps you learn how to save helps you to properly give not from borrowed funds Okay so all of that starts putting you into the right frame of mind okay simple you know and this is a simple plan this is a method it's old school but remember if your life is not in order in this area of then you need to do something differently okay and the old school way was you get the cash you put it in an envelope take the cash out of the envelope when the envelope is empty you stop spending that that's that was it but the devil didn't like that so you know what he introduced he introduced credit cards and start making things get complicated before you know it you're like I can't even I can't put it's just you can't put it in an envelope you you lost track and now you understand why you're in the situation that you are in okay but you can stop you can say you know what I can go back to being simple if you're out of control if you don't have your finances in order and your house in order in that area I would challenge you to take this approach okay get the cash I know it's old school but remember God is in Simplicity okay the devil's in the complications of life so go get the cash put it in an envelope use it for your groceries when the envelope is over then you know it's over okay you're eating out put in an envelope okay your debt payments you got kids put that money in an envelope take it out when it's done it's done okay give yourself that if you have these issues there's also ways you can still use envelopes and we have these sheets this is a sheet that we have and you can use it just like a past up a checkbook I mean and you can track an envelope that way okay you can say you know what if I am using credit cards and I am using my bank card and all this stuff well you can still take this tracker just like a checkbook and this is actually what we do okay me and my wife we work together for many years trying many different options many different ways whether it's a bank account this and that but this is the way she likes for herself so we give her like one envelope okay and she gets the grocery envelope and she's able to say okay every week I know I can add let's say $500 whatever that I can add that every week and I can just track that spending so I can spend and I know and then she knows how much she has for groceries so if you have envelopes or these categories that are challenging for you to keep and you losing control you can do that so let's say you're control with everything else you can take one envelope right okay or you might say well I can take two or let's say your husband he may have a a hunting envelope and you're like this is yours every week you're welcome to add 250 to it you know brother waade I'm just but that that's how simple it is every week you can add 250 so if you don't haven't spend it then you know okay two weeks from now I got 500 you could do it that's how simple it is okay so I would challenge you take that approach if you have challenges in these areas but again you want to get to where you have that balanced budget and now you're starting to make decisions and this is what you use to keep it under control you have to have something because there is an enemy okay there's an enemy he's going to try to make it easy to step out of this and confuse you okay because he knows once you start seeing wow I was 500 this way now I'm 500 in that way I'mma start challenging every category that I got and I'm going to see what makes sense okay does it make sense for me to have all these subscriptions I don't know if I want to give Netflix I was looking up it's like $22 a month for their premium subscription I don't want to give them $22 because I want that $22 to add to my bottom line now I got 600 extra a month now see you see what it's bringing to you where you're praying to God lord I got 600 extra I even know I thought I could even get to that Lord what you want me to do with it you see and I started seeing this when my and I'm like oh Lord God I all my money was going out now I have a little bit coming in and I'm keeping some of it huh you mean all these categories the devil's trying to take this stuff from me no we GNA put up a fight I'mma challenge myself okay and I'm not trying to get you where you you live like you're miserable I'm not trying to do that but hey when that character starts setting in you start getting excited I'm telling you something changes about you it does I'm telling you so I can challenge myself and question myself on all these things do I want to do this uh my why nope my why is not greater than what it's going to cost me I'm comfortable waiting at this point okay when that why is greater than the what then I'm going to do it because I'm ready I've been trained and guess what I got the savings now I'm ready I'm feeling good I'm in a position where I can get the best deal I'm good and if I have to walk away I'm good because I got character I got character you see and that's where God wants us to be because I know it's all his is in the first place I've seen him so you're in a position where it can be taken all away from you and you're fine because Lord it ain't mine anyway it's all your grace in the first place but I've managed what you've given me to the best of my ability amen simple simple plan praise the Lord so do what it takes these are the Hands-On things that you have to challenge yourself again the devil's going to make it complicated like this stuff doesn't work anymore it does it's just simple but when you get all these five credit cards and you 10 of credit cards and you can have five credit cards but put it on something it's still spending it's still the same money having a credit card doesn't increase your money it's the same money so if you spend a $100 on credit card that should be deducted okay if you're giving your husband let's say you're giving him $250 a week okay and he has a bank card and he has three credit cards okay he still only have 250 he shouldn't be like well I got 250 in cash and I got 250 in credit card no it's the same money deducted from the sheet okay and we're able to do that my wife and I are able to do that she got she has groceries she's managing that that piece so it however she spends it she has to deducted from the sheet and she likes it she said I love this it's very simple I can do it you know and each husband and wife you're different you know some of them you know the husband like to give the check to the wife and she manages it that's great other house house households are different sometimes it's a combination but hey work together at it decide who you think is best at it and go at it go at it amen again we have these sheets out there use them get them again custom whatever you need to do but the thought is the same the thought is the same get control and again like I said whatever season you're at if you can get that control and you start seeing the extra that you do have then you can still go to God and say Lord what do you want me to do with this what do you want me to do with it and you need that character if you have children you need that character because you're we are human so if you don't have the character all of a sudden you're you're doing for your grandkids in ways that you shouldn't do and now their character is being challenged it is a difficult Journey because the devil is real you see so he's going to do all of that you know and there's many tools and things like that to help all of us in whatever season that we're in to learn and grow grow and learn in these areas so we can be good stewards and pass it down to our kids and our grandkids all the way down it's very very important so as we kind of bring it to a close I want to I want to leave you with kind of the the tools and what you really need cuz we've said it we've talked about it put it on paper we've talked about the cash envelopes we talked a little bit about the why to all of this but you need something you need something as a steward and what you need is what we call diligence okay you have to have that diligence means steady careful cautious Earnest perseverance and one e one's effort with positive energy you got to bring that to the table you got to be diligent the Bible says he becometh poor that dealth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh Rich the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute that's the word of God that's in this word telling us hey diligence is key it maketh Rich why because you start seeing what God has given you to manage you see it and you're able to then to apply it and his word is his word he said it the hand of the diligent maketh Rich you're slothful in these areas you will be under tribute so as I said before you can choose the the pain of self-discipline or the pain of regret it's a choice make spending a plan a family affair decide the best person to manage the spending plan keeping the money could be either husband or wife love and Trust husband and wife need to participate in creating the spending plan like somebody can put it together and then you can talk and say yeah do you agree hey you you know this you think this is enough for your your uh what your allowance husband or wife you know and you might say well husband is I'll give you you know 50 he might say well no I need a little bit more vice versa wife might need 250 or three or four five six seven you never know but that's a decision you got to make but long as it balanced as long as it's balanced then you pray and decide that's that's the beauty of it God is a god of variety you decide to get together as a couple how much you think we but we got to keep it balanced we're in agreement on that but you might say I need this much and we say okay well you can have this but that means we we can't eat out this much then so it's it's your choice I'm totally fine with it but make that agreement have a date night once a week once a month review what's in the envelope what's in this balanced budget roll up your sleeves and roll with the punches it might take you several months to iron it all out but there is a method to it if you stick to it and once it's working then you you don't have to adjust it but ever so often right amen amen so I hope by the grace of the Lord you're seeing this you're seeing how to apply it you know I certainly think of the young people coming up and whatever season of life you're in hey you can do this by the grace of the Lord and as you do this you start seeing God you start seeing him at work in this small area again you can see how excited you get and get when you see that that positive at the end of the month and you can see how excited you would get as you start squeezing in like oh huh I can add more to that my goodness and guess what we hadn't talked about your income going up that's right we ain't talked about that that's right so you start getting and that's exactly what happened I start getting that thing balanced boom holding it steady me and my wife working at it hey we're like I said we enjoyed the $30 we had in our eating out envelope and that's what we would eat out on literally that was it now we could have chose to put 200 in if we want to but that means this would suffer but we had to balance okay but we did that and I started started getting excited because after a while my income would go up but I would say I'm going to keep my envelopes balanced I'm not going to change it so you start feeling like oh my Lord this is absolutely amazing man another year would pass my income would go up we might tweak a category here or there but it's like Lord huh father what would you have me do what do you have me to do you know an extra would come in after a while said you know what anything extra we hitting that mortgage that's where we started saying I don't care what in I'm going keep my $30 I like it because I see what that devil is doing to me on this mortgage payment okay and we would put that extra come in I got another $300 coming into my paycheck it's going to that mortgage that's all I did that's all I did we start keeping the envelopes hitting that mortgage and before you know it we paid that thing off amen that's the grace of God we paid that mortgage off and that's why I see the grace of the Lord came in there he came in there and done something that was totally impossible telling you totally impossible coming from where I came from it was unheard of Simply unheard of okay but the character is the greatest thing we got of the sacrificing the character I mean we we never felt closer I'm telling you we never felt closer as we got on this same page you know and I believe that's for everybody and I believe it's the same thing for the word of God and all of his promises it's the same feeling and I believe as God continues to see us being faithful with these things that we will see his promises come down like that just in that way and we will be getting excited okay we will be saying my God all of these things have always been promised to me I've always been Rich I've always been rich in every area of my life because you are my father I just didn't know how but Lord I'm learning how in this little thing called money okay and I don't want your mind to think you know just because the world is complicated you got YouTube and all of this stuff you got so much going on that people's mind can't grasp that God is in Simplicity it really is so I'm telling you as that testimony of our mortgage being paid off in these simple ways of envelopes that the world would say John no Mara do this you can borrow this no you should do OPM borrow other people's money and that's the way you that's what they're telling you and next thing you know you're all confused and you're like well I don't know what to do God's word is always right here come back to it stick with it in the area of money and watch him work watch him unfold and when you have a lot of money you're going to him you got such character in it that you're like Lord I don't want to do anything unless you want me to do it father period I want you in it praise the Lord Jesus amen we're going to get ready to close with this I think the musicians can go ahead and come on up be found faithful you remember it said it's required that a student a steward be found faithful you know faithful with 100% % faithful regardless of the amount and trusted faithful in the little things first money is a little thing faithfulness with another's possession faithful to the owner faithfulness it unlocks contentment amen and that contentment is again that's a great gain remember that but all of these things you know when we look at God's word everything that he is doing and done he doesn't want you just to work to work he's not afraid to tell you that he has rewards for you that's what I love about the Lord he's not afraid to tell you that there is a reward for it you know some of the rewards are certainly blessings he say a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste going all fast to be rich shall not be innocent blessings great gain but godliness with contentment is great gain character self-control hard work patience diligence frugality gratefulness all of that comes out of being a faithful Steward and of course more responsibilities and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise servant whom his Lord shall make him make ruler over his household more responsibilities and that's what God is promising us to do he wants us to get more responsibilities in his word and managing the things that he want us to manage but we can't do it without the character it's no different than parents with your children you know you know they need the character and you want to do things to bless them but you can't do it if it's going to hurt them you can't so we stand still and we pray and the Lord does the same thing you know and and and we see these things we see that everything has come down to this age this time you know I I I honestly don't take it as just money right not not at all right I see us having the greatest opportunity as our Prophet said the greatest opportunity is down to us man think about this word everything that we have all of these messages we can have it on you watch it's everything all of the experiences pastors preachers everything the history and certainly this church with with brother Dale just the history all of that think all about all of that is on us now all of it you know to say in a sense like there's there's no excuse but more so in a sense that Lord God what a responsibility that we have you know what a responsibility that we have to take this thing on through amen you know and I believe that I believe he said it also on the tape we're ordained for this hour all of us we are ordained for this so pray challenge yourself and said Lord help me help us Lord you've given us everything everything to see to see what happened to this what this person did what we can we got so much so much as I said coming from so much and seeing so much for me personally with financial Jubilee you know I saw men that that fell apart yeah sure I I could hardly name one from where I grew up that that came to anything wow literally men grown men drink drugs die smoke that's that's what we saw lose their way so that in a sense is in me it it it it has broken me to a sense that it's like Lord God what a responsibility you know I want to be one by his grace if I can stand for those men that nice men kind you know um I can name them just off my tongue so many people you know that to me just never had that opportunity they never had it for whatever reason they never had it so you think I'm going to let somebody trick me into signing a $50,000 car note never never it's too much it's like never too much for me when I see what they didn't have I can get gratefulness from driving my van beyond what any normal person can because it's like Lord thank you if it breaks I can fix it my dad didn't even have that he didn't have that if something broke he could fix it he was done try to find somebody who could maybe fix it and they would fix it halfway so I feel so grateful to God that I can go to the Lord like that and say father God thank you thank you Lord now I can get when the Lord is ready and I want to and the why is great then yeah I would do something different but I'm saying that to give you an example the same thing of all of these great Mysteries this word of of God that we've gotten brother Dale preaching his heart out I'm sure for the many years I always took to my wife and said you go you know we were from Atlanta but the Lord took us in 20 years up in Maryland you know and by his grace now y'all pray for me pray for us because we still you know it's a lot of growing and training and things like that but you know I look at it when we paid that house off right when we were getting ready to paid off you know by the grace of almighty God we're getting ready to pay off that house I think I had one more bill and I had the money to pay it you know we start getting the calls like hey John there selling the company in Maryland and close that door you guys coming to Atlanta you know and I look at it said praise God you know look at what he did Full Circle full circle by the grace of the Lord Jesus amen amen praise the Lord Jesus you know and as he said you know we can all stand his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord amen that's our desire sister you can start playing something we'll just take it to the Lord you know that's the key we wanted him to say Well done good and faithful servant Faithful over a few things he's going to make you ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord amen he got a reward that's worth it all all the sacrifices we can make on this side my goodness for his glory is going to be worth it all so praise the Lord Jesus amen let's just sing a song by his Wonderful Grace I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out and show me the way thank God I am free free from this world of sin I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born again Hallelujah I'm Sav save saved by his Wonderful Grace I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out and show me the way oh thank God I am free free free from this world of sin I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born again [Music] Hallelujah I'm sa sa save by his Wonderful Grace I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out and show me the way amen let's just pray precious Lord Jesus father what a a privilege Lord to talk to your people Lord Jesus Lord I just pray you take what was shared Lord Jesus and just bring it to them whatever season of Life they're in Lord wherever they are Lord Jesus oh God that it will be a blessing to them Lord that's the only desire Lord that you would bless your people Lord that you would help us get that why why we're here while we're at church why we're serving you Lord oh God and that become just a passion in US Lord to do what you want us to do Lord oh God to press a little harder Lord to fight a little harder Lord Jesus knowing Lord God that it has come on us Lord everything Lord Jesus all of history all of mankind Lord your Prophet Lord Jesus you Lord being on Earth all of that has come to us Lord oh God and there's no way within our own self we could do it but Lord by your grace we can take this thing further Lord we can take it to where you have for us to take Lord Jesus and I pray for us Lord I pray for all your children I pray you be with us now Lord Jesus keep us Lord we love you Lord again we pray your blessings over your people I thank you for them Lord I Thank you for them listening Lord Jesus and I pray you Lord you just grant us Grace in every area and all the weaknesses Lord all the mistakes Lord we pray for that Grace we love you father we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen we'll turn over to brother Wade Jes I am free free free from this world appreciate brother thank you appreciate [Music] brother I've been born [Music] again Hallelujah are you glad that I'm saved by his wonderful [Applause] gra and I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out and me the way amen let's give our brother a good hand clap of Praise that was good very good so you need to next time we got to put a line in it it's called building fund so since y'all got all this extra money we got from now to July right on time right on time brother I was thinking about that I thought now me and you didn't talk about that so but building fund but uh the lord always provides if you'll do your part if you'll do your part not jip him he will never jip you you'll jip him and you'll lose your blessing that's right but it's like brother John you know the right there at the top I I've had people and dad didn't never preach on tithing much a couple of times his whole life one time when Boyd's daddy came and boy said my preacher never preaches on TI preached on the same day as daddy came so don't ever say that to your folks that my preacher never preaches on x y z because the Lord will just he's got a sense of humor the Lord does so um but um but just think about all that if you if you don't you got to be a good Steward in everything and and tithing and all you know people get all well do it before do it for after it's like brother John said it's pretty simple you bring home a th if you make $1,000 a week write a check for $100 put it in a tiing account well I spent that well quit spending that's not what God said okay pay your tithe and we have faithful tithe payers cuz y'all do a really good job more than more than a lot of others and we sure appreciate that we appreciate brother John and what he's what he's brought and uh we'll do this in the uh next the next month May June and uh we sure appreciate him we appreciate what he stands for and his diligence listen I appreciate a man that can tell his history right and not be ashamed of it right it takes somebody with the Holy Ghost to do that CU most people are mad when they start talking about that their great grandparents were slaves and and share coppers and and and and you uh you should have put your name of your business on that that dumpster John's dumpster diving business or something like that was popular that's right but a man that can do that when everybody else is laughing at him right and then see now that that he lives in a real fine home that's paid off he's got a wonderful family sure we all got problems we all got issues but the little things the little things and brother John's done it and he came from and my dad my dad was a share coer their whole family that's all they done they took they had a field of 100 acres and you got 50 and you planted 50 and if if the guy didn't make good you didn't make make good so you know they had to share it it's why they call it sharecropping and if you had a bad year you all had a bad year and there was nine of them and Daddy was the baby so the old saying goes don't throw the baby out with the bath water that's where that came from cuz by the time daddy got his shower at I mean got his bath in the bathtub at 9 the ninth one you couldn't see him so don't throw the baby out with the bath water that's where that came from not from my dad but that's where that saying came from don't throw the baby out with the bath water people wash their kids and then they wouldn't be able to find them in the in the tub but I appreciate that brother johnen for a man to stand and tell his history and be and and be all right with it same way with all of us I me we all come from different backgrounds but but you you folks of color you have a different you know a lot of times you have a different mentality about it and and that and that just comes from the world but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we all the same color we all came from the same background we all were slaves we had an Emancipation Proclamation God said I'll save you if you'll ask me and that's way better than Abraham Lincoln's that saved all of us and give us eternal life um Abraham Lincoln was kind of temporary you know he he gave them the Emancipation and then people kept going on and and I don't think they stop slavery a lot after that but when you once become a slave to the devil once God emancipates you from that it's for eternity and you're free that's you're free and like I said you you see that you go to that Jubilee year and you see that person you can go free if you want to amen if you want to go free you can if not you'll be born in the in the air with an A Marked for life can't hear anything out of that air so you can't hear that Jubilee ever again don't pass up your time being in this is Jubilee year this is Jubilee for everybody all right I looked outside it it's not raining it's not cold it was a minute ago but it's not cold so but I'm still going to read the scripture here that way when we go out there we'll have the baptismal service and it won't take um that um that long of a time just be careful when you walk out there it might be a little bit muddy but I looked out it looked okay the Lord I asked the Lord just to not let it rain while we had the baptismal service so I appreciate him for that but let's go ahead and read the the um the scripture here and then we'll go down and then we'll sing on Jordan stormy Banks I stand there and then we'll have prayer and then we'll if you're ready anybody else want to be baptized just jump in line and we'll baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus so let's read the scripture Romans chapter 6 is what shall we say then shall we continue sin that Grace May abound God forbid in other words get a plan have a plan have a plan of action and and before I I was going to tell you this June and I when we first took the financial piece thing with do Dave Ramsey um I think we paid off $6,500 we had money laying around we didn't even know we had we paid off like $6,500 in 3 months but you sticking to the plan right and so you can do it and another good thing to do is is to check up on your insurance plans we saved a lot of money cuz we just had a guy that was our insurance agent for and he's a good guy but uh he may jump up there a little bit not send you a not send you a notice that it's going up a little bit so we um we went through all that and got all new insurance rates and it was lower so we saved like $200 a month I think it was just right just from changing insurance companies so um so that's something that you can look at but remember when you get those things don't bring them back to Brother John he does not want to see your income he does not want to help you with your homework he's G you enough to do your own homework all right so God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that as many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death Jesus Christ baptized into his death all right therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life you see what Paul did Paul took and he put us right in there with Jesus you know he told us in Romans that were heirs and Joint HS so he told us right here he said whatever you know we're going to be buried like Christ was buried Christ died Jesus was dead the body the man Jesus died all right but then he raised in newness of Life telling us the same thing even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together together with him in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection one day we if you pass away you're going to walk out of that grave they ain't going to be they ain't got to dig you out right this is all secret they're not going to go to the Grave we're not going to the grave and then you see that it looks like the grave diggers got all the people out of the no they just going to come right up hey if they're in another Dimension coming into this one and picking the body up and bringing it out of that casket ain't going to ain't going to hurt them or God either one you know he he he pretty much got it all handled it's going to be a secret thing but you know what Jesus walked out of that tomb with a glorified body whoever's in the Tomb today will walk out of that tomb and a glorified body knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin that's why when a Christian really truly dies that's why brother BR said Christians have sins but we're sinless do everybody understand that some maybe not I see the furrow your soul today by the new birth is sinless there's no way your soul can sin it is dead Christ is in there and can Christ sin NOP but you got a spirit realm you can sin in your spirit realm now what is sin unbelief you don't believe enough that the power of this thing right here will take care of everything just like you may say well brother John that's just do I need to use envelopes I mean come on me and June did and we did a good job with it for a while we fell off the wagon but but we still I mean the principles are still there you got to get you got to get to do something different and that's same way with God I I don't understand I say this real quick I don't understand that people that that that say I can't help but do this well you know what when I was a sinner absolutely I couldn't help but do what I did I did what a sinner did a dog barks because it's a what have you ever seen a cat bark a dog barks that's his characteristic he's a dog all right now if some way though like brother R said if some way you could take that Spirit out of that dog and put the spirit of a cat in it'd be a strange meow but it would be meow all over the place so what about the same way with God you acted like a sinner you were a sinner you acted like the devil you didn't believe and all of a sudden you died that died and when it died it don't come back up I know we have problems still in our spirit realm but in your soul it should be settled anchored I mean laid down where it's dead you're dead in Christ all right for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise Reon you also yourselves to be dead now he's telling us now we need to reckon ourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore Rain Rain r not r a i n r e you're reading it right don't let it rain what in other words take over all right if a king Reigns he rules the whole place all right so don't let sin be the king don't let it rain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God but sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace it's the grace of God that we go and we symbolize a death burial and a resurrection and then the Bible says walk in newness of Life repent be baptized in Jesus name and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost let's try and do what brother John said let's try to do what's already been there it's like it's like Dave Ramy said this is Grandma's stuff his stuff didn't get he didn't sit in his room and get this Revelation it's just from Old School that we've lost from new school ideas you know it's become easy to do the other thing but let's take the same thing with the word of God it's just it's just it's it's really simple we complicate and the devil loves for you to be complicated right he loves Mass confusion he loves for you to question but just say all right God I'm going to take you at your word this is what I'm going to do I'm Gonna Make a Move then brother bam say you make a move God Will Make a Move he's waiting on you to move first though so let's make a move toward God and finances and even spiritual spiritual finances he'll pour out the windows of Heaven if you'll tithe yourself as much as you do your money take 10% of a 40 of a of even 40 Hour Week take 10% of your time right so that's what that's four hours do you give God four hours from from Monday till Friday if you Works 5 days a week do you give God four hours of that time now if you take a 24-hour day of course you got to count sleep but you take a 24-hour day seven days a week that's about eight hours that you need to give God one whole day of just nothing but giving it to God if you tithe your time Brother D priest don't tithing our time right and our talent right and our talent and they're doing it they're making a sacrifice they stay here and practice they brother boy different one they stay and practice and they practice their their their singing they're playing and all that if we had all the musicians up here y'all know we wouldn't have a space to put them all but they practice why do they practice they don't want to do it for the for theirself they want to do it for the Lord right amen they want to do it for you guys to create an atmosphere that you can benefit from it you can benefit from it I know some of the Brother John some of them brother Boyd they if they come up here to sing and and it sometimes it just ain't there but then you work yourself you you do your job you do your job and you Pres in it and then God comes in and he brings it right down and we receive it so God bless you let's say let's have a prayer then we'll go I don't need to change clothes I'll be around in the back but let's go down to the baptismal pool so we can can um um give our sister what she wants she wanted to declare to the world that she wants to to be the Lord's she wants the Lord to have control of our life and we're sure going to be happy happy are ye as we say on the communion happy are you if you do these things happy are you if you do these things like brother John said it'll make you closer to the Lord and to your to your spouse so let's bow our heads Lord thank you so much for a a brother to use his talent to bring it to the purchase of your possession that we can be fully whole in spirit and in the financial part of the world that we have to live in Lord I Thank you so much that you've given him knowledge Lord and and an experience to be able to to articulate these things to to us in such a simple form father I thank you for the brothers and sisters that are here Lord that that you will take care of them that you will bless our children bless our grandchildren all the ones Lord that we want to come into this into this great Christian move Lord and not just the message of the hour but we want them to know Christ and know Christ is to know what scripture says about the way we supposed to act react and you told us first to repent to start our walk and and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ well we're going to do that in just a few minutes father I pray that you'd bless sister Iva June that you would be with her Lord as she goes to the water lord I pray not only that she's made a stand Lord make a stand for her and her body Lord her body has had some things Lord that may be going on and that that doctors are trying to figure out Lord I pray in your precious name that that'll be all be left in that water down there today Lord and that she'll come
