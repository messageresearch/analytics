amen I want to see him don't you and good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn back where we was reading this morning from Hebrews 13 and we'll try to continue our thought to try to get a point to you about something that I've been preaching for I said this morning 45 years trying to preach one thing and I I believe it remember now the uh Bible study will be this coming uh Saturday remember brother Gibby preaching this coming Wednesday bible study this coming Saturday ministers meeting second Saturday to the ministers fellowship meeting third Saturday for here and brother Ernie Ville and no will be with us you know that's all in May and we coming down to getting the year out of the way time is moving on fast so I still think they're trying to some way to take some time out of the day for us and you know and do that but it'll you know I know they can can't but I guess it's just getting faster maybe the older you get the faster everything gets I don't cuz you do stumble a whole lot quicker you know and do that Hebrews 138 yeah this morning I made a comment and some of the sisters said it I got a little bit too far out on what I was saying about the the women going and having the operations you know to stick theirself out well I could have spent an hour preaching quotes from Brother brandom about weing high heels and stretched out and strut it and all like that and it wouldn't have got to point across as quick so forgive me for saying things sometimes that are crazy just remember is the old man but remember is the truth if a dumb donkey said it is still the truth so you know maybe sometimes you say something and it'll it'll hit to people because you know it's just not something natural that's right right it's supposed to be that the sisters are to be humble sweet and everything but what are they doing now everything's going to the women they're going the whole thing is that true now that's not that's not we're just human beings you know we're just we're just people but remember that so you forgive me for that that's all right let's pray father we thank you Lord Jesus for your love and your grace unto us thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us with your presence and your love Lord that you'd forgive us of our human elements and phrases and thought thought a lot of times it's maybe it's not radical according to you but we just got one thing in mind Lord and that's to try to get a people to a place that we can see you made manifest among the people and we're seeing that and we believe it and that's why we're not giving up on anything Lord in this day we're pressing forward to the mark of the prize of the high calling and Lord just moving on in you we love you and we thank you just come Among Us and speak to our hearts and lives Lord that we may they see you and be guided in your grace forgive our sins and lead us in jesus' name amen Hebrews 13 5 says let your conversation see what manner of Life your whole thing now whole thing talking workings doings and everything be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what men what man shall do unto me remember them which have the rule over you remember that now that's not rule of of lordship like we're going around the pastor you know it's Lord you know spiritual husband doctrines went around years ago and all kind of things but what is it remember them which have the rule over you who now who's going to rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God that's the only rule that can rule over you outside of that it's man's rule over rule right it's doing thing what what's now whose Faith follow considering to Ender their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see that's supposed to be the end of the conversation the end of all things and be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines now remember we'll get to it Eve's problem right couldn't believe Hebrews 138 see the reason people get carried away I'll read in a minute where it's just a an old mule that wants to do those things all right be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with meats and have not pro profited them and have have been occupied them that have been occupied therein you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I just want to review just a second and I know that what I was saying this morning is kind of a maybe I didn't get my point across but but listen church God is a good God Amen and he judges us according to our hearts you know and and he judges everybody that way and then you know you can't argue with what the prophet had to say about that the Heathen would even be judged by the how they kept their laws and lived by them and that they were a whole lot cleaner and more straight and line than we are you know as so-called Christian religious world and uh you know but they'll be judged by that now that's wonderful you know to me it is what what it means to you no they they got to be born again well okay that's fine but they're not and now you think about it brother Brandon said you come up to a place of repentance and you know chop off your P sins and and things and you're really believing he said sure if you die right there I said you're going to heaven y now that's you know but now he didn't say they were bride that's right he didn't say they had eternal life right there right you know he'll even relate eternal life to just the fact of you believing and repenting all right but my point is that I believe in growth development all right and and and then talking about preaching 45 years on one thing uh I I believe growth development of what we're talking about you know and even though I'm preach a lot of times the same thing I did series 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago I know myself that it's always in a growth development going up and a little more added to it and a little more thoughts and a little more understanding to to be brought out of it because that's the way it's supposed to be all right and see even brother brandom now we'll get to this in a little bit brother randam after preaching 30 something years the Lord spoke to him and said Jehovah the old and Jesus of the new now what had he preached before then you know he had preached one true and living God hadn't he all right but my point is he didn't he wasn't born with full understanding even the Bible says about Jesus that he grew in Grace and knowledge all right so I believe that we need to settle down and think about it and that way we don't dechristianize somebody that don't believe the way we believe that's right allow that to be between them and God no matter what it is over here Baptist Methodist or anything around it let that be what it is no matter whether it be people of the message groups you know that argue and fuss with each other if you're not in our group you're not going to make it leave them alone just forget it we're against the doctrines that those people bring but not the people they're human beings just like you and I and you know if you haven't heard the truth could you be judged by the truth now you haven't heard it right you can't be judged by something that you're not have it heard that's right you know and see whatever God didn't reveals himself to be down Through the Ages and time that's what you'll be judged by that's right am it won't be required of those in the Old Testament that they have to have the new birth because it was not for them that's right so then you come down to the ages and you have like Luther preaching the J you live by faith that was the new birth of his age but that was not the requirement that was made for the next age the next age was required more the next age was required more that that's what I'm trying to get you to see I I've went through it in every form from former latter rain to all kind of ways we saying it that say I believe former rign teaching rign latter rain Rapture Harvest that you know quickening of it but you know what the next day you're standing with former rain again maybe you don't see that away I'm sorry I I don't have the ability to express myself but I just try to make the point where you can think about it I believe in God that deals with everybody individually Amen in the Gentile dispensation it is not a collective form but even in the Old Testament when he was dealing with Israel you still see him dealing with one person different than another one that's right he he's not just related to everything you know everybody right on one level and one thought okay children they're not required what adults are required right because they don't have the understanding that's right but yet who can determine what they are we were talking the other day about somebody you know I think little boy you know I think was four years old had a great understanding well Anna came along at about 5: and she wanted to be baptized I question first I let it go she asked me and I just kind of I didn't tell her no I didn't tell her yes I just kind of Let It Go he kept coming back to me and then I got to question to her about what she believed right and I went ahead and baptized her about 5 years old you said I went and baptized well now you tell me what the age of accountability is but I tell you that it's like I said you don't feed a baby steak that's right it's got to have milk right and then one day it becomes steak right all right that you can't just leave them on milk and that's what I see about the people of this message especially we've got it right here we're not going to move any further we're just going to stay with this little Doctrine apart we're going to we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to stay right here and we're not going to venture out anywhere and they're scared to death to hear any deeper depth now the pastors is the one that's going to answer for that that's that will be their problem because that's what the Bible says you stand in the door won't go in and won't let others go in they're going to have to answer that well what are you going to do about those people where you going to put them you know that's all I'm trying to get you to see I believe in a God that can come down irregardless of our beings and speak to us individually and direct us individually and lead us yes and but you know what this is a natural story story of a of a child that's enters kindergarten you know kindergarten with a small amount of understanding compared to somebody in the third grade you know or something a lot of difference in understanding but you know what it is all the same wording right it's just better understanding that's what I believe in in salvation Salvation then is not made on the basis of everybody on one level I I've never believed that right I believe that it's an individual Affair yes with you and God Alone amen all right and what he is to you he might not be to the next person but then the point is when we try to make everybody come to our level okay that's right then I believe we're wrong that's right amen right because that's that's not the way of doing it the prophet would preach 30 something years he said before he could preach the stature of a perfect man well you go listen to the message he said I just got this the other day well everybody thinks oh he was born with it he had everything no uhuh than I don't believe the Lord Jesus at three years old understood he was going to die on Calvary do you do he have even really full comprehension of it when he was 12 13 whatever talking to the lawyers no maybe when he entered his ministry did he no but one day it dawned on him it had become a reality to him yes that's all I've tried to preach to you for 45 years is a reality to realize who you are to realize brother brandom is wonderful you got to do that that's right but at the same time of realizing brother Randon brought a message I believe Luther brought a message I believe Wesley brought a message I believe the Baptist was a move of God the Methodist the Presbyterian the Pentecost I believe all that was a move of God for the time yes all right and I believe in that that each one of those can be bride you know you're going to say Luther wasn't bride Wesley wasn't bride Pentecost wouldn't ride you're in bad shape but I'm I'm trying to illustrate it what does it mean then Hebrews 13:8 is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yes amen you know that Luther I believe God was pleased to dwell in Luther's message right don't you it brought people from works and and all things you know idol worship Etc to reality of a living God that's all I'm trying to talk to you and and I about this message must become a reality now you would agree maybe in what I said this morning that we wondered at one time how is we going to get the virtues of the Statue of a perfect man right you know did we just fall air to it or did we just halfhazard Le or was it through growth develop Vel M by the opening of the word right all right now if you agree with that then you can see that when you first got converted maybe a Baptist or Methodist what when you was born again you know what he was to you in that new birth he was Hebrews 138 that's right you might have been as trinitarian as could be that's right but that moment of that new birth brought a reality of Christ to you there was something real I believe every age has to have that I believe every person has to have that and then put us all together around the world and you got the ministry of Jesus Christ amen dwelling in the bride of Christ around the world not not us all over it at Lula huhuh right I've never believed nothing like that never taught nothing like that because what I saw to begin with I still see God wants to live in individual people right but our biggest problem is doubting what he's trying to do right in ourselves brother random when he saw we'll get to it in a minute about the Hebrews 13:8 it's about 1961 on a message on the message of Grace is the first time he mentions ining the rainbow coming down the three thing coming down and it's on a message of the message of Grace and he called out Lord what would you have your servant to do go ahead and pull that up brother Joe and let him read he said what would you have for your servant to do just then the spirit of the Lord came in in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah the old that wasn't in 47 or 33 and that's what he said now what did Brother random preach before then you realize if he hadn't preached it correctly God could not have spoken to him about the Jehovah the old and Jesus of the new that's right right that's right was he ever a trinitarian no he said I used to think a prophet now that believes in one God I used to think that Jesus loved me and God hated me he said until I found out it was a selfs sameed person that's right well do you understand what I'm getting at yes is it the only change his MK from Spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him letting me know assured that these 31 years hasn't been in vain amen now but that was the first time that I find now you find other just don't worry about it read it that where he mentions Hebrews 138 in that way but you want to click on Hebrews 138 and see about I think it's a thousand something times maybe that he says it you know what he preached Hebrews 138 before then yeah before 61 right why is it then that God would so emphasize the point to him that he would see the rainbows of things and be a confirmation of his message the message he was preaching was the truth and God was coming down to confirm that message to him right right see that that's my whole point of what I'm getting at going to number one now this is the next time coming over which is a little bit later which is let let your light so shine before men uh paragraph or E1 and look what he says because he's referring back to the the light of things rainbow said Jesus of the New Testament is jeah the old he just changed his Veil well I sat studying that I found out that same word where he changed his countenance in the Greek didn't mean changing his mask not exactly his Veil but his mask it come to the place that he was transformed that means he changed his he changed that means he changed his way he was god Jehovah and God Jehovah changed himself from a spirit and became a man he's a son name Jehovah God which that was the father and this is the son being the same person so we see brother brandham then had deeper depths of understanding but I ask you a simple question and the question is the point I told my wife I said I don't know how in the world to get this but how can we brother randam always preached that he was Hebrews 138 that was him campaign uh slogan on his Billboards and the things when he went out preaching right was Hebrews 138 but then one day something happened that opened up to him right right he preached to seals in 50s something he thought he preached him but then one day it was opened unto him all right see that's what I mean about a God that can and all of what I talking about today about how that he judges people according to what he has delivered unto us yes and if it was a heathen that had no concept of Jehovah God or Jesus Christ and but yet he's worshiping idols and see your thoughts is that well he ain't no h for them the Prophet come along and say they'll be judged according to their customs and laws and things but you see we think we have it all figured out and that's why that from the beginning I've I've tried to express I did I believe in progressive revelation brother Claud I said don't like that Progressive he said that's I just ain't you know I'm just too don't have another word to use the best thing is partial to real realization to perfect realiz our growth development understanding you know as it keeps opening to us that what we see today tomorrow is just a foundation for something else and see I've taught you from the beginning that I believe what we're getting here in this world is just a foundation that when we get into Glory that we can he can speak to us without all of this garbage that we've got and we'll have an understanding but you know what will he speak to Luther like he speaks to you no he'll speak to Luther of his day that's right and his time that's right all right see don't throw off on people and put them out of the message or put them out of the out of the the understanding you know you say well what about these people that's got these false doctrines you know that are in the message the ones I feel for and cry for is the Ley people that are sitting there that what can they do they're let known in a way that's not telling you you leave here you're going to die of course some of them's that strong and says that thing but they're letting on in a way of a fear that they can't exist without that person who brought them into the message who led them you know and they'll follow them right on down you say what hopes are they for them what hopes are there for me and you well what do you mean Brother D I'm trying my best well what was you when you wouldn't trying to do it you know what he said I'm just trying to be honest and looking at something from 45 years or trying my best to preach it that's right that he wants to live in you and I the way he wants to live right one brother around preach message like doors indoors right and he said we had doors closed that's right now we didn't have doors closed with a whole lot of garbage over in there as the reason it was closed it's just that we didn't yield up to God that's right to where he could use it that's right it's not that you got adultery behind this door that's right no remember it's in the heart that's right that's where the Holy Ghost is at amen we see it's because we lack understanding that's true and you you go about the country and you listen to the Ley and they'd come to me and they said brother Dale can I get your tapes I said yeah if you'll get your pastor to okay well come on now we're going to be dogmatic and arrogant about everything else when he said bless God I don't care what my pastor said I want the tapes but instead I can't get them go my pastor won't let me listen nobody else now you tell me it's not fear that the people of this message you're living under right right you tell me that's not fear why wouldn't you just say I don't give a hoot what he says I want the tape that's right why didn't you say that about brother brandom right oh my pastor don't believe brother Bram hey come on I'm too old I know a brother used to preach down in Athens nobody can't feed my people but me at the same time old Don gin and F Billy Fowler was truck drivers going up through Jeffersonville and they'd come back with brother brandom's tapes and he'd be preaching his way and ain't nobody can feed my people but me and there's back there pic and tapes to each other getting the message if you wasn't afraid then why are you afraid now hey that's going out to Hur okay okay if you wasn't afraid to wrestle it out about brother brandom and get his message why not the truth now yeah but I believe if I leave this group I don't know what to do lady told my wife years ago said man over in India that claim to be God he said does he believe brother Brown's message said well he's a little off she said well then forget it he ain't God like I said this morning about the man that went in wanted a couple of weeks off his church he was out showing him brother around him was wrong they said why don't you just leave I said praise the Lord somebody let them raise up amen what's the matter well I'm afraid no it's not afraid you're like my sister my sister everybody thought she was afraid of her husband she'd drive to town and she'd put a rock and she'd dve to town she'd pull back and park exactly at that rock everybody said she does that cuz she's afraid of her husband no she just didn't want to listen to his mouth she'd steal the money off of out of his pocketbook you get what I mean but you see why are we afraid to listen to somebody that can preach things deeper than we why that's the person I want to listen to brother Mo and I learned years ago a little something you'd hear everybody telling you how long wrong his brother was you know oh he's off the message well you know what that was the guy we went and listened to CU we figured he must have something that others didn't have and they're scared of it that's right I don't care for you listening to other people's tapes I've always told you that amen but I said when you bring it back here that I don't agree with we'll deal with it from the pull pit that's right I think that's my right the God given right of Hebrews 13:6 that's right 7 and 8 that's right that if I'm going to watch over you in your soul then that's the way I have to do it and I believe it that way and that's all I've ever done but telling you not to listen to nobody else I never told you not to listen to nobody I have told you to be careful what you listen to that's right and I wish you would do me one thing that you know I wish you would listen with a pive what is that word pive good word an attitude that you would pick apart their message like you pick me apart maybe that's picky I'm going to cond a new word Webster get ready but I wish you would do that you pick me to Pieces brother Dale you said well listen to everybody outside way amen people come to you and say I've told people so and so was I well I've heard her takes and I didn't hear them say it but yet you always hear the mistakes I make right okay got that point across well listen Paul was a great man we know that yes I said this morning he wrote the basics of the New Testament you know more than anybody else and brother Brown said the Great Book of Hebrews the word that even the scholars argue whether or not he wrote it but he said Paul wrote it he said because his character is there he said because he'd take those Old Testament types and things and bring them into the New Testament right and like I said you know in the communion a man that never never had communion with the Lord Jesus right you know one right the others did but yet he was chosen to write about it when none of the others even were chosen that's right now why is that but get this thought brother ran him up until 61 go back and run how many times he preached on Hebrews 13:8 but yet all at once God speaks to him and says Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new now what kind of a God was he preaching before then right and when we read it in a minute that Paul had a greater understanding in all of the rest of them that's right Paul was the only one that understood Jehovah the old Jesus and you we read it well what the rest of them understand did Peter and him believe in a trinity come on Peter was the one that was chosen that's right to open the door amen that's right to the Jew and the Gentile that's right and what was it based on what it Matthew 16 or 13 what it Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he was declaring himself to be the Old Testament Jehovah right to Peter right are we you getting a new God no Paul had a deeper Revelation that's right amen that's all I'm trying to get you to see this prophet had the Revelation I've never tried to say oh I'm going to teach something deeper than he does there's doctrines of that out there we go beyond brother Brandon we do no the only thing we're going to go beyond brother Bram is we're going to take a change of the body and he didn't get to do that right but I'm asking you what do you believe what do you believe about God do you believe the new birth you have inside of you is the same God that spoke to Moses from the burning bush amen come on the same God that was leading the children of Israel across the Red Sea yes well now in a way I've got a good one in here brother R said the M when it said that yeah so you know what kind of Revelation the mule had yes but what about it to say why would God so emphasize to a prophet that had always preached him as the Eternal Jehovah Elohim self-existing go through the Hebrew series and read them of all the things that he spoke of this great one and then God would appear and say Jehovah the old Jesus the new well I'll have you you know that's what I've been preaching the whole time is that what we think happened well now Lord what are you doing that far ask you what you want me to do or preach and I've been doing that all my life no he come out of there happy right he come out of there with a fresh Revelation that's right something happened within the man that he never forgot it the rest of his life he put it into Hebrews 13:8 but yet he had always believed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen that church is all I've tried to do 40 something years I've tried to get you and I to see that there's deeper understanding of this message that the prophet has brought unto us right amen amen there ain't nobody to come along straighten this message out it don't need straightening out it needs somebody to believe it well brother R was wrong here brother was wrong there well then I guess you're God for yesu let me kiss your toe come on you can straighten him out you got to be almighty God see no people oh they'll say brother he showed us where brother R was wrong here where brother wrong here where look what he said he said uh 7,000 instead of 700 and I remember a certain brother we were Jeffersonville Indiana and someone was saying well re that's a type brother R never said it was a type he said anybody ought to know what the Bible said and I don't even know where it said 700 7,000 cuz I ain't never worried about it whatever which one it was he said it the other way but this brother was up he said see there now that prophet he just winking away like there was some typ in it when the prophet said there was no typ he said I just made a mistake well there going to be 7,000 instead of 700 where is that going to bring the rapture amen but the opening of the word something personal to you right amen the only thing we can stand on to think about any Rapture right right if not we're going to go by the grave amen that's right why because types and this and that and this what brother supposed to do this this brother seven Thunders were supposed to be seven certain brothers and you had to hear those Brothers right when I happened to know some of them and I didn't care too much for what their thoughts were well that's just being stubborn okay I'm stubborn I don't know my trou I'm admitting it but what's your problem you're just trying to be stubborn and I'm stubborn that just makes us all stubborn it don't put us in the Rapture that's right now come on church I'm just asking you and I know it's making it look like I'm exalted so you do what you want to 45 years to try to get a church to come to a realization of who you are amen 45 years of preaching yeses Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to start the first message off the Bride of Jesus Christ would beat the son of man 1969 oh who do you think you are I'm me who are you if you'd stay out of Walmart you might get a message lord well why would you talk well I remember a brother we used to P go their church and he said I didn't have nothing till I got down to Walmart mark this evening well that's all right you know but then he preached on women's hair and dress and clothes but you see I'm the dirty old guy well I've been it 45 years ain't no even changeing now if you don't like it you got to vote any time you want to for a pastor I got one and I mean that that to be God's honest truth cuz I've tried one thing to get you and I to see Jesus Christ the same yest today today and forever and to see that he's the same not just in a way that's right you find me any other statements right around talks about leaving your pastor he makes one statement he said if he's off the truth right you leave him he made another statement and said if he Don't Preach Hebrews 13:8 as the same get away from him right yeah brother Dale you just you know you've always been hard-headed and wouldn't listen to me I tried to straighten you out oh I had a brother do that with me here one time and I told him I I'm sorry I didn't get that I never I didn't get it he preached a sermon feed my sheep feed my sheep feed my sheep that's good message I enjoyed it later on he said you remember that message of feed my sheep he I tried to straighten you out said you just so deep and everything said you wouldn't feed my family the simple things I thought I thought that's what you're supposed to do I I thought parents you're supposed to feed your kids the simple times you know and that would help me what you see that makes me a battle egg but I'll face God is being a battle EG for trying my best to get you to see Jesus Christ we went through the series of of the the uh word being restored you know the gr went of the ground and then come up to the son of man and come up to the r being the fullness of the godhead bodily but you see this one brother he said you said that she's the fullness of godhead body he said I won't quote the rest of it you know he was but he just blowed it off like he said that third pull is only for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus well I thought brother R said it was for the bride and I thought he said for the church and I thought he said to the totally lost sure did but yet who's going to listen to me well the ones that listen to me that are the ones that I'm responsible for their soul to try to happen if not you'll get up and leave and go somewhere else but it's like I said this morning then is it up to me to go beg people to come back to church that doesn't come here I didn't beg them to come here to start with that's right I don't feel I'm responsible you're at home sick it's not for me to call you that ain't Bible it's for you to call me that's true but listen church do you get the simple point I'm trying to explain yes brother brandham preached always that he was God yes but one day it unfolded as he said about the shooting of the the the what do you call it the Roman candles that they go up just keeps going out and out and out one day it just opened up and God spoke to him said Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new you know he had a wonderful time thinking about that right that meant it something open to him something became personal Church what is going to bring the Rapture something personal to be in you one of these days I'll preach to you what I really mean on that if it's something personal to me and you that then we're the only ones that's going to get it that's the ones who are playing around in the sugar tit message things are not going to get it but I still didn't say they wasn't going to make the change of the body so now don't go wrong but they without us cannot be made perfect still applies today see somebody's waiting on you and I that's right but you think about it he's the same yesterday today and forever look what he says go ahead number two I think we got part of it but in the Old Testament this is all we would see Jesus 62704 84 through 86 I guess in the Old Testament Christ the same Christ the same in the New Testament and Christ the same forever then if we can see what he was then what he had been and what he will be then we've got it if we can see what he was what he is and what he will be we got it right what you got the same God that's right what brother around say he said how many gods did Israel have one God he said how many gods does a bride have one God right then we got it Moses said now you'll be like me a prophet like unto me then when he come what Christ that was he had to be what then he had in he had to be what he was before then so now let's start from right d and then we'll see what he will be forever that's the only way to make it same yesterday now here he was we find the Hebrew writer is Paul saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday speaking to the Hebrews and we all know that Jehovah the Old Testament was Jesus of the new and it's the Holy Spirit of today it's just the same God just manifested in three different offices and so the same God and all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was he poured into the church so you see you can find quickly what he is the same yesterday today and forever we quote all God we quote that all God into Christ all Christ in the church but do we see it's the same God that's right amen that's right but you see when our thoughts are our thoughts are locked until God reveals to us right right until he speaks to us our thoughts are locked and our thoughts might be right that's right don't was brother brandom's thoughts right right when he preached one God from the beginning and in 61 God spoke to him about Jehovah the old Jesus of the new if his thoughts hadn't have been right he wouldn't have spoke that right right Y what do you understand yes let's just drop down we go to number three the voice of the sign paragraph 131 to get right on down on now notice what did Paul have the rest of them didn't have we believe everything brother Brown says we'll read that he had the abundance of the revelation of the word of God because it was Paul who recognized that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the old now what did the other disciples have what did they have when Peter opened the door and said Upon This Rock I'll build my church Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right did Peter have that Revelation did the disciples have the revelation of one true and living God come on get over in Timothy where he talks about Immortal Eternal but Paul what did he have a deeper Revelation right Hallelujah I could say that something here but he had the revelation of it he wrote it and re and revealed it because God permitted it to be added to the Bible listen to him and the word comes only by the Bible by the prophet and so then God revealed to Paul and he wrote the letters inspired and God put them in the Bible oh my revealed that he is Christ of the Old Testament because he met him well all the others met him now what does it mean Peter them ate with him fished with him what does he mean going on to the next one we'll get back to that quote in a minute to where you get a point well let me do it now yeah let's go drop 38 you there're ahead of me today where's my other notes yeah when somewhere all right this is taken from a true sign that's overlooked 1961 236 look what he says he's coming down in Paul and explaining the way in the Lord then he said except I would have be exalted above the abundance of the Revelation he had more of a revelation than Peter James John or any of them he seen him after he had been gone for maybe two years or more you remember what I said there what the thought was all of them seen him all of them hunted and fished with him you right what's he getting at look at that after he's been gone for maybe two years or more standing in a pillar of fire talking to him how much greater today 2,000 years and he still lives he had a deeper revelation look at the next one but it was greater than Peter James John I said this morning John Peter said Paul says things hard to be understood right now brother random said what he said John Peter and John Paul were not different in What doctrine am I right he said it was a difference with Peter and his actions you remember when he rebuked Peter well no Doctrine look Christ is the mystery God revealed paragraph 244 through 246 Paul had something greater than even the Apostle did see they said well now what they said well I've got more of a revelation than you Paul because you know I walked with him I went fishing with him when the I heard him I sat in the boat but Paul saw him after he was dead buried rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel knowing Paul being a Jew would have never called that Lord unless he had seen the expression he was back the same yesterday and forever he said Paul in other words I'm the same God today that I was yesterday here I am in the same light the pillar fire that Moses talked to in the burning bush no wonder he could separate the law From Grace over in the book of Hebrews he met the same Pillar of Fire he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest now I'm not saying that James John all of them John went that Baptist a lot of things right right but yet nobody touched Paul's Revelation there no record that just go on and forget it leave it alone look what we need go ahead to number four now this is revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book page 26 now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is God the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new no matter hard how hard you try you can't prove there are three Gods but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that the Jehovah the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new amen that's right watch what he said Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth what Jehovah the old Jesus of the new and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we need a revelation of Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new right we need a deeper understanding amen Paul had a deeper understanding Paul had the understanding that it was the same Pillar of Fire he metant the same Pillar of Fire that Moses met do you understand what I'm getting at yes but what Revelation did Peter John and them have when John went on to patmas and saw him as the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending Etc come back and wrote about the things but yet he couldn't touch Paul's Revelation but was Paul's Revelation any different than Peter's or John's and one of them reveal a trinity other revealed one God no it was just deeper understanding right now I make my statement again 45 years I've tried to get you to see that this bride has got to have something personal for now Luther's age is pass Wesley's age is pass ausa street is passed brother random coming the ministry he had the things is passed now it's time for the bride to realize who she is and what did the prophet say when she realizes who she is and what she's here for what did he say said she'd be an invincible Army so what should we want well brother Dale just tell us how good we are tell us how wonderful it is tell us how sweet we all are call our names and tell everybody all the good things we've done this week what if I called all our names and told all the bad things we done this week I guarantee you you'd think I was more of a prophet for telling you the good things and I would if I told you the bad things right but do you get the point yes when a man is great as brother br him going down to number six by pass we know from the Mighty God unveiled that he's in the morph he means he changed his form right same God oh show us the father look what it he talks about God in his people everything was was put into Jesus Christ he was co-equal with the father is that right think it not work robbery but he was equal with the father I used to think God was mad at me but Jesus loved me but I come to find out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God well you know what if that's true then evidently he didn't know Jesus was the heart of God until that was made known to him right CU he said I used to than there's another one on identified Christ I used to think that you were cuz he's praying angry with me but Jesus love me but I find out now that Jesus is the very Heart Of God so I know that you loved me and suffered for me do you really believe in one God so we find that God never changes we've been through that right scanning down go on to number nine look what he says when their eyes were open and they knew him paragraph 70 I say under the authority of God's word and the feeling of my own soul that same holy ghost spirits right here now in the midst of this people I claim that he's raised from the dead I claim he's alive alive forever more I claim he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in principle the same in power the same in everything oh but his Corporal body well now brother D I agree with he was assigned to brother brandom but what is it to you you don't realize you just trapped your own self by your smartness I believe he was the sign to brother brandom but what is it to you come on you mean there's another God somewhere according to Paul he said there's not another gospel right well well brother Dale I believe that in a way in a way he's the same God that was Jehovah the old as Jesus knew I I I believe in a way go ahead number 10 Jesus Christ was same yesterday today and forever 63 627 paragraph 37 38 well then I'm asking this question then why can't we see him if the Bible said he is the same yesterday today and forever that doesn't mean just in a way the Bible said he's the same now to me the Bible it either is wrong or it's right now if that's not the inspired word of God then I don't know what to believe not in a way now to you that say he's not the same listen everybody open wake with me to you that say he was in brother brandom and we believe that the devil did too abely he knew that right he run from him right amen right but he's not the same today you're saying in a way he's different than he was with brother brandham no no I'm not saying he's different now you know what I preached about that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm talking about around the world he is the same Lord Jesus with the same Ministry the son of man the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in his bride around the world all right not just in Lula Georgia that's right amen true but see when you say in a way look what you're doing you know what that means you don't have a clear understanding of God right let see I know I just hurt feelings didn't I when I do it hurt your feeling it hurt my God's feelings amen I love you and I don't want to hurt nobody's feelings you don't know this man and how much I back off and how much I take it to myself and go cry to keep from blurting out and being hateful and arrogant in every way even to tell the truth I've backed away and backed away and cried about it instead of coming right out here and calling names and said get in the Altar and straighten up or get out but yet I'm the dirty old dude where you at sister fre maybe you need to get me that shirt was that you who was talking about getting me a shirt sister Trudy getting me a shirt out there and it says dirty old dude that doesn't mean just in a way now look who says it's just in a way roll up to the next one message called Perfection 56810 paragraph 198 say is Jesus the same yesterday today and forever the old mu will holler oh in a way in a way now I'm sorry that I can read you know I'm sorry that I can run I may have my own cuts past and everything the way I run the computer that you life at but I still get it right the mule is the one that says that he's the same in a way but a predic readed will say Amen you believe in Divine Healing amen a genuine experience of God will P punctuate every promise with an amen that's right with the MU honky honk days of Miracles is p we don't believe God is here today like he was well show me around the world a man that can stand up and say the things brother Bram did there's not any but in the bride of Christ there is the man Christ Jesus that you better not Crow too much somebody just might step up and take your challenge right remember we think it was Moses taking the challenge when he said all on God's side come over here they were the ones that set up the stage think about it Church you're going down let's see Perfection let me get that right run back up where we at in Perfection is that the one okay roll that up this is perfection preached in 56 616 E9 the 13th chapter the ending chapter said now this is Brother R talking about Paul ends with this towards the end that Jesus Christ is in all and all that is the same yesterday today and forever see showing that it was Christ back before the law it was Christ in the law it was Christ in the days of grace and it'll be Christ forever Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what a beautiful picture the Hebrew letter paints and I ask this morning or talk go to number 13 what's the biggest sin that we were talking about maybe starting the message all the great things that have happened the greatest sin that ever happened in the world that caused all the other things to happen remember Eve got confused before she had to act with the Beast right the act with the Beast was just a manifestation what sin are we against today oh we don't all these murders oh God I don't see how God to live and let this world live like this that's what we say you know what it could be my unbelief and it could be your unbelief and what I mean by that is is not the way you interpret it probably lack of understanding is one thing that's right you know lack not having to understand it not being available to understanding is one point but remember it's still sin you said well brother randman died went in the grave by sin I don't agree with that now I believe he died and went to the ground because he had to get out of here because he done said it no two of us can be here at the same time well then you're going to say Jesus went to the Grave because of unbelief now you really got a problem do you believe Jesus had any unbelief I don't believe brother random had any unbelief but he died and went by the grave abely now think about Eve then for a minute God of this evil age 65 paragraph 37 and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all got confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever see today we failed on One Promise under the temptation of enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of of course is his bride she is to come in contact by the same thing not just denominational truth or something but every word now did Eve doubt any of the word God said she doubted he wouldn't keep his word now Hebrews 138 wouldn't written back there she didn't have it nailed on the walls of the Garden of Eden that she could look at so she thought he changed Satan convinced her because she done a good job remember she done a good job preaching to Satan right God has said the day you eat thereof don't take her this tree she's done a good job she had Hebrews 13:8 and a good line didn't she but remember when she began to contemplate or study upon what Satan brought to her and I've told you and I believe it we don't have it written out in verbatim words but paraphrase your thoughts or whatever you want to do the devil didn't come to Eve and say there's no God he knew better than that she had witnessed him she had seen him she knew she was a creation but you know what he convinced her he convinced her that God loved her so much that he wouldn't kill her you're not too bad what you're doing you know go God meant for you to do that and you know what God did mean for her to have children he made her yes may have been spoken word children but it would still been children and he made her and she had that longing within her as any mother why do you sisters why do you marry you you wait all of your life you struggl in life and you and then a Boy comes alone and then you just give him everything why it's the motherly Instinct that's within you and he convinced Eve that she was made for that right and the greatest sin was when she accepted him in her mind not the adulterous act on the ground with the Beast that is the attribute of unbelief the unbelief was when she doubted God keeping his word or when she thought about you know God does love me preacher one time he said to me been backslid for quite a while he said brother Dale I know I'm backslid he said but why do I still get messages just like I got them when I was serving the lord I said brother that's a gift the gift in you is drawing that and it will work he said even though I'm back lit I said yes sure will bm's a good example of it right his gift work but do you see what I'm trying to get you to say see do we really believe I got one more thought and then we'll quit well let's do 14 then we'll do 15 I'll scan 14 we get down to where proving his word and I said I'd give to you paragraph 234 where brother randam says now if you belong to a church that don't believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in every way that's the title on the computer of this message same in every way you get away from it but there's plenty of church she says and get up we believe in Hebrews 13:8 right well then that means then if you believe in Hebrews 138 that he's the same as he was in brother Brown's Ministry no I don't believe that now what I asked him man ofer Jeff he was talking about deity I said brother I'll go along with you on deity if you will agree with me on one point I said that brother right there he claims the baptism of the Holy Ghost laying aside all of brother brandom's gifts put him as an individual and stand him side by side I said brother Brandon got the Holy Ghost in him this man got the Holy Ghost in him I said I believe he's deity if you'll go that way with me he says oh no see he made brother brandham deity I'll agree with deity deity is a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but think of it one thing that we let's go to 15 and I'll quit let me hurry the uncertain sound John 14:12 he said and the works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than this shall you do more of them we know the story not greater than Jesus can do because look what he done it's more right CU he's around the world right the word there absolutely look in the Greek it says more shall you do because why he was God was just in one man now God is in his whole church you see God was in one man then all men who would believe him now more than this shall you do where I go to my father and I'll return back to the light that I was that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness I will turn back to that and then in a little while and I will come again see John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you do also and now he said and more than this I'll cut the rest of them cuz Church listen we'll accept that he heals when he wants to or in a away well now I'm not throwing no Stones go across the street the man believes in Divine Healing but how do they believe it talk to chiropractor the other day he's a great wonderful guy and we were talking about he was about all the family gathered for wedding and they got up front and prayed around the people I said we had a similar thing to happen the other day I said we had a little baby that was dedicated Sunday and I said the families on both sides about 18 of them stood at the front around that baby and we prayed and dedicated that baby he said that's good I said the baby was a baby we call it the baby that Faith produced some R there in the study look it down at it you'll see it the pictures of the baby that that Faith produced I said her husband's sperm count was flat zero I said sure the doctor's done all they could do but I said one day the Lord spoke to me and says they're going to have a baby you say well why didn't you walk out and tell it because that's sometimes you can't do that everybody wants to do that because it makes it look good here but he spoke to them and said they're going to have a baby just as well as one day we were downstairs and somebody looked over at me and they said brother so and so's looking for a wife and I said yep he is and then he's got one to come I believe it was my wife she turned around and said who I said turn around and look she said you mean I said y he told me who there going brother later said why didn't you tell me about that I said didn't that's not right he told me way was going to come back to the Lord I believed it he told me later that Wade would not only do that but he would be in the ministry standing beside of me I believe that you know it come to pass he told me that the child was going to be born brother forny didn't know it I didn't tell him brother forny was preaching right here he goes walking down that aisle stops right in there somewhere about where sister Freda is sitting and he looked at the two and he said God's going to give y'all a baby I went in the office with him I said did you say what I thought he said yeah I said well now I'll tell you he's done told me they going to have a child well then they come to find out all this was the problems you know that they couldn't have a baby all the sperm count was so low this do you think that bothered me it didn't bother brother fory me and him would life and talk about it well you know what they got a baby in the pictures in there say the baby that Faith produced that's the god I believe in I can stand all afternoon in witness to you of things you've seen and we've been through when are we going to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and not be a and say in a way I say to you brother Gary asked me one time didn't mean to say that he don't care he asked me he said do you think we have the faith of the father I said yes without Reserve didn't back up a stitch you asked me today do you believe the ministry of Jesus Christ in its fullness is in the bride of Christ around the world I glor in shout hallelujah right cuz 45 years ago I looked at it and saw it I just want to be a part and if I die and go to hell I don't care cuz I've done what God give me to bring to you to preach to you Jesus Christ that you can make your own Choice that's right and be what God give you what do you think about Hebrews 13:8 what do you think about it I think he's the same yesterday today and forever in every way remember what again except he's not here in his Corporal body well that's scripture because he's not to be here in the Corporal body we're to meet him in the air and go to the Millennium with him right right but evidently the prophet must have seen him that way you know I believe when we see him that way we're going to walk off this Earth that's right you know but what everybody's wanting to do is looking at a they're spending a lot of time now talking come ahead musician they're spending a lot of time now in the newspaper talking about the big bang Theory and they've actually proven by their scientific equipments etc etc that something happened the Big Bang well brother Brown said it's a Big Bang Theory it's all right but now everybody talking about the big bang all right but you know what somebody's going to talk about one of these days days and say I'm changed and you know what it's going to take place now am I correct that you must confess your healing before you are healed is that right you must confess your salvation before you're saved that's right well what's wrong with a group of people beginning to say I'm redeemed give us that one brother dick okay I'm redeemed why can't we say that and say that we're changed yes but wait a minute we we're not changed that's the way we do to show you the MU now here's the MU here's the big mu well we're changed he's trying to get airon to come on up we we we get that Big Bang Theory we get these big things when are we going to say it's here now that's right now can I say this in one word while everybody's good and wide awake you see because I've always believed the change of these bodies the Rapture has been in process yes and I've always taught you that for 45 years the Rapture has been in process from the day you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that day your soul was redeemed and brother randam said future home he laid claim on your body y the day you was born again started the Rapture that's right that's why ever born again believer is going to be in the Rapture oh come on you got the quote you say brother said everybody got the Holy Ghost don't go that's right he said you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life die and go to hell too so go ahead and argue quotes but you see when are we going to save I and my father are one and the prophet said when you do the Shooks going to pull away well I think we said it long enough but I think what we need to do is start believing it and putting our whole life on it well I believe I'm redeemed I hope I'm redeemed maybe I'm redeemed so many days maybe somebody will come across the land and preach a great message and and I'll grab it that's why you see all these young preachers coming along right they get up boy they got that move we did we're going to do we're going to do and everybody Glory Hallelujah this is it and they run after him for about 2 or three years and then they find out it didn't happen that's right well you ain't never heard me go off on them I ain't going to talk off on them cuz you know what I believe that we're already redeemed I believe we was redeemed before the world that's why they told me when I first come in the message you know first Doctrine to come in the message you know what it was that you couldn't be born again after 63 Redemption was over in 63 I said according to my Bible it's over before the world ever begun and I said you know why that I don't believe you're a garbage can because God saved this man I have a personal witness we know what Peter said Hallelujah he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy he had within him an experience of Jesus Christ do you have that amen prise are we arguing and fussing over it you know go ahead brother let's sing let's stand together I'm redeemed sing it sorrow I have been I have redeemed I'm redeemed you believe it Glory Glory Christ is mine unto I now I have been
