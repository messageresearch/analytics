here y'all just say a real loud amen and if that don't work start throwing something amen if i see you dozing off i'll start throwing something too how about that amen i'll throw a rock of revelation how about that we'll stone each other here this afternoon amen let's get go ahead and get started here amen i'm gonna go back to the book of daniel here this afternoon and while i'm turning there i just want to say thank you again to brother dale amen for for giving us this opportunity it's been a wonderful day brother dale i really appreciate you appreciate your hospitality and everything amen and uh you got a wonderful group here amen there's a lot of good saints here amen we love you guys amen uh also i don't know if brother wade is listening in i think mr tune said he did amen just tell

can fit all y'all in our little place but you're all welcome to come by and we'll just have a good time at home amen we certainly will um also on a on another note i heard you praying also you're praying for brother ed binkley from brother siler's church if i'm not mistaken he he actually passed away he passed on to his reward on thursday or friday i forget what it was amen he was burned over 83 of his body they had tried to find skin to do skin grafts but he was just burnt so bad i think the only place they could find skin that wasn't burnt was under his belt and maybe in the bottoms of his shoes and his feet he was severely burned and can't be sad for him when you think about it that's rough but but you still think about it man where he's at now rejoicing in a new body no pain no hurting amen but certainly want to be praying for his family that's for sure amen sister daughter reached out to me and said they were they were hurting really bad the family was really hurt and bad so amen god's able god certainly able amen all right let's just bow our heads one more time before we get started here this this afternoon dear heavenly father again lord we thank you for lord jesus just this his chance one more time lord to get together we say once more dear god and there's coming a time lord we know that there'll be a time soon lord jesus when we won't be able to do this lord when the last church service will have been done lord the last song will be sung here lord god we know that time is soon coming lord jesus we just want to look faithfully forward dear god to that time lord because we know what's in store for us we know the joy this waiting just be on the way the lord we just pray help us lord to be faithful here this afternoon and going forward lord jesus take these words lord that you've given us these words of life lord and dear god just let them live inside of us give us a faith dear god that will surpass anything lord this world has here below the lord bless us now we ask in jesus name amen amen daniel chapter 10 again same as this morning but i'm going to read i'm just gonna read one verse verse one later on we we may make it i don't know i won't promise but we may make it a little bit further down but i'm gonna just read verse one for right now and the scripture says of course in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel and i'm going to stop right there god bless you you may be seated amen all righty i'm actually just trying to get myself back to where i i left off this morning i think i was talking about jesus cursing the the fig tree and uh no men eat from the from henceforth forever i mean done that tree is done for right it's gone and uh and then i hit on the on our theophanies and thought of our theophanies and it was done as far as i was going up here amen i was completely out there's no way to get back to the thought and the notes here so it happens that way sometimes amen it certainly does and there's nothing wrong with that but uh brother branham said if the bullet ever gets off target you've got the only way you can fix it if you bring it back and start all over again don't worry i'm not going back all the way to the beginning and try to preach that over again amen but i do i'm going to try to get back with where we're at and and go from there so we were we were talking about faith of course only belief right only belief believe the thing that that was revealed to you that's what we had come to there don't doubt don't doubt it you know sometimes you don't see as we were talking about with jesus sometimes you don't see the results perhaps but if it's a true revelation it's going to bring forth amen god will bring it from the roots up he'll build it right he'll put a foundation in amen and that's that's just settled it's established it's going to be and we say praise the lord for that don't doubt it don't say that again don't doubt it right don't doubt the word of faith because that's what it is it's a word of faith that's god to give you and you've got once you once you have that once god has given you that spot for whatever it is here whether you're you're young and it's a word of salvation or something you're looking for maybe something a calling that god's put in your life or you know there's any myriad of things that it can be that how god reveals himself to you but once that that that personal faith is settled down there don't doubt it don't doubt it hold on to it and listen if you got a doubt sometimes he's like i just can't help it i can't help doubting you some some people are like that some folks are like that well if you're going to doubt if you got a doubt if you just got to doubt well then doubt your doubts and his sister years ago she would always say my brother what if and brother what if she was worried to death she was always worried and upset and everything never settled brother what if what if and i said but what if not i mean my what if not is just as is liable to happen is your what if you know you don't know to doubt your doubts if you have to doubt and that devil's going to bring that stuff there but just doubt your doubt on the thing faith has a much better track record than doubts do faith works 100 of the time right amen faith works every time that it's used so amen and doubt fails every time that it's used amen so if you got it out just doubt the right thing doubt your doubts have faith in your faith have faith in your faith i like that amen so praise the lord through faith genuine faith there must be revelation straight from god that so anyways so this is the thing we were talking about daniel and i'm trying my best to get to daniel here but this is the the thing that was revealed to daniel it was a a revelation and you go back and you begin looking and i like looking at words sometimes and and this word thing here uh we think what thing was revealed unto daniel i just love the way that was phrased there it sounds like something somebody from plainville would say uh that thing that was revealed that word thing there actually i love it it's it's not like we would think a thing would be well you know this pencil could be a thing um this this this mic here could be a thing uh my my bible physically speaking could be a thing it's an object it's a noun but actually in the hebrew words when we go back and we look at this word it's not a noun and it's not it's not an object it's not even an object when you go back and you begin looking at this word here this word thing here it it means actually speech and words and and even more speaking so it's an active and more than a it's not a it's not a noun it's actually a verb it's it's the action or the speaking the speech that is spoken the words that are spoken in message terms you know in modern day message terms we would call this thing the spoken word praise the lord a thing was revealed unto daniel here it was a spoken word that was revealed to daniel here amen right remember faith we're talking about faith now without faith that is imp impossible to please god without this thing it is impossible to please god what pleases god his word pleases god amen that's why he said it that way without faith without a true revelation it is impossible to please him amen but with faith all things are possible all things are possible amen praise the lord so so here only believe again you say lord i believe i believe i feel i might feel terrible but lord i believe right i might have all kind of circumstances around me but lord i believe i believe there's a thing that has been revealed to me and that thing that was revealed to daniel is this spoken word and the spoken word is the original seed right it's what god saw in the very beginning what he had in his mind he began to speak that in that word it was a living word it was speech god put it to speech and and we know that in the beginning god dwelt along with his thoughts there and those thoughts of course were eternal thoughts because god is eternal right brother branham said they were perfect thoughts they were not they were not thoughts that had to be fleshed out or worked or changed or taken back or anything but they were perfect right from the start they were eternal thoughts that blows my mind i have thoughts and my thoughts begin somewhere and then they kind of get lost along the way but god's thoughts are eternal they have no beginning and no ending i took a journal one time and said because my thoughts get so disjointed and i have a hard time reining them in and that's i'm going to try to journal i'm going to try to put it down in a book and and where i can kind of keep order you know try to order my thoughts i made it one page that was it i said there's no way i put it down six months later i pick it back up let's try this again forget it it don't work my thoughts are just they just don't line up like that but god's thoughts are not such as that god's thoughts were perfect from the very beginning but you know what they lacked he said how can god's thoughts lack anything they lack express expression right so you could have all the thoughts in the world i can think a lot of things but what does it do right the brothers we were talking about gps and we're talking about the gps system out there you know after after church this morning and there's a survey or we we utilize all sorts of things the satellites and such as that but uh there was a time like i got out of surveying for a while about 2003 and there was your gps was starting to come out but uh but we did a lot of we did a lot of uh subdivision work and road work and we'd have to go in and we'd you know the surveyors had to put the you know 100 stakes on your back and a hammer and you'd go trodden out through there you know it's plodding through the hot sun you'd be pounding these steaks in to lay out a center line and lay out the lines for the lots and all these things and and i and i i got out of it for a while and as i was out me and my wife were going down the road one day and we and going down the interstate and i see this this this truck this transfer go by and it it was a a caterpillar you know like heavy equipment caterpillar company truck going by and had a big picture of a bulldozer on it and it goes by and i just had this this duh you know you know those thoughts that you get sometimes it's just like man that's it you know and and it was a thought of putting i said if i could take a gps and i could put it on that bulldozer that gps would know where it's at and it would be able you know that gps would be able to tell that dozer and the blade where it's at the the elevation needs to be and it'd be able to go through there and be putting a lot of the surveyors out of work but man i could make a million bucks on this thing and immediately i got on my phone while we were going got on my cell phone i got on my phone and i called my buddy who was still in the surveying who i'm partners with now and i called him i said buddy i got a million dollar idea and he said what and i said i told him what i was thinking he's a dutch you're about two years too late and i said what he said yeah they've already done it they've done it and you're right it works just that way and i was like oh man that's just the way things work with me i'm always a little slow on that so i have these thoughts but unless you can take that thought and you can you can express it you can put it out there then it's just a thought it really doesn't do anything right so you see what god's trying to do with you right you see why he said without faith it's impossible without this spoken word without this revelation it's impossible to please god because his whole purpose is to express these thoughts that he had in his mind i mean you were such an intricate part of the word of god you don't even realize that we think of a lot of times just a nominal type of way of thinking that god so loved the world before for god to love the world that he sent his only begotten son that that whosoever will and you know all these and when we have this and it's almost like god's reaching down and and taking pity on some lost puppy dog and he's he's trying to he's he saved you somehow and he picks you up and he he you're a rescue dog or a rescue mutt or whatever and god loves you and that's fine and he might take you in his house and you can be like a lap dog to him or something and that would all be wonderful you know like that but don't you realize you are so much more than that you are a son of god you are a daughter of god you are a part of the word that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and he has done everything even so much as going and dying on the cross so that you could come back to him that's awesome that's awesome and that's the thing that he's trying to get across right from genesis to revelation that is the theme of the whole bible it speaks redemption all the way through cycle after cycle after cycle god just knocking at your heart and saying see what i'm trying to do see that how much i love you see how much i want you see how much i desire to to to bring you back to that place of fellowship look at who you are church so god spoke words or thoughts thoughts but then god spoke and the thoughts began to exp to be expressed praise the lord now of course how do you express thoughts you put them into words and the words the words are the origin there so so in this case the the eternal thought of god that was expressed was in the beginning the very beginning we call it what the logos all right and and the logos which is the spoken word of god which is jesus christ which is michael which is the pillar of fire you can look at all these things here but this thing that that was revealed to daniel this spoken word that was to be manifested it was manifesting redemption cycle this very thing that was in the in the mind of god from the beginning and the spoken word was manifest to to create things that god had in his great mind before there was anything in creation these these eternal things these these godly things and he spoke and it was it just was glory hallelujah it just was it was it came into existence and and it wasn't hindered now we know that when god spoke he the bible says that he had to believe his own words right brother branham said he said god when god spoke he literally he had to have faith again it's impossible to please god without faith he had to have faith in his own words so even to god god had a revelation he had a revelation on his own words that's awesome praise the lord that he had actually had to have faith in his own words and he he believed his words and it wasn't hindered his faith wasn't hindered he had no doubt when god spoke let there be light he had no doubt that it was going to be light right there's no doubt in god it wasn't hindered ever how long it took it to come into coming to come to pass it wasn't hindered brother branham made this statement one time he talked about things you know things that we look and he said well science and and and faith don't really line up a lot of times and they were talking about dinosaurs and they were talking about this and that and everything else and they said the timeline don't work and brother branham said listen he said god said you know in the beginning right he began to speak it was there and he said but and then the world was without forming and and void he said but a lot of things happened between that time that's period but there's a lot of things that space could happen between that time but you know one thing that didn't happen in between that that period between when god said and there was form there was chaos ruled forgive me my words are going completely out of my mind the chaos ruled and all these things and and and then he comes down and god began to create he said there's that space of time there but one thing that did not exist in that time was doubt that time regardless of how much chaos was there regardless of how much was there one time brother brown would talk about a pre-adamic state he talked about the dinosaurs that might have been something that we just don't need to know about it was before this and that and everything else he says that but all that chaos and everything was there it did nothing to hinder the faith of god saints you got a lot of chaos in your life did i hit that right i do i do amen i've already got today i already got people calling i'm not gonna be able to be there tomorrow we can't do this then and this one's coming in there and then i'm like just forget it this is sunday i am not thinking about that this is a day for faith right not for scrambling trying to get things done but you look at all the things that we have going on in our life all the things are there one thing that we have to realize is that above all through all overall we have faith right and that faith is unhindered that faith is unhindered it just is because god spoke that's what it is this is the thing that's being revealed god spoke he spoke speech words speaking he spoke this thing so now so here's a principle it's a very simple principle this is not something you don't know here but here's a principle a scriptural principle that that god has to speak there's a thought but before that thought can really take place in your life he has to speak it to you you can take the word these are the thoughts of god right this is the word of god we say this is the word of god but you know we can look down here and we can see this these words but as long as these words are just right here in our head no matter how true that is it's not really reality to us yet it's not really real yet right it's not a revelation it's just something we've read here but these are the thoughts of god you don't know what god thinks about you read your bible i look at a man tell me one time he said we we can't know us this little finite creatures we cannot know the mind of god i said yes we can he said no we can't know the mind of god we're too little we're to this we're too sinful we're all these things i said we can know and we better know the mind of god in our lives and the way that we know it this is what he thinks this is the word of god from cover to cover this is the word of god this is the revelation the complete revelation of jesus christ who is god right this is it right here you want to know what god's thinking this is it but before this can be i'm forgive me if i sound like i'm repeating myself i'm just trying to nail the beat the nailed home i guess but but before you if you want to have the thoughts right here before these thoughts can be expressed god's got to speak it somewhere he's got to speak it to you so before it can be god has to speak and we read in the book of daniel and god spoke to daniel and then he said there the thing was revealed to him now hebrew word for the word thing there is dhaba and it quite literally means again speech word speaking saying utterance so you can see this is this is not just an inanimate kind of thing if you want just a pew sitting church going experience that's not what this message is supposed to be that is not what this thing is this is supposed to be quite literally it is a it's utterance it's not inanimate it's an action thing right that's why i like seeing your head amen that's why you're a preacher like seeing a man and the head's nodding and people engaging and everything else because listen it's not just the preacher the preacher is just he just gets up here and and whatever he wants to be the lord take him and use him whichever but you know you're the one that's actually participating it's not you're not to be inanimate objects sitting there no matter how tired you are or whatever you're not supposed to just be sitting there and be an inanimate object we're supposed to be we're supposed to be a a relationship back and forth with god something that's living a living love that's there dabba it quite literally again it means speech word speaking utterance it's not something that is described as a noun but it's living it is action it's that which has living breath behind it oh my and this word dabba actually originates from a word it comes from the root word dobber same thing but has an r on the end of it which means in my my playable language is butchered that i know but it means not just to speak now now we're not just speaking we're not just babblers but it literally it means to declare and it's not like a declaration that's being made but it's not declare it's the action of declaring right so so this speaker god is literally when he when he begins to speak these words when these words these thoughts are put into words he's actually declaring right then he's making a declaration it's so by my stripes you are healed right you know i i he he bled he died for you you you are saved you are a part of god you're a part of me i know the thoughts that i had of you right good thoughts thoughts to bring you to a perfect end praise the lord he has these thoughts it's to declare and to converse as in a relationship again a conversation converse but to command and also to promise and then there's connotations of to warn threaten but then to sing i don't know why they didn't put sing over with the other part there while they put it after the threat and the warn but but then also to sing amen but regardless this is not just these are not just idle words being spoken this this thing that's revealed to daniel these are not just idle words that are spoken by some babbler or or or some meaningless words they're they're breathed out by a madman have you ever been around people and sometimes i have that problem but have you ever heard the term word salad you've never heard the word the term word salad my wife has because i use it sometimes word salad is when when when when sometimes people get to talking and they're just filling the space the quiet they don't know how to appreciate the quiet and they'll start talking but the words it's really nothing it's just words it's just meaningless it's just babel and you're sitting there in your head the guy that's listening and sitting here saying what is he saying what does this mean and then you realize it don't mean nothing it literally don't mean nothing he's just he's just filling the space praise the lord that's not our god when god says something i knew one time i can't remember now but i knew one time how many words are in the king james bible 16 11 version bible how many actual words are in there it's a lot and there's not one of them that is meaningless it's even more than that you can read between the lines and not a bit of that is meaningless it has a purpose to it right praise the lord praise the lord saints amen they have these words they they have meaning and they have purpose and they also they have direction god knows his thoughts because he's bringing and then he's bringing you to that promised end that that perfect end there right he's bringing you someplace so these words they have they have purpose and they also have a direction to them it's the words of god it's amazing here god don't again you know people the different denominations the different the nominal christians they'll take a promise here this is my favorite bible quote and that's fine and we all got that right but this is my favorite part and and all this over here is this and this and there's no connection between them really it's just it's just something that you pick out randomly through there but god's really not do that all these the words tied together brother branham said you can take any part of the scripture and it can tie the rest of the bible together and he says and you can look through here and you can find jesus christ in every verse of this bible he said if you don't see him in every verse go back and read it again because you missed something well that something that people miss is they miss the purpose and the direction of god they miss the perf the purpose of god god has a purpose his purpose is to bring you back to himself and and to bring you into that perfect image that he saw before the foundation of the world and there's a direction to that praise the lord there's a direction to that what did he say the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord you know what happens when you order footsteps you go somewhere right you're not stumbling around and everything else you look like this and you know you take a drunk man and he's stumbling around and everything else and you look at his feet footprints and your brother brandon talked about the young boy that was trying to follow in the footsteps of his dad and his dad through the snow and he's going out there and his dad looks back and his son's trying to you know do this and everything else it's because the dad was drunk and he was leaving drunken footsteps through the snow and he said he got convicted over that oh look my son's trying to follow me and what am i what example am i leaving him right but the order of god is he he carries you somewhere it's got a direction he's got a purpose to it and we can look at his footsteps through the bible and we can walk in those footsteps amen and we bring forth an image the image that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world praise the lord your footsteps are ordered of the lord they are manifested words that are spoken words of god and they are alive with the predestinated purpose of god aren't you glad god has a purpose for you and god has a purpose for every bit of revelation he has poured in your life right just have faith saints have faith so this thing this thing that daniel's talking about i believe it's still being revealed today i believe it's still going forth today it's an eternal word this thing that was in god's mind and in his heart and then was expressed in words and then these words that are very purposeful and they have a a definite direction to them and these these thoughts and then they're made words and then they're made real in creation and there's a pattern here that god follows through scripture we can begin to see a pattern there's a pattern here in the message who is this melchizedek brother branham lays out i didn't give the brothers that quote and i'm not going to read i'll just paraphrase it here but in the in the in the message who is this melchizedek brother branham lays out how god manifests himself again he said you know a threefold manner he's a thought word flesh i know you're very familiar with that this is nothing new to you i know but but so so god has has his thoughts he has these thoughts and then those thoughts are expressed in word form and then god believes his own word which he was and the word becomes flesh and blood creation now the principle here for our lives and i'm not just talking in theological terms in message we have our own theological terms we do and we can talk amongst ourselves and somebody on the outside of the message or whatever they look at you like what are you talking about you know i believe a message will say what message they have no clue what we're talking about right we've got our own terms and everything else with this and but but there's message theology but that's not what i'm doing here i'm talking about this thing that's in our lives today you see faith has no hindrances and this thing called faith in our lives it must be unhindered and the scriptural principle here is that before any thought of god can come to fruition in your life first god must speak if you want it unhindered god must speak that need that thing you've prayed for that thing you've longed for that whatever it might be that purpose you say well lord i see this in your word and you pray and you cry out to god i can see it there it's a thought of god but then you begin to cry out and and god begins to speak once he speaks to your heart once he speaks that word thought word right the thought word once that comes and it hits that heart there now we are at the thing now we're at the unhindered part now we're now we've that word has become anchored down in your soul and it just is it just is there's no other way to put it it just is that word is there i don't care what you say it just is faith has no hindrances all things are possible to me this brings a little bit of a different maybe a deeper understanding of only believe just only believe all things are possible to them that believe we take that scripture i'm sitting here there's a phone book they only believe some book here right and we say only believe and we think okay i need this and i go and i believe it lord i believe it i believe it i believe it i believe it i believe you you i believe it do you believe it i believe it but still until god speaks it you really are not believing yet right i'm really not believing it's just practical to all i'm doing here this afternoon so what do you do before it gets to that spot you cry out and you knock lord let this be a revelation in my heart too many times we pray and miss brother branham says we'll pray lord i i need healing i need healing to god i need my i need a touch i feel terrible i've got this i've got that and brother brandon that's the question and this is the strangest question for me for a long time he said why do you want to be healed well gee golly brother brother dale i want to be better i want to feel better right i i i want my back to stop hurting i want my i want my strength back in my legs i i want i want all i want i want to feel better i want to be back like i was before brother branham said that don't do it but lord you're a healer but you've got to believe well i believe you're a healer but now how do you believe has it been spoken to you yet right and brother branham said why do you want your healing is it just so that i'm again i'm paraphrasing here but is it just because you do you want to feel better or is it to manifest the word of god is it for his glory is it for his glory so you see where faith you see where i'm driving at it's very simple but you see what real faith gets down to real faith gets down to the purpose and the meaning and the direction of the word of god it comes to a place to where really everything that i'm doing i'm sick and i want to be better but i want to be better for the glory of god i want that word to be manifest but what if lord's wanting to manifest endurance and your steadfastness or endurance or something like that in your body abraham had to wait 25 years god could have given it just like that he was waiting on a body change why in the world did he have to wait 25 years on a body change and you think that's something job had to wait 3 500 years more or less he said i know that in you that my redeemer liveth in the last days he shall stand and i shall see him with my eyes not another one but with my eyes i'll see him and he was talking about the resurrection and then job got old and died and went to the grave his flesh rotted and his bones actually turned back to dust he was nothing but dust laying in a tomb but that word of god that he had confessed that he believed it was a revelation to him it was a seed laying there in that tomb and when jesus came back again job raised up and he could say i see him i see him there he is he saw him with his own eyes why because that word of god was a seed it was that thing that was revealed to him it was that word that was revealed to him oh saints praise the lord for the hour that you're living in that there has been a thing revealed to this last day the thing of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the revelation of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever not just in the church ages not just in the nominal beliefs not in just all these things but in a real true presence and person of of god himself the word being manifested in lives in your lives you say oh if i could only have lived in the days of brother branham listen you're living in the days of the bride brother branham only spoke about your days you're living in the days that brother branham wanted to see he said i'm only laying the groundworks i'm only laying the groundwork here he said but there'll be another one come i'm sorry i'd if i don't i hope i'm not stepping on any toes here but i don't think there's an eighth one to come i'm not looking for another prophet to come they're prophets and gifts of prophecies and things like that but there's only one word prophet for this generation amen and he's come and he was speaking of you little bride he was speaking of your day he was speaking of the word of god that was being manifested in your life and here we are in a message church sitting under a message pastor that teaches a a a revealed word a message for this last day prophet long to see this day and people say oh for the days of a prophet i say oh for the days of the bride amen [Applause] so daniel daniel here we read daniel shows us this this very scriptural principle this principle that the prophet of god emphasized over and over throughout the message there again thoughts words flesh brother branham refers also to paul paul speaking to the romans here paul said in romans chapter 10 verse 17 he says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god and he he hid it you know brother branham hits it in this the quote we read this morning talking about the young mother and and the young mother there and said and she heard she heard that jesus healed epilepsy now faith cometh by hearing so she she'd heard words had to be spoken for her to be to have been able to hear these things she heard that but but now brother branham if you remember again he said that she so she tried to she wanted to get to jesus because she wanted to hear those words basically for herself she wanted it was one thing she'd heard she'd heard through testimony that god had healed epilepsy before perhaps it was the man that met him on the on the way down from when they came back from the mount transfiguration i don't know the timeline there but maybe it was the man that that had the son and brought his son to the disciples coming down from from from mount transfiguration and and while while jesus and james and john peter are up on the top of the mount here comes you know the man brings his son there and he's got epilepsy and the disciples are trying to cast them out but they could not right and then jesus comes down there and just gives us oh you have little faith right and he gives he gives the word there and he asks the man he said lord he said do you believe the man said i believe lord help mine unbelief that's an honest man right there help mine unbelief and jesus cast the devil out epilepsy maybe this woman maybe she'd heard that i don't know but she heard that jesus had healed epilepsy so what did she do she said oh i got to get to this man myself i got to go see jesus that's a good thing ain't it i need to go see jesus that's the problem today is that people don't want to go see jesus hello it's the truth they want to they want to read you can read your bible you do all kinds of things but do you sit down there and sign cry for the abominations it's done in the city in here lord help me help me so she goes she's heard that he heals epilepsy so she goes because she's looking for a a personal she's looking for a personal revelation now she wants to go hear him say that her daughter that her daughter has been healed now you see the word she she she saw the thoughts of god god's able to do it but now she's got to hear the word of god i had a neighbor that was dying of brain cancer he's a good man he was a good man baptist good baptist man but he was a good man and he's dying of brain cancer and and i was trying to to go up and i'd help him every day they he wanted to be outside so we'd have to he couldn't walk or anything we'd put a a wench in there and we'd winch him up and we'd sling him over and sit him down in a wheelchair we'd roll him outside he had a lazy boy chair set up on his garage where he could see outside and be on the outside there and we'd winch him up and we'd swing him over and sit him in his chair and he'd stay there all day long afternoon late afternoon towards evening you know he'd be tired just just tired and we'd go up there and we'd winch him back up put him in the chair and carry him back down back into his bedroom and we'd lay him back down winch him back up put him in his bed and i told him i said don jesus is a healer god can heal you you know what his words were and i had my own parents tell me the same thing they both died with cancer they both told me the same thing pretty much god can heal you and they all said i know that god can heal me if there's that bit of doubt in it if he wants to i told him he wants to he wants to heal you right he wants to bless you he wants to show his glory in you that's his desire today that's his desire to show his lord the manifest glory in you that's what he's longing to do he said if he wants to he can do it but you know i i don't know and then he made this statement dawn made the statement he said and i'm okay you see even fighting brain cancer he was in he really didn't have an understanding of his need and perhaps it was just it was his time to go and god was just carrying him out you know sometimes it is time to go but i just thought this church age has robbed the people of their true potential it's robbed them of faith they don't know how to have faith they don't know what faith is they don't know how to to look for the thing they're not seeking the thing they're seeking they can read the thoughts they can put things together and everything else but they don't know the thing the the thing of faith that revelation has not really been revealed to them that you may they may have the thoughts but it's not even made it down to word yet the principle is thought word god has to speak it to your heart it has to become real words have to be spoken and what were those words to that lady when jesus spoke they were the expression of the thoughts that god had for her circumstance for her daughter's condition did it die it just died it died i served too long it's all right why i don't wear one of those things at home we got we got two more batteries no we ain't doing that i don't know ain't that long thank you brother i saw that look i knew something was up as soon as i saw brother aaron get up and the sister turned around i'm like oh something happened i did it now oh i really did it now i just throw the cliff off of it okay i'm sticking in my pocket now you okay we can quit if y'all just want to give in to the devil [Laughter] all right that thing that was spoke in all seriousness i am so thankful for the thing that god's spoken this day amen amen [Applause] can you imagine what that must have been to that mother when that when that real word not just the thoughts but when that real word hit that your daughter can be made whole or is made whole you can have what you ask for i mean that that thing could you imagine such a thing such a thing when all the medical community said no there's no cure for epilepsy yet the seed of god planted in that little lady's heart it said yes thoughts made living words declarations promises commandments even this thing god reveals to his own those ones who are to bring forth his his word and continue down that path that thing that was revealed to daniel was god's word for his hour and his need and also for the ages to come god knew god knows god knew that we would need to look back and and hear that word spoke through daniel to believe in our day he he knew what we'd have to have the thing revealed to that little mother was the the thing that in god's mind for her need in her hour now what about our hour what about our need i need a new body i'll just be honest with you i need a new body i need to meet jesus in the air that's my need right that's my promise for today that's a promise for the day you rise we're sitting here brother branham said the generation that sees the fig tree put forth this bud it shall not pass until all things be fulfilled my goodness we're a long ways worth 74 years or something like that since or passed now but that generation is still going amen that generation is still going we must have faith this undefeatable type of faith this unhindered type of faith faith that is unconscious easy faith that is doesn't have without anyone or anything making it difficult to do something or for something to happen it's not difficult it's not slowed down it's not blocked or interfered with without that spoken word delivered straight to your heart there can be none of that though because this is hindered the word can be read the word can be sympathized with the word can be understood with the with the intellect and all these things but without the word being spoken to your heart there can be no true faith oh thank god for faith thank god for a faith that anchored down in your heart and told you that you were a child of god right thank god for a faith that spoke down your heart and said man this message is true and i've got a new body waiting on me praise the lord you realize that the the the nominal churches out there they're not looking for for a new body so much now they they're many that believe in the rapture and all the different things like that but but you know they're just looking for a grave somewhere and if it be i was talking to a man once a a we were doing a job for a man and he was a member of some some new church there in our areas a big church had drawn a big crowd and everything else and and they were kind of charismatic and and we were to be honest with you i was having a good time with the dude yeah we were sitting out there talking we were talking about jesus we were talking about the blessings we were talking about his presence and singing and this we were having a good time and i was getting paid for it and and it was i mean well i was having a good time out there with this guy and then we kept on and on i finally i said and man and jesus is coming soon i can't wait for that new body that rapture is in here and he literally stopped in his place and looked at me and he said i could care less if jesus comes today or within 10 000 years from now and he wasn't saying that in a good way and i said what he said i'm just having a good time down here and everything else he said i don't really think that he's coming like right now right and i thought huh that's kind of enlightening and i guarantee you it's because there were things of this world he was enjoying more than really even the blessings of god right i could care less if it comes just leave me alone for a while because you see the thing had not been revealed to him but man you can get happy about a body change you'd be crazy not to right you young kids you might not be able to be you know as excited as those old folks are yet but let me tell you it's coming right it's coming time lasts you you understand one of these days amen come quickly lord jesus i hope it does not get to that point i'm ready to go home amen praise the lord but you see what i mean it's a it's a very scriptural thing here the scripture says also that talking about a breathing word a living word that the scripture says that that god breathed into adam the breath of life and he became a living soul i guess that's as in as compared to a dead soul but he became a living soul so so without that word that that word was spoke it was literally it was breathed into adam if you go back and you look in and that word breath there that breath of life was put into adam that word life i should say is the same word that is used for the tree of life it was the same thing god breathed that's he he put that same life that was literally in the tree of life it was in adam it was an ad it's the same life it wasn't a different life it was the same life and in fact adam brother branham said that adam was literally he was god on earth right he was a little messiah he was little m god or little sorry little g god he was a little in messiah he had control he could speak in in the natural world would obey him and all these things because he had that life on the inside of him god breathed that inside of him oh when god breathes his word inside of a believer it has to it has to bring things into subjection to it because it's not that believer it's god that's doing it through you adam or god sorry god breathed into adam god in jesus breathed upon his disciples he said receive ye the holy ghost what is the holy ghost it's the breath of god it's the spirit of god it's the life of god it's the force of god it's the quickening power upon the word hallelujah he breathed upon his disciples ye the holy ghost what does he do to you when you what is it he does to you when you read this word of god when you recognize that neither something comes up and there's just something begins to move and you say that's it amen i believe that there's just something moving there you know what he's doing god's breathing upon you brother brandon made the statement he said we we we have a baptism in the holy ghost he said it's baptism upon baptism upon baptism upon baptism right it's not a one-time deal he said praise the lord what is that that's god breathing upon this word he's breathing upon that thought he's breathing and breathing and breathing he's breathing life into his word to bring it to pass in your life oh i'm so thankful to be a son of god so you see what i mean god speaks in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel his name was called built a stager and the thing was true but the time was of sorry the time appointed was long it was going to be a long way out there but still he understood the thing and he had an understanding of the vision there and he said in those days i daniel was morning three four weeks i ain't no pleasant bread nor neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled this man had a need he was doing some serious crying wasn't he and here's the part that again i think i believe brother branham was talking about in the quote we read this morning to people has a lot of hindrances he was mourning three whole weeks he was he was fighting it for three whole weeks in his flesh you think well that looks like a hindrance don't it yes flesh-wise but the promise of god had to be the promise of god had to be the angel when he came to him the angel gabriel said he said i was i was i was hindered or i was was delayed by the prince of persia right who was the prince of persia at this time the babylon had already had already gone to the persians so persia the medo-persians were in or in power now so the prince of persia is the spirit the prince of the power of the air that was over that land brother branham said every nation has a spirit to it our nation has a spirit to it right it's not necessarily a good thing right so here the prince of persia daniel had been in babylon and into into persia now for 68 years he'd been living here under this spirit for all this time and the prince of persia was was was hindering him but it wasn't hindering faith well praise the lord how are you buddy god bless you brother wade see he lives praise the lord amen [Applause] from the prince of persia you shouldn't have put that new battery in there that prince of persia that prince of persia was withstanding him that prince of the power of the air he had to get through the atmosphere to get to a place to where he could get to that faith you see faith has no hindrances but but this thing out here has hindrances but when daniel could break through after three weeks of mourning of crying of fasting and and all these things after three weeks he was able to break through and get to that place of true faith and when true faith was when he when he hit that spot that spot of faith i love to say it like that that spot of faith when he gets down there to that place there then the angel shows up the angel gabriel he says oh god heard you from the very first time you set your heart to pray when you just turned your heart to god he heard you the very first time well what was he waiting for you had to come to the spot you had to come to the spot don't give up don't give in don't stop don't just say a prayer and lay your head upon your pillow don't just say a prayer and say oh well but you push until you get to that spot you say wait a minute i thought faith was was was unconscious it is when you get to that spot you see if i've been going fast enough i'd get all this this morning but it been but it is when you get to that spot it's unconscious when you get to that spot because that's the word of god that's been spoken now it's it's got to come to pass you say oh if i could just have faith you do got you do have faith you've just got to come to that place of faith brother brahms the people has lots of hindrances minds have lots of hindrances oh man how we know that it's a mind battle in it it's the greatest battle that's ever been fought i think that's a very this is a very common ailment to humanity here brother branham said people that means humanity all of it people have lots of hindrances here and those hindrances they they originate right here in our minds you can be ever so mean to me but your your meanness or rottenness or whatever it's really not what hinders me it's my attitude here towards you if i can love you even while you hate me amen it does not bother me one bit i say so many times people hold grudges and everything else they don't forgive they don't know the power forgiveness and all these things and it causes so many problems and and somebody could do you wrong and go on it your your grudge is not hurting them a bit it's not changed them a bit it's not doing anything to them all it's doing is holding you back right holding me back that's all it is we fight in our minds we wrestle on our minds we try to get past these flesh and blood bodies and all these things and what are we doing we're trying to reach that spot where true faith resides but the enemy does not want you to reach out and get a hold or find that spot because he knows the true faith knows no defeat it is truly unhindered no obstacle can stop it it can't even slow it down he's well man abraham abraham had 25 years yeah but i tell you what when isaac came he came right on time he came right on time praise the lord it's always in god's appointed time god's never late he's never late they sent for jesus and said your friend lazarus lazarus is sick right so jesus what does he do he turns and goes two days further away because you see it wasn't time yet in god's timing it wasn't time yet and when they finally get there he said your friend lazarus you know he died he's sleeping he said he tells the disciples they think he means well he's just sleeping if he sleeps he's doing well right and jesus says no he's dead i love that he just nap he's he's dead you need to get that through your mind he's dead and they're like he said but for your sakes not for his but for your sakes i'm glad now let's go awaken oh my they want no fight they want no struggle there wasn't no they're just sitting there trying to fight no no jesus knew exactly what he's doing why because he was the son of god he knew exactly he was in that spot he was never out of that spot but when you can reach that spot too you can be just as sure of your faith being moving god as jesus did all the things that he did god's word cannot lie jesus does not show up late he's always right on time and the instant you touch the hem of the garment of jesus at that point of contact that spark of faith is there that moment you find that spot of faith satan is defeated satan is defeated this afternoon you can say it's over hallelujah it's over the battle's over the fight is over the struggle is over how many believe the war has already won hallelujah praise the lord the war has already won i was going to say but the battle's still going but the battles the battles in this right here it's not in that spot of faith and in that spot of faith he is defeated it is over and how encouraging that should be to all of us and make us strive that much harder to reach that spot hallelujah i'm cutting just as much out of this as i can guess you drop down this quote here i want a couple quotes i want to get to here brother branham said looking at the unseen i'm going to close right here in a minute he said oh this is looking at the unseen 1958 he said oh if the church of this day could ever pray until they till they pass the sin barrier and the unbelief barrier they can shout the victory of a living god when they once passed that barrier by looking to the unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to do oh just just let the world do what it wants to do but i'm in that spot with god shut in with god in that secret place there's a place of perfect rest behind that interval and that place is called faith true faith is unhindered he said oh she she had many hindrances it's a little bit further down the same message perseverance he said she had many hindrances she did herself but her faith didn't have any hindrances no faith don't have any hindrance faith just believes it i don't have a hindrance at all you're already past the sound barrier as the lady was talking over there faith don't have a hindrance you might have it but your faith doesn't have it your faith has no hindrances at all so in the midst of the struggle don't label that struggle as your faith don't say i don't have enough faith i don't have enough faith oh i've heard that so many times i've told myself that so many times i just don't have enough faith no you've got faith you just push on to it brother wade you're healed right right brother dale you're healed why the faith is there it's not like we're waiting on god to come down and bring enough power to heal us it's already here oh people say oh if i could just get under if i could get to the blessings of god if i could if god would just bless me that's it if god would just bless me i want a blessing i want a blessing listen the only way you can find a blessing is to get into the presence of god because god is a he is the blessing it's always blessing where god is the problem is that people don't want to go to where god is i want to go where he's at i want the blessing i want that healing i want that faith in the get to that spot run to that spot stay in that spot hallelujah when that devil comes and tries to fight you say listen devil you go off and vibrate yourself to who knows what i don't care i could care less because i'm a child of god and it's okay people have many hindrances but god don't god don't praise the lord god don't daniel said he lifted up his eyes and he saw all the saints down through the ages and through the bible stuff they they lifted up their eyes and they looked and they saw abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw isaac lifted up his eyes and he saw he saw that promise he saw rebecca coming jacob lifted up his eyes and he saw he saw the angels ascending and descending upon the ladder there daniel said in verse 5 of that same chapter we're reading verse 10 he said i lifted up my eyes and i looked what do you reckon he what eyes do you reckon he was looking with brother branham on the river there he he he saw he looked he lifted his eyes he saw the pillar of fire coming down some said they saw it others said they didn't see it some heard the voice speaking some didn't hear the voice speaking jesus cried out one time and said father glorify thy name and the voice came out of heaven and said i have i have both glorified it and i will glorify it again and some that were there said it thundered right you know what that why you know why that is that people say look the bible paul paul in describing his damascus road experience in one place he said that that the people that are with him heard it and saw another place that he said they didn't and people said see the bible contradicts itself it's just it's not right and brother branham said this here and that and everything else there you know what the difference is there were those there that had eyes that could see they were looking again i'm not going to get there but they were looking on through their eyes of their theophany and they could see they were seeing what he was seeing amen that's why some sitting in the in the in the in the roads there and they would brother branham would say oh you see that pillar of fire most didn't see it but some saw it why because they were looking through different sets of eyes some were looking through their carnal eyes trying to see it people say oh if i could just hear god speak god don't speak anymore i said god speaks all the time you're just not listening with the right ears god speaks continuously oh i can't hear them it's because you're trying to hear them through these natural things right here they're deaf dumb and no good amen but you start speaking or listen through the heart the ears are of the heart the heart the ears of your theophany you start listening through there and oh i guarantee you you hear god speaking and singing all the time the presence of god is always there he's here right now amen i can feel him hallelujah not just with this right here but there's eagle eyes there's eagle ears there's a presence that's there god is continuously that's the blessing of god he speaks what eyes do you think daniel saw through what eyes did abraham see through what eyes do you see through i lifted up my eyes and i looked lift up your eyes this afternoon church i don't know what your needs are but i know you got them i don't know what you're fighting with but i know that you're fighting if you're not fighting we probably need to carry you on to the corner you need to be down in the funeral home somewhere because if you're above the ground and you're still breathing you've got problems right you've got problems but the answer to every one of your problems it lays in jesus yes just get to where he's at faith knows no hindrance stand with me if you would this afternoon oh my i remember when brother jackie benton used to come through and then the service he would start singing that old thing faith in god will move a mighty mountain now i can't sing i'm not brother jackie brother jackie could really sing i love brother jackie i'll tell you what he would come and he would sing the same the beginning of the service he would sing the same verse the same song just over and over and over and over and the little kids are there like how many times are you going to sing that and i'd say he's going to sing it to the spirit of the lord comes down he's going to sing it until you can feel it right right why because he knew that if the presence of god at the presence of god if the people would get in a spot to where the presence of god could be be shed i think oh it was going to be a good time yeah i believe that same thing is true today amen right can you sing that faith in god and move to mighty mountain who's singing tonight you're singing amen i'll sing with you i'll go down here and sing amen god bless you saints i love you i love you and i'm just going to quit just like that amen you just saw my houdini act the lord is good is he not thank you for bearing with me i love you folks it's been a joy to be here amen if you ever get time to come by claim away y'all come see us amen don't leave your posted duty but when your pastor comes you can come too how about that god bless y'all amen faith in god amen i love you brother y'all help me brother dutch you're just gonna have to help me i don't know all the words [Music] think god can move a mighty mountain faith [Music] [Music] praise the lord first of all y'all bear with me i gotta calm my heart down because as soon as he hit that spot my heart jumped out of my chest i gotta tell you i experienced exactly what he said this past week i'm gonna try to condense it and you're gonna know every spot i hit on um i've been going for past four years i've had a rash on my body very itchy i've been to three dermatologists offices and it always came back bug bites i shut it down carnally because i'm like people live with me and i'm the only one getting bit by this bug shut it down brother dutch okay um i went to a skin cancer dermatologist on friday now i'm not sharing this testimony because i'm not going to give you all resolve that hallelujah resolve but the doctor said she read the reports because i brought the three all three of them said bug bites shut it down it didn't make sense so i went to the skin doctor cancer doctor she said has no one treated this and i said no and you know why brother dutch because i shut it down right i had to go to brother bob went boldly before the throne on thursday night and i said lord i gotta have an answer because i was getting close to the edge i'm gonna be real with y'all i was getting closer to the edge who itches 24 7 all day every day drawing blood and i went boldly bob on my knees on thursday night and i said lord i need an answer tomorrow i need an answer amen and don't you know i went to the skin clinic she made me feel good she rubbed my back she said we're gonna get you some relief okay so i went home brother done amen and the lord led me to those three reports that i never read and it uses the terminology and throb anthra was an animal it was bug bites but the doctor's delivery all three of them said bug bites that's why i shut it down i read for myself what it meant and he brought me back to the time and in the end and the question was why isn't anyone else getting bit by this bug it wasn't i wasn't the only one bit by the bug there was four other people but i'm the only one that's highly allergic to the flea i went boldly bob brother judge thank you my heart is about to have a heart attack he probably brought me from the heart that i sat there the whole time i'm like brother dutch you got to let me come up here i don't want to interrupt this no i don't want to do that but my heart is pounding thank you so much i lived what he just preached this week and it's over because amen it's over it's done i'm not letting it stop me anymore it's done it is done that's right no more hindrance is what i'm saying i hope i'm getting across everybody no more hindrance i was hindering it that's right he
