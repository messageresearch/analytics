========================================

thank you good to see about in the house the Lord I'm glad to have our visitors with us we always say when you come here one time your visitor you come two times you're part of us because we don't have anything to join we don't have anything to do we just part of the body of Christ but you know you come back and be with us and fellowship with us you're just part of us because we're not something big but good to have you with us I'm glad to do it and we're going to go right on the end of the service so you can go ahead and be seated and the musicians everybody can go down we'll turn it over to Ryan and let him uh direct a part now to because he's got a little bit he's wanting to show you and talk about the miracle baby then we will have the baby dedication all right all right good afternoon everybody this may take a while get comfortable foreign thank you I'm gonna set my stopwatch okay to stop me at a certain point because I don't want to go too long I'm glad to have my family here with me before I forget cake downstairs after service do not leave without eating some cake we don't want to take it home I'm so glad to have all my family if I could just take a moment to then introduce them uh starting over here in the right my grandmother uh Ginger bonnette beside hers my dad Joel and my sister Brooke and then Carlos and my two nieces and I and Aaliyah and then uh let's see my mom back there behind my dad there and my grandma my other grandma Arlene my mom is Deborah sorry and then over here Uncle Bill where'd they go oh they moved Uncle Bill and Aunt Suzanne Dover now let me tell y'all something that's important to me that I thought of when they walked in my grandma and my aunt Suzanne our children of my great-grandmother Eula who you all know my baby is named after they left Eula and Floyd night they left a legacy of Godly Christian love and that's part of the reason I'm standing here today is because the Bible says it's one simple law in God's word that train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he'll not depart from it they train their children to pray and they pass it down to the Next Generation my dad and mom taught me to pray and my grandma prayed with me and my sister and read our Bibles she read her Bible with us and that's she's part of this testimony if it weren't for that I wouldn't I don't know if I'd be here so um I wanted to give that to them now I'm trying to make sure I don't leave anything out um thank you all so much for your prayers about Ava God did something tremendous I mean not just healing her but delivering me from Fear and so many other things that I want you to see in this testimony and I hope it can be a help to somebody sorry that you didn't know all the circumstances most of you didn't know she was dying frankly I didn't want to think about it I didn't want to tell anybody I didn't want to confess it and like brother Dale says you don't have to know the circumstances that somebody's facing to know how to pray just pray amen you don't pray hard if they're dying and pray soft if they've got a cold just pray and brother Gary Atkins Sister Mary Doherty they're on my heart everybody's Hearts I'm sure we keep lifting them up we don't know exactly what they're facing to every detail but we just pray now either was born premature as most of you know she had underdeveloped lungs that was the initial diagnosis and she got worse and worse and worse over the first two days by the third day she was in critical condition on life support heavily medicated heavily sedated in a medical induced coma and under constant supervision from a nurse not one to two but I mean one to one ratio of a nurse constantly watching just our baby that's how bad she was constantly working diligently to get her stable by the third day now Now by that time all through this trial scriptures kept coming from our remembrance because he said he'd make a way of Escape in the trial and the word is the way of Escape you always go back to the word when Jesus was tempted he always went back to the word he said it is written it is written it is written and that's how we overcome now by the third day I was under tremendous load of fear not the good kind of fear of the reverent fear for God but the torment fear now the Bible says fear has torment and that scripture came to my remembrance and I told Gabby you know Gabby we've got to overcome this fear by this time I was crying okay because of the fear I was so scared for losing my baby now that was God speaking to me and I didn't know yet I thought it was just another good scripture to comfort me and later that day we're at our dying baby's bedside and by this time her skin was pale she was cold and clammy her fingers and toes were beginning to turn purple and blue her oxygen saturation at the lowest point that night got down to 37 percent it's supposed to be between 90 and 100 percent hers got down to 37 percent she was in terrible shape nonetheless there was a Bible study here that night we left our dying baby's bedside against all rational thought I'm not saying this to brag I'm saying that that I stood because I saw something in the Bible that having done all to stand we stand and to me standing is reading your Bible praying going to church diligently living to serve God and believing so we left our dying baby's bedside that night or that afternoon and went to church cried all the way here cried all dear and this during the Bible study and most of you know this part of the testimony because I testified a few weeks ago but the white approached me after the service not presumptuously holding his head down ringing his hands you know Ryan we'll keep praying for it maybe everything will be okay no he came to me and spoke boldly and said these words and simplicity he said he smiled and said don't worry stop worrying quit worrying like that about three times then he went on to say some other things and I accepted that okay that was the net result but he doesn't know this but when he spoke that to me a battle began to rage in my mind because that oppressive spirit of fear was beginning to it was confronted by faith perfect love casteth out fear if you can read that on the scripture there amen perfect love which is Faith casteth out fear that's how you overcome fear that confronted that fear and the fear began to be afraid itself because it was being loosed now watch I didn't know this until later on because weeks later after this had all passed I didn't realize what was going on but I pondered these things I kept these things in my heart like Mary and I began to think on these things and God began to show me some of what was going on behind the veil of the flesh if you will that fear was confronted by faith the first thought that came to my mind brother Wade was how dare you stand there and tell me not to worry when my baby's laying in bed dying I wasn't mad at him because he didn't know she was dying see but that was the first thought but what about my baby laying in the bed dying and you're just telling me something so simple just don't worry like Jesus said fear not only believe don't doubt and I went to Mark 4 38 later on that scripture came to my remembrance y'all can read it while I'm talking but just for sake of time the Jesus and the disciples were in this in the boat I see being tossed about by the winds and the waves and the disciples through a spirit of fear went to white jesus because he was asleep there was no fear in that man he laid there sleeping and in the midst of the trial in the midst of the storm he laid there asleep not worrying one bit but the disciples through fear went to wake him and said carest thou not that we perish in other words don't you care about my baby laying there dying see The Same Spirit act in the same way pointing to the circumstances just the same way false evidence appearing real fear pointed me back to the circumstances and then for a moment I thought yeah my baby's dying but this is Faith this gives me hope this gives me peace and joy so I'm going to take what brother Wade gave me and you know Jesus awoke and rebuked the winds and the waves and the winds and waves ceased and then he addressed the spirit of fear in the disciples and said unto them why are you fearful how is it that you have no faith okay so that same spirit of fear was doing the same thing in me I realized that only later now um that night we went home and went to bed I felt so much more encouraged I wasn't I didn't cry anymore after that in the middle of the night the worst wasn't over yet okay that was the turning point but not not just yet okay that God gave me something he was in the middle of giving me something to overcome the greatest battle was just ahead in the middle of the night the doctor called and said Ryan your baby's not getting any better she's she's getting worse and we're going to send her down to Egleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta where she can get some more advanced care so we went down there to meet the doctor in the middle of the night and while waiting to meet the doctor I pulled up my Bible and began to read despite my baby dying despite her having to be moved in the middle of the night would show she must been pretty bad and despite being a one-hour sleep I just pulled up my Bible and began to read as I did the day before that and the day before that and the day before that I refused to stop my daily Bible reading and you know what the very chapter that contained that very verse is the one that I read in my daily Bible reading now I go one chapter day out of the New Testament two out of the Old Testament and just to show you how unlikely this is I looked this up on Google there's 260 chapters in the New Testament so it's a one in 260 chance that this would happen that I would read that very verse now God was speaking to me and I began to realize that the Bible says three as a witness the previous day fear hath torment came to my remembrance just out of the blue then that night by the way it spoke to me don't fear don't worry and then in the middle of the night in my Bible reading waiting to hear the verdict from the doctor about my baby there came that scripture again and I've turned to Gavin I said Gabby look at this I said God is speaking to us God is showing us do not worry no matter what they're not fair now this is beautiful let me show you the next slide please Psalm 23 later again I realized we were walking right down the middle of Psalm 23. yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death Gabby and I collectively don't cry again being it's going to make me cry yeah I mean not collectively and individually we're in the worst trial of Our Lives the deepest valley yet and my baby was shadowed to death yet I will fear no evil that was David's Proclamation or Declaration and that was my mandate God told me don't fear what would be evil my baby dying it put her in the presence of God it'd be wonderful for her but for me it'd be terrible I'd never know what she'd become the side of Eternity I'd never know what color I should have what color hair she'd have everybody agree with me that'd be pretty evil I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff that comfort me now he was an ever-present help just as he always is and bringing the word from our memories give me scriptures to overcome and to comfort and everything and my favorite part I never understood what this meant thou prepares the table before me in the midst of mine enemies what were David's enemies here fear and death what were our enemies fear and death our baby was dying we were afraid fear and death The Last Enemy to be defeated is death the Bible says fear and death were our enemies okay now God didn't wait till they were at Bay somewhere off bothering somebody else and sneak in and slide us a little Manna under the table so to speak God's Not Afraid of fear and he's not afraid of death right he walks in waltzes in right in the middle of fear and death right in the presence of our enemies and opened a table before me and gave me exactly what I needed to overcome this very trial at this very moment they opened the table before me and on that table was not a seven course meal that was one little morsel of bread he was saying here son you're gonna need this for the battle that lays just ahead because he knew what that doctor was going to tell us when she walked into the room portion of bread was this that fear hath torment and no matter what the outcome of your trial you will never be benefited by fear so cast it down it's a disease it's a spiritual disease that only Dr Jesus can diagnose you with okay like depression which I've also overcome years ago now he Walters into the room and gave me that little Marshall of bread and no sooner than I had read that scripture and understood what was going on that the doctor walked into the room and she sat down and this was a real surreal moment she looked me in the eye and I wished at this point that I could be just a bystander watching her talk to somebody else about their baby but she looked me in the eye and was talking to me about my baby and said your baby is dying and we have a treatment here we can give her called ECMO which is a lung bypass machine will take and cut her jugular vein send this tube down her jugular vein into her heart to draw the blood out and circulate it through a machine and put oxygen in it because the lungs were not doing that and put it back into her jugular vein and thus get oxygenated blood to her body because if we don't do that soon she said she'll start having brain damage and before too long she was going to die her body's gonna start shutting down and there'll be no hope for her lungs then but this would give her time her lungs time to heal so she said uh and we'll leave her on that machine for up to two weeks and if she's not even better we'll take her off and let her go because she's not going to make it if she hasn't made it in two weeks Gabby was bawling by this time and I was trembling like I've never shaken before under that load of fear it was like a lion roaring in my face because Satan is a roaring lion Romans 2 and fro and seeketh whom he may devour and that fear was just roaring at me And yet this little still small voice that little still Small Voice kept speaking kept Echo into my mind and so the doctor said uh we're gonna hold off a little bit because she's stable right now so we walked out of there and went to bed our bedside at her bedside and watched her for about four hours we sat there from 2 30 to 6 30 Sunday morning and and they still haven't done the ECMO so we left we told him we'll see y'all this afternoon we're going to church it was Sunday morning so we came here and I testified about that very thing that if any time you're in a trial at the end of the trial you will never look back and be glad for the worry and say boy I'm glad I worried I'm glad I feared because that's what got me through that's when I realized that see and that's what I testified about and then I only made one confession about I've I still didn't know if she was going to make it but I knew I had to overcome the fear either way so I simply confessed I said y'all Pray For Ava she's she's fine just keep praying for her and at that moment as far as I knew she might have already been dead or dying or already on the ECMO machine well we left church and headed back down there that day and called the nurse on the way down and I said is she on ECMO yet is she on the long bypass yet and the nurse said no she's she's actually getting better and from that hour she began to man she got better and better and better every day she stayed there all together for 30 days in the NICU okay getting better each day now here's the wonderful part about all this this is something that nobody knows but me and God I haven't even told Gabby this because I wanted to give God all the praise before all you at one time and if after I say this if you're not praising God I'm going to step outside and look at the rocks on the church to see if they're actually praising God okay because this is one of our shouted over this in the chicken truck there were four nurses the first four nurses that I've had at Eggleston were named Kathy Katie Kate and Caitlin because I mean I called called him every day if we weren't there to ask them okay that's how I remember Kathy Katie Kate and Caitlin pretty much different variations of all the same name right so I said hmm something significant here I didn't know what I texted it out disabled people and Brooke texted me back so that name means pure p-u-r-e and I thought hmm that's neat sounds pretty two days later it finally struck me what that means look up pure it means untainted it means free from disease free from ill see God he works through nurses he works through doctors he works through medicine but God is the Healer God was beginning to purify our baby from the severe lung disease beginning to draw it out of her because that was her diagnosis by this time of severe lung disease right he was cleansing her and why four because three is a witness three would have got our attention but there were four of them don't get ahead of me now he's already got me figured out I'm sure Forest God's number of Deliverance in the Bible the children of Israel were 400 years in the land of Egypt and bondage when they were delivered Lazarus was four days in the grave when Jesus resurrected him and delivered him from death and the children of Israel I'm sorry let's see the Hebrew children there you go he mentioned it this morning the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace uh and the fourth man seen in that fire was their deliverer okay Forest guys number of Deliverance through four nurses whose name means pure which is a four-letter word God has began to purify our baby and cleanse her from the sickness and watch this she was born she was delivered from the womb if you will at four minutes till midnight and by the way a side note that was the best delivery best that Gabby's done so far everything went so smoothly I believe in other midwives were anointed but this time more than ever because I'll stand there praying you know I have to believe it and four minutes till midnight is when she was born she went into the NICU just a couple hours later and all day Saturday all day Sunday excuse me all day Thursday Friday and Saturday she got worse worse and worse and Saturday night she was at the point of death but on the fourth day which was Sunday the Resurrection Day the day we honor and celebrate the resurrection God began to raise her and heal her from that sickness and I'm not done she's our fourth child and you know God delivered me from Fear on our fourth child and she has a four-letter name I've her middle name is a four-letter name June now watch this what was the next thing I didn't write any of this down I just practiced it a lot four and four okay and uh well now I plan forgot it it'll come to me four and four all the fours in her name now watch she is her name means uh God is gracious did I say that at the start of it I don't remember God is gracious is what iva's name means it's a Hebrew name God is gracious and all through this trial God was gracious not only to deliver me but gracious to deliver her from the sickness God's grace was manifested over and over and over and um and those just so many other things just one thing after another I'm trying to jog my memory because there was four I know there was another four in there uh but God was gracious and let it be said of either from this day forward whenever you think of ABBA remember that God is gracious to to deliver God's grace is sufficient to deliver okay and um if I remember that other thing I'll just have to come back up and say it later oh yeah here it is oh it's a big one hang on this is a big one see anytime God gives you something The Devil Makes You doubt it yeah so immediately after this the devil's making me down I said okay big boy we'll see you come the next trial we'll find out right if I got delivered from fear or not the next trial came a couple weeks later it was last Sunday morning brother Queen was preaching Eula laid there on her back asleep and Gabby and the girls were in the bathroom and and uh the devil thought this is a pretty good opportunity to sneak in and cause some Mischief caused some trouble I was holding either my hands were tight okay and Eula was laying there on her back asleep and her arms began to flail like this about once every second with a heartbeat you know and she was asleep now I thought maybe it's just a nightmare but it'll just go away but no she kept doing it and then I noticed she's not breathing so I went up to raise her up she was just as limp as could be not breathing she opened her eyes and her eyelids okay and her eyes were rolled back in her head she was having a febrile seizure her seizure had spiked it was up to 103.5 and she was not breathing now I just all I did I handed off the baby to Terence and and took Eula picked her up and carried her out and said Lord bless my baby and no sooner than I did that that she coughed all that out and she began to breathe and it was in just within moments the brother Aaron and a whole host of other people and our two of our church staff nurses were out there assessing her people are surrounding us with prayer and and praise and it wasn't too long after that she came out of that and she's perfectly normal and well right now but here's the thing I didn't fear yes I just simply went and picked her up and acted I just prayed and carried her out and said Lord if you take my baby she's yours the lord giveth the Lord blessed us the way the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord no worry I just walked out and just believed God delivered me from Fear now uh the sisters if you will come there's one last thing I want to do the sisters are going to sing the song I need sister Esther and brother Richard Roberts no other musicians I want y'all to be able to see the slideshow they're going to sing a special song all the sisters that are singing please this is a list of the diagnoses that we received for Ava throughout the whole entire ordeal I'm just going to read these off this is sort of a ceremony I'm going to tear it pieces and frame the teared the torn pieces on our wall at our house and put above it in a frame by his stripes her total

will raise foreign ER amen let's stand together we're going to have a baby dedication go ahead and bring up the the little one and we always do here come up with the parents the grandparents the great grandparents a whole family and uncles there's any ants come on with it bring the whole thing she's wanting she's wanting you back around that's this thing bring them in while they're getting everything ready okay bring them in bring down me bring a little ones to Jesus praying down here bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in bring a little ones to deep Jesus bring them in bring them and bring a little Wonder dear amen and amen and amen but it's what we do we bring the little ones to Jesus you know a lot of churches they do different things but remember in the scripture they brought the little children that's right to Jesus and he blessed them it's not a thing that we call it a baptism or anything right it's just the basis that we bring them to the Lord we hand them into the hands of the Lord and asked the Lord to take care of them that's right he's been gracious to have done all so far so whenever you finish the day but how do we also do we also do one thing the family standing see when we come to a baby dedication it's a little bit different I guess than most people and like I said it's not an infant doing things it's not a sin or saved or anything it's just we've come to dedicate them to the Lord give them into the hands of the Lord and then you know what they would take them to Jesus he'd bless them he'd give them right back to them because you know who raised the children Jesus didn't raise the children it was the people the ones around that raised and we always say even to the church that everybody in this church today is a people that are dedicated to one thing for you to live a life that this child would have an opportunity to be able to see Jesus Christ that's the point of all of it the whole thing is the dedicating right but the dedicating of the people that are witness to all of it that's right now we're to live before this child to where the child could have an opportunity of seeing Jesus Christ that's all we try to do and that's what we try to bring them to the to the Lord amen if I see you then we bring you out landed router I want her again it's not me standing here it is if you hear you would take the child and you'd hold it up books we thank you Father that we have this opportunity to be a part of this be a part of seeing the family standing here that they realize that a miracle is transpired yes and all of their lives amen that they can see that you brought a baby where the even the doctor said couldn't live I guess you've gone into Texas but now it's in your hand we just commit to our opportunity anymore we believe we thank you in Jesus name the town Lord we give her back yes we love you and we thank you a little bundle of joy that's right think of all of the little ones and we've dedicated all of these little ones each ones had their opportunity to be dedicated amen amen she raised she is a miracle and we believe it amen thank you yesterday and forever he's the same Lord Jesus nothing can stand in his path he's the Emmanuel he's raised from the dead living among man if you just have faith in God God will heal you right where you're at don't you believe that I challenge your face I challenge you to believe Jesus Christ I challenge you to take that word that he's just the same yesterday today and forever and believe it with all your heart do you do it faith in Christ according to your faith doesn't touch his garments Watch What Happens your eyes comes open if you believe it have faith in God does thou believe if you can believe you will receive what you ask for for the Holy Ghost is here Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe it have faith in God have faith in God believing all things are possible for them they believe if thou canceled Jesus Christ is the same yes isn't he hey I just the Bible said if thou can't believe all things
