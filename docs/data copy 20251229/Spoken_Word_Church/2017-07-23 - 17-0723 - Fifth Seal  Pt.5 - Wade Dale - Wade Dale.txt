========================================

all right hello morning everybody we'll be back in the pound more today and bye have a good time and we can hope a lot of fruitful things done I got a lot let me finish that I own it we'll be over there another way over there Bihari about humans as well just because and that Sonny will get Sonny and I'll tell you one thing JJ about any country I can tell me a living ain't anybody I know or even a lot no I just got married and the ammonia now they're taking the rivers darkening treatments right now our data because you know yes oh all right so anyway now let's get started so there was no rampage so just keep everybody forever the we believe prayer yeah will be answered man prayer will be answered all right let's read now Matthew 24 more still on the fifth seal will probably finish it up day is today and go to system and then show many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise and deceive many now this is coming toward remember this fifth seal happens after we're gone right half of that y'all killing in your Sedona people get in here going yeah over here all right now spell something like but remember this is telling a an event that's going to happen right this is going to happen under the fifth seal there's going to be now we know for a fact that the fish they will went into another dimension but when we're gone the fifth seal is going to be inactive it's going to be an action still it is not going to be dormant because it as people die and get persecuted they're going in under that fifth seal juke-r right right okay so so it's happening that one saying we're gone so what's going to happen is now what does the Bible doesn't cover when it talks about the 1260 days and the two witnesses remember they're true witnesses they're all true they're true that true they bring a message but the vital really never said anything about balls because you know one thing for sure if they're going to be drool in this they've got to be involved with room there's got to be false prophets shall rise in deceive many so just as in our anytime see this is a choosing time in our en time same thing happened both profits are rising up and deceive many now we see that happening in the message rains as far as people leaving the message right but what were so far away is is people sitting here under the message of the idle word they don't have come to church and they don't have studying it up to me that's a greater falling away cause you think you're just so you think you're sitting in a building and everything's fine and what happened you're not hearing from a fault trumpet in this pulpit pulpit you're here from a false prophet but you don't have any bourbon that false prophet and then you you even got true or false in your soul there's no able to clean there's no there's no gray area you either got it or you don't GZ got the new birth or you still got that over that makes you still got a demon inside of you sorry but doctors the way they look there's a way out okay there's a way out I'm signal goes look because the niccola t show abound the love of many shall wax cold now that love is not so it is not filial love that's not how I feel up to it that's listen in the Bible when you try to make this skin we can understand in the Bible figlio love was when Abraham and Sarah when Jacob married Rachel and yourselves in when this natural act that's fetal love agape love never was a love between a man and a woman no there's no way agape love is between you across if you do one and cross the math right amantha God that true of God with a filial love and see they put in program of what point he did he come from agape the figlio to what was and what happens is now you see all these men with men women women notice what's going on back foot it a perversion of the true that God loves with that not that's not that's not video love that's adopting love the love of many shall wax cold may still happen you birth in there something that's why I grow to else that we need a reliable I sort David okay we were getting a haircut I'll get my haircut do then jeans a badges and then two of the badges sitting there you know they would come out now whenever revival to bring a center then you don't but Jeannie's real versed in the biology of the Bible I said Jim I said you can't have a revival with a dead person you can have a resurrection with a dead person you can revive those that are alive right there never has been a revival for their people its revival there's a lot of people's right you got anybody you know you're right I think the problem is we got too many people we got too many people then they died enough to be resurrected to have a real out all right anyway now to staying here because the love of many shall wax cold but look but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved right so that's that's to me that's talking to the vigil Jew typical dari enduring what what does the Bible tell them and their revelations it said wait what is it door main door means wait in door means the way wait until your fellow servants in other words always I was thinking yesterday you know God's Word is is limiting what I can do but it's the perfect plan of God because what we thought just come down here change running we go home why can't do that why couldn't you do that why can't he just now appear right here change our body will go on a rapture and he goes to the Jews and why does he go thing influency today everything has a plan in the purpose running God's plan the reason that the fall happened was to fully develop not God God already fully developed but in other words our love back for him okay I love back for him at the top they love not feel you look beat me although it's for your parents your wife your children whatever you want to say down here this is still your look this was filial while this imperial was created after the ball be Leola was created after the ball because of the fall God said okay Adam you leave are now going to procreate this way that's not the way I want it but you're going to procreate this way but it's going to be a type of us that help took the new birth and Mail of the crops and develop the childhood of almost all men comes before that that now I'm going to tell you why they thought can go to them go remember when Boaz redeemed Naomi remember he got rude but the full right of redemption was was to take the child that they had and give that child back to Naomi right which what that cops Christ the towel they only type was the old Jews the 144,000 we gotta give Christ Christ had to come to the Gentile we had to be born again first so that we can present that child back to the Naomi Jews so she can raise it you know hurry Tommy but he can't just be that's like that I made that point up I'm answering the question that I asked you why can't other screw down here every time the Bible will be broke all the time says is you've got you guys want to come to the Jews and then you take it again all right and then they have a child promise child and they take a child and give it to you but same way got it right so so that but see that was feel you love could they produce the child who you love Monday but you see the adopted love even then the Old Testament are you looking god I'd read it this morning we're brother Brown stood there without money walking out think it was darkest hour and you know there's ever been because when we're walking out he screams out he said I will play in other words I'm going to come out there I'm going to undo all this see that speak that's not Phil Yolo feeling a little I've always said to that when Adam to give back when Adam took when Adam found out what he did now he didn't have to have a sacral relation letter to say we know that right right there are no special anything that was redemption if they taught but it's not the real thing right but I'm telling you though if Adam had not had the Holy Ghost in his soul which idiot could remember garden-party turn like that he was the son of God that man had more control of the earth and we do with one man at the moment here what's it at the moment but that video had to turn into the topic of something inside of Adam forgave me acted with this you and I you're welcome to use I've had relations with an animal figlio love we kick you out the door and divorce or and you never touch her she would be defiled so what took over with a - why that Adam portrayed cry that's why God look down and said that's what I'm going to do because listen we're the we had relations with an animal or not we have have relations with the server that's our first relationship is with the table drunken is right in the car line is the deception so Christ is going to what we'll look through all that they clap dr. kopylov that's this thing right here I told you that man can produce reading man can produce it because we haven't got we appeal you look really old of me if you do something in addition being you just up for me I do some for you dr. love has no how will you will it's all God that I learned do it whether you want whether you like it or not I'm going to do this all right so we see that that this love is agape love of man shall wax cold we see that happening now even here and what is the network and equally a sin that you know you shouldn't do but you do it anyway right they neither shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached into all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come right good look we're living in the end time but when we leave this earth that's not the end we're going to be a secret cat that's what people do not get where this is we are going to leave this earth and there's going to be nothing that's going to seem out of cater for a while you talk to most people denominational ones and they're going to tell you that they know that they're going to see the skies park I mean I just heard it this guy is going to pardon Jesus is going to walk down and pick his children up and take us home every eye shall see the Bible tells you that but you gotta remember that's not the coming we are that's not as I'm trying to get y'all to see me then don't let yesterday and this is one points each person is not included into that it is totally and he said well we're segregating ourselves I got a quote brother Brown said God is a segregated God is a segregated not black - why not not from you know Asian and in fact no God to segregate ago he said you don't touch them all right so neither the same Gator but being a segregated though he has segregated that Genesis 1.6 man but he's also calling to those people telling them you can come in and you want to but he knows who he is he knows he different so therefore being God he knows he has a special group of people and he's going to take us out of here and I brother I'm said he said what did five other people left Jefferson bill right now he said nobody don't for a year or more and that's Jefferson bill what about the whole world right we leave this place and disappear yeah sure here your clothes families gonna but they all don't go life didn't done branding people they probably went up in a mountain somewhere or they you know are they all the way to gentlemen bill are they always been you know you're selling center so what I'm saying is when every I shall behold and all the things you better not be at that resurrect I mean he very healthy at that coming right the Last Judgement but we're going to be taken out of it first to me that's what the secret of the field are the secret of these fields are is we're going to take a body change we know all this has already happened to a group of people seven groups of people surveyed seven groups of people already been to these they received the word for their hour but not the eagle anointing water but they received the word God has preserved them into and degrade waiting the redemption of the volume which oh my god come to Redemption here before backing up all right so that's the same thing here we we saw these seven churches this is half now we've got what I hope you many times before you got to remember we got I don't want you to look at this as sometimes getting something but but your soul once you receive a revelation once you receive the new birth your soul is gone in this dimension you should all wear it over the other no it's right not only wherever we're supposed to be Paul said what in heavenly places now it is a heavenly place no where you receive revelation from one feeling dream no that's where the revelation stopped in these three dimensions when when we come down into time God stopped what fellowshipping with man like he did without okay so now we got but when he come back he come back into these three dimensions and he's going to take us back giving us a promise we're gonna talk about this afternoon what about the promise he gave us a promise of what he would do to fulfill genesis 3:15 and to fulfil acts 2:38 and to fulfill genesis 3:15 God came back himself to take you where he is he said where I am there you be also right so to me your your soul is not in this to making sure if you're born again as I said if you're not born again you you can understand the things of God the bicycle Bible said that's what the Bible said that's not what the promise is no I said oh there's a pileup it without the Holy Ghost you can't understand this Bible or Jesus Christ for any male said the Bible this is the Jesus Christ you can't understand it without heaven Oh Leo's right amen all right why do you understand it when you have the whole go because you're the one that wrote the one that wrote it is inside of you speaking out plus Angie if you know going through the series about the fall look at the effects of the fall was though that man could go back and go out you come in and clean your soul up take all that old brother up that imprint and take all that backs away from you put his life in you and you become a new creature a new creation well I must not happen that's what's happening all this is what's happening in all these fields you're becoming a new creation you should all brother that's a new birth I die daily I was come with you creating every day every day right I'll go a new creation one of the things are developing as a baby you know like Ulysses there he's got everything she's got to be able grown woman but you don't put thing don't hurt that age that she would have to handle that big thing they things at 15 she went that panel when she's hurt till she's 30 you know they don't say so that way John that way I understand the way God does it because he knows he knows how we develop as a human because guess what he developed in the human he learned by the things he's wife suffered right that's why I was telling you before God didn't promise you a perfect life he problems you eternal life you know all that not till we get over not do we get that here it brought you the perfect life he promised us eternal life all right that's why everybody thank boy get the new birth brother Browns yeah you get a new birth no you probably go away no let's go this time that's when they start why because truly if your soul is that another dimension receiving revelation from God and speaking to God the part of you that's here which is your spirit the spiritual part of you spirit part of you is still in this world memory memory is unconscious affection imagination you take them five and you think about what troubled you more than anything once it's not your flesh your seat they still smell in here only reacts to what their five senses in the middle memory that's my problem but God can take the holy dose and go through that memory and show me this right I can remember what God taught me reasoning you sure you can but still remember you gotta say it coming in the other way all right say it's coming in this way and dogs coming last one the great Bell they will fall tonight in your heart listen the Greg that's why brother Brown was sold for cyber he's a lot of noise you say no I said my Emma Hart no these are sayings in there or gods in there we have to understand that there's no finding in your soul you're either faith or your doubt the fighting is in the spirit around up here you say down here e to the grant spell ever thought in your mind even born again greatest battle at the end every born again the greatest battle ever fought is is that we got to get this Carl line what turn back toward the word and everything's are putting the word is for us to be able to turn back all right I mean look look look at this afternoon brother I said at that day see that's now that's this day that wasn't all today sure they saw a little part of it and that day you'll know that I'm and father pomian but when we come to this time right here this is it and why is it boots burns and you know that you look and see this is the title that this is the time of the culmination because it said the bridegroom waited we've been waiting for seven church ages but remember there was a call sign rose up woke up went in I let's look for all couldn't find any comeback names already going that's the rafter we're looking at that's today and why they have to do with that these fields that got come today because a lot of preachers say well these seals are for you know they're for you and send them away with a daniels muh ball I spear from needed no remember everything that's given by God in that onion peeled layer upon layer you are not listening you are not excluded from one scripture not one you are included in everything you say what might be there well what were you before number one you were the devil oh but every picture has a dual meaning secret meaning and then a meaning does right and also meaning to the Jews because remember and it was hard for me to see that the Bible brother ground is written to Christian we say no Bible would read the Christian but a sinner has to read it to become Christian so what you say it was written to Christians about creating bring example to the center so that he can take it and enter into and become part of that right remember Redemption what I love and into I you guys come out of the world and then to Christ or into the into the world so let's read this while property gods to pray for revelation more than anything I prayed the daughter show me just a little bit doesn't matter just a little bit and you know you did this week showed me a few things that that I had had that I struggled brother there we were talking yesterday going on us clothing and I had a question and going to answer that question so you know but you know why would you just sit there like a fly on them in a flower pot you you know I'm gonna get much you got a question asked them I said I mean I ain't y'all say we you know I ask questions I have to ask questions right I love asking questions I mean it's not bad though in dumb questions when you carry around all you out you know you know you pick it up it's not when you open the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them we were slammed with work garden for the testimony which they held know what brother branham held that scripture many times to be the souls under the altar even crying how long how long as the bride right before the sealed over you'll pay end up if you'll read the fifth seal will tell you but now that is true if you take the onion field because there are soldiers the Ultrabook when you come further and read what they said see then you take that scripture in these two just meld right together and we know it's a bit sealed you not the bride of Jesus coming because of what they said okay see that your relations that's been there for 1,500 years ago Bibles been written and nobody's called it the lamb time that's why the seals are so important what does he do in answer his question a loved ones property God said he said that the seal revealed what which that which was another one three came from that which he is and that wishes to cover even that's what John Senden book revelation that was what prolapses we'll show where you come from what you're doing here and where you go all right so that's the three bowl purpose all dusty 42 cry all Christ important to us and then we're going back to pass that to the Garden of Eden we're going back to the garden to be all right so what wonderful wonderful message we got and they probably allow boys say how long how long how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth we know one thing's for sure that is not the bride of Jesus Christ because remember we would be saying Father forgive them for they know not what they do that would be us so that's what our Savior did on the cross he didn't say to be my blood he said Father forgive them they don't want to do it so therefore the Prophet running running the scripture through their Holy Ghost filter come to this assumption not even assumption a prophet doesn't listen don't remember he did roaming but he said we just presume anything we're assuming we were people we got to know so whether a new write land that that was not the bride it was another group of people he breathed and what wrote arguing there one of them it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little while until their fellow-servants so whatever it wasn't under the altar had to be only earth toast fellow service also their brethren rose magenta cute that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and we know what's going to happen to know that that Jews are going to be slaughtered until until the I say real in time go back to that 1260 days the battle Armageddon is coming that will be the end time that will be termination of the world as we know it now do you understand what I'm saying as we know now now will be the end of the world it's not going to be the end of time I know that just an interruption of nature like we're going to get into the fist deal that's another interruption of nature that we'll have to deal with because the interruption of nature that we take in the new birth is the first one the first one it's got us on it we're not warning in it we'll have a new nature if we don't have a new life then the old optional people go it's just a think I'm taking over we're going as the scripture said down to time they said oh Jesus is coming well way by killing the 50s and coming to them but remember the signs were not there for him to come now the signs are here for him to come all the church ages have run out with the last prophet to the Gentiles has run out I don't mean run out and did it I mean run out to where the prophecy is in our hands all right everything is that that day everything has come right now to us standing here today no other group to throw it to no other prophet to come no other generation to come as far as a Gentile morning in generation this is it so what if our if our nature is not interested burst then there's no way because remember I will fail first then the creation felt hunted right now fail and God had to turn in curvier remember read your Bible even after the Asian Street good thing when they read it today a little bit the Galatian I mean no tension freaking thing relations of Jenson's replace the previous thing to to dentistry to think when I thought about genesis 3:15 what the problems was want to see them what he done afterwards teacher okay if you're going to what you're going to bear children in sorrow I am because of what you listen to your wild cursed is the ground delivered rain comes up on the grounds curves command just wait is everything okay I mean man even after it was cursed man live almost a thousand years what about that I went back to and I'm reading Genesis now than a million gentle I'm 41 I've read the whole book of Genesis in man and people live a long time kichul magnet being 500 years old and just be in midlife but there was a live another incision nine years why was 120 years old for his first child yeah yeah but you know what though that was that was to me that was showing that how perfect out of a need worry they were state of that condition on how much we could live that even after the fall after the sex comes in after time comes in after all that comes in my thirties was filled with nine fifty-nine year and there's five hundred seven years six hundred seven here the what based on this is it always on fault then don't then don't use one company we apologized interviews working at this time no matter that we don't want to hear that which means sometimes before brain getting here Johnny is not all exon fault it is all of our fault a man's intelligence is our fault okay all right yeah but you know what those people did all they don't just develop what they went back before the flood and picked up all the oil it was under bigger health of all the plants and animals and people they never tell you people in school just for a few minutes before we go you know they don't ever you always go you see this you're crazy that you got to just a certain age and then protozoa and all these things came up and we're living off a dead plants and animals there was people here too and they all died in the footage separate them and if they were seven billion people before where it was in the days of Noah weird it said well we're doing six point nine nine nine eight nine nine nine billion people without the agent leo we're they Ellen they go in your car I told somebody that does a normal person in that way now man it plants an animal does it think over here yes all we are is petroleum anyway were jellies elected by thought we are you know we're yeah yeah but see that that's why probably come but you know what let me tell you this and not be not be I'm not belittling the profit for brother branham opened the door so that we can understand he did not give us every detail he didn't have time he creates deep reason a people to preach 5 a lifetime he would have never been able to bring everything that God has revealed to us after the prophets well by the Holy Ghost by the Prophet being the porter to open the door and introduce us to Christ the real person right so then cries - what speak to brother Raman speak to you that happened 60 years ago but as we hear the voice in other words there's power behind that voice that was the voice of Almighty God so he can then reveal things to you that brethren listen but I'm never revealed explain to anybody right not so he didn't really old nothing ready right he preach the Word of God he got a revelation God took that in took his human factor his voice and and molded it with his and then he spoke saying that man had never seen but what are we supposed to do with it just say well I was just listening to what he said look at the confusion of people they just listen to what he said remember the brothers they come from Africa that went over there confronted so the trevor of them what were they holding in there man that's a marriage in divorce booth oh yeah that video is to me it's just classic I'm sorry but that's a classic example that you just don't listen to tapes because they took that man in divorce book right here right the brother will call in brother will it's that I don't believe that now they don't believe the manual or pletely I'm sorry that brother said you'll probably did right hands if believing me was leading right out of marriage and divorce book the way you'll save you don't have a revelation or if you don't so some kind of teaching you did you find a day the door won't button all right easy right that's right you want to be me bring a book down us over bring elbows down here we'll talk about it why because what the Prophet brought us two big nuggets and inside that big nuggets is little money right and that little nuggets for me we can't swallow big nothing we call a little dude I mean I like a state but I can't swallow in that bag right now somebody excited that piece bumpy for me to start handing it out I'll eat that sucker and I made it all but it'll take me a while come on yeah come on then hey man so anyway but this is what I mean we we kid around with it but it's true we need to have support from each other we need to we need to say preacher why I tell you men come let me take this tunnel I'm telling Charlie we have a visitor here and danced our top has to back up or I have to back up talk about one garden y'all just sit there like young Center and you know what the neighbors doing the neighbors one well they don't even believe that man later hates us uh probably know you hear me with brother Dale comes about ones on ie men call the bank of my sin and employees in the Trinity yeah and no I said they matter we go on him we've heard this a million times before not ought to be a joy yeah they got showed it to you and you ought to say a man to everything it comes in and they said well we've heard that before last example no you should Amen just as much because what you're doing is you're setting an example that that person may say hey they may have something here if all these people believe it like Jim's dad and Jim's dad always thought that my dad was the only one that believed we're waiting brent was the problem so he only were nut cases they brother that was just something he pulled him oldest man william branham out of a hat and he killed one they believed in till he started meeting brothers okay brother George Quinn all those brothers even foreign countries and all the medicines we have coming in jeans that would be there certain times and we have people when they put these same things we believe these are brothers we have churches in this place we all don't want to display this right you know what it doesn't change the data cute though it changes the attitude to we're not just want some little you know Jim Joe more Jim Jones all take a look you know over and South African drinking tea I mean some good way so you know you're no effective there are real people in this manatee and believe it and they limit and that that is the part of I think we are healthy don't be ashamed of the gospel that you know that don't not be ashamed we don't be what happen you be ashamed yeah good how can you be shamed at UPenn you should never be ashamed of eternal life she got the godly look that overtakes everything everything so no affinity let's run get real quick we'll go on one minute no not that based or what the the bride's don't so this is just to the Jew okay he come into another dimension because they're under the altar they're not in this dimension they're in another dimension okay so John hands go and look across into another dimension and see that go George saw and we had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar so he had to carry him into another dimension while roads were given to them they did not have them while the world earth they were giving to them for what the testimony which they held all right they were all Jews and they're going they're going to have to wait for 1260 days after we're gone for 1260 days they're gonna have to wait to end the app another all right so the Pennsy are we looking at three things here we looking at the greatest showing of grade giving some laser loud that did not want justification Thomas - we just see the real you didn't do it cuz remember if the real thing did it they're going to hell but the real them didn't do it in God's mind he blinded them for a reason and then given me our life now and it's the first revelation for the body chain that your body though you've sinned with it with this body it's going to be changed it's going to be changed literally changing the moment 2009 let's go back up a little bit maybe name tiny little start and see Lord bless you
