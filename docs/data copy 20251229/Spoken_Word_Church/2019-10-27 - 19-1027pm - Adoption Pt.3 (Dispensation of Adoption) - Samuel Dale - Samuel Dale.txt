Wade and June is traveling back from brother appreciate for brother all - I don't know where he's doing this evening on it but he's mr. ministering for brother ole Teague's we'll remember that and remember now the Bible study will be this coming Saturday at 6 o'clock now for the adults so we will Staton it to where you'll remember it the adults is from 6 o'clock to 8 all right the children are from 2 o'clock til up to the time with the starting of the service or the others because they have their parts and things that they're doing and you know and questions and answers they've got a whole lot of questions and I'm not making no joke but I saw one of them that want to know what the 3rd who was you know instead of 3rd pool those won't know what the 3rd pool who was so but that's alright we'll get the right answer somewhere in there and find out what's what's being said so we just you know appreciate so remember that - for the children now and then you'll have your times and then 6 will be for the adults and the children together for questions and answers we have a really good turnout most of the time it's between 30 to 50 on the the time they're you know and that that's good for you to come in and it's to come fellowship together so come bring your questions and we'll try to discuss them it's not that much to doing as we really just discuss a lot of things and that's the way I like it I enjoy their sitting down saying well is that what you mean you know I like it that way better than to pass over you and not know you know get the wrong point about the questions and answer so remember that you'd like turning your scripture turn to Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to Ecclesiastes 3 visions 1 please yes these 3 father we thank you for this day and your grace and love Lord thank you for everything and we ask you that you would just got us and direct us as to what to say to your people and help us Lord to realize realization that your God and you change not Lord will see into this and our thoughts and ideas that you never change so then it's easy to follow you through the dispensations in your word because they'll everyone carne out to be the same and point to the right order we love you and we thank you bless them God never waiting them traveling the different ones error in an impact from Tennessee and just have you away with each and every one thank you for being with Dale and many the testimonies that we've heard Lord of how much things is going he's wanting to go home he's he won't come to eat he's wanting all the things Lord we just thank you for that let me ask you to got us forgive our sins and keep us in Jesus name seasons 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which were at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him liyan before the nation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will what is the mystery of his will to adopt us that's just the plain as can be as the thought you'll see having made known unto us the mystery of his will according which according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself what that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who has trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now when the Bible speaks it like that it means singular there is no more see it doesn't just say were sealed with a Holy Spirit it says with that it's making a point that singular bringing it out a promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and let's go to Ecclesiastes called who a picker thought after we get on over into the message a little verse 3 says now you hear this quarter there's a there's a time for all things that's not in the scripture it's not a time for all things because that would mean there would be a time to die to be you have problem there's it doesn't say it now listen read it right there as you're seeing it to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven there's not a time for it there's a time to it okay a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck that which is planted a time to kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up so you get to point from that that it's not saying it's a time far because there's this if you make it far you and make it the wrong thing but there is a time to or a time this will take place are you following me the time will take place that is to a time to kill the time to steal the time to do it will take place but it's not just sit like lamb and that's it and you say well it's the time for the notes of time to that so remember that is we go along father we thank you in Jesus name Amen you may be seated now we're trying to whether Louise is going to interpret so I will I'm very slow anyway but I will try to slow down just a little bit and that will help him to follow on in interpreting all right now we read in Ephesians that there's a dispensation of adoption right a dispensation what is a dispensation it's the time are a setpoint assault or something you know as a dispensation if something made now you studying the message you'll do this run across it you hear brother branham and I'm going to put it on here I like to do that to wear that you can think about what it is you hear him say I am NOT a dispensationalism alright but then in another message maybe the next room maybe that same message he said I am a dispensationalist alright now he's saying it both ways and you say well what is he which one is he will read you know where he says he's a dispensationalists and we'll all be dispensation is all right that's true if you believe now listen that it we're all E and we're living in a dispensation a time a place a point that's more or less the dispensation is something set and we're living in a set time there was a times I'll read in a minute of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now that doesn't mean it's gone listening it doesn't mean it was here and then left see that would be if you were just saying I believe in a dispensation you just say well I believe in the dispensation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost well then you would be backing out see from that and would be saying I don't believe that's here anymore no it may be carnal for you to my way of thinking but the Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever so he never changes his nature his ways and beings he doesn't change down through there because he's the same but there's a time to things alright now don't misunderstand I said then don't think there's a time far see the baptism is there's not a time for the baptism when those goes that's my point we've always said you listen to anybody quote includes the 90% of the time they will quote a time for all things or they'll say in the Bible is a time there's not a time for it's a time to the that way you can have a dispensation move into another dispensation have them running parallel with each other are together and it's not one being far and the other one it's the time to know that's okay now I have to express things my way and I didn't want you to especially you that study the message of the Prophet to when I would say brother Branham is the dispensation well I've got quotes where he says he ain't well okay I've got him to know but then you say he'd say I I don't believe in different sizes so well he don't believe in dispensation did he'd say I do believe in the dispensation well then you got to get it clear what he's talking about okay so there's a dispensation for this a dispensation for this a dispensation and they all can overlap each other there's a dispensation throughout the ages of justification thing all right then there's a dispensation of sanctification does that do away with justification no they go together see that's why that you'll hear the prophets say I'm not a dispensation then you say I am a distance I read what he's talking about so the you know that will get you a time to all things not far to them clear it up to you to help you okay now what is that point talking about in the Bible using the terminologies of adoption okay and in that form we have Paul picking up especially using the words adoption Peter doesn't necessarily use the word adoption when he's covering it through the statute of a perfect man in second Peter but Paul is covering the word of adoption I like Paul's writings I don't discredit the others but I like Paul's writings because Paul's writings are specific they're to the point you know that they say what they mean and mean what they say and and it all comes out to the right order okay all right see Paul in Galatians you'll be talking about adoption okay he be coming through and showing you the forms of adoption which he's taking the Old Testament that's you know one reason I love you you think it doesn't mean nothing but do you know I try to explain things and I'm maybe not shooting a lot of times but I like for everybody to understand the ended odd that Paul wrote the communion message explained the communion the Paul wasn't there with the Lord Jesus when the communion was served Peter explains other things why would it not have been for Peter to explain the communion see because Peter was not an Old Testament form in his studies and bringing it forth Paul could take anything back into the Old Testament because he had all of that background that studying of the Word of God so he would know what happens in the communion and knowing like Wade was bringing out that time you know that there'd be a plate left this is for Elijah we'll see Paul was the only one that would have known that others would have not have known you know those things Paul had that set background understanding so in his understanding he understood adoption and he would try to explain it how that in the Old Testament they had the the son born into the family all right he's a son he's an error he's a child for that family okay then Paul picks it up and shows that he is he's given a tutor a governor a school masters we've read in Galatians our four three four five and he's given those to tutor him and bring into the position of the nature of the father all right so Paul understands what that's saying see he's following it from the point of the son being a son then the son is brought into deeper meanings you know sonship becomes a greater word for the father when he becomes Oh Zak in here but he he will get it one of these days when he finds out and that baby they're in and all the other things it changes things when you got children right you start understanding a little bit more about what the Bible's saying when it says be the child that won't die but that's what it says now it doesn't mean you know for you to beat him with a big old stick and wear him over the head and beat him to death no all right we know better than that but it's just that point but see Paul he uses his term to say a son is born into the family and he says then the father gives the son a tutor a razor to teach him and he tries to instill into that child the nature of the father to where he can run the business to do the things etc and he comes to the point that he can be trusted all right and then see Paul then does a marvelous point because as I said this morning I emphasize this point that there is no third stage of adoption in the Old Testament there's not something that you go on to it stops there it stops it has the sonship and then it has the tutor and the manifestation than the time but then it this kind of stops because that's what it stopping all right but when Paul comes to the New Testament he uses that as a background looking at it and he said okay he brings out adoption has to be in the Sun coming into the family and that's the new birth right the new birth you come into the family of God by the new birth then you have your tutor our trainer which is the Holy Ghost to teach you these things and it brings you to a place to where you can call it sonship which means that the Sun is getting more than nature of the father and it's coming into what God has wanted he wants us to be all right then he brings it in to that as manifestation there from Romans 8 that he brings the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God to her that they can have God's nature his ways his authority all of the things but then there's more to it and Paul sums it up as we will bring into 20/20 third verse of Romans 8 there - where he covers then that it's Paul says the adoption to wit the redemption of the body see he's picked that Old Testament point up into a higher order and bring in clearer understanding of what it means for us but then he's bringing it to the redemption of the body because that's the one thing that we need and that's what man has always missed I'm I'm not throwing awful nobody's doctor and their ideas or denominations or whatever that's them but they just didn't have the understanding now some of them taught about these things we talked about adoption in the Baptist Church we had things we had Studies on adoption in the Baptist Church all right we had some things we understood but yet we couldn't bring it out clearly it's you know in other words it never went to where we went this morning where we go this morning when it brought to a point of what that it come to the adoption to wit the redemption of the body to understand the redeeming of this body now see that's contrary to denominationalism and high for the message isms now if that's wrong for me to say it that way I'm just saying it most of the people this message believe you're gonna get a new body now you wouldn't think that would still be when after all the prophet has said that it's this body redeemed he already taught this body redeemed not gets you a new one will see us in the denominations I'm serious not making no joke but we believe that the Holy Ghost was enough to save us but we just didn't bring him as enough in him to be able to regain these bodies because I got a smoke I've got a drink I got a - I got a do you know he all tied up in in life and you see and I can't help that well the Bible says you can show that so you know but that's the point see then when you come to seeing Paul brings it into a wonderful situation that then he takes it from the sonship part takes it on in to the redeeming of this body the Bible says we'll have a glorious body like unto his body what do you want a new body did Jesus raised in a different body or was it the same body that went down now according to my Bob well he came forth with no offense in his hand I mean that's according to the Bible then he had to nail friends he didn't have a new body he had that body made new and that's what I want I don't want another body I've enjoyed this little guy living you know I think he's the best-looking fellas in the country and my wife all agree we in secret but think about it now see we were the adoption that he's bringing there was nothing to show in that Old Testament about redeeming this body why are you with me then I'm trying to make the point of the message to relate it in and I try to tie each service together see there was nothing back there talking about this it would always gonna get a new gonna get a new C even when you come in to the New Testament Paul and him understood we was not going to get a new body but they lost that understanding down through the ages and come out with that we're going to get a new body well why would we want a new body why would we want a different body from what we live in that wouldn't be anything that's not Redemption that's replacement you say well I believe in Redemption well but I'm gonna get me a new body you know I got smoking cigarettes I gotta I can't stand without all you understand there's a lot to the Bible did we get it clear and bring out a lot of points to where that we would understand see when that then it's the redemption of this body that you and I are concerned with I'm not concerned right now with the rapture I'm not well don't you want to go to heaven what cause according to my understanding of the Bible wherever God is is where I want to be well I thought he was right here I thought he was here living in his people well why do I want to go to heaven he's not there he's in these people down here ain't it glorious that one day we'll finish the whole thing up right here you mean out of it don't you think feel glorious about that out of the universe of it is of all of the stuff the moon the planets the things that are that God chose this to be the center of the universe and we're going to live right here we're not going to live somewheres else we're not going to Pluto Mars or whatever we're gonna be right here because this is where we come from that's where our bodies come from our bodies come out of this earth right why would we want to go to another I'll get on one thought like that and it is it gets me because you know it gets me because people don't see the simplicity of the truth but it gets me to think of the joy that we can have about what we do see all right so then are you following me now this morning we were doing that the child born into the family tops the baptism with the Holy Ghost that you receive through Jesus Christ all right then sonship comes into view in the Old Testament as the son is brought up through the nature and the things of the father until a time of his inheritance rights are his doing that Bar Mitzvah things you know the son of so-and-so is what it means we'll give you the definitions a lot of times I can't pronounce the words but but that's alright let's see it comes to that position but then it broke off back there because there was no way to it was not even way there to talk about redemption as to understand now they were saying said in the Bible because that's what we're gonna get to see adoption is a mystery we're ready to defeasance it's a mystery you know what a mystery is something that's not understood is that a good definition for a mystery something that's not fully understood is mysterious well I see there was nobody in the Old Testament could bring out the mystery and now the disciples when they begin Paul is bringing this out he's bringing out the mystery we read it there in Ephesians the mystery of adoption alright now watch this about a dispensational parties we talk about see and you'll see one brother branham would one time say you didn't believe in a dispensation or tell anyone see I believe in a dispensation that contains all of the things of adoption if it's going to be anodized it's going to be a dispensation of adoption then that means everything about redemptive plan is included in that dispensation justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth bringing you up through the body of Christ bringing you out through the statue of a perfect man bringing you to sonship all of it is in that dispensation and that's Hebrews 13:8 it never changes so Fred wrote said I believe in dispensation if we're reading it but then when he would say I don't believe in the dispensation would be for you to go partner on something and break off and not put it all together see if you can't put it all together it's not a dispensation it's a split condition then I'll be the way to say it but that's what it is it's not a dispensation a dispensation is really a time to that you know you can call it into the you know I've looked it up so go ahead and you look it up and you'll see it's a dispensation can go to leadership it can go to you know ministries and and things like that but I like the point of this putting it in plain language the dispensation is a time that's why I chose please est because our thinking on day and I thought what would I put there and it just Ecclesiastes says the time - not a time for a time - because that way you got Hebrews 13:8 see this that we're talking about now over the dispensation and going to bring in to talk about the adoption system you realize what I'm getting at the disciples had this but they didn't have the redemption of the body you know what I mean they didn't have that that to take it on to the change they had to understand him Paul had to understand him but the Lord would descend from heaven with a shout he had to understand it but he never reached that position he's in the grave today the Apostle Paul is in the grave today waiting on you and I'll corner Hebrews 11:40 that they without us cannot be made perfect he's waiting all of those people are waiting awaiting a time - not a time for that would be something you look out tires well we'll get out that one of these days well we will find it out there or well we we've done went through it back you under you remember the story now we're not looking back we're not looking forward we're trying to look around exactly where we are now and where we are now standing in the most glorious to me the most glorious time that has ever been in this world to me is right now a time to understand the redemption of the body not have to depend upon the fact that it will go by the grave and have to come out that's why I'm saying I want to go I don't look for the rapture well because my Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first so I'm looking for the resurrection the resurrection is my next out of mind a time - and that's hide together where we can stay in the whole thing's all right get it you know what I'm talking about the child may be heir of all things but not able to claim anything in the right of what it's to be don't go out and and hand your kids the key to the car right wait until they grow up then after they grow up you set down the side of them and you say that is a break that stops it that is a gas that moves it don't swap them and so if you do you get it you know all right I'm a secret Amish I'm a kid but dead serious right you don't trust a child with those things you wait until they grow up and see now you've heard the Prophet sit like this he said people will take a person off of the band floor we're playing the guitar and worldly music said the next day they'll have him in the pulpit preaching he said you don't do that you don't put it out of it as I was saying this morning you had no novice writing the word tell me one novice show me one child writing the Gospels no you have someone who has grown to maturity that knows what they mean and that's a wonderful appalled that Paul had already these background behind him the background of of the scriptures I thank God you can say what you want to about Enza I thank God for my background because in my background we studied things we just didn't play around we studied things I didn't believe in it I couldn't explain how the body part was but I didn't necessarily believe was gonna get something different you know I couldn't explain it there's a lot of that stuff I couldn't explain but I at least had some knowledge or thinking I don't you you might say that's God I don't I'm old denomination has taught me wrong they didn't teach you no more than what you what you wanted to be taught don't blame them you remember the other day when I bring brother Branham says they're denominations with a schoolmaster did you ever any of you go home and look that up he said the denomination's was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ a teacher a tutor a razor boy they engraved me they taught me wrong well what about now yeah all right but now listen a dispensation is like a time and the problem we think of it is we want to make it this way let it stop I don't believe that is why I believe ready run didn't believe in that well he didn't believe in the dispensation where something goes off and stops he believed in it continually opening up I believe that the gospel cause Paul spoke of a dispensation of the gospel that was given unto him and we know that's true because the Gentiles were Paul was given to the Gentiles to bring the Word of God so you could say the dispensation of the Gentiles was in its leadership by the Apostle Paul to bring forth the word okay then bringing it to that point to everything there is a season all right so let's hold that in the dispensation as he says first Corinthians 9 17 said a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me Ephesians 1 and 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather in one all things in Christ seasons I guess it's two and thirty two or three and three and two if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you the Gentiles wherever I am made a minister Colossians 1 according to the dispensation of God which is given to each one of us to fulfill the word the a dispensation of time a situation ra is something that's to happen at that point to be able to you to be able to follow into that line and come out of that with the right understanding okay now trying to get to the point a dispensation because the cleese ESDS is is explaining that there's a time to not far there's a time to all things all right a point a situation something did sure to come to all right now think about these things the world we ended up this morning talking about the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God from Hebrews 8 about 2021 right in there all right talking about the time of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God that the whole world is groaning waiting right the whole world is groaning way to the corner Romans there for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for a time that the children can come to the position to realize who they are and what we're doing here you realize we're here to finish this up if not what's going to finish it I'm you know I'm not throwing no slimes throwing it straight like it is what's gonna finish it you say well it's this well alright I still waiting on me and you because that can't come till this comes you understand why is that runs a dispensation buddies no they cannot become something over here until this here is made manifest for that to be able to build on that's Hebrews 13 it has to keep unfolding and that prophet as he would try to bring forth to you and I the message of the last days in the dispensation of bread you know there was even a dispensation of John the Baptist you know all of those things has disciplines our time a time to that John the Baptist was to come on the scene and bring his message there was a dispensation from Malachi for Luke seventeen thirty revelations ten seven as to all of that that would come in our day and our time to turn the hearts back the things that are said in the scripture but not are we going to just stop because we look at it now and say well that's fifty years ago did it stop you don't believe in Hebrews 13:8 if it did gonna put it that play you say well it's just over with hearing or whether you're not listening that's not a time to you got to town for something and that's gonna mess you up see because we're living in a dispensation now remember my point a minute ago then a dispensation means one thing the anything that is to be revealed into that period of time as part of that dispensation all right now listen is I'm trying to get it let's let's pick up the Prophet and read just a little bit this afternoon because I we all know who who met what God sent to us to believe in what would try to Caprice and teach that God sent a prophet to the last days all right so go ahead go ahead number two we've done covered number one talking about a sonship go ahead to number two on adoption you believe in dispensation Bible said so in the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time there's been a dispensation of well there was a know what is fullness of time when time is fulfilled that simple what's the fullness of time when time is fulfilled when a dispensation comes to closing out of that situation all right listen but if the fullness of time there's been a dispensation of well there was a dispensation of the Mosaic law there was a dispensation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there's a dispensation of church organization there's dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit now father each one and listen now now the dispensation of adoption all right now is the dispensation of adoption now this is not the dispensation of John the Baptist yet that fulfilled its day and we wouldn't be here hadn't that not come right so he still Hebrews 13:8 now listen there's a dispensation without pouring of the Holy Spirit that was the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting groaning and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what is that fullness of time when the Dead rises when sickness ceases when all there are ceases to grown the fullness of the dispensation of time now he's explaining what's going to bring time to an end well it's just gone quit Mike watch this quit it no what is the dispensation when it is fulfilled when time is fulfilled there was a time for John the Baptist that was fulfilled there was the time of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost right that was fulfilled that doesn't mean the Holy Ghost can't fall on us now right now saying that it's all in code but now is the dispensation of adoption all right now then our concern should be of adoption to find out about adoption that should be our major concern if this is the time that that is to take place see now how simple of what we were talking about this morning Paul could understand it and bring it out the child born into the family then the child to dirt train which as far as Paul could go then he steps into bringing his message or his thoughts from what he was saying and he starts taking it to deeper things taking it to the resurrection taking it to the change of the body do you understand what I mean it's all will be involved in it you know what's involved you know what a dispensation of adoption would be then now listen what would be dispensation of adoption and you'll see it covers all the way back comes all the way down to where we have the dispensation of adoption would cover justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth all right then the tutoring and the training all the way down it would cover the ages and their time because they were in the dispensation they just didn't have it to understand Paul and him understood adoption that's my point we looking like that well well we don't understand adoption that don't mean Paul isn't it I'm reading it to you Paul them understood adoption Peter explained it as the statue of a perfect man Paul explains it as adoption and the stages and what to be and see thing that's where our thoughts should be now on adoption well I don't want to know about that the dogs you know I just don't think that's important okay it ain't important enough for you to go and change the body that's fine if it ain't important enough for the resurrection that's fine you won't make it anyway that blunt the plain enough goes getting interesting something you're not gonna try let's see the bride should be interested we should be concerned about what these things are or what it is to be these or what they are well you just make it to be some kind of a mystery I didn't say that your prophet did that it was a mystery so let's continue to go on the a dispensation of adoption what the world's groaning the world groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God but in the dispensation of the fullness of time then we'll get to that in on the next lesson because when something comes to a fullness of times it means it is there in manifestation it means it's the dark so now what's my point not back not forward what's going on now brother branham what is this age that we're in we're not in the dispensation of John the Baptist we're not in the Mosaic law dispensation we're not into those disciplines that we're not even in the dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that would have come on the day of Pentecost and then coming the last days to Azusa streets and nothing where we at he said we're in the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting ruining when the time of the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what about a church but you see we've nearly died it around played around and won't won't study the message we won't be concerned with the message and believing it see you said brother tell you we know and you have the answer to this you have answer to the only answers I have is what that prophet said and you come and show me where I don't answer the cording to the Prophet that's that's where I will just sit down right there I'm not bragging I'm just telling you what I've tried my best to do let me answer you something to my own thoughts when all I got to do is read the Prophet you have been around with brother mogul was here when brother moat said brother Brown believed in one God he picked up the book and read it off the page he was hearing for certain what it was that's why I have this I was hearing here while back there's certain place that the church had started putting theirs up it would look praise God if that's you know if it's what it is we all wanna well cuz that's what I believe in alright and look what he says that's what I said you think he covers the dispensation let's go to number three try to get a point the number three which is questions and answers in 57 now the Gentiles now what's theirs yet left three and a half years into the Jews okay and Jesus said to the city of Jerusalem will be trodden by the Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation now you people that don't believe in dispensation lets you what about that till the Gentile dispensation would be finished and when the Gentile dispensation is finished the time of the Gentiles is finished what are you saying what's he doing he's telling you that there's a dispensation for all things as a dispensation or a time and once that's full filled and it moves on into something else okay going to the next one I like this one could I like him all over them tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now now what about the Apostle Paul in him you don't think they were manifestations you don't think he thought that you don't think he didn't know that what's the difference this is the dispensation are the redemption of the body this is the time this feller is involved not to try to get a new one as I said because that's what we were taught see don't get me a new body no that's not according to scriptures when Jesus raised he had nail prints in his hands that's Bible ingredient and I didn't know what said that well good you'll go read it that's tricks of the trade what to try to get you to read you say well brother Dale I don't know whether that's right or not we'll go read and compromise you know that's what I like do that way we can get to a whole thing we want to be outside of this time and there when were there ever a time in the history this that manifests benefits the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation one before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all all the Old Testament on down through there there couldn't have been manifestation now see there couldn't be no baptism with the Holy Ghost until the Holy Ghost came on the dip in cause it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming down and shaping up to a head stir to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it would join him and his shirt together all right is that's what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be that they're supposed to be a group of people and I'm not the one I'm just playing okay you say brother branham done all that now show me where he did when he said it would come in these men I'm not no argument no argument with nobody cause it ain't gonna help nothing it's just plain truth I believe he was part of that I believe he was one that brought the message to you and I rock praise God without that him we wouldn't be nowhere but if we do sit down you're not in the dispensation of adoption did you sit down and and peter-patter around and play go to church and try to be good all that's well and good but Alcoholics Anonymous will make you a good person right that's their goal is to make you a good person it's not my goal to try to make you a good person you don't want me to be good no kind of stopping pause no I don't want you to be good now everybody that's been here for ten years knows what the answer that is not done to the stranger or not I don't want you to be a good person I want you to get born again that'll take care of the whole thing if you get born again it'll take care of whether you good or not it'll change our whole lives and fit together and we'll come out of it with the right attitudes and things and be in Christ of what he wants us to be because it just try to get you to be good for me that wasn't no good mm-hmm all right but this come on church waiting the redemption of the body go ahead to number six what was all that ghost giving far he said what is it he's pouring out his spirit he's explaining it coming down how the it would be said then those who are resting out younger in the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you you mean God's waiting on me well that's what he said you want to race that out God's waiting on you and me he's wanting to see what we're gonna do what do you think well here fifty years after going with the Prophet going into war 60 now why cause he's trying us he's trying us to see what we're gonna do right he's tried to give us the tutor the trainer at a time and try to give us the nature the baptism the whole try to do it now he's waiting on you and me wait no it's the one look how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you okay the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raise the dead and we go in the rapture now do you do you believe that never be fulfilled I believe it will I've always looked for it I believe it will if I didn't believe it would I would I really be messed up on my dispensation what I'd be trying to find out what I need to believe I believe God's waiting on me and you he's letting this thing get bad he's gonna let it get real bad because he's waiting to see what we'll do he sent it to according to scripture two tries what should we do well you know what in the message what they're doing they're running here and they're running there and this groups going there and that groups going - that's their business I'm just saying they're running all over the country trying to find something instead of just sitting down and listen to the message and just leave it to the the message has the answer to all the time that were waiting on us to where God can pour into us his fullness brother Branham I didn't say it brother Brennan said that the fullness of the Godhead bodily would be in the bride hey now brother Dale that's getting a little bit too strong now you trying to make us God ain't making us God we are God we're the offspring of God were the children of God what's the problem well you just didn't explain that to start with now I got a better idea huh what you see what around said to Godhead is not complete without you do you need those quotes we've given them over and over the brothers in the back and find them for let's see do we believe that we're trying to find a life seed come on I'm not against that I'm for it we send out money we send mission earth we send off we go we do all kind of things to find the last one that we believe in it but that ain't what I'm looking for because one thing for certain when the last one is found according to my understanding and I'm hoping for you to correctly according to my understanding that person must come to maturity line you find last person I'll do my best try to preach the word to get them to a maturity they'll mean I ain't hunting them I'm just answering the question you find a person we'll do our best to find something to teach that person the ability cuz we got to come to a place because the world's waiting on you and me waiting God's trying to place his church go ahead number seven pull up number seven I get to reading over here and I quit enough don't think about it's that right waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there is my spirit flowing freely there it is that I can work here get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting taking him out of here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel I'm gonna take these back up in the next message what's it gonna be some quote don't you think that's what God done with brother branham don't you think he took him out to herself by self and visited him with an angel and giving the word for you and I well now he's bringing it to the individual so that's where you think without all that ain't okay go ahead I can play seaman Dobson placing manifest and taking him out here to put a ceremony on it visit him with an angel tell him something now he's told the truth and if he's just making you making something it won't work no no that that won't work we've had a lot of that but I mean but I mean manifestations of sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends him out and then he goes forth and what he says is truth right listen God sends him out now what was thought of randoms definition of how that Jesus was sent are you listening the rest of Jesus was sin but what was his definition how did he define that that took place then he puts it right to the church and how does the church sin get him quiet you listen you want to know what the Prophet had to say he said the way God sent him he went in him well you just got so bumfuzzled my father on what God went in him Jesus and God was a self same person are we done messed up and the God had somewhere till he seen him he went in him he sent the church out on the day of Pentecost he went in the church those disciples was Christ made manifest Paul said it's not either living for Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of son of God God came down and went in him how is it right now if you got the baptism when the Holy Ghost tonight then God came down met with you and your soul giving you eternal life and sent you because he goes in you I think that it makes me understand a little bit take them out and visit it tell him something profit goes out in Arizona and God sent him right Angels comes down and watch we got to get it real close to understand angels come down and visit a prophet this has been argued ever since I've been in the message of what did they tell him either he told you they did not tell him nothing he won't that said they told him to come back to Jeffersonville and it would be told him later what would it be God sent to man anyone any that's what I look at I look at it all to see you know Christ living in me and you God waiting to get to church in order he's waiting on you and I made grant his blessings let's go to number nine then we'll get this point they said he made known to us the mystery and I get the spirit he said own you just watch that run-through and I got to running he's running his thought - I thought mystery how mysterious in the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then back over into the New Testament taught something together see the mystery of his company great the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together remember it cannot be taught in any seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world or you read waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the word manifest look it up and get home see what lean manifest means to make known look it up he needs to make known because that's what God wants he wants it to be make known he wants himself to me be known it's a mystery the mystery is to adopt us there's going to be a people that will come to fulfill in their dispensation all things pertaining to adoption and the last of all is the redemption of these bodies what are you looking forward to brother Dale I'm looking forward to the redemption of these bodies they said when will this take place I've got them here he said in the resurrection waiting on a people that can understand now we're gonna tap something and then back up okay the headstone has not come yet that's what your prophet says all right now I've taught you deny believe it what is the headstone to the church the fully revealed Word of God which is the opening of those seven seals that prophet went west came back east the angels met him daily and he brought the seals there was the headstone to the church but one you won't read Greer's Almanac I read this book of that book of study all these other time when it's been told to you your very headstone is the Word of God and then you don't want to read it or you won't read it you won't take your time at least oh brother I out here call me up sometime I'll be on something like I said what should I read I said we'll read this this is this cuz that's kind of where my thinking is that well it's a mystery God's mystery is that he's going to redeem us do you listening this early the mystery of God in the last days is the fact that he's going to redeem a people he's not going to give us a new body it's not going to go through things like that it's going to be a Redemption and the world is waiting on you and I to manifest our make that known the Prophet made it known he brought us the word we're not looking for another messenger to come somewhere we're in the dispensation now listen to what I'm talking about that dispensation I'm gonna state it the best way I can for our understanding when the Prophet began to bring the word about adoption there was the beginning of the mystery of adoption when he begin to bring it out cause nobody brought it out before oh yeah they spoke about this or spoke about that like I said we spoke with some of these things but when he began to say what did he say one day he said when you begin to say I and my father are one and these other things he said them and denominations will swing together well we've always looked for the denomination to swim together why don't we start saying I and my father one that's what the Prophet said yeah but we can't do it we can't do that until he gives it to us uh-huh ain't foolish sure but I am one time this message when it began to open to the Prophet you started a dispensation of adoption he was back there in 55 and earlier talking about adoption the biggest portion of his message is Jiri him and things was back in the 50s he began to try to explain that and he said that's where you Pentecostals failed see they think about not listening to him as to what he was explaining that you must come to manifestation you must come to adoption you must come really instead of thinking you got it all and that's why I warn every year you and all of us never become the relaxed in Zion yeah always be concerned and worried and and looking forward I look forward he stay I like what Billy Graham said he said Athena I look for him today or something of my perforation wrong pretty close he said if he don't come today Cynthia boned tomorrow he's a good I look for what do we look for we're waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when that's a prophecy in it at the first resurrection when will this take place at the first resurrection we're watching for the fullness waiting for the fullness reduction this will take place when the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are we'll have a body like unto his glorious body we'll see him as the years why called we be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like he is a glorious purified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more in these earthly Tabernacles which we now grown in we're waiting for the earnest that earnest for the salvation fully in its fullness in fullness to come but now in these Tabernacles will play we have something that tells us that we have raised up so far amen now you get the last point something has happened if you have the new birth something has happened to tell you what's going on if you're listening we're in the days of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God what are we waiting on the Bible said he's waiting on us it doesn't say we're waiting on him right are we waiting on God oh yeah we're right no need to manifest this and that nature we're waiting on it that way but really he's waiting on us do you realize what that means he's waiting on us what if these waiting on you to call for what these waiting on you to do what are you gonna do like I say in this morning we've seen the dead raised we've seen this thick healed what these waiting on meaning you to call for it what are you gonna do you got a dead man laying on the back of a tractor and you're looking at him in and on to the robot wait said daddy's dead wait out in the woods working on deer hunting I am no way for cellphones wouldn't work no nothing he's dead he's deep I just looked down at him and I said ragdoll his role the doctor said yes I am I'll take you to his house and he'll tell you he was dead I've heard his testimony to sinner's they said this land here prayed for me when I was dead what do we wait now have you not seen enough healings and signs in vain to show and we not seen enough of the Word of God to at least to be able to say we're right here in the middle of it I look forward he stay to see what God is going to do but what if he's waiting on you come on musician what if he's waiting on you well I don't have nothing nobody said anybody had anything it's all in him we give him the honor to glory I got enough sense to know I could stood there and hollered and screamed all day long the man would have been buried and I could have still been hollering and screaming I stood in a hospital one day and looked out a window I was hired to pray for a lady I looked out a window the lady's sister-in-law I believe I'll get it Robin huh she said the deal is it's gonna ever spoke to you anything about her I said no ma'am except one thing she's not gonna live he said nothing yes she's not gonna live cuz that's what he showed me two years a few times later the husband would come into a situation there and was on death bed and she was called me as God told you that I said no I told you okay but I said I've got to say that by His stripes he's healed by the stripes of God he's healed and he's gonna live I've got to say that until the day comes that you called me and tell me that then he's already dead I said I can't say nothing else she said couldn't we pray for him to go ahead and die I said no because he was in sick start with you know horrible shape so wouldn't it be humane I said no but I said when you call me and tell me he's dead I'll tell the world he dead she called me one day and only listen Church why can't we just take what we see and speak it and we won't sure Richard the family they wanted me to go and pray for their daddy I wanted to do but when I got there I couldn't find nothing I prayed I couldn't find that oh I could pray sure and I can believe but I didn't pray that way you know I couldn't I couldn't find the words and I couldn't I turned as I did before looks out the window didn't say nothing didn't pray this simply had to thought because the man had had a stroke and would his right arm right side he couldn't move all of us know about it he's been that way for years a few years with his rods right side he couldn't move we stood and looked at him and prayed and talked and I said Lord wouldn't it be something that he just come out of this and that other side start working he saw no he just heating they'd rather come on your God ain't great mine is you know what he's doing now moving both arms it'd be a great dress great miracle to look at the man lay entire a few weeks ago for us to look at him and seeing and the doctor said he's no way for him to live no and yet there he is today both arms moving he's wanting to go home he wants a hamburger he's he's talking he's look they took him off today or yesterday when Friday they took him off the machine you know he's still with oxygen right but but they took the ventilator type of thing off of him a man that I had no hopes no hopes but now he's moving in the right side she hadn't moved in years why can't we say thank you God that we have a who pregnant I've told you the other day we get into all of that junk who prayed the prior what have you worried about who prayed the priors whether or not the prayers answered it's not who prayed to pry when these little kids can pray God can hear them and answer their prayers as quick as he can here are matter of fact you probably hear them quicker but you see don't try to be in the future and don't try to live in the past live right where we at now regarding the Pais okay great Oh God in the future great don't God now where he can live in you and me and manifest itself through us and pray and thank him for being what he is I couldn't walk through the house at night just they said Lord thank you just be what's going so I'll just go down the line you know I'll go down the seats call your name and just say Lord be which one so be blessed that's just my way to do it I'm not a prayer warrior I've never been that I appreciate those that are I've been with brothers that could pray two hours without stopping I prayed 10-15 minutes get up and sit down read my Bible nice thing that's just well but I all seen you minutes for a few brothers and I know that rely thank you well what about it where are you living at what did I tell you to start with our thought was gonna be not a pice not a future where we are what a dispensation of adoption has been going on now since the Prophet came on the scene it started a dispensation of an option it didn't end when the Prophet went off the same it went in to word a manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God would call for it what can't you do listening well we got brother page 161 PFF they were just they ended this anybody have a need [Music] nations are breaking it shreds awakening sign that the
