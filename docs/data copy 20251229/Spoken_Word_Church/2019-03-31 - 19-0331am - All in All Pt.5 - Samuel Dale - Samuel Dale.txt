and you know so go to Colossians where we've been reading and first Corinthians now remember the Bible study this coming Saturday remember that ring with the spring festival will be the 13th so remember these you know and keep everything in mind the Lord willing Wade will be we're gonna put him back into rotation and get him back in and with we like for him to go other place and preach we would like him to preach here so he's going to minister this evening and try to give us a report from all of the things and then if he don't finish he's just going over to Wednesday night and finish up them and take care of it okay all right so remember these announcement any other announcement then we're all of the sick ones among us there's many many sicknesses many things you know we don't have to accept the fact that we're getting older but that is a fact and it's happening but all we got to do is just keep saying by stripes I'm healed saying thank you Lord for it and I believe it'll just be made manifest don't you all right Colossians 3 in first corinthians father we thank you for this day and we thank you for your love your grace your kindness thank you for you we just ask you now that you'd come among this Lord and that you would first cleanse us from all sin and unrighteousness to make us all worthy for you to come into our presence and to dwell with each one of us and we ask you to help us remember the sick ones among us just touch each one of these lords that are having to view in and all we thank you for that opportunity that things can be done like that but we don't or in the fact that we can use it we just use it for your glory so we ask you to guide each one of us in this have your way forgive our sins most of all cause that's what we want to be covered and be completing you keep us now as we try to speak your word and try to answer questions and things Lord and you just have your way in Jesus name Amen so we'll just read the scriptures we don't because it was on the par but we'll go to Colossians 3 and we'll just pick up verse 10 and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him see that's Genesis 1 right ok where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian Cynthia bond they're free but Christ is all and in all they men so let's go over down to Corinthians where we've been reading from we'll go to verse 15 chapter 15 verse 26 well I stood enemy that shall be destroyed his death for he has put all things under his feet but when he said to all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which is which did put all things under him in other words this manifest he is complete he's done he's doing it is what he's doing not what we're doing okay and why all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we covered this past Wednesday and bringing forth you know what we've been trying I thought we would try to get it to an end on that but really what it's done is just unfolded to more of the same thing but it won't be the same point so we'll be picking up in moving on you know into that as we go along and you'll see how I believe the Lord willing that it ties together you that how the note for this morning put them up and keep them for next week because that way we won't have to make no new ones and that way we'll give you a whole week that you can read you can figure out what I'm gonna try to say you know all of that so just do it that way alright so let's just get into thought we have some questions to do on another part that I'll wait till later to try to cover that but this is just specifically to the time right where we were Wednesday in trying to minister you know in all an hour I wish you would listen to that message again not a time that good of a minister but if you can retain all the things I said in that message Wednesday night by listening one time are you in a hurry I can even though I said it that's a good way of saying it well we got a couple of questions it would be related right into the area and see they didn't a person facing the knows question didn't know that I had this top part of my notes for this morning to make sure and Express something so it's the very thing that I have written down you know to work in alright question number one in the new heaven and new earth there's all three sons named come to an end like you've got son of God son of man son of David so that God will be all and in all all right now I'm like this even though I'll cover it in a minute even though we would talk about maybe redemption being over or this being done or that being done remember you will never forget I don't believe in eternity that you'll ever forget of his name here or anything Redemption all right because see I believe when we get diary list unfold more of the redemption but it'll still be that we'll know that he was the son of God son of man son of David we'll still know that but it'll be increased to give us better understanding of you know what it is it's not to do away it really means where it says that we read you know the son himself shall become subject he didn't do away see if you followed the way I was expressing it in the way the Prophet was bringing it said the kingdom that Jesus would give to the father all right see that something has to transport fire transpire into that do it but how did he say that it does he said God the Father would hover over the son in other words become one and to me it's the same thing as I said maybe we need to get in anointed one Nkosi I've seen that's what happened I believe that's what happened there on the River Jordan that people are so confused about to put them it's very simple he was born Lord to Christ he was Almighty God he didn't become God at the River Jordan he became anointed all right he didn't become the Messiah he became the Anointed Messiah all right see then that makes him too worth it it's just unfolding see when we get dire we won't forget this when I try to illustrate it I don't believe it'll be a a father over here or son over here and the Holy Ghost fluttering here anything like that I believe we'll see Jesus and know he is Almighty God because that was what he said he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well right what does the father look like the son what if the son looked like the father that's sensible that's not uh you know it's not a point something hard to understand it's just sensible it's plain language to say the that what happens each one of those manifestations God has many manifestations all right see he's a road to sharing the lily the valley the bright and Morning Star none of that will be forgotten or done away with yeah it'll never be it won't be none of that will be done away with all of it just keeps you what would you call it it keeps spreading out more all right becoming greater in our understanding many manifestations let's see you know I mean I'm at the house and and you know me and nany weird are at the house by ourselves well see you'd say well only you ain't nothing but a husband no as long as I have children there somewhere there's no one in thinking about me it's being a father what's in it she calls me daddy I call her mama you know it's not the point of trying to to be it's the point of understanding who we are you know we follow that point you know you know and see it'll never be don't ever think about God anything in God being done away with because if if you could do away with God how you know it just don't work okay so think of that as the increase brother mote had a way of expressing like God you know we think of God as as being like an apple you know you cut it up brother I'm talking about you your your the way you try to express it and and brother Moe had it like this he said you take an apple you cut it up and you give it out where you just run out of pieces well you've run out of God but that's incorrect see if you're gonna take the Apple you cut to pieces hand it out and more grows back that Apple keeps getting bigger and bigger instead of running out see that's that's the way God does things because his is entirely different from than the way we do things because he can do it he's increasing in that are decreasing and let's see what was that word that thinking what are you expanding himself yeah that's been about 50 some years ago yeah he preached don't expanding himself alright see if this keeps unfolding unfolding unfolding so that it's not doing away in other words will be sitting there in the future home with him but will know him as this or that or the other but that was the pointed I wrote down do you realize in the future of home that's why me that's why the scripture said that God may be all and in all or all in all not now we covered it to where you wouldn't understand it doesn't mean everybody in the world's got the Holy Ghost now we know better than that they don't mean all in all like that well everybody's going to be saved because the Bible said God is all in all no not that away but remember you know brother Donnie had asked me a little bit yesterday on something just remember this point this is the best way I can comprehend what will take place when we leave this world and going on into the millennium in the future home and thing is to think about there is a bride all right and that's what it's talking about that God may be all and in all he's going to be in the bride because he's going to give her eternal life in their soul right here right all right but now what about those that are given eternal life what about the Jews what about the the foolish virgins what about those there'll be people be given eternal life but now the eternal life that's given to them is an impartation Adam it was imparted to Adam he turn a life Adam never had a new birth because he wouldn't know a new Burt in the Old Testament so you didn't have that away so Adam was imparted you know eternal life see the foolish virgins and people like that to choose all who ever get eternal life you know after this world I'll put it that way it will be an impartation seeing an impartation is not a birth so do you see the difference in the bride and who she is we are his children where his out spring we are him made manifest in another form called a bride all right see that's not it just an impartation that's something that you receive yes but in God before the world ever begun he already knew who is going to receive it he already knew what would take place within the all and all see you said well it's just a bride no it's not just a ride no oh we'll get to it cuz I got the notes for the next message coming on in the future home do you realize in the future home that the bride can live in the city other people can't live in the city but now if they are now here's the wording if they are redeemed if they get eternal life that is the eternal life of God but what's the difference between them what's the difference between the ones that are nations and the thing and the bride it's what it is it's the way it comes the bride is part of him then remember what we gave from brother Branham God is not complete runaround sin without you you realize if the bride is and the prophet said it she is the fullness of the Godhead bodily that's not talking about every person in the world I told about the Bride of Christ all right see then when it says the all and all you've got to put that on to first the bride and she gets eternal life making her the offspring of God we see the foolish virgins they only go if the father's they can go is sanctification they can't go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right see there will be people giving eternal life I'll think about it people will give an eternal life which would be more because they would remember there was Nina representing the rapture and Noah represented foolish virgins and the things see that's eight times more of them so there'd be a whole lot more people giving eternal life somewhere else down the road we're not concerned with that we get eternal life here that's what makes us the bride the greatest the Jews can be to come back into the way that it's supposed to be still they will never be the bride now people out of the Jews people out of the nations that can be part of the Bride of Christ right all right BC one gamma when you say all in all look who's talking about in Colossians it plainly tells you who is talking about universe did you catch that and now put on the new man who's this the born-again Christian which is the is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him goes all the way back to Genesis the new creation so then you you understand what I'm saying then when you say all in all look who's talking about you remember the story I Ellis trait it over and over why are you out by doing it but still at least you ought to get to pulling little run said you know we're so mixed up in our language do we we can't understand what say it and say you say board that can be a lot of different words but if you explain what you're talking about the board can be that board can be on different words but if you say come on board stand on this board and I'm bored with you we'll see you before and the after has explained what you're talking about so is it with the scriptures in the scriptures it will explain what is talking about if you'll read what it's talking to the context it's in our who's it talking to so then the all and all think it's bride all right you got that that's a group of people that's a special designation of himself that says in the church age book alright they receive eternal life here at the new birth but these others is going to receive eternal life later alright see then they can be the all in all as to me is why the Bible says it like that what's the difference in eternal life in you are the eternal life given to a foolish the eternal life is society right if she turn alive but it's the difference in who it is - and the people it's - alright so then when you're looking at it see all right in the new heaven and new earth there's all three suns come to an end so God something man some David so that God will be all in all oh they don't come to an end there's still manifestations they're still taking things taking place when you and I walk off of this earth right 144,000 is gonna get eternal life right but that don't make them bride they rejected that that's where the prophecy explains these things that we in organized religions we didn't have enough understanding to be able to place it in order but he explains it all right so then that group that gets the eternal life in the bride if you'll be inside the city convinced for later she'd live in the city but those that are given eternal life that are not bride they can't come and live in the city you tell how eternal life there won't be no death no sorrows won't be done to that dark botella they just won't be bribed I mean to me that's that means the whole Bible is unfolded us that we understand all right now watch see then God will be all-in all over the time the future home comes to pies all read it deforms will be completed right all redemptive forms will be completed but it won't do away with the name that's where I differ with the people of the message that's what they're trying to find either trying to find some new name I don't I don't go that route is the name of Jesus gonna be done away with how can it be done away with when you got your kings of the earth that brain girl glory and honor into the city they're still in the point of understanding what takes place don't you thank me and you will be understanding his name may change his name may change you may get a new name all right have no problems but it'll never do away with his all-night me and then he got married all right when we got married she took on a new knight right it didn't change mine it changed hers she got a new knight but did her new name make that something unrelated to me know everything she receives is related to me so what didn't she ever forget my name no you don't do that so the children come along as an increase of my name right she never goes back to her he's increasing by name all right more manifestation in my name grandkids come along more manifestation of my name great grandkids come along more manifestations in my night well then she can call me daddy I'm not her daddy but in the gospel I'm her daddy her father she can have different meanings to that then why are we trying to find some new name because we're trying to find a rabbit out of a hat trick to get us out of here that's the best way I will say it after 50 years looking and what people are trying to do trying to find something that can get them out of here instead of believing the word is here and receiving that word all right what do you follow now listen because they said on here there's no son's name in the new heaven and earth well it doesn't list it in the Bible now it doesn't give a name in the Bible that he changes from Jesus or anything it doesn't do that we go with the Prophet we believe it all right but yours my point about the new name but uh this is where I look at if you're the Bride of Christ now every morning I wake my wife up well what would you do walk in waking life up you know you guys what do you do if you don't wake her up she tell you what I say I say the same thing every morning Dona I don't say Peggy nanny I say Sleeping Beauty wake up see that's something between her and me I don't call you up and say Sleeping Beauty wake up cause I don't have anything to do with anybody else besides me and her now you know what I'm talking about Lisa Nene she's nee nee naw naw naw naw if you've got 1,400 ways of saying Nene but Terence has got a private name for her that he says you know Wade's got a private name for Jim you got a private name for your wife right it's something in relationship to you go write whether if you say sweetheart honey whatever you know it's just see that's what I see about in your name when we get dark the bride in that city the MINIX it's the next week when we get there in that city it'll be a never-ending unfolding of the name of Almighty God and you will never lose the name of Jesus I don't believe that yeah but if he gets a new name you don't need that hey let's reason a little if he gets in your name it only has to do with a pet name for the bride who's them other people don't call it who's in people outside the city that's coming in now who look what are they gonna call me they can't call him the new name because there's no way to pronounce you hey come on they having trouble with JV hates you j vh v you you can't pronounce it let alone getting there yeah I was used to but one of these days we'll get a new name then we'll be changed all right but will it do away with the name of Jesus no we'll always know that he was son of God son of man son of David it's none of Abraham you all here you'll never do away with Alpha and Omega beginning and end you'll never do away it just keep enhancing he keeps unveiling what he really is to each one of us come on I'm glad to see her company come in all right now let's go to part two in the Millennium does Jesus Christ continue to sit on his father's strong a son of David and then takes his own throne in the new heaven and new earth okay now the Father's throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit to the company we're trying to we always say to you when you come one time your visitor two times you're part of us are welcome but we're trying to answer some questions that's why I love brother Branham the message like a deal I gave it to you in the message that I was preaching on brother Branham covers in the Millennium what will take place God will come down in the Millenium hover over that human flesh that we call Jesus and like the anointing that I was talking a minute ago at the River Jordan the anointing didn't make him a different God he just made that manifest right God will be all in all in the Millennium you know why cuz he's already all in all now do you you and me to the bride before the Millenium ever comes he's all in all she understands she knows who he is he's in the only difference between the future home and the millennium is because of the things that were going through in the Millennium he will hover over and show as himself as being one sitting on the throne because he is Father Son and Holy Ghost may manifest as one there's not three guards so in when the Prophet would cover the hovering over the that's in the Millennium Drive son of God son of man son of David son of David is the rightful throne of the Lord Jesus Christ through the promise of the son of David which was the son of David and the natural with Solomon the spiritual son of David is the Lord Jesus Christ all right so he'll set on the throne in the Millennium but God will come down and so engulfed in all ways because remember God is the spirit you can't see he's got to have a form to reveal himself so he comes down in the Millennium but then as something happens we go into a future home and when you do then God becomes all in all he's all in all in the Millennium now listen you'll get the point he's all in all to you and I he's all in all when the Jews receive it he's all in all in the Millennium but remember there'll be people after the Millenium at the white throne that will receive eternal life you agree so then this thing is not finished see there'd be something about him that he can't fully make manifest in the Millennium even though God's it can become so one until we won't look at him and see two or three people running around we will see Jesus and know who he is we'll come riding back into the Millennium according to revelations 19 to live a thousand years here with Jesus Christ and he'll be on the throne of David but he won't be distance son son of David - you and I you'll be the all and all there's still some Redemption left and that's what I've always said everybody wants to do away with this no Ellen if you're going to do it preach it correctly if you're going to give a new name tell me who it's - and how did it that it comes to pious because at the white throne he'll be there but we'll be sitting around him on many throne at the white throne and judging and people will be given eternal life as long as you're dealing with eternal life being given don't try to do away with a nun Jesus come Jesus means Redeemer anybody that ever gets eternal I get sits on the fact of Redeemer did you catch that season in the Millennium will see him as all in all will know who he is what's taking place called he'll be our husband and God can give us a private name that's fine but it won't never be made known to the world the world will always know him the foolish virgins of Juicer always will understand him as Jesus if you're trying to get him a new name just remember it'll only be a pet name that's the best way for me to say it'll be a pet name given between him and her that nobody else you said words the Bible it says will get a name that only we will know I can't tell you people's done that you know in the message I remember one brother you know he he had a lot of problems and a couple of hours but anyhow he wound up one of his wives told him what his new name was well that'd be pretty good for Peggy to tell you my new night hateful arrogant stubborn stupid come on Sarah what do you call it era dummy don't answer keep that quiet okay are you following me see there's a lot to the all and all I didn't have time to explain I was just putting it out in point but I got a question that will help us now to understand that part he's all in all too many groups of people but it takes in the finality in the future home in the finality of the future home dwelling on earth the new city all right see by that time everybody that's ever going to get eternal life will have it okay and by that the all in all will be there because he'll be all in all but that order these understanding to you right now that hey he's my Savior he's my God he's my healer he's my delivery he's my father he's my all and all and he's in all did you catch it is it the white throne there'll be people giving eternal life well the Millennium he can't be fully all in all coz there's something left will be the time to future home come into being the white throne everything's that happened he'll be all and in all the do you understand that he'll be all in all what cuz everybody's gonna have his life right are you following me with time you get to the future home those who have eternal life will be the life of Jesus Christ no matter what parts you put it in foolish virgins choose bride and the way I love it because you get eternal out here you ain't gonna look down on people die right you're gonna realize what God done for you alright now let's get the rest of this part because it they were saying them from the Prophet said it in the this day the scripture is fulfilled says the father strongly still in the Millennium that's right now watch my point that's written I told you these two things to remember Christ the mystery of God revealed brother branham is not explaining the future home the city he's explaining Jesus Christ coming into the millennial reign and he can be all in all in the millennial reign to you and I but they still Parks is to be revealed later though time he comes to the future home then at that time he's all and in all everybody that has eternal life will be part of his own life he said what what that's right we get in here what's the difference between the bride and the 144,000 they get eternal life after we leave out of here right but I don't like them bride foolish virgin gets eternal life that don't make them bride but you just keep on going till one day all is in all all right here's the quotation Jesus came in three names he came in Son of Man which was prophet and that's what he did he proved his ministry by being a prophet we all know that every one of us knows it he never said he was the son of God see Jesus never declared himself to be Sun God he declared himself to be the Son of man read Matthew Mark Luke and John all right he said he was the son of man now today he's the son of God which he he returned back and now he is in the form of the Holy Ghost the unseen person the new birth the Father's throne spirit within us right but yet God the Son of God in the Millennium he sits upon his Father's throne which he'll be son of David God sits on the throne what will you see there it won't be three Thrones that's what I've tried to get you to city that's what I kept asking the question when you get to the future home what do you expect to see I I see by revelation that Jesus is Almighty God is that the way you see it that he's all of God that in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily see that's what I see Jesus is being oh mighty God that's the only name God ever had CJ v8 sphere j vh u is not a name Jehovah it's not a name Jesus is his night well you take Jesus and run it all the way back you can't take your hope and run it all the way back cuz you're gonna run out cuz you're gonna come up to somebody like nice gonna throw Scripture out the Jesus that Jehovah said back there as you call him you know oh he was your over he said by my name Jehovah what I never known so that told you over witnessed some time we were talking to when they're talking about the name of God is Jehovah give them the scripture this is my name drop by my name's your eyes never known there was no way to pronounce that is j vh v j vh u now that's the to putting them together and i'm saying it the way brother Branham says it so you say well it's j vh v is j vh you you won't find j vh v separating from j vh you he's expressing it and see there's no vowels now you got a AEIOU you got a you in it but there's not enough vowels to pronounce the name in the Old Testament even your scholars will tell you that that there's not there was no vowels to pronounce it was j vh v r j vh you really brought around and put some boat together to at the same point he doesn't define it he puts them together j vh v j vh you in the same message alright see because you can't pronounce it then they have that G to a certain way Oh D that did you draw it out and write it out as is saying that that is God but they have no way of pronouncing it and they say before they'll ever write that it's so holy and reverence to them because it represents Almighty God they'll stop lay the pen down and go take a bath come back and then they'll write that night there's no reverence that much but you see then what is it see without brother branham explaining now listen he's explaining Christ the mystery of God revealed that in the Millennium God will be sitting on his throne Jesus the human flesh will what leave what you see but God will be in that flesh because that's who he is God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself all right that's Christ the mystery then he receives the revelation he goes into the future home at a later date and he brains the same scripture that God may be all in all for the future home didn't he knows and sees Christ the mystery he sees the Millenium who do you think you're gonna see end of millennium sitting on the throne are you gonna see three Thrones one for the father one for the son one for them no we don't believe in the Trinity there'll be one throne but who will be on the throne Jesus but you realize who he is by then see we're getting who is here and I am we're supposed to be realizing who he is here that's what's gonna get us dark he's realizing who he is that he is the all and in all he's in ever born-again believer today that has eternal life but that ain't all of his redemptive plan the other other places the Jew the the foolish virgins the different ones it has to be added there'll be things in the Millennium then that are not in the future huh you won't fully bring forth the complete revelation in the Millennium but it's a revelation enough to know who that the Jews will see him sitting on that throne hey listen we're supposed to be seeing him now we've got to wait to the millennium to see Jesus sitting on the on David's throne and realize what's taking place that's to the Jews that's their time the millennium is to the Jews where they're on a honeymoon those Jews will see him as all in all but they'll see that he's already in this group they'll see that he's all in all in his wife then they'll see what happens to them cuz you 144,000 when we leave out of here they get eternal life they're gonna realize right there who they are right here they're going to realize who they are and they'll have to give their life you under 44,000 give their life for the gospel all right they're all killed two witnesses are killed all right seed in the Millennium it would be to the Jews they will be the one that will be trying to understand who he is it ain't gonna be me and you you and me is gonna be able to explain who he is that's what I've told you about it that's why the Bible covers it what is it is even though it's not as they can win it where there be a millennium Temple is equal 40 to 44 will be the Millennium temple built no bill millennium temple there will be no sacrifices they won't be no doing like that no it's there for an explanation all right but in the future home there won't be no temple because the lamb is the temple I'm quoting you scriptures I'm gonna lay in here in front of me revelations read it 21:22 in it there'll be no temple there'll be no light because the lamb and God is the light now is that two people remember God can't be same so in the future home you ain't gonna be saying well I'll see God in the future huh no you'll see the body of Jesus and know who that is you really see who is in but he said when you see me you've seen the father we can't understand that now but remember the father was in that flesh walking upon the earth so in the Millennium he will sit on the throne of David who Jesus the human element flesh man Jesus the body which is made eternal and who be living in that the father he said he didn't overcome and sit with me in my throne as I've overcome and sit with my father in his throne he overcame unto death on the crucifixion and come to the Father's throne baptism of the Holy go now in the Millenium the father comes to the throne of David through the Son of Man which is the Lord Jesus Christ this all the correct story are the acts of a play that is unfolding down through there that God may be all you know see that it's not looking like in the Millennium well there's only two of them here but in the future home all three of them gets together is that now who is your God what are you expecting to see in the Millenium the same one that'll be in the future home the Lord Jesus Christ he said Philip have I been so long we Philips its shorts the father he said have I been so long with you have you've seen me you've seen the father very still it see we want to make Jesus that's the problem with the people of the nation they want to make Jesus a body spirit and soul man and then try to some way on the River Jordan bring this in and bring this in and let him become God and the more it keeps coming in till finally all three have winds up back together well I don't believe that whatever you believe you do what you want to but I don't teach nothing like that I believe when that baby was born the Bible's right a body thou has prepared me but one said it was the father provided the body then he turns around said it was those Old Testament prophets that built the body that was what God was doing to provide but when that spirit and that soul stepped into that body it wasn't a spirit my soul just of a man it was a very soul of Almighty God it was a very spirit of Almighty God his spirit his soul was eternal he said yeah but wait a minute he's tempted you got to eternal life you ever have any problems are you ever tempted ain't gonna asked how many times we yield asked many times were tempted what are you following me see that God may be all you know that comes in stage you see he's an ever born-again believer right here today around the world he's all in all he's in all born-again believers but there's more about him to be made manifest so when we get out of here you get 144,000 Jews that will get eternal life to them he'll be all in all and they'll look and see that that bride was that very all and all that he cherished you didn't come back to get them now come on he come back to get his bride the Jews wound up as part of it because they were part in the beginning all right are you seeing what I'm talking about it's unfolding the all and all is the bride then when he steps into another manifestation with the Jews there they are they all in all when he comes to the white throne he will give eternal life to the foolish virgins in different groups then he's all in all all in all just keeps getting greater and greater and greater when it comes to the white throne he's given to the foolish virgin all in all and then everybody that has eternal life will be the all and in all when we're gonna get down to believe in the Prophet how many times you ever heard him say all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ he pours into the church take her back to the Garden of Eden how many times you heard him say that know what you think he's talking about when he says God is not complete without us do you how many quotes do you want that we are a part of God right now him any quotes do you own of the Prophet where he said we're a part of God well you know that many simple language then there's the whole fullness if you take out one little piece he's not complete right if there's anybody in the world today that hasn't received he turn align but does receive eternal life you realize he ain't complete until then eternal life comes into that person right is that sensible see it's the expanding of God revealing himself in a greater way and you realize they'll make this statement quit on it as a series anybody else got any questions so if you've got anything raise your hand we'll go you realize it's you and I now the greatest opportunity that has ever existed in this world for us to have the very interpreter in our soul to interpret God's Word all of the compound names of Jehovah applying to Jesus Christ and we're his wife where his wife where his children how can you explain that you realized the Bible says he's my brother he's my Savior he's my Redeemer he's my healer he's my father he's my son he's my holy goat he's all of those titles and how can you explain it and one thing if you're a born-again Christian today you have part of God's life in you and until that happened to you God is not complete cuz we're apart you get all the parts together no come on are you listening and just because ever born again believer the Bride of Christ even though she receives eternal life there are some parts of God that are not made manifest he's got to go to the Jews and get them he's got to go to the White Throne and get them there are some parts I can't say it no other way that's not been made manifest we're talking about all the plan of redemption is over that was one of the first doctrines that hit me in the message they told me I couldn't be saved after 63 because Redemption was over I'm sorry that I'm hard-headed and everything else and just kind of like to read a little I told him I said well according to my Bible redemption was over before the world ever begun till then he known he all saved because you're saying it was after 63 you know you couldn't get saved mm-hmm it was before the world he died as a lamb before the world you see for sure of one thing you know for sure of one time the person who'd tell you you couldn't be saved laughter 63 they made sure they got saved before 63 right because it wouldn't go get up and say you couldn't be saved after 63 and and I'm in the same shape because I can't be saved either cuz I ain't saved yet you see how silly we are when we've got the greatest opportunity of comprehending God's Word to be able to go all the way back to Genesis and come straight down through the Bible and come out to the end of the full plan of redemption to be delivered to us to take us straight to the future home you remember what I told that man at my home that day when he was telling you know I see I know what you're doing you're thinking you gonna go beyond brother Branham you gonna tell us something brought around him didn't tell us I said go ahead and tell me but I said start after the future home cuz he got me that far well he just shut up God where are you going I said tell me something life in the future home I said probably preach this to the future all well he didn't like it I was a smart aleck sorry I agree to be an Alec ain't too smart but do you understand what it's simply anybody got a question not a relation do you need a brother Ryan Oh somebody better get the microphone wait let me get a microphone worth okay go ahead brother you probably already answered this and maybe I missed it but in the Millennium will Jesus be sitting on the throne in a corporal body you know and that'll be in the temple or what would that be it could be in the temple cause temple will be there right it's just not a temple made for sacrificial or anything else it's a temple that was all thank you he'll be there in a physical body you know what benefit let's go I ain't gonna say physical that's an eternal body but it he'll be an eternal body that's physical all right God we're gonna be there in eternal bodies that's physical come we're gonna have a body like he is right and we're going to be there with him in physical bodies the bodies that are made eternal now to the rest of this art they're not gonna be eternal because he'll be sitting on the throne and they be designated son of David if you want to put it that way but just remember my point would all the way through if he's sitting on that throne there is Almighty God there's father son Holy Ghost Alpha and Omega the beginning in the rows are sharing the lily of the valley the all of the father son holy go all of it sitting right there in that body and we'll be around him and he'll be all and all anybody else sister Judy the bride is the only one that has a new birth right of all the people that have eternal life yeah the bride is the only one because when you said an importation is not a birth right so everybody else has given an impartation right of eternal life right okay that was only the bride has the new birth because see she's gonna be part of him right that's why the new birth is the one I believe it like I do what is the new bird brother Dale brother branham what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you the word in other words revealed to you is that new birth well what could be revealed to a foolish virgin that he's a foolish virgin but he can be given eternal life because of it is the things that he done anybody else somebody else's brother mother John first nimbler the border one of the two coating so yes brother I know in the I think it's the the breech brother Burnham is saying that Jesus Christ is leaving the Father's throne to take his own throne right so just wonder if you can explain that a little bit okay and getting into your in revelations four and five okay that's where waves in that part I'll just make an emphasis over the little the end revelations chapter for you go to heaven you see the throne there's nobody on it it doesn't list somebody on it it sees the throne first and then you see somebody on it see it's separating it the throne is there alright that throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through the seven church ages that's the throne of God alright now here there's something close to that in that now this perforated brother Brennan said see the lamb he said he comes forth in City comes around from behind said he's been back here making redemption through the church ages he said he comes forth may now I may have this backwards but he comes for takes the book out of the one sitting up on the throne climbs up on the throne and sits down and said I'm the one that did it what does that mean that means God is in morphing and you're seeing him they could spend hours okay because where does the lamb come from the lamb comes from the church age is the you climb upon the throne he does and sits down and then sees he can open the book because he becomes one with the one sitting on the throne not it takes two different people he just keeps evolving or in morphing changing his form until here comes all of God finally interview and he sits down on the throne that's in Chapter five you gets upon the throne sits down and says I'm the one who done it not now I'm brother branham said it this wait I'm gonna make the statement called wave coming actually that one of these day though chapter five is the opening of the seals we go to six and try to read this and read and read brother branham said chapter five is the opening of the seals that don't even sound sensible to our human minds because it's the fifth sixth chapter he's starting to see the opening of the seals is not to the bride is to Jews alright that enough for the board okay so we got anybody else you see to me the more you see the word the more of God you're seeing ok sister Anna it's just a quick question now the sequence will be the the the dead in Christ will rise first and then we'll be here for a few days like 30 days then we take their rapture okay my mind went to I know some believers will be left behind those who don't have the Holy Ghost and they know the word and they'll know that maybe the bribes gone up somehow probably they'll know now the foolish virgins are the ones who will die when they give their life for the gospel right I was just my mind just went wandering one and I kept wondering okay if some believers would know that something has happened well okay and they know probably I'm a-gettin he's about to come on mm-hmm nuclear war well if somebody decides to take a gun and shoot themselves and they're really okay they know the word is that will they be foolish friend you know will they be lost just wondered about that little Eve totally left up there to guard himself as to what those people would be because I can say it this way that's where we would always taught if you killed yourself he was gonna die and go to hell we'll see the Prophet straighten that out that's not that he said it doesn't matter said you could take a gun and blow your head off he said that has nothing to do with your salvation see we was told he did was taught that we've lost see because of that because that was the Catholic trying to scare you let's see the foolish virgins in other words we go out of here or are the resurrection comes now I'm quoting brother Branham we'll get to quote some of the people as you said they are not into bride so they don't get it they don't see what's taking place but now here's the one statement I see but a run said a little voice will say you missed it we'll see everybody will look at our I've heard people say said look at either the head the Holy Ghost cause who's the little voice telling them the little voice telling them as a soul that's when a man that sees that he's done lost it and he don't have no hopes to go in the bride so then he'll have to give his life for the gospel and he could be given eternal life but remember if you turn this message down there is no hopes at the white throne now if you turn it down you're gonna face him as an unbeliever so don't put the foolish virgin just in a lump you know something remember he said there'll be a little voice say you missed it that's not the Holy Ghost telling you you missed it because the Holy Ghost going in rapture it's just a voice in your inner being which is your soul I'll let you realize hey I've missed this and what can I do what can you do but give your life for the gospel I sure don't stand in that place I'm gonna say this planing blunt to you you here in Lula you can think what you won't do what I've told what I've been all the years and what's been talked to you all this year don't you ever think you can qualify for a foolish virgin don't get that in your mind if I don't make it your rapture all this go as a foolish virgin you better be careful now some of the churches across the country I'm just plain for what they've taught and everything that people might be foolish virgins sitting there and get eternal life when the pastor will even lose and I didn't get it itself but you have no excuse you think that as being an exalted statement do what you want to cause for 40-something years I've been teaching these things and you come show me where I changed and show me where I change my doctor if I see I'm wrong I'll be glad to tell you I'm wrong I don't have to worry about it I preached for years that beyond the curtain of time they didn't have the census but one day I found a prophet said they did I came right here and told you I was wrong the Prophet said then beyond the curtain of time had CTAs field I mean had memory reason cause they were remember what took place I don't mind telling you I'm wrong so if you think I'm wrong come tell me anybody else whose sister Barbara I was just curious no the 144,000 are going to become servants to the bride the five or six million shoes that died in the Holocaust oh they also be servants to the bride well see your your talk about a fifth feel Jew and that's not servants to the bride you got a desk designate there can only be 144,000 and servants to the bride you know because they get now that's the the here's the catch here is that one two three still me we get eternal out here and we leave out the foolish of the 144,000 get eternal life then they give their life the foolish virgins and other Jews and if I get eternal life at the white throne in time so they need that different stages see they won't be food servants to the bride they'll just be that khalsa promise okay because they get robes of righteousness that's what I was wondering come on now they get the white robes they're given white robes well that would be it's a white throne but uh I'm technical or I've told it and I believe it the fields you don't go to the white throne now if you find what brother Owen said he did all right that's it let's hear it but I want to hear it from him because that feels fields you according to the Bible is given white robes and told to wait now listen that's why not what throne they're told to wait until their fellow brethren which is the 144,000 are killed so that feels sealed you has to be somewhere between us stepping out of here and God going to the Jews for the hundred forty-four thousand that feel sealed you cuts off somewhere right there there will be no more of them they'll be given white robes well if they're given what it rose why are you going to the Lots wrong you said well they're going to a white throne to get robe now that your way back over here you're not getting it you're not listening point the point is we leave out of here there's somewhere running are there going to be a cutoff for that Jew of the fifth seal Jews because the next will be the redemption to 144,000 now they will be Jews because they'll be just like foolish virgins they'll beads use it to white throne because they can qualify for foolish virgins right and be given eternal life at that time but that's specific that's why old man church you talk about something when that prophet when I read that and that feel seal all that opened up a lot of things to me that I'd always wondered about it sound like some group of people with our but we couldn't understand what to do with it you realize God blinded their eyes that we might be saved he blinded them that we might be saved oh what a wonderful everything else anything that's it anybody else before we go come on musicians think on these things like I said now keep these notes that you got because when you look at you get your notes you're gonna see automatically that we're going to a position because you're gonna sit here then if God's not complete without of us you realize in that city it's gonna be carnal statement but listen you realize in that city now in the city not in the world or anything in the city if you are supposed to be that light and they're not there there'll be a dark spot as plain language they'll see you're the light of the world now know neither the like if you ain't there the city won't be lit those you're part of going I wish would get that I wish we could just realize and I'm talking about me I realize hey we're a part of God not this here that eternal life that dwells within you is a part of God cause it's his own life go ahead brother what we got anybody have a need left and you know P you have a name come let's see enter laude Turner [Music] to pray and for a [Music] oh Allah he ducky Morningstar and through [Applause] eternity I'm going to pray [Music] listen to the prophet who will populate the earth outside of the city now I'm just giving you an illustration how you can read something word-for-word if you don't know the before and after you gonna miss it but listen to it it will be now who will populate the earth outside of the city it will be the redeemed that will populate the earth outside the city [Music] you'll be the retained it will be the Redeem that will populate the earth outside the city but they will not be the elected and called bride now he just called him redeemed but they will not be the elector to call bride the bride will be will live inside the kingdom with the king and on the outside will of either kings of the earth and the labor and bringing their color but he calls them redeemed they don't get mixed up with wordings well it's he to regain boundary day there's a lot of redeem foolish virgin gets eternal out there regained Jews gets eternal life that redeemed it doesn't mean that was the Rodina said they are the redeemed it's a wonderful thing to know and realize it would be great to just be a foolish virgin to get eternal life I just can't take no change I got a press home I gotta fight the battle 79 years old next month I gotta keep fight I can't quit I get to we got a press home father thank you Lord for the day in the message in claims thank you for the word that we've heard from your prophet and how
