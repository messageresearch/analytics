that's the only difference me and you I've always said we we sometimes we we try to isolate oursel from Humanity but you know what we're still humans we still have human feelings and emotions so brother pull down see the heading of it this part yeah oh pull it down a little bit Hey listen we got the Young Guns back there you see brother Joe sitting out here and you see I think brother there you go yeah that's the title I'm sorry that's the title to it but uh brother Michael is p way is running the camera today so we going him out I told him I said when you get bored just let that thing

downstairs cuz they're all down there there's no need to announce any of them all right dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you'd bless this day father take care of us be with us through this journey we ask you to be with ones that are sick we see brother Gary's not here today so something must be a little wrong in his body Lord we ask you right now that you would strengthen him knowing that he's watching in that you'll give him courage father and give him strength for the journey that lies ahead of him let each of us have that strength Faith or that strong faith that virtue Faith that'll go to him Lord and help him make and be stronger father give us our daily bread today and forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are not here the other ones that we haven't called brother Hal there coming through that cold father we pray that you just bless each one of our bodies Lord touch Us in Soul also today Father give us something that we can uh make a part of our spiritual life and and grow more in you Lord we ask you just take care of us now lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name amen second Peter 1 verse1 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ you can make yourself part of that or you cannot make yourself part of that all right to them that have obtained like Precious Faith all right that didn't mean that Peter got a faith and then we're going to get a different Faith right Peter gets the faith and we get the same Faith right and you know what it'll do it'll make you act the same way all right Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus our Lord sorry according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given I like that that's why I ital made that word a different color given they're given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust that's what we're talking about this morning turning going away then God will take that away and bes besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness to godlin brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ that new birth turns you in a Direction but these virtues make you if you if you develop if they develop in you as as true Holy Ghost virtu isues they're going to turn hey how do you think we're going to get this thing under control there's no way to get this under control under present conditions under just faith alone faith alone won't do it faith alone will save you give you the new birth and put you in the kingdom of God right but does it make you a full um Christian that God can use no not to the degree he wants to use you all right but you have the opportunity as we read the quote brother Brown says it's just how high your faith is for if things be in you and abound they make you in other words they turn your whole attitude that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off there's a lot of people has a problem with Revelation like we're talking about this morning they have a problem with the Revelation well they're born again but they can't see a far off right and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated you shall never fall I um at at the end of service last Sunday you know we sang that song It Is Well with My Soul I just want to make a comment on that have you ever looked up the story behind that because it it's really a striking uh story that we sang there and it kind of lifted everybody up a little bit and um being lifting up I uh s sister um milka said have you ever read the story about the man that actually pinned it Is Well with My Soul well his name is Horatio spafford all right these hymns were written I got this off of off of Wikipedia the hymn was written after a traumatic event in spafford's life because if you listen to this for a minute you'll never forget the lyrics of this song and what this man was going through when he wrote this verse These verses the first was the 1871 Great Chicago Fire which ruined him financially he was a success uccessful lawyer he had owned real estate and the 1871 Chicago Fire um wiped him out all right his business interests were further hit by the economic downturn in 1873 at which time he had planned to travel to Europe with his family on the SS V de hav in a late change of plans he sent the family ahead while he was delayed on business concern business concerning zoning problems following the Great Chicago Fire while crossing the Atlantic the ship sank rapidly after colliding with another sea vessel and all four of spafford's daughters died lost four daughters think about that he lost $ four do four daughters and his wife was the only Survivor she continued on to England well he was coming but the the story behind all this and I want you to see is this man was a was a devout Christian he was a student of Dwight Moody and irisi he was actually going to Europe to see Dwight Moody so he was a devout Christian man and watched what happened here though his daughters died his wife Anna survived and sent him the now famous telegram saved alone shortly afterwards as spafford traveled to meet his grieving wife now think about that that's it wasn't like they got on a plane and went over there it took him a month to get there to get from Chicago to the port in New York and then on a vessel over to to England so she had to wait on him but afterwards shortly afterwards as spafford travel to meet his grieving wife he was inspired to write these words as his ship passed near where his daughters died that's right and he wrote this verse when peace like a river attended my way when Sorrows like Seas Billows roll whatever my lot thou Hast taught me to know it is well it Is Well with My Soul a man that lost four daughters lost all of his earnings look like the guy should have just give up he pins one of the greatest songs greatest Christian songs ever written so you'll never sing that song again without realizing that man the sorrow he was going through when he wrote that that song and then he continues on and he doesn't even go back to Chicago because you know what they said the people in Chicago said there must be something wrong with you because God has laid all these plagues on you so he went to Jerusalem and he died in Jerusalem on his 69th birthday and never went back to the United States because they told him that he had must he was a secret Center and he must have done something wrong it's why God was laying all these plagues on him no I believe it was for that song it was for that song that now has meaning when Sorrows like be sees bows Ro whatever my light thou H has taught me to Know It Is Well with My Soul amen the Lord does some things for us right and we don't understand them but you'll understand them in by and by he probably died thought thinking he was a failure because a man named Paul Bliss is the one that actually put the uh music to the to the song and then it's been sang All Over The World by different people so I I I enjoy the song but I enjoy it more now that knowing that a man was was in such sorrow and tragedy till he could pin one of the greatest songs in the world so all right let's get started this morning of course we backed up a little bit but that's okay but we started with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost is a new birth all right we remember that we were looking in Ephesians 4: 11 we're going to read it next one down Bob just jumped right over Zach you didn't hear him hit the wall back then no just kidding cuz we're going to roll through this pretty quick and I had a few points I wanted to make he gave some I want you to see this though this is this is how we're going to get it so there's no other way I don't you know just beat it in your brain this is how you're going to get it and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints three things for the work of the ministry wish we had time to minister on all three of those because it's perfecting of the Saints work of the ministry and edifying of the body all right till we all come and it's look it didn't separate this group this group's in this right okay for the edifying of the body so that just dumps everybody into that one into that one uh office as we're all Christians till we all come to the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen now let's go to the quote that I want to read quote number one that we've been reading before but I want you to really get this because it is it's it's it's your you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be bornn again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it down scroll it down to the to the top there brother Z you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have is how high you can rise all right and I want you you say well keep reading it over again I want you to realize that it's up to you that's right and if you're born again you already have the faith right you just got to exercise it you got to get it out there got to be a way like like with virtue when we were reading that we're not going to read the quote remember brother BR said I got to have an outlet there's got to be an outlet to get that virtue out cuz it's an outward expression of an inward work right same way with you know like water baptism water baptism doesn't save you but it's an outward expression of an inward work now what is the inward work right Peter said repent that's the inward work Peter said repent you can bury them you can baptize them 100 th000 times unless they've repented that does them no good that's right just makes them actually two more F twofold more child of hell if you don't teach them right right cuz they'll think their baptism is what save them and it's not it's an outward expression these virtues are all an outward expression of an inward work that God is in there doing the work not you all right all right but look but remember faith alone won't do it you got to have faith but it's how high you can rise after you get that Faith all right you get that faith and then you got to rise up higher than just faith alone because faith alone won't do it all right and you got to have a substance Faith the faith that we have the faith that we have at the new birth is a substance Faith right brother Dale preached on that you're not too long ago on substance Faith but but the substance of that faith I believe is these virtues because you can't have it's like Brother D always said I'm born again I'm born again but when I get my body changed that's when I amen that's when I'll be born again because you still got this guy that you know came from those two people right there amen but when we're changed in the moment in twinking of an ey we'll have one like he has will be him made manifest we are that inside right but as we are down here on Earth that's what we have got to have to get this body changed right one more time if we don't have this brothers and sisters anybody on the internet whereever if we don't have these virtues in our life there's no way we can take a body change because there's always going to be a hindrance this is going to be a hindrance what those virtues are doing is they're they're moving that hindrance out of the way amen like said giving you a giving you a virtue Faith which is a strong faith not just Faith gives you a strong faith give you some Faith with power all right we acts 18 going up to acts 1 18 and we'll or go to Virtue because virtue faith is what we have to have next I think he had it already up there a minute ago which is that's that's okay there you go got to have that virtue of Faith which is what strength our strong faith and then in Acts 1 and8 Jesus tells us he says hey I'm going to give you power after right I'm going to give you power after that the Holy Ghost has come on you the Holy Ghost comes then you get the power all right as sister Anna kamani was was said she had always wondered about how they you know how they stacked up there well that's the only way they can or God would have put them a different way right you got to have faith then you got have a strong faith then to add to that strong faith you got to have some knowledge and before you can have Temperance you definitely got to have knowledge right all right or knowledge Faith but you shall receive power or virtue after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in both Jerusalem and all Judea Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth so that's talking about us we must have power after that the Holy Ghost comes remember you don't have power before the Holy Ghost comes right you have no power at all all right the only thing you have I was going to bring it out this morning I'll bring it out now the only Power you have before you get born again is to bring yourself to a place where God can work on you right remember justification justification that CHS off your past sins you still got the same devil in you but you're putting him in a different environment right that he's really uncomfortable with and I like that cuz it makes him nervous cuz remember if you say I want to get born again or if you say I want to change my life or I want to you know I want to give my heart to the Lord now you can do that but 6 months later you're doing the same thing yeah you got to go back right all right you got to go back cuz something happened in there that or something didn't happen actually you got to come back and say hey I wasn't really sincere amen I wasn't really sincere if you have sincere justification that means that it's going to take you all the way to the New Birth amen those who is Justified he is already glorified all right so it's a journey but whose responsibility is it it's yours right if you're going to lean back over here and go back toward that group that you were with that means that your justification was not one that's going to carry you on to sanctification it's going to carry you on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you just found Jesus in jail yeah I mean that's what really I mean you know and I believe God does chop off people's past sins you're right yes by said he's just to forgive you all you got to do is ask believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved if you died right then you going to heaven but you're not going to be a part of this right right amen but now if you do that and then 6 months later you're still doing the same thing I'd be careful right you understand cuz it's a same thing with these virtues if this is not helping you you need to go back to the beginning now lay me down to sleep yeah most of you know what I'm talking about right right brother B said that that guy that was dying the priest said where you need to go back and find God where you left him and he started saying now lay me down to sleep what happened was he left him when he was a little child so you got to go back listen remember God will be right here right he'll be right here waiting on you if that's where you got to come back to he'll be right here waiting on you you just come right back to that spot and say God I'm sorry it wasn't really honest I really didn't want to be forgiven and that's really what you got to say yeah I want to be forgiven because they got caught right most of the time that's what that is but really for Godly sorrow leadeth to repentance then if you if you're really sorrow for what sorrowful for what you do he will forgive that then you got to walk and continue on same thing with these vertues he said well I got the new birth okay you're a baby we don't want you to stay babies we want you to have some some strength where like Peter walking in the gate beautiful he didn't have to have a church crowd around him he didn't have to have the atmosphere of of you know 14 or 15 deacons or or you know Elders of the church around him and building him up no it just him and another guy was with it they were just walking down the road right right he didn't have to go get it it was already there all right and what did he do is he just displayed that to that man at the gate beautiful all right so that's what we as Christians because we don't want to stay babies we don't want to be we've got to start there right but let's don't end up there right cuz you born a baby and you you're an adult Jesus was a man right and he's expecting us to be a man amen the virtues were working in a man's life all right now we read acts one now we've come to knowledge faith and let's look at the U continue with the definition of knowledge faith brother Zach knowledge signifies in general in general intelligence understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion but now remember let me stop for a second I want to really emphasize this just because you read the Bible and you got you know 14 stars for reading the Bible 14 times that means nothing to God right right if the most illiterate person can receive the new birth brother Louise that guy can't read right so it must be that God he listens God brings something to him and it what it affects it comes in here and then the effect is down here right cuz he really can't read like brother J for he couldn't read he said God you got to teach me to read if you want me to read your Bible that's what you got to do you got to teach me to read and he did all right but look so it's not a it's it starts with a general knowledge of Christian religion sure that's why you got to study Show Yourself approved I'd rather study two scriptures and know what they are than to read a whole chapter and be reading it like a newspaper like a buck cuz we all know the stories of Noah and and Moses and that's just good stories all right we want a deeper more perfect and enlarg knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced that's why you got to be more advanced up the pyramid more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as seen in right living so it continues on with right living all the way even up into knowledge now let's go to Temperance and Temperance faith is the one that we that I really think Temperance see us right there in the middle we're not far from the top and you got Temperance right there's the right there's the key right there a virtue of one who Masters his desire and passions especially his sensual appetites and that doesn't have to mean sexual that means anything sensual that's not according to God's word cuz you know he we use that word love all the time I love to hunt I love to fish well what are you talking about what's love right I'm sorry it's not a love that's right it's not a goppy love it's FAL love and actually that's not even filo love you're just using it as a word right right yeah that's the thank you we can stop right there mastering controlling curving restraining controlling oneself temperate and continent that's the person when you get up there to Temperance I'm telling you that Temperance and patience is right in there together but that is control that is a controlled faith that we must have you can't go any further cuz remember once you that's why I was telling them downstairs once you get to Temperance the next thing is your trial right yes patience remember the try remember patience Faith there's no way to get patience but by trials now if Temperance was up here sister anakani and patience was down here you might blow up right here if Temperance is above it but if you've got that self-control in place right the trials are going to come that's right right right the trying of your faith much more precious than gold it's going to give the you patience there's no way to patience but by trials cuz everything we read every everyone that we read this morning of patience faith is something to do with God trying you right easy to have patience if you're sitting in the doctor's office and 2 minutes after you sit down they take you in then you well I know that's impossible sorry but if you're there for two hours how you going to do how you going to feel 2 minutes versus two hours the trying of your faith is what's going to do it so let's go to the definition of patience and then we'll get to Godliness and your patience possess your souls look steadfastness look how much more compacted the scripture says there that we that in Ephesians that we have everything's compacted everything's got to start being squeezed in here because look honestly you need a whole lot of faith as you get further up it's pushing in pushing in it's pressing it's pressing it's squeezing you what up right all right not out up right all right steadfastness constancy endurance in the New Testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerve from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and suffering patiently and steadfastly steadfast waiting for enduring sustaining and perseverance we've waited 50s something years to come to a place that brother brandom was at in 1965 right 63 actually God has waited on us and been patient right for us to come to a place that's why brother B I believe he said the first thing we got to do is have patience with God right then have patience with everybody else else all right let's go to James 1:24 and then we'll start on godliness here in just a second my brethren count it all joy when you fall into many Temptations H count it Joy when you start going through a trial just start saying I got that joy joy joy joy down in my heart huh knowing this that's the trying of your faith amen worketh what one thing for sure if you're going through a trial and you're having problems with it God saying you don't have enough patience yeah right cuz remember if you're a son he's absolutely he's he's that tutor he's the one that's moving you over and showing you this and giving you this way but he's not a do old granddaddy now right he's not one that's going to clear all this out of the way no you're going to go through trials but it's what you do at the end of that trial right right that's right right brother Bram said it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it all right so the how is how you overcome it with patience let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing all right have patience have patience with god listen we've waited a long time for body change sight and time is God's two worst enemies right because you and I are what what is sight sight and time time is patience right right patience and what what we see I thought we're supposed to believe to see not see to believe amen so how many of you seen a body change how many of you saw Jesus down on the cross how many of you saw Jesus Take Stripes how many of you have seen that so how do you know it's true that's right how do you know it's true something in your heart takes you back to that time that it happened now if that don't take you back you don't have that in here there's that virtue that virtue is taking you back to that and I'm drawing strength from something I can't even see right oh I see symbols I see pictures I see a cross right but do you see how much we actually do live by faith right we walk by faith not by sight right same thing with patience the trying of your faith worketh patience so God's going to try your faith for you to believe something you can't even see you have to believe believe that your children are already already saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost right amen husband wife whatever and you say well it's not happen have some patience right are you dead yet are they dead yet always a chance people but when you turn and let sight and time take over that's what our problem's been you see these people leaving the message they never had if they didn't if they did not have that substance faith when and get born again there's nothing for them to look to right but with that substance Faith inside that's what God brings us he brings us that substance Faith hey that's what was hanging on the cross right so he projects it now down to us and we got to believe it by faith right if you don't have that then you can be why you can be you have no Foundation ation you can be moved here you can be moved there you can get this you know you can get this Doctrine you get this you say brother R was wrong he was right and all these things you see what's happening the statue of perfect man is so ill taught nobody really knows how to get into it number one and how to go up it because nobody's teaching it right and really they're not all right now let's go to the next one which is godliness now we must have now what godliness Faith don't lose your faith but your faith has to become so Godly and I found something here I've been you know brother brandham really doesn't spend a lot of time on the Statue of a perfect man with godliness right he doesn't it's only just a few paragraphs that he spends on godliness if you've read the book but remember the whole thing is godliness but watch what he does watch what he brings in I'll read the quote in a minute and I think it's something that'll help you kind of like the control of temperance this is something that God showed me to what godliness is and it shows you whether you got it or not cuz see we're supposed to be like God when we get born again right right we're supposed to start acting like God when we're born again well why is this here if we're supposed to act it down here there's something about this and I'll read it to you in just a second but let's go to 1 Timothy 3:16 this is all this is where we were going to start some this morning but this is where we we'll uh hit God and brotherly kindness and without controversy so there's no controversy right great is the mystery of godliness right God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory amen now how many believe that amen without controversy then we must not have any controversy that that's what that is that that was was God that did that right and it's a mystery because the mystery comes in us right God's a mystery to the world but we're a Myster of the world because we're God here manifested on the earth now watch this go to 1 Timothy 4 Timothy talks a lot about this or Paul does but refuse profane and old wies fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness there's that word again exercise for bodily exercise profiteth little which it does a little but godliness is profitable unto all things right all right having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come now what were we talking about there in in U in second Peter it says we're talking about life and godliness all right so this is life and godliness what you're doing is you're bringing the life that we're should have lived had they not going to fall you're bringing it back here right you got that that's what we're bringing back is the life that we should have Liv all right cuz remember that Genesis 126 man never fail that Genesis 126 man never had to say God forgive me of my sins right that's right so if we get back to thaten that's when the body change happen people this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation right but godliness is profitable Uno all things having promise of the life that is now and of that which is to come right all right now let's go to the definition of godliness after oh I'm sorry let's go to 1 Timothy 6 I messed you up didn't I 1 Timothy 66 but godliness with contentment is great gain I want you to think about that godliness with contentment in other words be content what settle patience temperance you see how that stacking on top of each other yeah godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certain that we carry nothing out so all that you know we and it's fine I and I I really think we ought to be successful in life I think I don't think we ought to be just you know brain dead but I don't think that we should build our hopes on this world but on getting to that bringing that other world in manifestation cuz it's going to be way better than this godliness with contentment is great game I want you to listen to that and hold it now let's define what godliness is strong concordance is this is all it says about it reverent respect piety towards God now look at that word there right let's take that word let's read quote number 12 this is from the statue of perfect man brother Brown says but if you got genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to it then genuine knowledge then genuine Temperance genuine patience see you're moving right on up the line fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeff there and we found it in a dictionary godliness means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience then be like God you say I can't do it brother brandom oh yes you can right that's right then he's talking about read now what he reads is is he reads Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect right but then he comes and reads keep scrolling up we're going to read this and then he actually goes to Ephesians and reads what we've been reading where the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists is for the perfecting of the Saints you get way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here here he's asking that you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God how many things I could say along that line and he turns to Ephesians 4 and he reads that scroll on up this is a I think this is a pretty long quote but he reads the same thing I read talking about the apostles prophets pastors teaching evangelist for the perfecting of the Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones amen the one started from down here right right so you got to be born again you got to be a saint before you can be a saint Sanctified one right then he talks about the perfecting of the Saints and going up perfect takes godliness you have to add to your faith godliness see he Ain left Faith so that's godliness Faith see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge then you go to Temperance then you go to patience now you're on godliness then he talks about to be like Jesus keep scrolling up Godly always looking for one thing I always do that which pleases the father right always do that which pleases the father see yes sir always that's godliness see right all right so what we're doing now is we're looking at something cuz you know there's another form of godliness second Timothy tells you there's a form of they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof a form of godliness not godliness a form of godliness but look what he's saying is always looking for one thing I always do that which pleases the father and I came to I was looking through a little more few more quotes and looking I thought Lord what what is something that we can do to make it we're supposed to be Godly here but why did you put godliness right here right before brotherly kindness here's what came to me take it for a grain of salt or you can take it from the Lord but godliness to me is a respect for the the gifts of God or the person that is gifted right right see you've come all the way up here this far you got all these virtues but there has to be something and because it it does it shows that godliness is a respect you must have a respect for the gifts of God once you get that far because look the next thing is what brotherly kindness right if you don't have you got to have respect for the gift of God first then you going to have to have respect for the Brethren got it see how they're stacking on top of each other respect for God remember have patience with God first have respect for God's word or God's gifts first then you're going to come to brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness is one that's going to you it's going to knock us off a little bit maybe brotherly kindness is tough but remember brotherly kind kindliness is right right at where God is getting ready to absolutely make you an instrument that he wants to use Glory right right but we got to get that one little thing out of the way called brotherly kindness so godliness faith is a respect for the gifts of God all the gifts of God we respect all you say well no it's not you say well that's speaking in tongues why does everybody go to that one those are the last ones yeah the gifts of God is what wisdom faith and all those spiritual gifts we come there and we see that now we need that kind of godliness to take us up one more part higher we must have respect yeah respect for each other is what's coming up but respect for God respect for the gifts of God and know where they're placed and you know what know how to use them because what did Jesus do I always do that which pleases my father right so did Jesus do anything that didn't please the father if he didn't the scriptures wrong right you say well he did this he did that I always do that which pleases the father amen did Jesus have respect yeah I think he did he had respect to the father didn't he right didn't he right he put all the honor on the father right right he had respect that's the godliness un I going to have to have is what it's not up here where you say I got godliness you got to come to me I like what brother Chris is not here but he's in the back and I'm sure he won't mind me saying he walked out there and he said I'm sure you're telling I'm sure glad you're telling these people how to treat me think about that a little while he was laughing and I know what he was talking about he was talking about himself he said I'm sure glad you telling these people how to treat me but really I mean and really you got to be that way you can't say well I get up here and you go well I've got all these great gifts see that would be no respect there right you everybody understand what I'm saying there'd be no respect there there'd be no godliness I could have all these other virtues and not have the godliness about myself to know that to respect that I know where that gift come from right I know where the gift in Brother Rich Marlo all you everybody everybody's gifted right but you got to have respect for that gift when you come to right there because you know what you fixing get real close to that person yeah right right you know Temperance is something you got to work on patience is something you got to work on brotherly kindness is really something you got to work on but you working on it with somebody else and it's brotherly kindness see you can have patience and have patience with the world you can have Temperance and have Temperance you know with the world but brotherly kindness that's you and your brother amen so it's bringing it right into the family and we're seeing that sure it's all in the family but but godliness is a respect for the gifts of God so remember that I believe that's what brother Bram was trying to say is having respect of where it came from how it got to you and how you're using it remember power without character to me that's a character godliness is a character that we need to show respect for the of God and then of course 2 Timothy 3: 4-7 I just threw that in there because it's a different kind of godliness it's a form of godliness right you can't listen the form of godliness is right here you can't even get in the body having a form of godliness that's religion religion is a form of godliness cuz they want to act like I said many times you know they they get religious around you right traitors he high- minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the what power thereof in other words not showing respect for the gifts amen not showing respect for the gift they're denying the power they're actually they're denying where it come from from such turn away and it tells you what to do so let's go now to brotherly kindness Faith next one next chart brotherly kindness faith we going we coming right up here to the top all right bless you brotherly kindness all right we going to we're going to read a few quotes here but brotherly kindness Romans 12 let love be without dis stimulation upour that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kind affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love cuz remember brotherly love and kind brotherly kindness is the same thing yeah all right brother love brother kindness is the same thing in honor preferring one another what I tell you about godliness respect to the gifts now you're going to start respecting the person right oh it's easier to respect the gift sometimes it's not easy to respect the person so that's what we're getting to though you got to do it that's the last Point let me make this point look that's the last point before God puts that seal right right what is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's a what a seal right right the Holy Spirit we're sealed right here until the day of our Redemption absolutely in our soul but when we get to right here God's going to put another stamp on you it's not another Holy Ghost but it's going to be a stamp that the world's going to be able to see I hope right but Romans 12: 9-10 let love be without ass stimulation you read that now let's go to 1 Thessalonians 4 he therefore that despises despises not man but God all right so now if we despise a person if that person has God in them and he's at at godliness we despise that person we got a problem we got a problem with God right because you're not despising the man but God right who hath also given unto us his holy spirit but that touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another this shouldn't be a hard one but it's the hardest one it's right up there at the top all right for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another so we're supposed to do that so now let's go to the definition of Brotherly kindness which you know what that is it's Philadelphia that's what that means Brotherly Love brotherly kindness love of the Brethren love of brothers or sisters brotherly love and the New Testament the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren now the problem that we have is the problem and we'll read it here in just a minute from Brother brandom the problem we have is is we say well if brother Dale loves us L loves us I love him yeah that's the way we want to be yeah right that's the way we want to be we we don't want to be the one that portrays the love first we want him to love us and then it'll be easier for us to love him or anybody I put anybody in that place it's really you know if Jesus said the two greatest Commandments and we read them was the the Lord your God is one and love your neighbor as you love yourself now look I got two neighbors that are gay pick that one up I've got to love them as much as I love me regardless of what they do CU there's no stipulation but remember through this whole thing it's got to be an overcoming it'd be real easy if brother Al and sister Anna lived on one side of me and brother how and sister already lived on the other side and you know Mom and Daddy live on down here and Anna and Richard and Terence and Lis you know but they're sticking right beside me is something that you got to deal with but it'd be easy if we had a commune with all of us that live there we all live there we all praise the Lord and we all did that's too easy that's too easy you know put a Richard Marlo in your yard and see what happens boy if he was just a lot nicer I'd be a lot nicer to him that's not what this is this is what love of brothers and sisters not the love they give you it's the love you project to them all right and I'm being serious cuz look this is this is to me this is the hinge point if we get through this that's the whole thing I believe that's what's stopping I know it's what's stopping me and I'll just admit it I you got to have brotherly kindness and you give it you know we give all kind of examples but the the greatest example is that you love that you got to love that neighbor unconditionally doesn't matter if he loves you doesn't matter if he's a Christian doesn't matter let's look what see what brother Brown says quote number 13 that's another one another U part of a uh definition but let's read this look 6ly let's add the Bible said add Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the six seventh all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Jesus said 70 times seven which those of us that don't can't add can't Cipher that's 490 times a day yeah yeah that's not a weekly or a yearly quot that's a day brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see see that's where it comes down to patience see no see be kind to him go anyway someone said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the want that's all the rest then put see brotherly kindness see see hoping someday see patient with him see temperent enduring he's going through this whole list knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in now he used every one of those virtues right there right stacked them right on top of each other just like we've been doing you wonder where we get this from right he got it first brotherly kindness the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 brother R Taps on the chalkboard seven things now you're coming next thing then at charity which is love that's the capping Stone and then we're going to get to that maybe when we get back from brother Joe greens not this Sunday but the next all right let's go to number 14 let's read this one here now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart's broke he just nearly killed you say we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another see but to maintain in a group of people now look he's making a point here I want you to stop he's making a point we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for for for one for another if it's one for one right here right but when you get a group of people that don't like that guy yeah see right here but to maintain in a group of people where's Benjamin where's Michael we can obtain that why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight we're actually going to break bread tonight we're taking communion you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of stay what you ought and do but shun him a little bit Yeah but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister now if we have such a hatred toward people that we want to see something bad happen to people we're in trouble right you need to go back down to justification you're on that shoots and Ladder game where you think you're going to be almost at the Aaron in that right Aaron play Shoots and Ladders last night Shoots and Ladders you get right up there to almost at the top and there's a big old ladder that goes all the way down to the bottom how many of you played that raise your hand you rest of you are secret centers but you slide all the way down to the bottom what is bro dick it's a board game and it has ladders that when you hit it you can climb up and you go to another it's like a journey and then if you get up to a certain spot and you hit that point there's a ladder and you have to slide all the way down and start all over again playing with dice and stuff like that so well you made a statement I want that cover I never you want be on secret Center did you but a lot of us played I mean it's a popular game right for those of us that lived out in the country We we played with uh played with those kind of games those those were neat and that was good times you know there was no television program we didn't have to worry about that we grew up without a TV so we played board games so but anyway shoot some ladders that's the way it is with this look he said you come up this far and then you know all the way down to the bottom if you can't love listen now and this is the point I want to make there's people that humanly you don't like to be around right okay right brother brandom even said and I wasn't going to bring the quote cuz I don't want to deal too much on that side of it he said there's Christians that you can't stand to be in the room with yeah because of the Clash of your Natures but like he said right here if something happens to that brother right first thing you say you don't say first thing you should say is God have mercy you know but instead of going well he deserved that no you know that's like this I I don't didn't mean to bring it out but just like this this aao spafford all them secret all them people back in Chicago was saying hey he must have done something wrong right he was a sinner he done something wrong God punished him for doing all that no he was right there in the will of God right to write that song that I believe will be sung for eternity we'll sing these songs for an eternity because I believe it's a it's part of the growth process of the man and they were saying that it was something that God done to him right you have to be careful brotherly kindness you have to be real careful with in all sincerity that is the place where we all need a lot of help amen first thing if some does something to you what's the first thing you want to do get back at them yeah first thing you want to do I want to get back at them I want to do something that he has made me uncomfortable that beard on brother klie is bugging the Hound out of me do I looks like Uncle I don't think I've ever seen him with a beard so it's aggravating me I'm I'm tired of it brother stop it get over I'll get over it brotherly kindness that shouldn't have anything to do with anything you understand what I'm saying it's like uh uh sister Anna kamani she's kind of my she's kind of my Rudder every once in a while she's and she's very smart intellectual she said brother Wade that's not the first sermon brother Brandon preached was Faith you don't know that that's the first sermon he preached and I don't know if that's the first sermon he preached but it's the first sermon on tape that he preached so I need to make it so I need to make it I need to make make it right she's crawling under the seat now but I need to really I do I need I hey I get that from all of you and I appreciate that I I I hope that that brother Dale all of us ministers are so approachable that you can come and say hey that's not that just wasn't exactly right what you should have done or or you like her you know she said you need to explain that cuz you don't know the fast the first sermon and that's the truth and I appreciate that you know what that didn't make me not like her that's right that makes me you know love her more as a sister to know that somebody's listening because somebody on the Internet or somebody that's just come here the first time they if they search through the the uh you know look through and they say well that was not the first sermon he preached he started preaching in 1920 something and here it is 1940 something that's not the first it's confusion we need to stop the confusion and I'm sorry because I caused that it was the first sermon we know that brother Brandon put on tape for us to listen to was faith is the substance so I thank you for that not to embarrass you at all I know it didn't your face is not red where you at Michael but brotherly kindness listen like I said it's really easy though for us to love each other really should be easy for Christians to love each other it really should but sometimes it's not just like that now if I would have been some people being a preacher and some woman tell me that I did something wrong and says you need to correct it oh her head would have hit the floor and rolled all the way to the back some preachers couldn't have stood it till they got in the pull pit and did that amen seen it happen before many times we have to be careful we have people come in here and I've seen ministers at Fellowship meetings a girl woman comes in and sits down in the front row and her hair is real short first sermon she's ever been to now how's brotherly kind is going to be projected when he stands right here and goes cutting your hairs of the devil and you know you're right that ain't a lot of any of that that's right definitely knowledge probably even the Holy Ghost cuz look brotherly kindness is preferring your brother before yourself Jesus did not die for hisself right he died for me and you he didn't have to die he was God Almighty he didn't have to come down here and do this but he wanted to because you know why he wanted he's so unselfish he owned all these virtues before there ever was one Adam right like brother D's been preaching for anything he was those virtues but he did not want to be alone with those virtues right because look how you going to have any of them without having somebody to project it to that's right that's so he's got a family now he's got sons and daughters that he projects this to and expects us to live it if we believe that that's what he came for was to give us these what gifts these virtues are gifts that God's give us so let's use them as we comeing on up a little bit further man you're right here brotherly kindness you you know you get all these things working in your life you uh have respect for God's gift and then you got to have respect for the person all right let's look at number quote number 15 we'll be finished here in just a second I'll let you chew on this till we start back over in a couple weeks look if Pentecost was God's Vine This is I will restore this is not in the Statue of perfect man book how this is the one that's going this is one yall see if you can swallow if Pentecost was God's Vine which was the new Vine that has grown up then these four destroyers has been the one that eat the vine down now you remember the Palmer worm Locust caterpillar all that all right that's what he's talking about now let's find out what Pentecost had now not 1906 let me explain that not 1906 Pentecost but the true Pentecost the one that started right down here in the first church age all right there in in and right after the death of Jesus and coming back on the day of Pentecost all right find out the Destroyer who they are well what did it now the first thing that Pentecost produced was brotherly love that's right it tore down the middle wall of petitions and made a Brotherhood cuz you see what Pentecost done in 1906 it totally reversed that right they started putting walls up they started putting petitions up brother Bown said you've you've cabbage down you've stopped here well the first Pentecost not so they are not a total pattern of the first Pentecost all right it tore down the middle wall of petitions and made a Brotherhood to such a way they had everything in common in the Bible Days A brotherhood right that's right this is where downstairs it got a little bit touchy I told y'all today to bring make sure you brought your cash did you bring all your cash did you bring your checkbook title to your house and all your cars no you're supposed to give them all to brother Dale and me brother Terrence brother Louise brother Lise quit smiling that's what they did in the first church age that's what brother brandham said was to such a way they had everything in common you remember brother Paul spoke of Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal church and he said First Corinthians Lord speak with tongue and Angels not have charity but what do he do they brought all the money in they trusted now how about trusting a brother how about trusting Peter who can't even write yeah so he can't make an invoice but they just piled everything in and they gave as was needed in the first church age that was brotherly love that's what he said right right boy it's good and quiet but remember ananas and Safara was part of that group right now what did they do they sold all their goods listen this is what they done they sold all their goods they did what the disciples said they sold all their goods but when they walked in before Peter Peter said is this all they said yes or he did said yes this is all Peter discerned that if he got $20,000 he only brought 10 into the pot he kept 10 for himself and what happened to him he fell dead right there Peter said you've not lied to me you've lied to the Holy Ghost so now what I'm telling you today is you don't have to bring your money and your cash and all that we don't need it but I want you to start bringing all to these Services right sir bring everything you got every title deed to Faith virtue knowledge Temperance everything you got you bring to this service right amen and don't leave it at that door right you bring it right here that's right I don't want your money brother don't want your money we don't need it but that's what they did though that was brotherly kindness you know what they did they trusted those Brethren so much till they did here I just I just sold my house I just sold all my cattle and here's the money you do with it what God tells you to do with it right that's how much they trusted not just the gift of God anymore they trust the people with the gift right you see how this are stacking on top of each other you got to respect the gift but you got to respect where it come from right they respected them so much now this is right before the headstone now remember they didn't get that the first church age didn't get they have no they didn't get the headstone they didn't get Christ in his fullness but they got so close till they gave everything they had because remember what when Jesus hung on the cross did he hold something back he gave all he gave everything he had for me and you so why can't we in turn turn around and give it all back to him everything we do all the work that we do whether it be natural whether it be spiritual whether it be anyway let's roll it up again right here Jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other Pentecost had it right I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of Apostles and the disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had and for the further for the the furthering of the church the only way you going to get make this church profitable is come here do what God Said and you know what God's going to have to give you a blessing he's going to have to cuz he said I'll give you a blessing that you can't contain amen all right they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together till even when one heard of the other one died they said let's go and die with him such a Feeling can you say that about yourself amen can you see brother Donnie or or brother Joe or anybody in a situation I I told Brother how and I meant it from the bottom of my heart I said if I could take that away from you and give it to me I'd take it that's where you got to be that's where you got to be now let's don't be foolish and say God take the cancer off of this when to give you know don't let's don't be foolish right but if a man's sick what's brother Brown say the little girl the little the little woman that was sitting on the row that had a sick baby a mother came around laid hands on her and he said that's where the baby got her healing exactly why that lady entered into brotherly love because you know what if a sister's having a problem I can't relate to that right right but if a brother has a problem I can relate to that and enter into that problem so you sisters are have just as much of responsibility to enter in if if one sister's having problem or two sisters having problem enter into that don't separate yourself from it enter into it and I meant that with brother how many you know you look at people and you say man if I could just take that away from him right just give it to me I'll take it that's what Jesus said wasn't he right right cast your burdens on me I'm not making me Jesus but we're supposed to act like him right right that's why brother Dale has has problems in his body I told him the other day I said you're just like brother Jess you do everything I'm going to say it you do everything you don't have no delegation skills you don't tell people to go do this do this do this you do it all yourself brother Jess treml was the same way 75 years old he had a stroke your body listen your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost but your body is still under sin your body is still under sin and has the effects of it listen we're all getting older this is falling out okay I told him other day I said I don't know how in the world you preach three sermons work two jobs and built my house and terence's house and Anna's house I don't know how he did it after two Services doing this I'm dead dog tired why cuz it's a strain it's a strain look at brother brandom he was 56 years old I'm 55 he was 56 when he died he looked about 70 he was old why Jesus he was 30 years old they thought he was 50 why because the man had brotherly kindness he took on he took on the sins of the world Jesus did and then us we must bear each other's burden and we should I don't want brother how to be sick he's been sick for weeks I don't want no more of that right and I don't have to physically take that on but you know what it's like brother Dale did that day he took a quarter and said here let me buy your headache right well that wasn't Wizardry that was faith that was putting confidence in somebody say here I want to take that from you that's the same way we're brotherly kindness we must now bind together not be all lovey-dovey because you know what the world and and people that have a um that doesn't have the new birth they take it to like you're talking about cuz remember brother Bram said agapy love then fil your love then what lust then it just keeps going it keeps deteriorating all the way down all right OS and all that stuff cuz what they're doing is our in our being we're supposed to love a Creator a god something we're supposed to love something cuz that's what we're supposed to love right and what happens with Satan is is he brings it over this way and brings it into OS fil your love and all those things over here God has got agop love and it never moves it stays right here it's constant it stays right there yeah exactly that's who he is that's the head stone that we're missing right that hopefully that we can get into but I like this right here where this is some people go berserk but I like that right there right where it says holy spirit we'll we'll get into that in a couple of Sundays let's stand but brotherly kindness put yourself in that person's position before you start judging right or anything all right I hope that kind of helped you a little bit further on into godliness God but remember godliness godliness is a respect for the gifts of God right all right then when you go up a little bit higher if that listen if your filter says that brother Dale has a gift of God then you must respect the gift of God but you must respect the person to go along with it right right cuz look how bad they got with Brown they said oh we respect the gift when it was working with a discernment but when he's preaching how messed up can that be right I mean how messed up can that be God can't keep his word straight now those people had a different attitude than they should have had if they would have brotherly kindness say old Dr Bosworth he had brotherly kindness he said oh brother brandom you need to get on the field you need to get out there before everybody you know before brother Bosworth died he's telling brother bam all these things he needed to do well now he could have been like the rest of them and said well now you know you're don't go out there doing any preaching no he said get on the field get out there before the fanaticism gets out there so we must find the gifts where they're coming from respect them and then respect of our brothers brotherly kindness kind of hard to do yeah Jesus said love your neighbor as you love yourself right think about that think about that we're fixing to take communion and we need to we need to really as we're taking communion realize that as Sons and Daughters of God it's a it's a requirement it's it's something that we we're supposed to do as Christians we're supposed to take communion but now if you're not a Christian then you're not supposed to to take communion cuz if you do then then you're you're harming yourself now what's a Christian Christlike right that's someone born again all right and if you don't then you see all these things and and you see brother was going to read it in just a minute you're going to see that there's things that there's blessings and there's cursings right all right so as we take communion it should be the Born Again believer or brother bam even said those believing unto but now not just because you want to drink some wine and eat some bread right that's why communion with the brotherly kindness that's why they all had everything in common there was not one I love that where St Martin he wasn't satisfied until he went through his whole congregation and they all got born again well see then when you take communion every you don't do this you don't you know you're sitting there taking communion sit there taking communion and you kind of go see if brother Dick's taking it see if F one's taking I see some of y'all do that what have they done yeah that's not brotherly kindness you better worry about you right and you know if a if a if a a stranger comes in and takes communion what are you going to do it's open communion you don't know what that person's done or or what right exactly it's your choice to take it I'm just telling you that if you take it though and you live a like brother Claud said you take it and you live a hound dog life you going to get what a hound dog gets sometimes he gets shot and run over that's what he says so just realize that it's it's a it's a sacred thing it's just for the Believers right there was no unbelievers in that Upper Room when 120 received the Holy Ghost they were in communion one with the other 120 people that's why brother Brown said if the Church of Ephesus was a powerful Church all 12 people were born again yeah and they were they had these virtues working in their life give me a church like that I don't need 500 or 300 or 100 give me 12 people that will believe the word of God live it be it I I'll take that any day L we okay you love the Lord before we take communion let's pray I want to pray we'll pray for us and then we'll take uh take communion let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we pray Lord that today what's said has been satisfactory to you Lord that we've said it from the bottom of our heart that we believe that if we don't live these virtues that we're we're living way below our Privileges and Lord we want to project that virtue and knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness project it to the people so that they'll see it and they'll see Christ Living in a human being cuz the only part of you that the Earth's going to ever see Lord on this side of judgment is us the people walk walking through the streets of Satan's Eden the worst most Dark Hour ever on the face of the Earth yet you've got your little bride walking through it you said you'd protect us you said you'd take care of us Lord as we go further into this service for the communion Lord that as we take the communion if they be any sick among us Lord may you heal them now father and keep them strong not just heal them keep them strong let nothing come against us Lord let us all bind together and be one in you father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes and our thoughts against you Lord that are contrary we pray that you just bless each one of us take care of us and lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray Amen brother de bless you
