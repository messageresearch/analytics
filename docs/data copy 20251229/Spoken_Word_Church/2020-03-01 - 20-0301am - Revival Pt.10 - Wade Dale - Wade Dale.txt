believe and I want to see hey man good to be in house with Lord didn't have all of you here today we need to lift up prayer for brother Dale home they're watching and pray that the Lord be with him and bring them out all this and everybody else tell your brother dick and all the ones that are sick sister Jean no different ones we are you know the world is looking at all this coronavirus and all this stuff and you know what it does just puts fear in the heart of people but the Bible tells us fear not you know as I was listening to the radio the other day and you pick up little tidbits 365 days are in the year right besides this leap year which is yesterday y'all had an extra day right so you felt a lot of older because you had an extra day yesterday but 365 days in the year do you know that exactly 365 times in the Bible it says fear not fear not for I am with you fear not fear not because what does fear fear brings torment so let's forget about all this fear that the world is bringing onto us and let's just think about the Word of God if we worried more by our soul than we do our body would might be all right but if you got your Bibles we're gonna continue with revival we were I sitting yesterday trying to figure out if we needed to continue or not and I believe the Lord gave us some thought for a couple more sermons and brother Dale cut and couldn't be able to be here this morning so this is enough this is an oddity to not have our pastor with us in the building most of the time you can but but for for his for his his safety sake in his body he's wore out he's tired let him rest right we just lift him up in prayer so Psalms 1 38 8 we're gonna do part 10 and 11 there's one thing I have not covered that is where the Bible tells us in Amos about being a famine in the land not of food and water Lord we got plenty of that but it's a famine for hearing the Word of God but we'll speak more of that this afternoon this morning we're just going to background a little bit and fill in some gaps that we have kind of skipped over in this service of this revival series remember brother Aaron to be preaching for us Wednesday night brother Louisa's in Jacksonville with the group down there I believe he spoke Friday night he's a brother Keith Browns today maybe or yesterday but just remember him in prayer coming back coming back combing brother Aaron wings tonight next Saturday remember March the 7th at 3 o'clock we'll start our youth the Bible study we'll have a phone Pete say at 3 o'clock and then the service starts right there after brother John will be leading the singing but other luisa be doing speaking then we'll have questions and answers also remember next Saturday night change your clocks spring forward there you go yeah praise no it's not we'll lose an hour you get you get my age you take all hours you can get but spring forward so set you yeah well that's right you got thank you for reminding me that sits freedom but spring forward so next Saturday night don't forget to turn your clock forward and we'll be back on whatever this is regular time I guess that was daylight saving this is regular time and also time chains I'm trying to remember all this marks our tenth brother Dale is gonna go for a shoulder surgery so we'll keep him in your prayer that all this will clear up so he can get that done it's it's he suffered with it for a long time his shoulders been all all tore up so we believe in doctors amen that's what I've told him this morning I said look brother Bob had some emergency in his pocket you know for vitamin C my sister treated Macmillan about to two or three years ago she said you're not taking enough vitamin C so I take 2,000 milligrams in the morning and 2,000 milligrams in the afternoon and I have not had a cold for three years but I take it every day don't do like people come into our honey store and they'll tell June about right now they'll come in honey it's not for my allergies no that's already you needed it way before that you know moms the world's worse I'm gonna call around moms world's worse you get vitamin C she'll take two pills and Sam sick you got to get in your body get in your system listen God give us all these vitamins to take to hell because listen you know our food is horrible our food has all the vitamins sucked out of it all the bad things are in it and all the good things are being cooked out of it so God give us I believe he gave us everything in the earth to take care of our needs so take 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C in the morning in 2000 in the afternoon it's not gonna hurt you it'll keep you from getting the flu so let's say March the 10th let me get on down the road here March the 20th through the 23rd June and I will be in Oklahoma so keep us in your prayers when we travel them we'll be going to visit brother Claude and sister ginger for a few days had been out there in a couple years so we're gonna head out during the 18th through the twins the people for our Father's Day fishing excursion and weekend or week of having fun Thursday Friday and Saturday so haven't heard back from brother Aaron McGarry but I'll call him today or tonight and find out if he's going to be with us and he'll be speaking for us that weekend if he can come so Psalms 1 38 8 all minds clear just remember the ones that are not here the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would help us today father that we are truly as the prophet of God told us every generation gets weaker and weaker the food we eat is actually killing us we're a long time ago it actually sustained our life and made us strong the Lord according to the fall everything that came out of the ground you cursed back in the garden but Lord you sent an advocate you sent a high priest you sent Jesus Christ on the earth to take away all that we're just trying now to to get this thing through the Ministry of the gospel to get us turned back to that foundation of before the fall where everything Lord was restored back to its rightful position you promised you do that you sent a prophet in the end time to tell us what you've already said and I pray today Lord that the words we're speaking will be your words Lord and not ours that the hearer Lord may hear and receive revelation because we crave revelation more than anything Lord being the bride in the end time and a way Lord that no one else has been it's not been laid on anyone else Lord but us to have a reverence as direction Lord all those dead Saints coming out of the ground and glorified eternal bodies and Lord then will be changed and it will be taken out of here and then the world can do what they want to do but Lord we'll be safe in your arms we'll be over in that glorious dimension where there's no hurt no sorrow no pain no flus no sickness what I pray that you would be with each one here in the building Lord that we would truly Lord look to you and not look to man for our answers that will look to you the author and finisher of our faith Lord and that what we do have today will become a revival in our heart and it'll take care of all these diseases Lord the first diseases of disease of the heart of the soul of man Lord we by the new birth has been cleaned out but father some may not be in that position yet Lord but we truly need a cleaning of our spirit Lord we need a cleaning Lord that will clean those flus out as we're getting ready to speak again Lord about you how that you came and cleaned us out Lord and caused the revival on this earth probably give us this day our daily bread be the ones that are not here people the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for the labor father in Jesus name we ask these things the bride of Jesus Christ says Amen Psalm 138 8 we're just going to review just a little bit and then we will try to set a stage for this afternoon and talk about a famine though I'll walk in the midst of trouble that will revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and our right hand shall save me now that's the right hand of power we know that the Lord will perfect that which concerning to me we're depending on him we can't be perfect in ourselves we're dependent on him the Lord will perfect that which concerning to me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands let's read Psalms 85 1 and then you'll be seated turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease look I'll be angry with us forever wilt out draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice indeed you may be seated in the Lord having blessing to the reading of the word but while you're while you got your Bibles open or if you don't have your Bible let's read here this is 2 I want you to keep this in the back of your mind today that we're we're going to talk tonight or this afternoon about famine and what what the Lord said in the Bible and Amos 8 if you'll pull that up let's think about this yesterday we've been talking about waters and cleansing and and all these different things and look what Amos says verse 11 behold the days come saith the Lord so it's coming I say it's here that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread or thirst for water my heavenly days we've had enough rain in the past three weeks to take care of that but listen we have clean drinking water truly we have all the food we can eat and then some but God is not talking about that he's not talking about a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of the hearing but of hearing the words of the Lord all right now look and they shall wander from sea to sea and from North even to east they shall run to and fro to seek the Word of God a word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst that takes me back to the five wise virgins and five foolish virgins the five foolish virgins they are faint because they turn part of the word down and they didn't get the new birth all right when that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst now what we're talking about it's just like you leading to a horse to water and it doesn't drink or you you said a little fish is why better be careful drinking the water out of the ocean I may drink it all up you know you but God's then end of the das table fountain there's no way that it's going to ever drop we even know that the river of life there was rivers in the Garden of Eden and then we polluted them as man but then that pure water shows right back up in the Book of Revelations flowing out the River of Life flowing out from under the throne eternally it's not gonna it's not gonna flood brother John it's not going to dry up it's gonna what flow because God's brought everything back by how did he bring it back he didn't bring him back by natural water he brought it back by you and I coming to a position because of the washing of water by the word that we've come to a place that that can flow freely in us and I was thinking yesterday you say well and you know me I don't care much for laundry list of do's and don'ts but when we come to this revival if you don't have a revival inside of you today you know it you know it because you're with you 24/7 hey man so who's the problem this is the problem right here all right so let's work on that because what a revival do it stir up what you already got what happens sometimes and being in beekeeping we have we use essential oils in our in our sugar water when they can't get sugar water we give them sugar water plus we put a little vitamins in there some vitamin C mmm are some citric acid and we put things in there to help the bees because they can't get it all because y'all are killing it all with us roundup and all this stuff y'all use so I'm preaching on bees now so anyway but we take these essential oils though and we mix it with water while we emulsify it to a degree but what happens if it sets over time some of your sisters know and many people know that if you leave something somewhere long enough it separates oils at the top waters at the bottom what do you do though now you haven't added any more in it you haven't taken any chemical out you're just shaking up what's already in the bottle well that's what brother branham says and the resurrection of Lazarus he said it's just a stirring up what you already know about what you already know you just haven't used the Bible says exercise exercise what exercise your faith in what you know they said well I don't know this I don't know that that comes by washing the water the word have you made yourself available for that because remember remember the prophet of God said ignorance might be you know they may play ignorant back whenever but you can't plead ignorance now because the full books been open everything's been give us the seven course meal the full plate everything and it's free it's free let's see what brother Brown says let's go and read this I've got two prayers in here I found another one we'll read it a little bit later maybe this afternoon but brother Brown said recognizing your Danis message he said God created me a revival let me be the revival that's our problem we've been waiting for brother Aaron to start a revival we've been waiting for brother David to start a revival sister throwing some brothers doing some work on the home ground because if you start one guess what you started it God started it in you there's nothing nobody else can do with it except it'd be contagious and somebody else grab ahold of it and they start a revival because you guys we have to realize number one you got to realize that what everything was in the bottle it just got separated because of lack of use but if they can shake it up get a preacher get a sunday-school teacher get the prophet of God to stir it up what you're stirring on what you already got mmm like I said before everybody wants to know what the great Seventh Seal is and what the great dis is it's nothing external nothing zero that's what we've been looking for a great somebody a great something California to fall the government to come in and take over the money everything brother mom said it's going to come to pass but now what did the Bible say look up when you see these things for your Redemption draweth night and some of these things that we see you know it's gonna happen if we wait until this happens wait until that happens there's gonna be a voice the prophet of God said it's going because you know what you're gonna say I thought this was supposed to happen I thought this was supposed to happen I thought this was supposed to happen what brother I'm say he said a little voice would come to you and tell you you missed it you missed it why because you were looking for this and not looking for the giver you were looking for all these other things God created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me the thirst created me Lord that one is needed in me let me from this hour on behind more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kind or more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive for getting things that are in the past the negatives let me press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ amen and then the next one is what I just quoted him into going the resurrection of Lazarus brother Brown what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine not a seven thunder opening of whatever we already got that it's the full plan of redemption and even the prophet of God has said prophet of God said thousands of live voices it's what Satan hates that's the thunder that Satan can't stand he can't stand you living the Word of God he can't stand it what this church needs a good revival not a new doctrine or in you order just two stirring up of what you already know about that oil in that wine and all the different things that the Bible tells us about now listen we have to hear the word of God but I'm telling you one more time if you're waiting for the Sun to stand still the clouds or the moon to turn to darkness all those things have already happened a lot of that stuff's already happened you just might have been looking in the wrong direction but if you're waiting for that all to happen you may be too late if you're looking for you know we always and we do ask the question well you know the question the biggest question is or are we gonna be here when California sings I don't care I really don't care but if you put that at the top of your list you might as well be the only thing on your list because you're not gonna do anything until California sings and what if we're already gone when these things what if the great resurrection in the rapture shakes this whole world and dropped California in the ocean you better be ready before that time comes that's what a revival is we're sitting here we've got the Word of God it's a word revival we know that brother Wade we got the Word of God but what are we doing about it you saw we're sick that has nothing to do with it zero property God said cloudy days doesn't mean God's against you sunny days don't mean he's for you you may have bills piled up this high and you may have ten million dollars in the bank that don't make you no better Christian make you better person but it won't make you no better Christian either way because God's not judging you on the wealth that you have on this earth except for the wealth that you got in your soul what is a man that gains the whole world but loses his soul soul food pardon the black brothers soul food is what we need amen maybe you've been asking for soulful let's all ask for soul food we all need soul food and when you come in and say man you know what you're eating on soul food hey bye alright alright let's look at number three then we begin to find out miracles isn't taking place in the more like they were the sick go home sick it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of the revival among the people there is no revival they sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good mm-hmm see there's not that zeal now we covered this before or the or an ardor our there's not a something you want to grab a whole - there's not that something in the people that should be there well listen the only person that knows that is you not me remember the preacher can't bring a revival we've read those quotes over and over for about nine other sermon preacher can't bring a revival I can only brother down all the ministers can only what gets you to see what God's already done and that we do need a word revival we've already had different revivals of different things we need a word revival to where the Word of God you say well what is that well what does the word tell you to do the word of God here we go we're going to do a laundry list it tells you sisters now cut your iron okay let me hear you no don't wear pants all these different if you can check them off I was reading the quote or brother Brown I'll bring it I wasn't gonna do it but I now brother Brian was in this meeting and he said I preached away and he said I preached on sin of every kind and he said a good little Saint a little Baptist woman walked up to me after the service and she said brother Branham said you weren't preaching on me today said all those things I don't do said she walked off and brother brother Brown said he was standing there said another one walked up and said what was she telling you and he said well said she that I preached on sin and preached on all these things and said didn't hit her up didn't have it not of what said she's never done none of them coming to rich young ruler he said that sister leaned over and said brother Branham she's the worst gossiper in the whole church he said that was the one thing I didn't hit on so she could say he went breaching on me because of the laundry list but now the gossiping he didn't preach on so she must have been free from all that but it was kind of funny for you know you brother Branham I believe everything brother I'm dead was ordained of God under the auspice of the word now I'm not talk about a human being we're asked to eat and have children not know but when he was when he was walking when he found the brook when this lady walks up when this other late these two ladies says when he called me a Buzzard when he called me an eagle all those things were a life of a prophet to show us that God was dealing with him so that he can deal with me in you in the same way so I'm not here today to tell you if you're a gossiper you shouldn't gossip but you got all these things you should know it's been preached all these things have been preached we should know these things there's not a zeal there's something in the people that should be there what is it it's a stirring up are you to realize you don't have it because there's all these things then he said well I've not got my healing I mean you know men June and I've been praying for our children for years and nothing's happened well you know what you keep praying something will happen [Music] if you stop god knew you were gonna stop and he doesn't have to do anything else after that because he only goes by your confession what you confess amen so don't stop those who endure to the end if you ever heard that scripture those who endure to the end shall be saved I'm not an advocate of deathbed confessions but if it'll get them in any in glory with me so be it but the Bible said you'll be there with the offsprings now be there means be there amen so let's just realize what we've got we need to give it out to our family live that thing listen I'm gonna tell you all of you something there was not and I'm off on the rabbit and want a rabbit trail here all right I'll get back in a minute but you said we say we want our children saved and Warner to see our children in church and you come half the time half the time there was never an option when we weren't Scott when we were growing up and a shake in the head tends to be shaking his head mama shaking her head I'm shaking my head daddy's head shake his head some of it some of y'all I think you get up on Sunday morning go it's Sunday o Church what an option we knew we were going to tell some honey both services our parents drugged us they drugged us we're on girls till we were about 18 they drag us to church every Sunday young people I don't want it to be a drug I want you to be happy to come to church that was my problem and their problem - it was just because we had to I don't want that to be that I want you to come to church to worship God I want you to listen to what God has to say and you say well I got these problems that's why we opened this thing up to the youth group because they do have problems you can't just say that's not a problem no we went through it ourselves if you'll remember back you know there's things that we didn't go through that they go through now but same devil and the same results same devil same results he'll Drive you away from church he'll drive you away from each other Satan does not want you to fellowship I said before I tell you again I just I talked to a preacher a couple months ago he got so depressed because he heard people was saying that he didn't preach deep enough doctrine then he was gone all the time now that may have been a problem but anyway he's been and all these different things so the first thing the preacher did was is how did old wowsie wowsie woo oh woe is me party and he went and separated himself from fellowship they'd in the motel for two days he said that's exactly what the devil wanted me to do he said I thought I was gonna get away to talk to God he said but the devil was there talking to me when I got there okay so that's the same thing with you and I as I told the church before we're sheep we're lambs we are herd animals that's why God herds us here on Wednesday night and herds us here on Sunday because of what happens when the animal leaves the herd wolf will separate one person and you know what happens after that he'll kill him he'll eat them but if we stay together lying together I'm not saying we're not I'm just telling you to look at these things brother Brown said bye and closer as the day comes bind closer together pray for each other but there's not that zeal there's not there's not that something in the people that should be listen that something's got to come that something's got to be here be glad to rejoice the children of Zion Zola Joel 2:23 let me ask you a question going to anyway how much real studying do we do during the week how much real studying now now listen my study and I don't know why I'm doing this but I got about another hour so I'm gonna take my time so when we my studying is different from yours I'd be driving a mail Jeep I know some of y'all can't do two things at once but I can drive a mail Jeep be thinking about God I can think about one word or you can you do the same thing but let it be a time though that there is a time that you sit somewhere with God and talk to him talk to him nobody else but do you ever just grab your Bible just start reading now US ministers are different we have to every Sunday and every Wednesday we have to get a channel but you can study many different things as laity but you know what will happen if you'll start studying and it'll be something that you have a question about I'll promise you mr. milk is smiling and shaking her head because she knows it God will absolutely either change my sermon her brother Dale sermon or send us down another direction just to help you I was in Oklahoma several years ago and you know me I have to have they all know I'm izip driving I got my notes and we go right by these if I lost these I probably shut up but that's the way a teacher is I had an evangelist tell me one time he said I don't preach like you I preached my inspiration so well I'm not inspired then I need to quit I just took it is what he said but I was we were in Oklahoma we were broke large house and I had my two sermons ready to go revival 10 and 11 note wasn't that being believed something else God woke me up at 6:30 that morning on Sunday popped me straight up in the bed and said preach on this right here nobody that rattled my chain and my brain because I'd never done that before I'd never just opened the Bible and preach the sermon especially - but I tell you the story behind that is though I preached on God told me what to preach on he's to preach on Abraham now that's all I said preach on Abraham walking straight up the preach on Abraham so I had remembered I had just several months ago went through the series where brother Branham preached on Abraham to 14-foot took a chapter 14 15 16 17 18 and typed the believer the walk of the believer well I had no notes all I had was just what was in my head being way so I brought that forth and I said you know it was good I stumbled through a few things but it was alright and then after the service this sister come up to me and she said brother wait she said that's exactly because her family had come she said that's exactly what me and my family had talked about the night before and they had some questions and she said you answered every one of them now see that is going by the way that's God listen it's not God being nothing for me it ain't making me nothing making you because you were the one they're the ones that had the connection I didn't they changed my sermon they changed it because of what a question that her family had had that they had talked about the night before that she couldn't answer the question she said you answered all every one of them so that's what we're looking at sometimes we do go off on rabbit trails and things but somebody's here to get it Joel Joel to be glad and you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God we have given you he give this to you he has given you the former rain for giving you the rain I want remember rain is white rain is revival the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now we've been through this before remember he will cause to come down for you the the revival the former revival in the latter revival you and I under this messenger in this last hour or were under two revivals now this is one part I didn't bring out so this is a part that's going to fill in a little bit we we are now not under two revivals but we came under two revivals the first revival of brother Branham was was the healing revival and then remember the messenger Malachi forced to do two things but now brother Brown tells you that it wasn't his message so that revival was for the world that revival was for the worldwide he went seven times around the world but in 1962 1963 64 65 somewhere in there all those sermons they were honed down to one thing and that was a word revival an opening of the seals where he may have taught him a little bit different before but now when the angel met him down there and he makes the call wherever he was Arizona and told him to go back to Jeffersonville he came with an open book and now you and I are living under that revival the revival of the open book where God's not going to wink in our ignorance because of us not knowing what's going on because with an open book listen John didn't need a closed book Johnny need an open book so whatever that book was it's now in John according to revelations 10 right so who's John topping the whole bride so that word opening of the word is not just for William Marion Branham it's for you he brought his former reign which is a teaching rain but the latter rain is a harvest of what was planted 1962 brother man preach the spoken word is the original seed now that seed has been planted brother mom said Oral Roberts planted a seed Billy Graham planted a seed and I planted the seed now that seed of Oral Roberts and Billy Graham was not a word revival go back to the characteristics of a word revival word revival has to be 100% word correct they were both Trinitarians they both baptized name Father Son hook now God winked at their ignorance because you know what they were to do they were to blind the people member they were the two prophets that went to Sodom and Gomorrah and blinded the people but remember one stayed back with Abraham one stayed back and that person revealed to Abraham that he was going to have a promise and he was going to take a body change listen then people in Sodom and Gomorrah didn't take a body change they died by fire and brimstone by what by what all Roberts and Billy Graham preached to this world that revival is over with but that revival is what the denominations are still living under and that's what I said before are we still living under you know hey I'm gonna say it anyway I know they came out not too long ago with a tape of just brother branham's prayer lines that's okay that's not gonna that's not word revival that's not gonna do anything you but make you feel better and maybe give you faith for a body healing but that's not the word that's part of the word you can't take healing out of the Bible can't take little hands out of the Bible but now the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover don't even say pray for the Bible says the prayer of faith will save the sick you don't have to put the two together we're praying for people now that we can't physically touch you we're believing that God's gonna heal them but that's not the revival were under listen and the floor shall be full of wheat the fact shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts eat cankerworm katha pollitt palma worm my great army which i send among you if you'll read the restoration in the broad tree you'll understand that those different bugs same bugs different stage of the bug did different things to this broad tree the same thing with all the organizations and all the different things God cannot give a word revival to anyone but the bride of Jesus Christ I hope you see that I don't want to be exclusive God remember brother Brown said he said God believed in segregation now you know we don't common human segregate we don't believe that but God said separate yourself God said come out of her my people God is a segregationist he doesn't want us to go down into Egypt will read in about it to end he told Abram to stay who he was that but because of a famine Abram went Egypt and got out of the will of God and that's what we're going to talk about later on we'll get to that family in just a minute now we're restored to you so there's a promise of restoration two years they're locusts that seat can't-can't worm pommel worm caterpillar my great army and remember this restoration of a bride tree is a word revival non-denominational revival listen brother Bram tells us the domination is what eat it down the denomination's was the problem of the eating down and I don't mean Baptist Methodist I mean anything listen anything contrary to the Word of God is the denomination you can be a one man denomination you can sit here and denominator and die because of what your own thoughts let's look at number four excuse me broken system brother Brown says how about that water bubbling up on the ground you don't need a filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up but what's pushing you what's pushing you what's pushing you today there's something inside pushing you to go to jump on to go to church don't want a match play to want to do the right things because it's got to come from in here we can sit here listen you sit here and you you can't save your kids you can't save your wife you fat you can't save nobody but if you'll live it long enough of a life before them and they walk up to that fountain and see that you've got something bubbling up inside of you that the common world does not have what brother Dale's always said he says can our family really see that we're different can they really see that you're committed to what you're doing if you're not committed then they're gonna see it they're gonna see it whether you think you're fooling them or not like I told you about many times you know Jim's dad when I got converted there was a lot of going on saying well he'll be right back to what he was doing before well that's been 20 years ago so I think we're okay but they're watching you to see if that's just oh one of them trends you know he used to test us remember he'd come to our come to businesses always on Sunday right Jim always he come Saturday night always on Sunday why he wanted to test us we never missed church because we had her daddy in the house never I don't see how some of you can do that I know you kids are important but your souls more important than that and they're watching you now Jim's dad comes to church with us when he's here because he knows he's gonna send it home by itself if you do that few kids they might get saved but when you stay home with them on Sunday just say they watch every move we make because we are different the community watches everything you do and listen most of them want to see you slip up because they're searching for something to catch you with but don't worry if you're washed by the water of the word and you keep that thing stirred up inside of you there will not be a lull in your Christianity amen there won't be folks I mean that's what people looking for and you know what you might be brother man said just be real salty remember what he told us that's sister said be real salty what about a man that walks in and plays and pretends to be drunk and he knocks all the food off of the table because his friend he said watch this watch my wife said she got she didn't pick the plate up and hit the guy with it she picked everything up and said must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free saved her husband and her friend because what happened just what's rain we've been talking about revivals you go stand out under a water and you're gonna get wet hey man you go stand on the water you're gonna get wet our problem is we put the number a lot let's finish reading this will no get done broken system you don't have to depend on local range to fill it up rains or revivals we're that fountain that's at that fountain of life where the carcass no what's the carcass the word where the word is the Eagles we gather you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing it'll just come right straight out it'll flow right out of you let's go to the next one Tom's one verse to bless it is a man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night it's what I was talking about I know there's a lot of things that we have to do but my heaven John and Charles Wesley that was 17 kids in that family she did not have a washing machine she didn't have a microwave she didn't go to Walmart buy instant dinners for their kids she cooked 17 meals two or three times a day but she had enough time to sit down and teach them kids about God in that John and Charles Wesley came out of that which caused a revival across the whole world and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water now we've covered this before we're gonna cover a little bit more that bringeth forth his fruit in his season he should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit the fruits of the Spirit love joy peace long-suffering wisdom faith all those different things that we look at his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now remember we talked about the other day the whole world can be in a can being a famine or being a drought but whatever is planted by that River it's going to be green so if we get ourselves planted by the rivers of living water now what brother but I'm talking about this watch number 5 planting the vine and where to plant it now are you planted by the rivers of water what water that's smitten Christ it was out of the rock floodwaters to save a perishing people from death Christ was smitten and out of his body come forth the Holy Spirit that perishing people might not die but have eternal life are you there's many different things God promised to heal he was wounded for transgressions bruised for our iniquity chest eye chastisement our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed rivers rivers of one water don't get hurt by this rivers of one water the Holy Spirit there are first apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors rivers of one water you get a fountain you get rivers five rivers the only way you're going to get it it's through those five rivers apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists the Bible says in Ephesians what for the perfecting of the saints we know that here but somebody may be listening in that has a question about things that go up on up north but their first apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors rivers of one water listen folks you're deceived if you can't see that you need apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists you're to see person cuz you gotta take that part out of the Bible you can't get perfected without it like I said we're heard animals were sheep all of us are sheep we need a shepherd we have the great Shepherd but he said the great Shepherd is water one water our great Shepherd is the Holy Spirit remember God sent the Holy Spirit what leads you and guide you into all truth but he flowed it down through and I'll read you a quote here in just a little while it may be this evening where it flows now not through the church but through you it flows through you will read that maybe this afternoon if we get to it all right look revelations 1 verse 15 this is just kind of the other day we were going through this and and even just dressed her black thanking me for preaching on logs he's hidden his hair was white as wool it's white as snow and his eyes was flames of fire and what does this revelation is 115 John turns and looks and what does he see he sees in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks are the midst of the seven churches he sees a man with these characteristics and his feet like unto fine brass I said we're burning the furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters all right brother Brown says in the seal of God this is number six I want you to watch this now this great subject we had last night the first night was the church in the church age that was seeing Jesus standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks look upon his Jasper and sardine stone the beginning and the ending Reuben and Benjamin see the seven candlesticks were seven lampstands standing in a rainbow over it as the Covenant how he was how appeared and his voice was the voice of many waters both Christ and the church speaking together with a golden girdle around about the breast part of the church covered over feminists holding the gospel holding the righteousness of Christ over the church how can we fail when we have the righteousness of Christ were robed in His righteousness all right now look at number seven brother I'm stone but now now remember you got to watch what he talks about the church and the bride because at that moment over there a few minutes ago he was talking about the bride not the church nominal everybody got that say man lord y'all need to go to bed early daddy sees y'all in the morning I thought I saw you sleeping ones in the afternoon pinch yourself do like I do sit on the edge of the seat if you fall everybody know you was sleepin you got to see me fall yet him now let's see well soon down to the end of the page now hair like wool eyes flames of fire and his feet like brass it is hot in here burned in the furnace and his voice the sound of many waters hello Brown says voice of many waters walk this waters represent now remember rain and water is a revival we don't we just saw that nobody got that say man if you want to mark it down turn to revelation 17 15 you find the Bible said the waters which thou sawest is thickness and multitudes and people in tongues all right voice what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilot goddamn you know we were talking the other day about that little rudder on the back of the boat loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the great cataracts the Falls what a horrible thing would be for a soul drifting voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers hmm through the Holy Spirit you got to put them two together there's ministers that preach but there's ministers that preached by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out to what to the thickness and multitude to the people the voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming divine judgement the voice of many waters came forth from this one that looked like the Son of Man many waters if I got that say man now we'll watch this this is in the layout of CN Church age I just picked this up a few minutes ago let's read this let's read the whole quote because we get the whole thought a momentary consideration now remember this is Laodicean Church age this is the only Church age where Jesus Christ has been put out of the church he's standing on the outside of the church trying to get back in and eyeball as I've always said for some of you that are new and are you need to hear this because look who was that standing on the outside of the church guarding human flesh Dease on a man not a spirit Holy Spirit still in the church but the son of man is not in the church anymore that's not a man he's been driven out and he's trying to get back in I'm doing my message churches and specially them out there we've got to get the revelation that God in human flesh is here now listen an open door is an open book a closed door it's a closed book they closed him out to let the real revival start in the people which is a word revival and the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word now remember Luther couldn't start a revival like a word revival that works because it was the book was closed the just shall live by faith that's all he had the Lutheran spoke for God at that time Amen God sealed in the under Martin Luther got sealed in a group of bride that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was under a closed book it was not under an open book never I understand that there was only a certain scripture that they had that they went in on because listen even though God winked at the ignorance of the people he never never ever condones false doctrine he allows it to happen brother Brown says because the ignorance of the people God said okay but Luther's message was the just shall live by faith which was God's mind coming to Martin Luther to bring a people out of the Catholic Church but they still baptize wrong they still had a wrong doctrine of the Trinity but God winked that there Ignace because it was a closed book it was only open to one page the just shall live by faith and that's not a full word revival that is a what remember they were reformers they were reformers it started a restoration but Luther Wesley were reformers because what they did is they reformed the people out of the Catholic Church Wesley reformed the people out of the Lutheran's that had went back toward the Kevlar dock to Catholic doctrine but when you see whether Branham comes in the end time it's not it's a restoration I will restore I will turn the heart of the father's back to the children and the children back to the fathers where you're living under not not just Luther and Wesley that's part of the foundation but that was Reformation you and I cannot live under Reformation you're not even born again if you live under Reformation those Luther's Luther's doctrine was that the just shall live by faith I can go to the beer joint and I can smoke a stogie and talk about God God winked at her Ignis they could do that not in this age you can't do that why because the books been open the full revelation is that that's a part of God justification but you got to move from that into sanctification you got to move from that to the baptism the Holy Ghost why because the word has been restored full and unadulterated by the Prophet in the end time everybody got that say man that's just real simple the Lutheran's speak for God at that time but they organize look and again the pure Word was lost for organization tends toward dogmas and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God at one time they were but God moved on and they didn't then God sent Wesley and he was the voice of the word for his day the people who took his revelation from God became the living epistle read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodists failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age final voice under her messenger Luther's message was not final because it was Reformation Wesley's message was not final information even Pentecost with the restoration the gifts not final you and I are the final boys to the final age what the voice of many waters the voice of many people yes sir look the church now he's so much the church you know I'm with the bride the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her what the church he will confound her through the Prophet and the bride they didn't just say the Prophet he will confound her through the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come you ever read that in the Bible right there - Brienne it says the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as that Pentecost but of course that word bride would come at the word revival that word bride will be repudiated as in the first church age now he has cried out to this lass age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces hmm you can't hack a word revival up a word revival is restore is restoring of the to Word of God pure and unadulterated through the voice of the bride in the end time look taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want your interest you are not interested in living it but debating it Wow hmm I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected it I can say that if you get white heart to know its truth and live it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you I will spew you out for you nauseate me Wow for you nauseate me that's pretty tough for a prophet to say those words but what are we doing in the end time about it hmm let's go to John 7 verse 37 and the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood in the last day the last day he must be done about somebody the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried and said if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water rivers of living water what it rivers of life alright let's go to number 8 getting in the spirit this is what we tell them I till today that's the way you get a revival when you really get in the spirit of revival it's what I've been trying to get you know you need the rudder you're in the water everything's good you're in the water but what if you know the winds of sickness blows you this way the winds of this blows you that way that's okay but if you got if you don't have a rudder you just might get blown all the way off into the end of the falls but if you got a little bitty thing called a rudder they put about that long on a little boat even on a huge boat it's not very big but what does it do it's a rudder and it doesn't matter if the winds blowing in that direction if you put that rudder in there that'll boat make like they're little ways but it's gonna go the way that rudder says for it to go and that rudder is your Holy Ghost that will lead you and guide you direct you into all truth that's the way you get a revivalist when you're really getting in the spirit of revival not whooping it up or something but by praying it down until there's a revival strikes your heart here's what we talked about the other day until all the logs of ecclesiasticus ISM and all the logs of fanaticism and all the laws of system and all logs of unbelief flow out and then the water of God comes falling down upon you there you are I didn't bring something out the other day when I was preaching here but I preached the same thing your brother Duchess and it struck me you know what logs are there is never a live log a log is dead if you see a log laying in the woods its dead if you see its tree standing up it's alive but if you cut the life out of it and it falls it becomes log hmm a log is dead so whatever your ideas are that's clogging up your water it's dead you know what it's dead wood and you can't even build a fire with it it's soaked with water it's wet but if you need a fire here we go getting in the spirit he said it was out there one time perishing in the same way that you are now there's channels out there's plenty of channels will that rock still lays in the wilderness young to me he said you got to dig out a lot of stuff remember he's told my little ID you're Elijah talking about digging ditches in the Bible remember what happened they dug he did they dug ditches and filter that with water and then when the enemy got up in the morning and looked out across the field they saw that water and the way the Sun was shining on it looked like blood they thought that the somebody had come in and destroyed their enemy so they go rushing in the Campbell when they do they're waiting on them the Israelites are waiting on them they kill them all they killed the other group right so watch brother Brad I'm saying it ain't starting new organization that's the vision tonight brother just dig out what's in it that's right the first thing that old rotten log of organization throw it out of the channel the channels of God blessing is all stopped up tonight organization logs laying in them then another log laying out there called the no such thing of the Holy Ghost if you dig down and struck that log throw it out what we were talking about remember sister Sheppard's dream even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost there was a man pouring water in that top it went down into the person and what came out trash dead sticks dead logs a man came out with us a statue a perfect man that's our problem if we're a born again strike that you don't have logs in your soul there is nothing dead in your soul if you're born again you're alive you're that tree that's planted by the rivers of living water you listen to those five rivers of a possible profit bachelor's teaching and evangelist and that what that nurse is your soul there's no such a thing as about this one throw it out if you dig down instruct that Locke throw it out there's no such thing as the baptism all the ghosts that's just for the disciples only dig it out the only ghost was just for the apostle dr. Simon Peter said on the day of Pentecost is for you and for your children them too far off what do you do he took them back to the Bible great fine Pentecostal brother told me not long ago said we don't need any more divine healing I wouldn't even let it be practiced in my church he said we got fine doctors and things today that takes the place of that that's what I told y'all the other day we got doctors so you know divine healing we need divine healing you can't take it out of the atonement that's in there but do we have to depend on that for your soul survival no no your soul soul depends on the Word of God Jesus told them said don't worry about the guy that can kill your body he said worry about that guy that can kill your soul mm-hmm see what what kind of an old log gets in there what does it do this stops the flow of the water Elijah's vision showed him that out there in that wilderness right where the fruit was dried up don't start in your organization another rain or something just clean out the channels where the first rain can flow the waters there listen if you're not today let me tell you how you get into a revival a word revival is you remember when you got born again how fresh and new you don't want to do anything but listening to tapes read books talk to brothers come to church if you're not doing that now revive what that was before that means you're in a revival get back to those simple things the waters there across the same yesterday today and forever and that spit and rock was a wilderness still here tonight thank God Jesus cleaned it out for them at Calvary but they came right back around and throughout the logs back in blocked off all you know what it doesn't throw a log in a channel what does it well then all kind of dirt hits against the log and washes up the first thing you know you get all the water backed up like the beavers do and make a dam and you get nothing to go through it that's right we got too many beaver preachers today trying to dam all the water up and say this is ours this is just us here this belongs to us and what happens to it it becomes stagnated now it's water but it's not flowing water rivers of living water it doesn't say puddles puddles get stagnant rivers of living water I remain I you know back my brother Brandon was coming up you could really stop by the creek and pick you up a little bit of water and drink it because it came through all the rocks and all the things and it was purified you may not be able do that now because the man but it really is that's the best water there is its water that's cool water right out of a stream it becomes stagnated that's what's the matter with a lot of our organizations trying to back up the water for your organization it gets stagnated stagnated we don't want it to be stagnated we want that water that first saved us we want it to continue to flow freely we want to be able to sure how the gifts of God and all the different things live the life before others but do we really want a word revival do we really want not just the do's and don'ts but we want the word revival to where the word remember what I told many times before you think about this when Jesus walked on the earth he was God Almighty in human flesh right a man he was God Almighty in human flesh the fullness of the Godhead bodily okay one man but now he has given to us and now we're God in human flesh walking on the face of the earth and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us you and I are God made flesh we are God made manifest in another form so what are we to do act like it never was a time when Jesus like I said before Jesus didn't get up in the morning but mill today you come into the disciples and he said man I've had a problem with my daddy all day we've been disagreeing all evening he never said that vote he said I only do that what the father showed me so it had to be the Word of God listen Jesus's life was built around what that Old Testament said about him there was no New Testament he was writing the New Testament in his life but he lived the Old Testament that one quote on the great day of the feast you remember there was three feast that every Israelite boy man had to attend I can't remember mo but there's three of them all the time it says and the day of the feast Jesus was in the temple he didn't not do what the law said even when the leper was healed and all the different things he say go show yourself to the priest you go do the law of Moses remember he came under the law he fulfilled the law and then made that law live told somebody well you know you drop by and you're looking you see this big sinus it's got the ten commandments and you got all the Ten Commandments and the guy sitting on the porch drinking the beer smoking cigarette I mean what is that it's not a word revival you and I know better but that's what God promised what happened let's go here we'll quit right here we'll start this afternoon mmm we're gonna read this set of stage for this afternoon all right Amos eight let's go back to a mistake verse 11 behold the days come saith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread and a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea from North even to the east and they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst let's see what family means the word family in the Greek lexicon or Hebrew lexicon means hunger famine in the land or of Jehovah's word figuratively which is that's what it is because we have no hunger we know you're not hungry today if you're hungry today in a few minutes you're fixing to go get some food stores will be open you won't have to go down there and ration it out it's gonna be right there for you so it's a famine of hearing the Word of God lack of food famine in the land and the nation and famine of Jehovah's word figuratively there's four things a famine does anybody read listen to this and we'll stop and just as a ghetto guy you know eat and get more sleepy for the afternoon number one a famine moves people think about it who ever wanted to stay in a famine ridden land and I'll read it to you by four scriptures Ruth Abram David and Elisha a famine moves people number two it's because of a lack of water rain revival during the time of famine nothing growth there's no growth that's where you going logs from all that dead stuff and number four it kills things there's nothing live in the family it's all dead so now let's go to Genesis 12:10 just I'm gonna read you these four and then we'll stop right here this is 1210 and there was a famine in the land I read how many times have you eaten going through the Bible put in the word famine there's like 86 times every time you see a family and somebody moved alright there was a famine in the land and Abram went down to Egypt now I didn't bring the quote but brother Brown said that was Abraham's mistake he left the Promised Land because he thought he could find food somewhere else so he goes into Egypt he gives his wife away and all these different things totally gets out of the will of God but he moves now watch Ruth Ruth 1 verse 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife know who is this this is Naomi and her husband and her two sons as soon as they went down to wherever they were going to they died now we know for one thing's for sure if they hadn't went down there Ruth wouldn't come into being but there was a famine and they moved in the two sons and remember all the three sons the two sons and the husband died all right let's go to 2nd Samuel 21 then there was a famine in the days of David three years year after year and David inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered him said this is why you're having a famine it is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the Gibeonites Saul done something wrong God closed a family to come into Lynn first King 17 we'll get to these this afternoon we'll explain each one Elijah the Tishbite who is of the inhabitants of Gilead Senator Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do listen you can stand something when there's new on the ground a little something will grow member especially down here in the south you come outside in the morning especially in changing the seasons like we're coming to and the grounds just wet would do no do no rain and we know for three and a half years it didn't be said according to my word now what happened is musicians come what happened Elijah went to a widow woman and right in the middle of a famine God gave her plenty he said you bring me the last bit of foods you got the famine was so sore nothing grilled everything was dead she had just enough oil in just enough meal to make one cake and bacon you know brother branham explains all that we'll get into that this afternoon bake that cake and Dana she didn't need it she gave it to Elijah she obeyed the word of the Lord so disobeyed the word of the Lord and stayed in the famine for three years this lady this woman that this Elijah come to in the midst of a famine that lady if you'll do this for me your crews will never run dry every time you reach down and get a meal out of the barrel it'll appear right back again until this famine is over you'll not have a famine you'll live in the midst of this thing so a famine wait now a famine is bad but when the family moves you to the right place because what it is it's not a famine now for food physical food it's for the Word of God and if God moves you to a place where the Word of God is shunammite woman he is sustaining you during a time of famine promised over the whole world the worst famine has ever been is a famine for here in the Word of God list and that woman got down to her last one cup of meal and one little cup of oil to bake that one last cake she was right in the midst of the famine not at the end of it and she met Elijah and Elijah told her doesn't matter what goes on out in this world doesn't matter now there's already been condemnation in this world you don't worry about it though because you and your household will be saved you and your household will sustain life in the middle of this because what have you done you've found the water of living water of life and you're drawing from that you and I today draw from that water it's living water I've never seen anybody oh yeah you can drown but remember you can do without food for a long time but you can't do without water but just for a week or maybe seven ten maybe days water has life in it river of water there's a river of life flowing out through each and every one of us has the Elijah spoke to you folks I'm asking you that has Elijah spoke to you and told you don't worry about that family out there because I want to bring you the Word of God and I'm going to bring it through rivers five rivers of living water through five streams and it's going to sustain you through this dry land that they call the world that we live in you and I have been called out by nee Elijah prophet in the end time
