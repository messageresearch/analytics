head and we brought a little thought we're going to kind of weave it in a little bit tonight and uh we're going to keep the same title Son of Man part 120 but we're going to talk a little bit about the anointing there's an anointing uh if you haven't caught it yet sometimes times we we go through things and and we get almost to the end of the series like we are now and then the Lord will just say hey that's an did you tell them that was an anointing so because it is an anointing all these all these are anointings they are the faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience but now remember your birth is not an anointing your new birth is not an anointing all right everybody with me but all the other things that pile on top of that that's an anointing that comes on us and if we're not careful we'll get that anointing on our spirit and not let it go into our soul that's what we're working on with the Statue of perfect man all right so we'll get into that a little bit this afternoon so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this middle of the week Lord many are tired and weary and we pray Lord that you give them Supernatural strength father I pray that you be with us Lord in the furtherment of this service you be the active participant the one that takes over and does the speaking father Lord I pray that you be with the ones that are sick Lord sister fra went yesterday for those tests Lord and she was coughing up some blood Lord and we hadn't heard anything else but Lord we we know you're the great physician and you're the one that'll take care of her Lord we pray Lord that you'll take care of the ones Lord that are gone on vacation and different things and especially the ones that are heading to school Schools starting here in just a few weeks few days for some Lord I pray that you'd be with them and Lord cover them the whole time Lord that they're that they're there Lord and may they may they truly learn they have to learn their book knowledge and their knowledge of of how to navigate in this world but Lord may it be smoothed over with some spiritual knowledge and may that spiritual knowledge take over lord and when the natural knowledge leaves let the spiritual knowledge take over lord I pray that you do that tonight father anoint the speaker anoint the hearer father bless us and be with us the furth of this service in Jesus name we pray amen also remember the U missionaries will be coming in Camp Meeting missionaries will be coming so they'll be coming from all over the world and probably in September I mean August that's why I kind of left it open last three weekends in in August I'm sure we'll have a a um a foreign visitor somewhere in that time so we appreciate them coming in and uh also uh just for FYI in October brother Vernon manahan's going to be here from the Philippines he's the one that we send the money to so he comes I don't think he came last year but he come the year before or maybe because of covid they didn't get to come for a couple years he always tries to send us a an update on the money I mean he takes care of every penny every penny we send him he puts it somewhere and he writes it down he's a good accountant and he writes it all down and and then he will give you a uh a report that that money you send that we send from the church we give some to the brother Danny some to brother Nester and different ones and it pays for their plane tickets or plays for pays for their boat ticket or pays for something to take them out into the highways and byways um brother Dell many years ago used to send money for buildings and churches and stuff like that we don't do that anymore it's best to give it to a person and let a person take it and go and preach the gospel they let them build their own stuff uh their own building they they'll love it more if they build their own I know we do help some and we have helped some some of the newer ones but some of the older ones that we help now it's mainly for Ministry to go out in books and tapes or or or take a take the gospel to uh back in somewhere in the Philippines that something nobody would want to I wouldn't want to go and they will go all right that like brother landland different ones we give him some money to to buy a van and he is using it he's sent me a picture the other day he used it so much he run the wheel off of it or run the tire off of the wheel so uh he had to buy him a new a new tire but U we did help him buy the van so let's let's just uh we love the Lord I want you to know where your money's going I really do I want you to know that it's not just you're not just putting it in a plate and it's just going out Into Thin Air it is being used for the gospel always has and always will be all right so don't don't feel um that your money is being you know wasted it's being used all around the world you'll never know you will know in the Millennium you will know maybe in the future home how much as as brother Andre and different ones go overseas and some lady says I got a i some of you that weren't there brother Andre was telling a story that he was at where was he where was he Guyana Guyana he's in Guyana on a mission trip and some sister walked up to him and said do you know this brother in other words so is brother Dale one huh she had one tap she had one tape she had got a hold of a tape and it was brother Dale and it helped her so much so you never know you know yeah we may we may not be always preaching to the to the crowd may be preaching to the ones overseas so you never know but we appreciate brother Joe and the different ones for putting this thing out and getting it out to the people we sure appreciate all of you that has anything to do with that so let's in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can sit down I know I maybe have you stand up too long but keeps you from sleeping Philippians 2:3 says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory see we've come here to brotherly kindness and I was thinking just the other day how that brotherly kindness can be the most Comm cing thing you ever uh that you ever experienced or it can be the most traumatic thing you've ever experienced everybody with me on that it can be you you can uh rub elbows and and and and be all right or rub elbows and as brother dick always said uh my spirit May irritate your demons so Philippians 2:3 says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves and I think that's what we should do as a church and we do that um and I'll read something where brother Brown tell he said it's not in other words it's not hard to have brotherly kindness as an individual but as a group it's hard to hold I'm going to read you and I I'll tell you why he why we said that because as an individual you can have somebody who just like brother Andre we were talking about and we gave him those accolades this weekend brother and is one of the meekest men that I know he just never raises his voice he got got a little excited Sunday afternoon after the service is over but he's really just even kill nothing really you know upsets him and he he's just even killed with the people and and they're comfortable with him and I'm comfortable with him and and I just appreciate a a brother that can do that he can stand in the middle and grab both hands and put them together where some of us some of us may not be able to do that all right but we're working on it he's still working on Me 1 Corinthians 2:12 now we're going to get up to the Holy Spirit and we're going to talk about it maybe a little bit at the end of the service but I want to cover something here just a second 1 Corinthians 2:12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god so we had the spirit of the world right all right uh we had our conversation in times past and the lust of the Flesh and all pride of life and all those different things that Paul Paul tells us about all right I saw something the other day it was a state that said I wonder what Paul thought when he stepped over on the other side and saw the ones that he had persecuted and killed there had killed he didn't kill them he had them killed right because they were Christians he was having Christians persecuted and they were being killed and now they're in the sixth Dimension wherever Paul's group is and then Paul walks over there and after he dies and they're like oh h no that was a joyous meeting because those people you know what I believe they really truly didn't blame Paul as a true Christian you don't blame another person I had a person tell me one time said you've caused me to lose all my friends you never had them to start with an outside person cannot cause you to lose friends you only cause you to lose friends right all right it's not what somebody else does to lose a real friend right or a real brother like I said before you know and I read it where brother R talks about in individuals it's not it can be held but in a group is the whole issue that we have to as a group as a body we've got to all come to brotherly kindness all right if we can't love them here we sure not how we going to get them over there now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so when we get the spirit this Spirit of adoption or Spirit of of Truth truth our spirit of the new birth then it puts us in line to understand these things as I was telling them Sunday now you can you can you can read the quote where brother Bri says you know God give you the Holy Ghost and he give you everything for your journey well that's true but he also gave you 10 fingers 10 toes sorry Thomas 10 fingers 10 toes two eyes he gave you all that equipment now what you do with it is your business all right so he gave you the Holy Ghost now what you do it with it is your business all right which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth now that now your Holy Ghost is a teacher we know that tutors Governors till we come to what but see it that's talking about coming to adoption that's bringing us to full stature which is that thing right there see this down here is a birth everybody with me this is a birth this is an anointing right you don't get born twice but it says being born again but you understand it's not like the justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you weren't born again I mean you weren't Eternal now you are you can't get Eternal again you're already Eternal you just add to so that's what we're talking about tonight we're going to add to this as we go up to Statue perfect man we're going to add to these things but it's which the Holy Spirit teacheth look comparing spiritual things with spiritual We Are Spiritual people brother M told us he said we're eaglets we're little Messiahs We Are Spiritual people we're supposed to be I know we live in a natural lot but we're supposed to be to where we can discern or have a little bit of spirituality about us especially when it comes to the word of God and if somebody's teaching or preaching something in error it should be something that that a little a little you know a little bell should go off somewhere all right everybody with me so s Peter besides this so besides your new birth besides getting that down into your soul everybody with me here and besides this besides this divine nature going into your soul giving all diligence add though you're adding or you're anointing cuz you can have many thousands of anointings remember last Sunday the devil was anointed he was an anointed Sheriff he was the first anointed one right he was anointed to do his job all right and then till iniquity was found in him and when iniquity was found in him then he became the devil but he was Lucifer when he began all right and God created him he said I created you perfect until iniquity was found in you but we as Christians we add we add these anointings because Paul had an anointing he was the first church age messenger had an anointing brother Brown as many times I told you before they had a box that they were that they they stay in they were confined to that box Moses couldn't get into Noah's message Noah couldn't get into Moses message all right Paul couldn't get into irenius is message and irenius couldn't get into Martin's message so you understand what I mean they had a certain message they had to bring or a certain anointing right that's what we preached on Sunday anointed for a purpose all right there's an anointing comes that's a purpose it has a God doesn't just listen he even anoints anointed ones for a purpose amen yes sir to almost deceive the very lack that's because that's what the Bible says right all right amen so to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience we're going to add these virtues or add these anointings and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity and we'll get to that in just a little bit but we were talking about this weekend I want to show you something real quick I know y'all we've been through Genesis 1:26 but remember it says let us make man in our image after our likeness so that's not an anointing that's a person that's an extension of God everybody with me amen that wasn't all mankind that's just the bride that's not the 144,000 that's not the fifth seal Jew that's not anybody in the Old Testament everybody with me that was an extension of God that's God's attribute his own children his own children are only the ones that's going to be birthed by a new birth into the kingdom of God all right everybody with me but there are anointings you can be anointed uh brother R even says Eve was anointed but who anointed her God didn't anoint her the devil did all right Cain was anointed to kill Abel right right let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion we see that there's something about this group of people that's special God set aside this group of people and he wanted this image see he said created man his own image and image of God created him male and female so we know there are male and female created he them that makes the brothers and sisters that's why we're we call each other brother and sister CU that like I said that denotes the family all right I have a natural brother and a natural sister I don't have to call them brother or sister but I do you because you're not part of my natural family you're part of my spiritual family all right if I get too fast just tell me cuz I got something I need to get to real quick so God created man his own image the image of God created him now look whatever that image is it's of God that image was not the devil that image was not an angel that image is you every son and daughter of God since the day of Pentecost ad30 right amen was created in God's image or formed in God's image now remember this part of God was not created like Lucifer was Lucifer was literally created he was nothing then here's Lucifer God created Lucifer and said you be the anointed cherub you be the one that goes up and down and and and you be my song leader and you go from Heaven he still goes from Heaven to Hell and back and forth and up to heaven amen he walks among all that God's G him that Liberty to walk anywhere he wants to but when you're born again he cannot walk in your soul praise God there that's why that's what I want you to see is like I was saying you God Is So encapsulated inside of you he can't even get out you got to let him out somebody ought to let it out oh somebody put that on a t-shirt so God created man in his own image and the image of God created him male and female created them so that's the birth not the anointing are not the adoption some of this group of people right here will not come to adoption right lots of them will not a lot of these people that God created in his own image were working as we were talking about Sunday you look in the Book of Luke and you see that that there was a book handed Jesus and it was closed Jesus sat down and opened the book so Jesus Christ is the only one that can open the book and close a book amen all right so he was handed a closed book he read opened it up read out of it identified who he was have you ever tried that when you come to church every Sunday you should open your book and identify who you are and then you can say as we said Sunday and as brother randam said during his tenure and Jesus during his this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears this day all right and it's not a 24-hour day it's the day of the Lord it's today for us to come to adoption it's the day for us to come to the change of the body it's for us to come to the son of man Ministry that when God when Jesus was sitting there who was he he was the son of man so he when he closed that book and handed it back to the priest they just didn't realize in symol form but that's when God shut the book right no one understood him no one was born again at the time and then even on the day of Pentecost he only let a certain piece or portion of itself out the book was still closed it's been closed until Revelations 107 when that Mighty angel came down that Mighty Angel brought a scroll you want if you want to say it's the same scroll he had in the temple that's okay with me I don't care but he opened the book and he opened a book and he handed it to the seventh angel messenger and that seventh angel messenger handed it to us making us the final voice to the final age that you and I have come to a birth but we've also come to anointing the anointing that we have in the end time is to come to the son of man Ministry the open book the son of man was sitting there in the temple with the book open that's right right everybody all them denominations that was sitting in that Temple the the Bible said they fasted their eyes on him there was an anointing there brother Brown said it was the greatest anointing that was ever on a person right he opened a book read where he was at brother George he closed the book back handed it back to the priest and they said precious words proceeded out of his mouth brother briam said and I'll read it cuz I'll probably do that series maybe a little bit on anointing but brother Brown said you would think that with that power or that great of an anointing that people would be shouting speaking in tones running all over the building he said he sat down in Precious words proceeded out of his mouth you know what he said anointing was it's supreme power in control all right and without these virtues remember he was The Virtue sitting there he was it he was sitting there with the virtues in him he was The Headstone had the whole cap he was everything he was the fullness of the godhead bodily you and I are part of that but he was the fullness and he was walking God on two feet but I remember he had to have an anointing cuz even there in Luke he said he has anointed me to preach so on the so on the River Jordan when that Dove came down and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's what he said to you at the new birth Jesus didn't need a new birth that's right but he needed that anointing because for 29 and a half years they call it the silent years he never said a word that we needed except when he was 13 he kind of jumped on the scene and and and said something and then back off for you know 10 more years 15 more years nothing why that anointing that time of anointing John the Baptist had to grow up John the Baptist had to come to fruition John the Baptist had to come to his message which was very short but he had to come to that message CU he was the one to introduce the head which is who Christ right right but this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell then he had an anointing on the River Jordan that anointing was for his ministry to preach for three and a half years and to preach the the the hardest three and a half years of his life he probably wasn't uh from 29 and a half down he probably you know he was probably quiet didn't have a lot of family or friends or something but he had a bunch of brothers and sisters the Bible tells us and his daddy died or his his chosen Daddy on Earth had passed away early Joseph so he didn't have a real daddy so he was just kind of I mean I don't think he's wandering around all over the place and doing like we did going to shows and drinking and smoking and gambling and all that stuff no he didn't do that cuz he was the Holy Ghost he didn't need the Holy Ghost he had that already that control was already in him he was a proper child as they talk about Moses but at 13 He said it must be about my father's business he knew what his position was coming to he just didn't know exactly what it was but when he got down on that River Jordan and that anointing didn't just fall on him and then leave it fell on him and went in him you know what we were talking about it Sunday for those of you that weren't there the word anointing actually means to smear like peanut butter on a sandwich or or pore and know what happened in the Old Testament as a type they couldn't get the oil of the Holy Ghost Inside of of Mo of Aaron so they poured oil over him and smeared it all over him all the way down to the Hem of His of His Garment right so that's what the word anointing means actually it means to smear smear me smear smear smear this virtue smear knowledge Temperance patience just smear it all over me so that's what anointing means so we have the birth and then we have the anointing now we're going to talk to that that anointing is going to come to a a part that we've got to come to and brother R in 1960 he said now what is adoption let me get to this I don't know whether uh there's a lot of people in the message that just don't preach on adoption but it's important that we come to that position cuz brother R says look your adoption is not your birth right it's your placing amen amen we have wandered for I'm sorry we have wandered for 60 years what the prophet of God said wandering through the Wilderness wondering what he said wondering why he said these things wondering why he said well you these virtues are are required it's required for your adoption it's required for your placing amen and placing is where we want to be the problem was they got misplaced in the new world or in Canaan they got misplaced right this one married this one this one married this one they married the Canaanites they married the amorites they mingled and mingled and mingled well that's what the devil wanted to do and that's what he's done with us he took us he brought the pure word of God through William Mar brandham he come to adoption he came to hear ye him in 1963 somewhere in there the book opened and he started preaching the seals amen amen and he preached the greatest messages he'd ever preached before the most anointed he said this is the most anointed I've ever been preaching the seal the week of that of the seals everybody with me brother George Smith was there uh Friday and uh George is George but I like him I don't mind I like being around if you look in those pictures that Joe's got I'm with him 90% of the time cuz we're talking about things but he he was he's got a new seal book and it's got a few things it's not changed but um brother Brown would say four like before well they changed it to before because if you translate it you can't translate for f o r e not f r so you can't translate that so he kind of you know put added or massaged it a little bit he said but anyway he asked me he said brother wait he said what is the most important part of that seal book what is the most important of either message or most important quote in that whole sale book I said brother George you w't believe it I said the greatest quote in that whole seal book that I can identify with is on the questions and answers on the seals when brother randam said it's not for you rightl so that took it that took that anointing it could not fall on no one in that building he said it's not for you you're not supposed to get it so who's it for me I can't identify with that I can understand the fifth seal whether it's you know it's the Jews under the altar crying how long I can see the seventh seal I can see the the the white horse rider and all those things but and and that identifies sure in my journey but that was brother brandham standing there he was prophesying he said you're not supposed to get it right but right around the coming of the Lord there'll be a group of people in other words paraphrasing that's going to get it so that's the greatest quote in the book for me it turned that whole anointing to where there's no there's no question to anybody sitting in that room in 1963 that said I got it no you didn't you might have got your portion cuz remember brother Ram he kind of backed up he said just go on and live a good Christian simple Christian Life right he said don't try to twist he said if you get all messed up you'll twist yourself away from it why it wasn't time the anointing was not there yet the anointing had to be on a bride that could come to adoption that could come to a body change and that the son of man Ministry would take over and would preach the same three and a half year message that the Lord Jesus did 2,000 years ago you said there's no way you can do that well watch that's what me and brother Andre was talking about you just watch people say well we can't get it right all the time we ain't perfect Jesus Christ never had a problem with his Doctrine and it was perfect amen now he might have talked as a human he might have said that old Fox he might have said let's go on vacation let's go do this let's go do that he was a human being but when he said I only speak that which the father tells me that was God allmighty talking to us and he can't get it wrong cuz it was the word that we dep depend on we I don't just put my dependence on salvation I know he died for me I put my dependence on that every word he spoke I can receive in my heart and if I let him out and do his work he'll make me as perfect as he is that's why he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect so your adoption is your placing right all right so we want to be placed I want to know my position you should want to know your position well I don't know I just come to church well coming to church may be a position for some of y'all right really you know what brother Brown said adoption was a little wash woman going to abouty her daily duty but she knew her place amen the man with a lunchbox of course we don't carry those anymore but used to Thomas does oh you carry lunch box too Mickey Mouse Donald up Batman let's stand we're going to pray for Louise oh bless you is you got thermos in it man come on but anyway Thomas does care but that's a lunch boox if he's doing his job under the word of God under the anointing of the hour that he's in he's just as powerful come on he's just as powerful as a messenger standing behind here if he'll stay in his position the problem is we haven't all stayed in our position everybody with me on that when we were born again John 117 I believe when we were born of the spirit of God we are the sons of God now that was also in Romans that we receive the spirit of adoption when you're born again you receive the spirit of adoption not adoption the spirit where in other words you come into that Open Door you come into that place where you can be adopted listen you got to be in the family before you can be adopted all right so you got to be a son and daughter of God then you come to your placing then you listen for 10 years 15 years 30 years 40 years 50 years and God somewhere along the way something clicks and you say that's where I'm supposed to be amen but we were predestinated here's what I'm trying to get to you for this sons of the last day that's us we were predestinated unto adoption amen amen the Masterpiece brother R talks about we know that that the marring of the Masterpiece there was a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful until what Satan did during the rest period during you know God was resting and trusting in his Masterpiece his enemy came in found the Great Masterpiece and he crawled under the garden walls and he marred this beautiful Masterpiece he marred it but now remember he goes on and tells us and and why I want to talk about anointing you look and see that that the marring of the of the statue made the Statue the Masterpiece right there could have been many many many many many statues of Moses but the one that Michelangelo looked at and the one he got so inspired or anointed till he HD it on the knee with his hammer and said speak to me in other words you're so live till you're you're exactly what the image was and we've always said that too that's what we've been waiting on to Genesis 126 man come to that full image that God saw before the foundation of the world brother George amen and you know what he done he smoted Us by putting us in human flesh but the Maring is what makes us a masterpiece amen the Maring is what made him a redeemer the Maring is what made him a Healer the Maring is what made him all the other compound names of Jehovah and all the different things that you call the Prince of Peace the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley Adam listen to me Adam didn't know those titles he knew him as father he knew him as Creator but he didn't know him sure later on he knew him as a savior but he didn't know him like me and you know him as a savior everybody with me because what it wasn't the time it got marred so he had to take that Genesis 1 126 man put it back not so much on the Shelf but put it in his bosom put put it in his breast put it in his heart and hold on to those names in the book mine yours Paul Peter James John now listen there's different sections Moses and all those different ones they're in that section but they're not in that section they're not in the Genesis 126 section sure they'll be given eternal life but you're going to see in just a minute we already talked about it Moses and all these different ones they were anointed something would come on them so strong till they would prophesy or they would call fleas and flies and frogs David could write all these Psalms and just be so anointed to where God said oh he's a man after my own heart but then when out anointed would leave him he'd be a murderer Moses murderer because power without character look at Samson Sams son was so anointed his anointing was to slay the Philistines God cursed them the amachi Philistines are he cursed him and he put Samson on the earth to take care of the Philistines and what did he do he fell by them why because he had an anointing that would come on him he could lift the gates of the city up pick this building up and set it over two feet and he wasn't much bigger than Jonas right but it was power without character David Samson even Abraham Jacob Noah Saul Elisha all these different ones and we were talking this weekend about David and the anointing on David was was to be a king all right now I think that I thought the anointing according to Revelations 5 was for me and you to be Kings and Priests all right so let's start acting like it let's start taking the full benefit of that amen 1965 doing God a service now notice in this now David thought he had everything in order now what he's doing is now he's he say he trying to do God a service without it being his will what did David do David was anointed in his own self come on right he knew the law he knew that thing had to be carried by priest remember when the ark was coming back in he put it on a cart and it almost fell over and a man reached and just try trying to do go trying to do right he reached him grabbed it but when he did God struck him dead because he can't go against his own law he can't go against his own word so but that one was on David right now notice David thought he had everything in order and he was inspired see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing that's right Moses couldn't come with Noah's message we can't come listen Luther's message put thousands hundreds of thousands in the bride Methodist John Wesley hundreds of thousands millions Dwight Moody brother B said millions I guess he said but they were trinitarians they were working under a closed book they can only see through a glass Darkly they could only see the part that God wanted them to do because you can take Luther's anointing today and just be justified and die and go to hell that's right right but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be anointed look with the Holy Ghost now listen Moses wasn't anointed by the devil to create flies fleas and frogs that was God cuz God's your only Creator Satan can't create Satan can imitate and impers but he can't create all right the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark as pitch that's where you get the quote and where brother Brown says in another place that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell that's the same thing this is saying right here all right the cleur grows on the same water puts life into the wheat puts life into the cuur but at the bottom of the cuur it's got cuur life it's rejoicing blooming got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is a clear see false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost that's right anointing ones at the end time and perform just as many miracles amen as the true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it in other words they can't put the word together and make it stick they can't put the word together and make it right 1959 let us see God brother R said for in the Bible it said there was Set uh this is Brother L said this many many times and and um me and brother Richard Wilson was talking about this and you know everybody's trying to do away with the fivefold ministry right not everybody but you know you know who and you know where all right everybody with me press play that's the way you know yeah it might be the way but it may not be the way you want to go right for in the Bible it said there was set Apostles prophets evangelist teachers pastors all these for the perfecting of the church all right are we are we good right here God set them in the church brother Brown didn't put them in the church brother Brown can't take them out Joseph brandham can't put them in he can't take them out God set him in the church but look now watch watch how brother Brown separates this though totally clears everything up for me I mean what it wasn't unclear but if somebody ever says anything about it just read them this quote they like to put on tapes press play with that one on it they kind of skip over that one God set them in the church now there's nine spiritual gifts look we can lay on hands and so forth and pray earnestly for the best gifts and so forth in other words anointings AA Allen was anointed when he was praying for the sick and people got healed AA Allen didn't heal them God healed him but he was anointed but he was an alcoholic okay but those others are predestinated gifts of God what those other Apostles prophets pastors so listen if they're predestinated by God there's not a man on this Earth can take that out I don't care what you say you made brother Brown the fivefold ministry amen back in 1960 maybe the 65 I'll agree with you he fulfilled them all but he's gone and those predestinated gifts did not leave with him amen God this is the second time brother Brown said that God sets them in the church they are predestinated in other words they're predetermined they are predestinated eternally from God if you were a preacher here you're going to be a preacher there amen you're here you going to be a prophet there amen now watch Through the Ages that's coming now watch what he what he says here John the Baptist was a special runner for that age what the age of the neck the age of the introducing of the head from the Old Testament he stood in the middle to introduce the head or the New Testament all right nobody else could take his place he was the third coming of a elah and nobody else is that just as brother RS the fourth coming of Elijah nobody can take his place all right amen God just for ordained him to do that work remember there was no Miracles done he just stood in the water and said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that was his message right amen do you believe that sure he did Jesus said did you go see a prophet more than a prophet see John didn't know that but Jesus knew it hear you him 1958 brother R says speak the word the Lord he's praying if that would be sufficient but God's good he has set in the church gifts first apostles or missionaries both the same Apostle means one scent missionary means one scent Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors they're all predestinated this is the second quote they are all predestinated gifts of God gifts and without repentance they're placed in the church all right who's going to take them out who's going to take them out you better not take them out you've added to or you've took away and I know what that happens in The Book of Revelations they're placed in the church to bring the church together hold it together for the glory of God hold it together Corinthians says now all these things happen for examples and they are written for our admonition in other words the Old Testament on whom the ends of the world are come that word example means a figure formed or blown or an impression a mark of a stroke that's what we were talking about the Maring a pattern of warning everything in the Old Testament was a pattern of warning to us right amen cuz they didn't have the Holy Ghost right in their soul they had an anointing and they had a position Moses had a position Noah had a position each one had a message all right but they were not born again Sons and Daughters of God right only you and I because it took Jesus Christ to come here with this book that was supposed to come out in the Old Testament which wasn't Old Testament then back in the beginning of time he had this book with him and it was closed and he took it with him where to Calvary brother Brown said and then he was what he was open his side was open and the bride came out Genesis 1: 126 came out of that man eternal life came out so that you and I could be born again amen right when Jesus said you must be born again there was not one person during his life time ever fulfilled that he said oh no John the Baptist he got the Holy Ghost in in the mother's Holy Ghost he didn't say New Birth remember they're different that's right y'all know that I don't have to tell you so let's go to brotherly kindness real quick and besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and the godl brotherly kindness so now that's the anointing we're talking about so let's let's make it an anointing let's make it to where it's going to have to be something that's going to fall on us and smear it like peanut butter or honey cuz brother r talk about honey be and brotherly kindness here in just a few minutes with that dream of sister Shepherd is everybody with me wake up all right you can go to sleep tomorrow wake up today don't go to sleep going home I bet you won't well act like you're driving right I've always wanted to do that somebody be asleep you get over and get real close to the face I'm afraid I get hit brothers and sisters when you call when you look at brotherly kindness and sisterly kindness it denotes the you're from the same family when we when brother Andre head he's my brother he's in the same family all right sister of Joyce same family all right we it denotes the same family and that's what we got to look at when we call somebody brother that means that you have Kindred you are in the same family by the new birth all right now if they don't have it that's their business but if they're your brother and they're sitting here long enough they going to be they going to get born again you just you just have to I want everybody to be born again amen I want and I want to thank everybody Born Again amen but your fruit tree will bear whether you are or not amen so now sixthly add brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter I'm going to read something to you in just a few minutes John 13:34 said a new commandment I give unto you now remember he's come had all the old Commandments he knew the law he knew exactly where to find himself when he sat down in Luke and pulled a scroll now remember it wasn't a book it was a scroll so he had to unfold Scroll after scroll to find Isaiah but when he did boom he found it and I to me it just illuminated because he saw that was him how many times you've been reading the Bible Genesis 1:26 me that just that just resonates that's me that just proves where I came from and prove what I got and what family I'm in now amen a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you because remember the Old Testament was you shoot me I shoot you you kill my brother I kill you you commit adultery a lot of people die if it was in the new commandment praise God for grace that you love one another as I have loved you that you all also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you love if you have love one to another or an outward display of affection under what we know as the New Testament everybody with me on that CU remember in the Old Testament you could look on a woman and lust after her and as long as you didn't touch her you were fine right that's what the Bible says but now Jesus said now I'm going to bring you into a new commandment here sir uh the Bible says Thou shalt not kill I'm going to read you where brother Brown says if you kill somebody's influence you've killed the brother right all right but let your communication be yay yay nigh nay for whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy that's in the Old Testament right but I say unto you love your enemy enemies bless them that curse you how many of us have done that okay do good to them that hate you like Bob last Wednesday night there's a holy hush going on here start talking about Pride you start talking about selfishness you start talking about me and you and and our little anyway do good to them that hate you and pray pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that don't mean one time I'm talking about persecute you John 15:9 says as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in that love in other words continue ye in my Agape not my felo if you keep my command my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love what is the love of God it's the truth it's not a sloppy affection where you got to go hug everybody and say I love you no you got to love the truth if you love the truth that'll set you free and if you love the truth you'll love your brother look that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full you won't be wowy wowy woo if you love everybody and really mean it amen well they got to love me they they got my right agape love is unconditional you got to remember that feel your love is conditional agape love cannot be conditional amen God Loved Us in remember God loved us when we were what unlovable this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you amen Divine love and Sovereign Grace 1956 we're facing a day that prophesy this is 1956 um coming up on 70 years in 2026 now we are faced in a day that's prophesied to us that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible remember he goes to and he tells you he said God God's going to come to you and say hey what gift do you want you want the gift the preaching you want to gift the healing you want to gift of this he said take all them but give me love wow take all them but give me that agape love I was reminded this weekend before brother Woodby passed away I know some of you don't know him some of you do he did mind in June's wedding and he was a minister in the church we were at for a long time but he come he went to a we had a fellowship breakfast up at Ruth and brother Richard and brother Woodby were sitting together and then I came in and they were chuckling and uh and I didn't ask I just walked up you know and brother Richard said yeah brother would be you're right well well he didn't tell they just went on and didn't say anything after that but Brother Richard came to me a little bit later and he said you know why we were laughing I said no he said brother would be lean and I mean they was probably a hundred ministers cuz it's ministers breakfast only ministers could come so there's probably a hundred ministers in that room he said brother WBY kind of looked around you know and leaned over and he said reckon how many doctrines is in this room I would have said a hundred different sad but true right and a lot of it is pride and selfishness listen when you stand for the truth you're going to be hated literally hated you're going to be ostracized you're going to be not allowed in a pull pit I told you that time before some of you don't know it we went to Ruth meeting one time and there was about 600 of us under that brush Arbor and they were just shouting and the preacher was preaching and he he preached this you know 5 minute sermon that was totally not true right J we were all there we were all Brother Richard we were talking about it last weekend Brother Richard Wilson and his some of his people were here and Dad mom me June I don't know who else was over here but they were all you know 5 probably 80 of them were just throwing sawdust they sawdust on the floor they were just having a a a a shouting I mean shouting over that false Doctrine right 570 or 80 of them we sat there like bumps on a pickle I'm sure we were talked about afterwards cuz whoever this brother was preaching he was supposed to be you know he was like the high Echelon of ministers which he is a good brother and he does say some good things but that one thing was totally false and we knew that because we've been taught well but we sat there I'm not going to shout about something that's not true but buddy they all would I mean when they got finished they just kind of looked down that row and we were just sitting there kind of odd but that's what standing for the truth is that's what knowing the difference in the truth and error amen and thank God we had a good teacher that give us a good foundation we didn't have to learn it when we got there we walked in and when that thing went off we went like ding that's not true that's not right right can't be right that's right all right so you can say whatever you want to but I sure appreciate good teaching amen so let's talk about selfish just for a minute to be selfish is to be concerned excessively excessively with oneself selfies and I and me and oh W is me and and selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and each other I want to put that in there and inspiring relationships with other people that many of us desire that's well true 2 Timothy 3:2 says for men shall be lovers of their own selves well they had already prophesied and told them that's exactly what's going to happen Covetous boasters proud Pride blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy we get up there to that meeting Saturday and what' Joel Brown Say or Andre who which one was it Andre or brother he said parents I mean kids pray for your parents it was Joel brother Joel Brown and I knew he didn't I knew he didn't listen to me so that must have come from God that must be God wanting us to know something cuz he said he said kids pray for your parents so that was good so maybe there there something to that kids pray for your parents I tell you that's what's a whole lot of the matter with people today they're not friendly like they used to be the people has got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a little world by themselves you know that's the truth I despise oh brother brandom he despises God hates don't get quiet on me God hates there are several things he hates I despise that old somebody feel they're bigger than somebody else after all you're six foot of Earth that's all you are that's right everybody the word became flesh and India trip I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming on me so in other words he wasn't exempt from a selfish Spirit coming on him all right saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong he said God's the one to tell him about it all right let's go to the next one same message he comes to another quote another part of the sermon he said I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to study in the scriptures that is that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts at me told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now that I was sitting in the yard and I told her she had reminded me I told her about it I said honey I got to a place till I've become critical of people I don't want to be whose job is it it's not mine God's the one to criticize not me Jubilee year 1954 brother Brown said I'm not going to ask you how many made the consecration but I believe many of you did and myself I did in My Heart Lord take that critical spirit from me and you know what that's what I despise I despise somebody that can't do nothing but criticize I just can't be around them don't want to be around them don't even want to listen to them constantly can't find one good thing I told somebody the other day I said that we were talking about somebody at work we were talking about somebody and uh we were talking about them being critical and I said well if they wanton a two billion one billi Lottery they'll complain cuz they didn't win too there are some people in this world that if you totally healed them and gave them 10 billion dollar they'd still find something to complain about right y'all know I'm right you know those people I hope they're not here now I don't criticize people to their face now watch brother I'm done criticize so he wasn't going to say oh you know brother Bob he it's a little bit but he's weird but in my heart I'm going to say the same thing Bob's weird but in my heart I do I see a lady walking down the street especially see she's not dressed proper I say isn't that awful in my heart I don't say it to nobody else after all that's her business she's a free moral agent that's why we get our problem is we get into other people's business well I'm going to preach anyway and y'all just be quiet like Pride I'm going to get any Pride here and just minute Bob didn't cover it enough I'm going to smear it she's a free moral agent she ain't got no right to do it Christ bought her life but maybe she doesn't understand amen so it's not for me to criticize let God do it when I'm in the pull pit now watch he he backs up he says when I'm in the pull pit I preach the gospel the best way I know how and the rest of it I commit to God he didn't save nobody he didn't change nobody's mind he didn't make no woman quit cutting the hair cuz he obviously he kept saying I get come back year and year and year and you cut more you cut more it probably got to him that's why he became critical Lord I I preach these Pentecostal women and instead of their hair getting longer they get shorter every year he said I come back same way with some around here you know you tell them they need to be in church and two sniffles and a cat with diarrhea and they'll be gone for two weeks Christians come to church all I got to say always Christians always come to church all right make Believers come every once in a while unbelievers come on Christmas and Easter like I did that's what's the matter with people today now brother BR that's what the matter with people today they're trying to pack up to be a Christian if there's anything you need is unpacking to be a Christian get too many got too many things hanging on now one of them said now mother you know couldn't go unless I took my card table with me or my iPad or my S and U y'all ever find that app I was talking about that app that's on all your phones it's not new it's been there forever look on the side it says off yeah some of you don't do it cuz the the baell start going off every once in a while people you know who it is cuz they don't sit there and reach like this they go they dive in their pocketbook so it's women anyway um because you know the other boys wouldn't appreciate me going along if I didn't have my card table and all these other little things and you have a little box of selfishness you have to hang on to that you have to hang on to tattling backbiting little of this hang on hang it on your camel well you hanging on enough he's going to get both like what's old saying it's the straw that what broke the camel's back straw it's the little things the old camel can't can't hardly move he's mashed down so hard till he's bowlegged almost that's what our problem is we a bunch of bowle Christians we got somebody hanging on to us let it out let it go oh you see it's coming up Bob look at the bottom down there uhoh you started it you need to unload wash up clean up get right amen pride is a noun Bob didn't bring that out but I'm going to a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from your own personal achievements amen I prayed for this one I did this I did that it was my I didn't bring it but I was going to and Bob may have read it I can't remember but the Bible says pride comes before a fall pride comes before a fall God is not going if you're a Christian God's not going to let you stay prish you will fall amen and you will get a weapon like you never got before cuz remember pride is not just for sinners for us too cuz why would brotherly kindness be up there and it tell us not to have pride not to have selfishness not to be selfish the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated are from qualities possessions that are widely admired Bible says proud boasters I'm proud to be a Christian and I'm proud of Jesus Christ doing what he did but that's not being prish that's being proud that you got a perfect Heavenly Father Blasphemous names real quick brother Brown said look now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church now this is the the dream of sister Shepherd which goes along with the stature of a perfect man he was telling us this now Blasphemous names I think was the next Sunday that's why in Blasphemous names the first hour and a half he preached Blasphemous names he preaches he preaches the statue of perfect man again and brings a few more details that he didn't in the other sermon all right now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church what happened was remember Sister Shepherd saw this man up on top of this mountain pouring pure water into a box Well the box wouldn't hold it the box was leaking and running out all over the place all right now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church but the church body is altoe like the this Tabernacle will'll say that's where she comes to church talking about sister Shepherd this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body a group therefore it runs out right but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church it was him right he just didn't say it was he knew it was cuz he saw the vision right pouring the message into the church or bride but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash right that was in it pride selfishness boastful that's what the whole Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age I got just through telling C of Brotherly kindness the age that we live in that was back the week before now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so and something like that but just like something happened to him brother your heart's broke it just nearly killed you now here's where he he he stops he says see now watch we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another individually but to maintain in a group of people where everybody loves everybody with brotherly kindness hard to do that's just what brother Brown said right here right why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar or you will tonight taking communion you Fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother oh by the way time out do y'all want to take if y'all want to take communion this next weekend you can or you can wait you you decide who wants to have communion Sunday who wants to wait boy you only one so we're waiting oh a couple we're waiting I don't mind if y'all take communion if I'm not here brother Bob can do it well nobody voted to you didn't even vote you're supposed to write this is yes no you don't it's over with now the AR door shut we'll do it the next weekend blame it on you you you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and you might do something in the flesh he might do something that you would disagree with because you just kind of stay look which you ought to do but shun him a little I'm going to let that sink in but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it kill you or that sister I'm an old man I was once young now I'm old I've seen it down through the age do what I hear people say I just won't have no more to do with him see we got to break down those walls of petition just as we were talking about this weekend there are walls they need to be broke down all right we need to have brotherly well they don't have that's condition I love you if you love me that's not what the Bible says that is not the Bible never said that the Bible says you love them whether they love you or not that's why it's hard to do oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love how many times don't raise your hand but how many times have you have something against somebody and they pass away and you never were able to tell them that's what that's talking about oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him because why because the pride a little bit of I I me me I'm right you're wrong that's right well in that case you're wrong hello this is a prophet telling us how to have brotherly kindness and you look at me crosseyed right like it's something like it's something strange this message was preached 50 60 years ago we should be able to we should have already read this message 100 times I like Blasphemous names it's a good messag amen and right there's where it is oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey which is what brotherly love will always stick Hebrews 12:14 says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled remember brother brownman a word to a church to the church it's right in there on the wall oh I no it's downstairs brother Brown said don't let that come in B Tabernacle don't let that root of bitterness come in he said if something comes in what he say do stick tighter together amen what that's the honey the brotherly kindness the brotherly love anything we're going through we should stick together instead of pulling apart brother Brown said the only thing that matters get all these little differences away from you little ism little funny feelings around you for Brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soulen wow if you do it'll canker you now those of you that are not Southerners that means ruin or you stank canker means to spoil right keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow right amen amen if you can't do that you need you ain't you ain't sealed you got a loose place yet right ain't that what the Holy Spirit right up there is supposed to do supposed to seal in the cracks seal in the cracks that we've had forever I'm sorry against other people so come on on back get that sealed up right good with the blood of Christ it'll cleanse you from all roots of bitterness yes amen you know the story I told you I could I wouldn't I would have been a stale Christian if I hadn't done what I did when I spoke against that brother that's right you're not going anywhere until you get those things right right you never will I don't care how much you try you'll beat your head in a wall till your nose is flat you will not move cuz that's going to stay right there Jehovah J 1957 brother Brown said but Abraham the man of God gave lot his choice took what's left oh I just love that a real believer will give you your choice he's willing to take what's left there's no selfishness in a real believer not at all amen that's why I like what Dave Ramsey always says I he says if you if you if you GI if you you know let your kids borrow money that's a mistake right if they need money give it to them and don't expect anything in return right amen but we got so many people that are I'll give you this if you'll that's wrong that's right I like what Dave Ram just said he said he said if you owe your daddy or Mama something he said turkey dinner at Thanksgiving don't taste very good when you have to sit there and look at them and know that you owe them money but look but when Dad says hey son here that money I that you owe me it's yours it's a gift it's a gift Luke 6 ver 26 says wo unto you when all men well they get quiet again Bob we quiet bunch I like woe unto you when all men speak well of you woe unto you when all men speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you you which hear love your enemies do good to them that which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you are falsely accused but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the what unthankful and Evil 1 John 4:19 says we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hates brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also 1 John 3:13 Marvel not musicians come on Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you praise God Amen we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death who whoever hateth his brother is a murderer wow and you know that no murderer ha eternal life abiding in him that's his Bible hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but who so hath this world's goods and seeth his brother have need and shth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let's everybody stand let us not love in wor word neither in tongue but inde deed and in truth wow brother Brown I'm in the Hebrew series you people with these saw blade tempers it's always spouting off it's a mouth that somebody can't put up things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear down it tear it tear down it you you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it that's what Jesus said 1 Peter 3:8 says finally be ye all of One mind have compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil I'll get back at them or railing for railing but contrary wise what does that word mean opposite or viy right but contrarywise give them blessings knowing that you are there un to call that you should inherit a blessing amen for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no G Jesus told us right here we'll stop right here when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses that is divine forgiveness that means that he forgets forgives and for forget we can't do that cuz we're not Divine in that sense but he can forgive and never remember it again cuz remember if he if he remembers it he didn't forgive [Music] it what sin you talking about amen he's putting a SE somewhere am read this right here and then we'll stop but because of the selfishness got among it the objective was wrong signing up a bunch of stuff it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God I want you to listen to this real quick cuz this happened in a situation that I was involved in and brother Dale maybe even Richard signing up a bunch of stuff it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but look like it's for themsel now here's an example that happened in our life we were hunting Kentucky and his brother he had his issues not then but he come into a lot of money so he buys this piece of property and he builds these deer stands and he spends thousands of dollars and he stands out in his little place and he and he's got a little little it's got a camp there and he said he said Brothers he said I'm not a minister cuz he had been married before and his wife was still living he said I know I'm not qualified to preach he said but God's given me this money to be able to buy this property it like 400 Acres it was good property he said God's given me this in this little house here so that y'all can just come anytime you want to hunt any where you want to you just call me and tell me there's and it is we went up there several times Richard been up there several times we went many times I went but everything was free I mean the food St stacked up you know this high in the corner and refrigerator and everywhere else and most of you know who I'm talking about but I'm not going to call his name but at that time he was just I mean he did it he said it's my Ministry to you all right two years later now this is right here I'm doing it for the kingdom of God all right two years later he had killed a real nice buck with a bow on that property and there were others that were bigger than the one he killed and he was getting ready to go somewhere else I was sitting in the living room I don't think Richard was there but Daddy was there and and he walks outside and he turns around he comes back in he says brother Wade he said you tell me he said you're in charge you tell me though if so and so if anybody goes to this so and so place I said really to myself I said really two years ago you told us we were free to hunt anywhere we wanted to anytime we wanted to because that was your ministry so he goes on and he says I don't want nobody hunting there if anybody hunts there they can't hunt here no more well he had found this big deal here on the camera and he didn't want nobody to hunt it but him now two years ago it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but looks like they did it for the self so he got selfish he didn't want nobody to go over there brother John he said if anybody goes over there can't hear here no more less than one year less than one year I think y'all went last less than one year from that day when he said that to me he lost everything he had everything almost lost his marriage but he lost everything I saw a check one time a commission check was $300,000 commission check that he made at one time that wasn't one year that was one time that he had that much money and he was doing so well and and and then after that guess what his life fell apart he went out in the world he he just almost went crazy he owed a lot of people money but he didn't do it for the glory of God like he said he was going to do it he promised he promised all us ministers he promised all of us people here's you a sanctuary a place you can come and you can hunt you can just sit back and relax and enjoy yourself and I'll take care of everything then two years later he says NOP you can't hunt over there cuz he want he was in some kind of big deer contest and he knew that deer was over there and he didn't want nobody kill it but himself brother Ram said it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask because if you don't you'll lose everything you got so let's be careful but let's learn from that cuz it was something that he that that just I mean it almost destroyed him he almost committed suicide and lost everything he had like I said before now he's back in church now he's doing better but he lost like 10 years of his life because of one thing he did he became selfish of something that he said that God told him to do and gave him the money to do see what I mean watch's your motive and objective we had a brother not several years ago that he come up with this great idea that God told him that to work on Sunday cuz you get paid like triple time if you work on Sunday so he worked on Sunday so he could send money to the missionary field and quit going to church God didn't tell him that so who did it was either or the devil cuz guess what his life fell apart he quit going to church listen you can't out give God God but you can't outsmart him either amen you can't outsmart God he knows already what you're going to do and he knows what he's going to do but he's going to let you go like he did those Brothers he's going to let you go cuz free moral agent hey you said it amen so let's be careful of the promises that we make let's sing a song real quick one song but that's life lesson if you prom something to God you better fil with transition if you have a need real quick earth [Music] stand your hopes on things Eternal and hold to God's unchanging hand sing it to him I'm singing to God's unchanging hand oh to God's unchanging [Music] hand be your hope so things etern [Music] oh to God's [Music] unchanging think of this trust in him who will not leave [Music] you whatever years may bring sing it to [Music] him if the whole world hates you you might be doing something [Music] right still more closely to him I'm singing oh to God unchanging hand hold to God unchanging hand don't build your ho down here things sing out course one more time you're dismissed God bless you remember
