========================================

let's turn to the Book of Proverbs now what you got in front of you is those quotes that I told yall would get together and then for those of you that were not here Wednesday night there is um that's pretty much the quotes that we read Wednesday night plus something so that's uh if you didn't listen to Wednesday night service you ought to just because I did it but but you didn't list Proverbs well if I get you the Proverbs it'll help six 16 do everybody know what um we not we'll wait for just a minute but everybody knows what brother Brown said about if you're stingy do what have the attitude to start giving stuff away if you're if you're this have the attitude of the opposite right just kind of keep that in you in the back of your mind as we go through all this verse 16 these six things does the Lord hate now if the Lord hates them then anything below that should hate them right if the Lord hates them that's the Apex he if he hates them then everything below that there's nowhere down the line that God's going to begin to start liking these things is that good enough are these things in the order of hatred not I don't see that in the book of they just put all six of them in a in a in a person and they're wrong so I got to turn this on hold on but why does he say seven are an Abomination six Proverbs 616 seven are an Abomination unto him we we'll get we'll cover all that cuz you got to read one 2 3 4 5 6 and the last one and he that Seth Discord among Brethren and that kind of takes everything into account of the all six of them cuz these six things does the Lord hate cuz look he doesn't hate it that you don't get Revelation watch these things these are not all let let's let's be careful and not spiritualize this too much leave it natural cuz that's what he he's talking about the Lord hates these things in a person right a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among Brethren now yeah you can spiritualize all that but if that naturally happens in your in your U total being all right the total being of you then you got a problem okay sure we were born Liars sure we we probably shed innocent blood and didn't know it by saying something to hurt somebody that's spiritual let's just keep this natural cuz this is six things that God hates and then when you get to that seventh one because look a proud look that's something you do a lying tongue that's something you do it's not that doesn't say your a Brother's lying tongue that says you're lying tongue all right it doesn't say the other guy's hands that shed innocent blood no it's talking about you a heart that devises Wicked imaginations all right feet that be Swift in right to Mischief other words Busy Bodies you know a false witness that speaketh lies and then the last one is he that sth Discord among Brethren now you're stepping out and he's showing you that what these things are has an effect on your brethren or sisters everybody see that and he that sth Discord among Brethren so he's going out to everybody else then and it's like what we were talking about Wednesday night it's that witness it's the witness that you are to this world because the only God they're going to see is you and and the way we act and react and our reactions proves we are because now read at verse 22 let's read 20 cuz God doesn't leave us hanging cuz every one of us are guilty of this pretty much except for maybe hands that shed inocent blood I hope we that nobody's ever murdered anybody here but we have done these things in our life but we should be that God has taken these things away or has already taken these things away all right my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck when thou goest it shall lead thee what the father's commandment and the law of the mother all right when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou a wakest it shall talk with thee now what is that it that it's the holy spirit that it is the holy spirit for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is a light and reproofs of instruction instruction are the way of life all right you can keep reading on down a little bit further and see how that it affects your life but let's go to one more let's go over to chapter 7 just look over well you don't have scull field Bible you may have Change chapter 7 verse 1 my son keep my words and lay up my Commandments with thee keep my Commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart he's telling you to do that okay see there's things that we have to do and I I see more and more that as people I'm trying to choose my words correctly here as people of the message of the hour we have went away from all this and we've come over to where it's like I was saying Wednesday night and for those of you that weren't here or listen I'm going to say it again I don't want this message to be I know something that you don't know I know more than you know you should hear me because I know more than you do no that's a condescending attitude and I do not I'm like God I don't like the condescending attitude because that's what number one is if you'll look up a proud look if you don't know what a condescending attitude is it's an attitude that you're up here and they're down here cuz I want to read you something right here this knock your socks off chapter 17 verse 5 don't you see how strong this is whosoever who so who so mock the poor reproaches his maker 175 Proverbs 175 man I hadn't been through Proverbs in a long time and I've started I'm almost in the last chapter of proverbs got a lot of good things about life how to live life how to do business how to treat your wife cuz it says here in one of these places that it's better that you live in a corner than to live with a brawling woman in a big house praise the Lord anyhow chapter 17 verse3 the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the Lord trith the hearts so what's he a w a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue who so mock the poor now you can say whatever you want to say make that poor in spirit make that poor in money make that poor in put whatever you want it's not that it's just saying people that don't have money but even the poor in spirit but look what it says though look how it ties in whosoever mock the poor reproaches his maker and that's a capital M right that's God right you know and and sometimes in our culture and our our way of doing things I told you this may be boring to you but if we don't live it then you can forget about all these other things right right but if we condescend on the poor or if we think the poor man there's just all kind of things about and I know poor is a state of mind sometimes poor is a state of mind and there's going to be always poor people but God it looks like God's taking care of the poor people all right so we shouldn't mock poor people whosoever whoo mock the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished you know what calamity is confusion he that is glad in confusion shall not be unpunished in other words somewhere down the road God is going to punish the people that cause confusion all right look at verse chapter 19 just picked out a few this morning then we're going to read a few quotes chapter 19 chapter 19 in Proverbs Proverbs Chapter 19 better is the poor that walketh in his Integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinth the foolishness of man perverteth his ways and his heart frth against the Lord look at verse eight though he that GTH wisdom loveth his own soul and he that keepeth understanding shall find good a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies Shall Perish pretty tough huh verse 16 he that keepeth the Commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despises his ways shall die he that has pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord It's like God takes care of poor people huh somebody somebody has to I mean somebody has to and and and that which he hath given and that which he hath given he will pay him again if you have pity upon the poor and you lendeth to the poor now that don't mean cuz it tells you here not to lend money to a brother and charge him interest okay we'll get into that later but just like we're doing this food bank and stuff like that and we're you know doing things to try to help people if you need help somewhere along the line we may need help you know but he that he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord not the person so the Lord is going to take that which he has given and pay him back twice it says again right so that's what he's saying if you know you lend yourself doesn't matter if you lend yourself to to you know like brother Joe does to the nursing home to me that's lending to the poor people they're they're they're not maybe they may have millions of dollars but look at the condition they're sitting in their their their families deserted them maybe their kids never come and see them that's a poor state right though they may be millionaires and have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank it does no good that's why that that when brother Joe goes and you that go help you're lending to the poor so the Lord's going to take whatever time that you spent or money or whatever you spent and he's going to give it back to you again not just the part you spent he's going to give it back to you again they promised he do that all right so that's what we that's why I said this is going to be the basis of Christianity the basis of Christianity is what giving God did that for J God did that for us he gave his only begotten son we read it last Sunday he gave right all right so let's keep reading right here he that ha pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord and that which he hath given will he pay again then it talks about chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy Soul spare for his crying look at verse 20 hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end right that talks about you and I right in our latter in receiving instruction and that's what we're doing now I I think we've come to the place to where that that we're way up in the pyramid and we don't need instruction we we got all this thing figured out well I don't think our pastor feels that way I don't think I feel that way we need to learn and learn from each other learn from our mistakes yes but look at verse 23 well let's do 22 the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar a poor man is better than a liar all right the fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil what promise I underline that one in my Bible I want to go back to that one the fear of the Lord lendeth tend to in other words to your life all right and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil look at verse 28 now let's go to the other side an ungodly witness scornest judgment and the mouth of the wicked devour iniquity h now let's go chapter 20 I'm just going to read a few here and then we'll then we'll make a few more comments verse seven the just man walketh in his integrity that's what I was talking about Wednesday night if we can't walk through life and somebody say there goes at least if they understand you or not there goes someone different there's something different about that person right okay there's something different now you can say there's something different than being in a bad way but there's something different because remember the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him see that promise the children are blessed at after him okay let's read this one right here and then we'll stop and make a few comments chapter 22 cuz you know I don't want people to I want you to realize something we are what we are by the grace of God but he gives you five senses to contact this world like brother Brady always told me mean and he said he expects you to use them right all right God can't make you walk Godly he can't he can't make you walk Godly but if you'll get God inside like I said Wednesday night and let him walk then you'll have to walk Godly there's no gray area in there all right sure you got a gray area because of this thing right here there's things we're going to get we're going to get trapped into and and you know we're going to fall but are we going to stay falling no we're going to get up and start over again you know why cuz we know how to do it that's right the world doesn't know how to get up from an adversity and go again that's what I'm uh trying to to get people to understand and I'm talking to you to understand is that what we project this world is looking for God this whole world I don't care if it's a sinner I don't care if it's somebody that's that's uh drunk or or prostitute or they're looking for something to raise them out of what they're in right Romans 8 the whole world groaneth and travail us waiting for the manifestation of God in a group of people now I didn't change the Bible that's exactly what it says it says the manifestation of the sons of God God same thing okay it's waiting on the whole world right so the whole world whether you be in job whether you be in your acquaintances even your family that are not serving the lord even they want they are longing for somebody to be right cuz they see so much wrong they see so much of this that we're talking about they see so much of this backbiting and lying and filing this out in the world they're looking and longing for somebody that's why man when you walk in a room people you'll watch after a little while they'll just start congregating toward you cuz they want to be right they want to know how to do right nobody's told them how to do right I mean you go to a church and they tell you how to feel good and all that stuff in the denominational churches but we have life and we have life inside supposed to inside of us that radiates out because somewhere down the line if it doesn't if you don't have life inside of of you the life of God you're not going to act like him just simple really simple this is just simple Christianity without saying brother brandham said all right and if we don't live that then you can forget what he said that's right CU that's what he preached he preached Christianity all right but he preached it at his highest Apex so we should be at that Apex of height with him all right and that's what we're heading toward cuz I know it's there so somebody can make it all right look at chapter 22 a good name a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold now let's look at the context of this though who's writing this who wrote the Book of Proverbs Solomon the richest wisest man in the world and he said you can take all my silver billions of dollars all my gold billions of dollars and you can throw it away if I don't have loving favor or you can take all my riches and if I'm if my name doesn't match what I'm supposed to be which was King if and and the wisest man in the world the Bible said I just got through Reading there in Kings myself transposing the Bible over to this new one or the new one at work Solomon wanted to be wise he wanted to lead his people so God said I'll not only let you be wise he said I'll even give you riches to go along with it because you asked that he said you didn't ask wisdom for yourself cuz he could have he he could have asked wisdom to be rich yourself but he didn't want to he wanted Israel remember brother Brown said that was their Millennium that was their years of rain that no war they prospered they built cities they built houses the coffers were full of gold but here a man looks down and he writes one day and he says a good name is rather to be chosen than all of the riches of my kingdom if he lied he lied but this was the Lord writing through him so this was what was imposed on him to write through the Lord for us a good name okay a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the Lord is the maker of them all a prudent man forseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished by humility listen to this here's two things has nothing to do with money has nothing to do with status has nothing to do with anything but something that you can do yourself by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor in life pretty simple but very profound Ray Croc said one time he said if you go into business to make money you'll fail if you go in business to make someone else Prosper you'll always prosper and that's the way we should look at life same thing we do with with here but see watch how it goes through there and and comes down from verse one now watch verse 5 thorns and snares are in the way of the forward forward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them in other words sh the appearance of evil that's scripture train up a child see how it goes into it train up a child and way it should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the rich ruleth over the poor and this is one of Dave's favorite scriptures the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the limb lender he that sth iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of his anger shall fail pretty tough isn't it look at verse 16 we'll end it right there with this one just make a few comments he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches now you can talk natural and spiritual here if you want to he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want so we see that in our in our own personal life that's why I said it's it's much important that your name be good I saying Wednesday night what kind of a reproach are you if you go out and do things wrong in life and then you come to church here is that the way that this church teaches it are we are we supposed to accept that or are we supposed to say something about it we're supposed to help you become wiser right now not not the wisdom of the world but Godly wisdom to live a life to get up in the morning and not hang your head low and and be defeated right okay not not be not be something that you're ashamed of if you're ashamed then you're not a Christian you know you I'm not ashamed of where I walk cuz I know God's changed I I can see myself changed I know others have seen you know change from back when I used to be but if but if we haven't had a change in our life then the change hasn't begun can I say that one more time yes if we haven't had a change in our life your change will not come right right if you had had a change already you forget about change over here cuz see the change started at the new birth that's right cuz you become a changed person that's right a changed individual that's right and then that's going to culminate that's going to culminate in a Rapture that's the culmination of when you started on your journey to not just not just um what what did Jesus say he said you you you you you clean the The Seer in other words you clean the Seer that that that the prophets are in but you're the ones that put them in the in the ground that's pretty strong in other words he said oh this is where Abraham is buried we're going to keep it all clean and shiny but your actions and your ways is the ones that put that prophet in the ground that's what he was telling them right your Doctrine and your ways of doing things is the one that put them in the ground same way with brother Dale if we act and we act up and we do things out in the world and and it becomes a reflection on him he's the he's the man he's the leader he's the one that puts his life on the line all the time for you now it's time for us to reap the benefits of that and turn around and do the same thing live the life live the life let's let's don't be a reproach to the world that's right let's don't be let's don't be something that we're not when I said Wednesday night I'm like brother Dale I wish that we could all see that we were lost just lost as lost can be and start somewhere and say God I'm lost I'm not doing I'm not changed yet change me what's that song change my heart on God and then what is it's what something something he's changing me from glory to glory he's changing me from glor from Sun to Sunday I don't think you realize and I'm talking about you when I say me that when you walk out of this service today you're going to be better or worse you're going to be better or worse and then it's going to Heap on you the next time you go and it's going to make you worse Better or Worse that's what the prophet said and I can understand that because if we bring a sin in or we bring something in that we know we should get out of our life or do away with with him and then we going to get rid of it and bring it back the next Sunday it just gets bigger you know God even said that he would give you a strong delusion to believe a lie and I'm not going to quote the rest of it because you know what it says it's not good all right let's look at these not the one living me a sermon but let's I think it's got a few of the same quotes in it but just go to the one where it says adoption just read just a few excuse me and I read some of these Wednesday just forgive me if you were here but some of you weren't let's read it here now this is the adoption Series this is where brother random is trying to get people to see that there's more to the New Birth than just being born again right there's more to the New Birth than just being born again there's a walk all right uh the prodal son he acted up but he was a son yes but see to show that he was a son he came back his dad didn't go get him he came back that's what God wants you to do he wants you to come back all right cuz we all backslide every day he wants you to come back brother said the Holy Ghost to go out on the limb and sit there and wait on you to call him back what he's a gentleman you grieve him something you do he goes out there you know what he's going to sit there but you call him back it's not that you lost your salvation you just lost the joy of him being close that's right okay there's where the church is failing this is adoption 1960 on that walk this is where the church is failing if he said it in 1960 we ought to be able to say it in 2013 because you know why we're still here that's right that's right we get the walk right the change is going to continue and we're going to be changed and get out of here but until we do until we change the Walk we're still going to be here that's right cuz he said that's where the church is failing now failures don't go into Rapture that's right so we got to change something's got to change to put that positive instead of a failure and there's where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed and you know he sees that I mean he's a prophet he looks out in the congregation and he sees that black thing raise up cuz he sees Spirits when he's when he's Discerning he sees those things he'll see some black you know he'll say it looks like a black cat one time he say like a black cat would pop up or a black street would go across cross from one to the other he'd say those Spirits are screaming at each other knowing they're fixing to be exposed well see it wasn't those people probably didn't know that there was a black street running from their head over to somebody else's but whatever they held in their heart right whatever they held and that doesn't mean they weren't Christians it's just they had a spirit on them all right cuz watch this next one look lady death knocks at your door faith of the African trip 1952 you believe me to be his Prophet if you'll just turn to God and God will return to you the lady says now I got a question to ask the lady speaks to brother rown that is true lady what I mean is true you listen to what backsliding didn't mean that you're gone somewhere and with a man I'm a little bit of a calvinist see not that radical type but I am calvinist you was born again so he felt that familiar Spirit he felt the holy spirit so it was a familiar Spirit it was the right spirit so he felt that all right right but you back slid away from your calling from God right isn't that right and you should have went and done something but you felt like you wasn't able to do it that was the spirit that was keeping that lady from being healed was just she was just had backslid away from what God had called her to wow something so simple as that it's just that's what he said backsliding running away from your calling from God and you should have went and done something in other words what is that that's iniquity iniquity is knowing to do something and you don't go do it or going and do something knowing that it's wrong so she had iniquity in her heart and brother random is calling this thing out and and I'm sure I didn't get the rest of the quote but and I'll I'll find out the lady was healed cuz she asked for forgiveness that's all you got to do when you approach God ask for for forgiveness you know but I'm prise you one thing like Jesus told that prostitute he said go and said your sins are forgiven he said go and send no more send no more L A worst thing come upon you go and send no more all right if she was wrong and she went back to the calling of God then God healed her and she went on as a Christian lady but she was born again you was born again but you backslid all right God's way that's been made for us 1952 all right I followed up another man here not long ago where they talk about a lot of this said he went one city and had 5,000 conversions we followed right behind not me a group of ministers and took the card and followed him back and in 30 days time you couldn't find 30 that claim to be saved you know what I think I think it's conviction instead of conversion when a man is born again the spirit of God what we need today is not a ProTrac of meeting in other words just say God I'm sorry and remember you know people find Jesus in jail you know that's a that's a a quote that a lot of people you know a judge will always tell you that if a guy comes up before him he's always got a Bible and he's got his hair cut well the lawyer tells him to do that why because it's an outward appearance that maybe something has changed right at least it gives an impression right well see that's a conviction not a conver I right because you let the guy go another 2 or three months or let him out and he's going if he's still got the same Devil in him he's going to go do the same thing he was all right same way with you and I there are spirits that control our life evil ones and good ones well I don't care who you are brother brandham said he had them all right what we need to do is just figure out which one controls and brother Bown said the old like the old Indian said which one wins he said the one I feed the most okay what we need today is not a protracted meeting but an oldfashioned God sent Holy Ghost Revival an old time sky blue sin killing blood wash religion amen makes you take them tire tools back and do repentance somebody must have stole some tire tools somebody in that audience I'll guarantee you he picked up on that and I'll bet you whoever that was went they make you I mean why do you pick TI toes somebody stole some tiar toes and needed to take them back and do repentance Joy you still for dark I don't know how to use okay yeah if you're going to steal something you might as well steal something you can use right all right let's go Lord bless you read The Book of Proverbs if you want to if you don't we're still going to stay in Proverbs probably a month or two but remember these things brother Bob will be here next Sunday because I'll be in Witcher next week so all right I'm leaving listen everybody I'm leaving Friday Mila Mila say I thought you work on leaving and somebody else did too I'm guilty I'm guilty I'm leaving Friday and I want a text message over my birthday Saturday cuz I'll be out there and then I'll be back on Thursday okay thank you
