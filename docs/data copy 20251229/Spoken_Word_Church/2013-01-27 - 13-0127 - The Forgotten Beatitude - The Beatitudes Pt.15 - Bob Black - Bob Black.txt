========================================

all right morning everyone um y'all might have met my brother-in-law brother Matthew and my sister-in-law sister Daniel brother Matthew pastors the church down in Mobile and we're glad to have them been spending a lot of couple days of good Fellowship and S glad to have him with us this morning y sister Jun said brother Joe is going to urgent care this morning so let's remember know he's having coughing and stuff and brother boy said how and aubre are still bad so this remember Jo Joe Joe but we're going to read from Matthew 11 and have your finger on Psalm 119 also Psalm 119 but we're going to read Matthew 11 first now last time we we ran through the Beatitudes and we finished up with blessed are the persecuted and um those are all the Beatitudes that Jesus preached on The Sermon on the Mount but there's another beatitude that everybody forgets about and this is the one I'm going to talk about today so let's start off in Matthew 11 and just read about uh John remember John on the River Jordan we talked about how he knew his place he was supposed to introduce the Messiah and the Messiah knew his place what he had come to do and they met there on the River Jordan and uh John saw the Spirit descended on Jesus like a dove amen and he knew what was he knew who he was he declared who he was he declared him to his disciples when uh he was standing there talking to two of his disciples and he said there he goes right there and they went and followed after him so he knew who he was but then when he went when Herod put him in in uh Jail uh then John you John his ministry was he was preaching it hard the axes laid to the root of the tree uh um just coming at the people real hard and then then Jesus when he saw Jesus come forth in meekness and humility and meek and lowly it says the scripture then he had a little problem so let's read uh Matthew 11 verse1 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them that's the sign of the Messiah he could have said he could have given him a yes or no answer or a yes answer but instead he said tell him declare to him the things that you have seen amen which are an Evidence of who I am let the life speak speak for who I am and and then he said this forgotten beatitude and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me come on praise God blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now offended if we compare this real quick with Psalm 119 165 Psalm 119 verse 165 it says great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them and offense right here is speaking of being ashamed stumbling over God's word because it's presented in a way that we don't understand and uh so we'll take a little history down through scripture of how when the word is presented to people in a way that they don't understand it St they stumble over it and and uh many times are ashamed of it but if we'll search the scriptures and look at the law what Jesus told them search the scriptures for they testify me if they would have searched the scriptures they would have seen like Paul after he met the pillar of fire and he went in he went and studied the scriptures out for I believe it was two years and looked to prove in the scriptures what was spoken of about Jesus and then he was convinced because he knew he saw for himself that the scriptures testified that this Christ was the one to follow amen now just because the psalm says great peace have they which thy law and nothing shall offend and that now that doesn't mean that in uh our our conversation with one another that we can't be wounded in our spirit because you know I think a lot of times we can present the gospel better people are looking at you know how brother Bram said that we're everyone in the congregation is preachers in the sense that your life preaches louder than any words that you could say that's right and if you come and if you confront someone with the gospel and your life is speaking something different then they got to go around your life to get to the true word but when the truth is presented then they uh if we'll look at the search the law then we will not stumble over the truth someone that really investigates and seeks after it and uh so I have some scriptures just uh kind of pointing out how we should uh you know brother brand when a lot of times when he would speak he would pray Lord don't let me stumble cause anyone to stumble and and uh he was talking about this sister that uh he he saw and he said sister you your dress is too tight you're going to be a stumbling block to the other sisters to the weaker sister the younger ones that will look at you and uh you know you're trying to say well I'm a message believer but you're not dressing right you're not living right and that that's an she said well that's all I can buy they don't uh you know that's all the store sell and he said well this they sell sewing machines cuz uh if if what's people are looking at the life that's what we're looking for is someone who can live and manifest the life of God not just uh say words in Romans 12:3 for I say Romans 12:3 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith Praise You Jes I think sometimes that can be a stumbling block to others when we present the go gopel in a way that we are above the other person you know we we uh present it in a condescending Manner and uh you know just looking back through my own life and mistakes I made I can I remember uh you know saying the truth but if if I didn't say it in a way that was loving then you know you can just see people kind of turn it off because they have to go around the life if you're not if your life doesn't match what your what your words are Ephesians 4: 1-3 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with ye are called with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and uh you know how in the Old Testament David testified of of uh he know he said I know that thou are uh your your patient and and uh all he testified of Christ's attributes and those attributes that he was longsuffering with us and patient with us while we uh you know came to the knowledge of the truth and that's how we should be to one another Ephesians 43132 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and flamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you and Proverbs 1819 I'll just read it real quick a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong City and there contentions are like the bars of a castle and Martin Luther translated like this a brother wounded resisteth more than a strong City and strife resisteth more than bolts in the palace and and uh you know brother brandom talked about how uh uh how we should treat each other in our home he was talking about a man treats his wife that we all have uh he said now there will be times that you all won't see things alike but always remember you're still in love when you see one set in the way and the other don't I said give in if they're wrong it'll show and after a while it'll be all right I said there's a little bow in a human heart that is full of golden oil called love if it is ever broke it can be healed up but there will be a scar there as long as you live but on the other side of that argument he said don't be afraid to get Battle Scars because Caesar was uh you know looking for someone to ride with him in his Chariot after the after the battle was running he came across this little fellow that had scars all over his face and uh he was ashamed of his scars and he said where'd you get those scars and and the man said I got them fighting for you for my Emperor and uh he said come on up in my Chariot and ride with me because you got those scars fighting for me and brother R said and palm worm Locus korm caterpillar show some scars you ain't had no testimony yet you haven't done nothing might as well get out and do something for God do something so we should try not to give each other scars but we should not be afraid to take to to get out and and get some scars to show that we've been fighting the battle and now is the door open do you have said about the SCS do you know what's that's from that is in P worm Locus korm caterpillar 1953 paragraph E64 thank you and uh there's so many times in the scripture where uh uh sometimes the word will be presented in a way that it seems harsh but it's the truth and the and the truth we we should not stumble over a real True Believer desires to be corrected and uh and remember in Mark 7 243 1 uh where uh it uh I'll just read it real quick you don't need to turn to it and from then he arose and went into the borders and tire and siding and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be he I was uh I was kind of thinking about that how that types the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a secret thing to you personal relationship when it comes into your house but it can't be hid for a certain man woman whose Young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet now she was convinced that he had the life that she was looking for that he had the truth when she came to him she was already convinced the woman was a Greek a Sy phenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth a devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled now there's a little hope first let the children be filled and then for for it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and he called her a dog now uh a lot of times things that God tests us a lot of times to see how bad do you want it and it's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be uh you know a lot you know when the offering plate comes by a lot of times maybe this uh uh not a perfect tipe but it's not easy to you don't you don't have an automatic a debit machine to pay your ti you know it's not or you can just sit on the couch all the time and your money automatically goes into church or whatever that that wouldn't be right it's you got to dig deep and uh you sometimes you have to to press hard to get what you're after and so he um she answered and said unto him Yes Lord she agreed with him because you it's it was a truth she was presented with the truth and how can you stumble over the truth she knew that he was telling the truth yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone and her daughter laid upon the bed brother brandom said in perseverance brother she was not a h hot house plant had to be baby petted around like some of the crop of the day oh my well I'll never go again this is all there is to it oh my no wonder you can't hold that sort of Faith no wonder you compromise on the words you go somewhere where you can hear some kind of a little sissified something put together you little hot house plant you the first little bug strikes you it kills you have to be sprayed all the time I don't believe that stuff the days of Miracles has passed it's the devil's spray Tenderfoot she admitted he was right but now down through history a lot so many times people have stumber from from from Peter and the apostles when Jesus said by the time the crows you you you are going to deny me uh just all through scripture people when they're presented with the word uh that and it comes in a way that they don't expect they stumble over it and in today we in this hour we should be on guard to uh uh just be uh watchful you know I was kind of studying what brother brandham had to say about the disciples and a lot of times we'll look at one another and think that uh because this brother doesn't act exactly like that brother then it stumbles us you know how Peter Peter was faithful it was a little fire brand and he told it like it was and then brother R said Andrew was a prayer Warrior who would pray all night and you can't say well Andrew should tell it like Peter or Peter should do like Andrew CU God puts each of us in the church into his own economy placing us and we're not like Cookie Cutters we we're not acting exactly the same God puts his attributes Us in us to manifest in different ways his attributes so don't let that stumble you and uh and then just I I made some notes of all the times through scripture where people were offended the Jews were offended at Jesus's parentage who his parents were and and how he came they thought that his parents had committed fornication they were offended at his place of birth because they said in John chapter 7 isn't he supposed to come from Bethlehem and he didn't say uh he didn't correct him he didn't come out and say um excuse me let me explain this to you that you think I Came From Galilee but I really was born in Bethlehem that's right they uh if they would have asked about it and a lot of times you know won't speak to someone before we judge but they didn't investigate and look at the scripture that's good brother they were the Jews were offended because Jesus healed on the Sabbath and he said I the Lord the S the L the Lord is the lord of the Sabbath you know I'm I'm uh they didn't understand what the Sabbath was about that it's a a a Eternal day of rest not any particular day they collected uh when he collected Grain on the Sabbath and he told them about don't you remember how David ate the showbread and it was found blameless and how the priests profane the Sabbath when they every Sabbath day they uh they go about their normal their normal work carrying things when the Jews had laws that you couldn't even carry a stick further than a set amount but on the Sabbath the priests and the temple would carry animals around and and uh do different things uh profaning the Sabbath what Jesus said in Matthew 12 and he was telling them you you're offended at what I do but you don't even understand the scripture and they were offended in Mark chapter 7 because Jesus and his disciples didn't washed their hands before they ate and then John the Baptist disciples were offended because Jesus and his disciples didn't fast and he said how can you fast when uh when I'm you know paraphrasing when I'm I'm with you that's right how can they fast but when I'm gone then you'll mourn and desire to have desire to be in my presence and he they were offended because Jesus didn't maybe lead an Oster a life as they and their Master the uh meanness and obscurity of Christ Kingdom he was preaching about a kingdom that uh must be in you and it offended them U they were offended because their leader John went to prison for saying this is the one you know after confessing Christ he went to prison and they were offended because of the reproaches that Fallen someone that testified of Jesus and in Matthew 13:20 Jesus told the parable of the seed that falls in Stony places that becomes offended and just follow it all down through scripture how they were offended of John the Baptist lack of education and today they're offended at brother bram's lack of Education remember in the Old Testament how Elijah God came to Elijah and Elisha little poor people that didn't know uh part of their ABCs but the school of prophets where they were brought up and taught they didn't really understand what was happening and they would uh the people people of that day were offended at Elisha's bald head and they called it uh called him names and then all down through the three pools of Noah the three pools of Jesus as the three pools progressed they became more and more offended and more and more would fall away that's right brother uh you know a lot of times we can look at things how things are done in church and we'll stumble over it we'll say well I don't like the way that the song leader sings the songs I don't like the way that the that the service is conducted or I don't I've heard it before I don't like that that that you have a picture of brother Brandon hanging on the wall we've heard people say you know your your Sunday school class color pictures of brother Brown and people stumble over these little things and it lets them get in the way yes it does BR it brother bring it y'all I'm sorry it's it's all right you uh let your some people in your church go to baseball games or you let your children play sports and because of those things people stumble over it and fail to see God's word being revealed my yes Lord Lord and then we look at uh how Peter when uh before he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would keep you from being offended that would solidify you he said Jesus uh Jesus said then in Matthew 26 31-33 he said then Jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee he always gave him hope after I'm risen I'll go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended and he made a a great declaration that he would not be offended but you can't say you can't make any declaration until you got the Holy Ghost that's right you can make all kinds of vasts and and proclamations but until you have the Holy Ghost there's not something in you that the rock of Revelation to solidify you and and we know the story that before the crew they had all ran and Scattered and Peter had denied him and said and and and even the Bible says he cursed you know and said I don't know him I don't know nothing about him and not and uh and brother Brandman questions and answers 1961 he said when you ministers are correcting someone about a gift when you're correcting them or spiritually correcting them and they get offended remember it wasn't the spirit of God because the spirit of God cannot be offended by his word he comes to his word see he's always willing a real saint of God wants to tow the mark yes sir I want to be corrected I want the Holy Spirit to correct me in things that I'm doing that's wrong I don't want nothing substitutionary I want the real thing or nothing just let me alone don't let me have anything at all because I'd rather do that than to bring a reproach on on the Christ and in Matthew 15 where he was saying not that which go into the mouth defileth of man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this say in other words are you concerned that they were offended because you told them the truth don't you know that they were offended and he said but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up amen let them alone they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall in into the ditch now let's finish up with uh the the Antichrist scripture John let's turn to John chapter 6 and let's start reading at verse 56 John Big John chap 6 verse 56 he he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me amen this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and and are dead he that eth of this bread shall live forever these things say said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard say who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend oh my what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father then John 6 66 from that time many of his disciples went by and walk no more with him because they were offended and they couldn't see God's word made manifest in in front of all right let's stop there thank you very good very good thank you thank you um when you about how the Holy Spirit would be offended
