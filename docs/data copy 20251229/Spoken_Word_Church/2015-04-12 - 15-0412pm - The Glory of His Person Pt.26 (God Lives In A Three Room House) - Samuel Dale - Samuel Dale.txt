========================================

for the philippines um i know i think we told you already that the church itself is going to uh send the three thousand dollars to the dingalon church to finish the church and the pastor's study so that has been taken care of by the church and also brother edward uh needed the sound system and i was given 75 by two people here in the congregation to take care of that so that needs been taken care of and then we have uh others that have that have come forward and given money are going to give money uh upwards of two thousand dollars to finish brother edwards church so we thank god for that and then we are we are looking now to uh some of you that want to help if you want to do it individually they need tablets those tablets are 50 bucks a piece and they're uh and all they're using it for is the message they they don't get on the internet because there's not a lot of internet service in uh especially in palowan where they're they're looking at taking these tablets but they're 50 bucks a piece with the message installed by one of the brothers that brother uh soriano's church they install the message and then they take it to palowan they're having a hard time getting books like i told you about the church age books they're having a hard time voice of god is having a hard time but hey if you can get them a tablet for 50 bucks they've got the whole message they can research the whole message and they've always got it with them most people have power so you don't have to worry about that they can you know they can use their battery chargers and all that you know charge your battery so 50 bucks if anybody'd like to help i'd like to see if we can maybe get 10 to send over there because those 15 people that called brother letho the other time when we were there that was 15 out of the 60 wants him to come back and teach in their church we had nothing to give them so we need 10 or 15 of those tablets that we can send them the money and let them buy the tablets and take them to plowing and give them so if you if you want to do that i think the church has done enough itself and maybe individually because june and i are going to help some too but if anybody would like to do that that would be a blessing for them we're like i said we're uh we're a giving church and and it's all yours anyway and you know it's what you give but i would like to uh to extend that if anybody would like to help mom that's going over there yes we're going to send brother lito we're going the church itself like we support the people some of the people in the philippines to do their extended work we're also sending another amount of money for that brother lito that i told you that went over to palawan and stayed three months uh we're extending some money to him every month to pay for his expenses because like i said it does take money to operate whether whether it's over there over here it still takes some money so we're as a church we're committed to forward him some more money for a monthly support for him to go do his work in palaum because like i said his work just now has begun uh to take to go to 15 churches and to bring them the message of the hour that would be a full-time job so for the next three months or whatever time he when he gets over there he will have several months of nothing but just going around preaching to these brand new churches that's never heard the message of the hour and it would be wonderful for him to take a tablet and hand them to the pastor and say here this is the whole message research all you want to research but this is what this is for so if anybody wants to do that see me come and talk to me don't go anywhere else just come see me that way i'll handle it from the end here since the lease is not here uh we can run it through the church if you wish or you can give me cash it doesn't matter but if you want to do that just come and see me after the service or wednesday or next sunday we don't have to do it this sunday there's not a deadline i would just like to get it there as fast as we can so so god bless you thank you for what you've already done and uh and what god's gonna do because this continued support i believe there's a work over there that needs to be done there's a work everywhere but like i told the brothers i sent him an email brother gary we can't support all of the philippines but but when you present a need to a church you let the holy spirit tell you what to do you know let the holy ghost tell you what to do they may be you know they may think that this need needs to be taken care of first but when god puts it on your heart to say here here's 50 i want this to go to this brother edward or i want this to go to brother leto then you i believe then it's the lord leading you to do it and then if the lord wants to have another need met by another church let them take care of that don't lay the burden on one church but let the holy spirit say okay i believe this brother can use this amount of money and you're the one that's going to give it and then i'll take care of all the needs god's going to take care of the needs anyway right but we just don't all take care of it in as one church body as spoken word church let the whole world pitch in and do but the lord's laid it on a lot of your hearts to to give me money and say here put this toward this or or i don't care what it goes toward here take this and give it so then we will direct it to the place that it needs to go but right now i believe we need to to see about getting some tablets so that they can get the pure message you know at least get it on on uh don't have to be audio at least you can get where they can read it where they can see the message of the hour because these are brand new people brand new churches that could come to the message of the hour by that just giving them that tablet and giving them information hey information this is the information age the more information you got the better off you are so god bless you sorry we're going to sing out the notebook uh page 32. remember we in we nc i remember how my savior died for me on the ruggy cross of dark mount calvary i remember

and things how much more would we want to see him amen than to see that be in that place amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading in revelations and then we will go revelations one then we'll go to second corinthians 5. now the announcements have been made but this coming saturday remember the uh time together for the easter time and meeting at about one o'clock and we'll be eating it about five and having a good time fellowshipping together and all down at the the playground there at gillsville so remember that and come and be with us also remember the fourth of july uh weekend we will be having services on the 4th which will be on saturday and brother vernon will be speaking for us and in that and morning services on sunday i mean eat morning and evening on sunday and we'll be having a cookout now you're at the church starting at about two o'clock and then we'll eat together at about five and that saturday now that service only will be at six o'clock so everybody get it right now where it won't come and say well we always start at seven but we'll start at six o'clock on that service and to give you a little chance to get back home in a different thing all right so remember that remember brother bob we'll be preaching the lord willingness coming wednesday be much in prayer for him i heard a good report of him over in in alabama and i told him i hope you got a little bit left for us because i heard they were doing good i don't think brother luis is going to have to be his voice though because we had a good time laughing at that brother louise goes over and he doesn't preach at all but he has to be the voice of everybody that was there preaching so that you know you get involved one way or the other so you know we appreciate brother luis to be able to do that one of these days maybe he can interpret what i say you know where you'll know what i'm talking about all right remember that any other announcements we've generally got some we missed but remember each one remember the sick ones and the things and the lord would be with each and every one okay revelations one and for second corinthians five father we thank you for this day and opportunity to be able to just think about the things that we've just spoke about that we would be people that the ends of all things would come upon us and that we would be happy about that not to see the bad part but we know that we'll go along with it and be there and we can't help that lord but to be able to see the end of all things to be brought upon mankind and then ending that up we know that eternity begins where we are ending our parts and lord we love you and we thank you have your way remember the sick among us the different ones request and father just let your love be made manifest in each one in jesus name amen all right i don't know whether they kept on going but we don't have to but we we just gave the yeah they went on down okay so i didn't know where i gave them that note i've written it so many times revelation 1 12 13. but they get ahead of me and they pick it on up okay and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candles too in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clove of the garment down to the foot and gird about to pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet likened to find bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and death now let's go to ii corinthians 5. we read start 4 14 for the love of christ can train us us because we just judge that if one died for all then all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which lived should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth no no we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more what after the flesh it's in the spirit right therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation now the ministry of reconciliation is actually the atonement see we think about reconciling part but really in in what it's bringing out here it's the the ministry of the atonement because in the atonement is only the reconciliation see we're thinking it's like reconciliation to restore something to bring it back it's really the atonement is the main point that's what i'm reading it about where you can see how he died and what he done and how we look no more after the flesh see but we look and we talk about a new creation or a new creature old things are passed away then see all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation but wait a minute he's given to us why would you be talking about it be an atonement because see we are the ones who know what the real atonement is right okay now watch to it what is that to understand what is the ministry of reconciliation to understand that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their transgressions into them and have committed to us the word of reconciliation amen you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word see just to get you to a point of thinking you know we talked about the atonement we we you know we went through those things and we believed in the blood of jesus christ and the life given for us but see when this message came we come to a point then of really seeing things in an open view that was never seen before by way of this end time message all right and to think that you and i understand that's what it means are too wet to understand that we understand the reconciliation as nobody has ever understood it we will get to that more the lord willing next week and talk about some things but i just want your mind to just think on that that we do have a part to do in this end time and as we read there and we don't throw no reflection to the point but it's the truth that the it's the bride of jesus christ that has the ministry of reconciliation all right now i am not saying period not saying now that nobody else can't be saved out in organized religion et cetera you know and and be really truly born again i have no reflection to that whatsoever but i believe it's getting pretty narrow now i said pretty narrow that could mean a great big wide view in a world of 7 billion people for the narrow could be a billion right so you understand what i'm getting at i'm not making any point other than see i believe now i do believe this i believe there'll be a time right when it winds up in the finishing up of all things that if you're going to get anything you're going to find the bride of christ to receive from i believe that that's that's as honest as i can say it because that's a that's how i believe how close that the bride will be to jesus christ that it's going to come to a place that the gates are going to be closed everything's going to be finished and you're going to have to uh rely on each other you know to be able to follow through and finish it up well brother dale i'll just do it on my own okay all right let me argue with you about it i just don't believe it is that all right i just don't believe it because i believe that it's the body of christ and being the body of christ if we believe the words of the prophet in the way that he brought it and the things that are in the bible remember that the seed comes through the body all right and there'll come a time that will only be the redemptive plan will be within the they i call it framework where it won't be in the wrong thing but within the ranks of the bride of jesus christ and i believe that that's what i've always believed always believe and look at that time and not look to where you just say you know because you think we're i'm saying we're it i thought we was here that's what i thought was the truth i thought the bride is it i didn't know there was any things left over and that's not making no light against nobody everybody has had their day and their time and their beings which is in our time and we come down to how the ministry of reconciliation the the ministry of explaining the atonement or are you with me about that i you know i just i thought well lord do we understand what that's saying this reconciliation will means to restore you see that's what we think look it up i had took that opportunity it means the atonement which would be the reconciliation it's for you to be able to explain the true atonement you know now god winks in our ignorance is that scripture but what's the rest of that scripture that god winks at her ignorance that's fine and he did but what's the rest of that verse which said now he commands all man to repent see in other words you're going to have to come to that place all right so then people out there if you hear that and say you think that we got to come to you to get it i didn't say me i didn't say it that way i didn't say us i said the bride of christ okay everybody follow me so we know then where we're going all right now i brought the message this morning up to a point because i wanted you to get your mind in a set form of thinking about uh the point of what i was trying to explain all right we'll try to continue that thought on this afternoon and then we will drop back the lord willing to be more in the redemptive form of bringing it the lord willing next weekend all right now what was our thought this morning that had they known that this was the lord of glory they would have not killed him we know that's true so they didn't believe even who he said he was right even when he said it and even when signs and wonders prove the point of who he was they did not believe it why because they had previously been perverted in their thinking and it had happened as it did in the garden that satan through his septility had blinded those people's eyes and remember it was not the sinner that had jesus had trouble with it was not the uh prostitutes of the things right you know that's what they got onto anybody eating with sinners and it was not those things that was the problem where was the problem in his day the religious leaders of that day were the ones who instigated the form to word that it would bring him finally to his crucifixion all right because they were the only ones that had the power enough to do those things you know and in doing it then who would we always look to be the ones that was deceived we look back at eve we've been through that part to see that she was deceived that she was not wanting to be a bad woman she was not doing these things she was deceived into the point that she thought she was right right all right brother brown said it's hard to get those pharisees i believe it's birth pains i believe it but then they said like this he said hard to get those pharisees and things to realize they were sinners to where he could die for him you realize his death never helped anybody that doesn't get saved right so it wasn't you know i mean that back there see they didn't believe it why i mean everybody no matter what surely the the word got out the uh the things at least around in some respects of a man that could raise the dead on many occasions he could heal the sick he could teach you how to pay taxes right you do many marvelous things then you want to kill him now you take the bible sometimes and sit down and think about it upon what grounds would you ever think about them coming to a point of crucifying this man he never done nothing but good even what they thought was bad or maybe driving them out of the temple the statements he'd make about them and things you know what they had to admit he was right i mean why didn't they come back there when he drove them out of the temple why didn't they go get the temple guards and come back and run him out you know you don't let that go through your cranium cap you know and consider it a little they knew he was right and they knew they were wrong but see a man that never done nothing but good i used to think that when i was in a baptist i used to i pondered those thoughts i thought well and that's something that that you just do good and you heal the sick you raise the debt you do everything in the world and they want to kill you now that's what i call being blind right that's what i call being deceived right got a lot of other words i could call it like ignorant and stupid but we don't like to do that that much we just put it on the basis of what they were and somebody blinded them right i mean come on the poor average guy you don't ever think about when they were stirring up the crowds to get them to call for the the killings and the crucifixions and things you don't think about a lot of those people were good honest sincere people a lot of those people were coming o joes and you know just plain people and they were maybe not as deceived as much as we would think they were just caught up in the crowd because the people that were supposed to know about who would uh be the wrong guy is the ones that they had depended upon all of their life real nice people right now bring that on down to our day for a little while and just think about it's not the methodists and the baptists and the presbyterians the pentecostals et cetera that bothers you or not right if it does you you've got to really a problem i mean if you think well i need to go back down there to that because they're better people you might as well just going back down into that because you're you're not seeing the truth you know by talking about somebody being good you know we're not talking about that we're talking about truth of the word of god all right see then in doing that who do you think is the problems today that's why you see that i spend so much time speaking against the doctrinal issues etc of the people of this message who do you think is going to deceive us i mean you're going to turn on a radio broadcast of anybody you know and and you go well you know what he explained the trinity's so good i just about see it why okay you get the point i think about that a lot folks i'm sorry i'm just human i'm sorry i i think about the ministers of this message that are so wonderful in their ways and they're talking i'm not making no joke or a lot either and they're so you know eloquent in their speeches until they can just uh have you on the edge of your seat thinking about these things and just get the whole crowd up into a frenzy you know of doing we were a certain meeting one time and and this brother was explaining the point and everybody in the building was just elated and just up but one row and i looked down through there we don't go on if it wasn't all lula heights and you know they were just sitting there just not doing nothing well you know we stood out yeah you know but uh they wasn't deceived by the person but everybody else in the building out of 3 400 500 was just elated to the things that was being said and and you know maybe that's me i don't know but i i wasn't doing a hey hey hey he's wrong hey hey hey yo sat down he's wrong i was sitting drawn up on the other side trying to not be a spectacle i tried to do that one time and this brother he was going to fix it real good for me and we were in this meeting and this brother was kind of we knew that he would more basically come out with a thought and i don't remember who it was if i never figure it out i'm going to fix them but somebody in our group took my seat and said it out in the aisle well here's a line up of chairs and i'm sitting right out in the aisle and what am i going to do i i can't get up and move but i'm sitting there just drawn up not trying not to be sarcastic or you know i'm trying to be nice and amen and what i can you know but i give god the credit for it if there's any truth in any of us it is not me and you we didn't search for it we didn't want it we didn't try to find it we're kind of like it was in the bible of those seemingly to be the outcast were the ones who would receive the truth but see in the end time you see a lot of people leading the people astray and i'm sorry i'm honest but maybe god will look at that in a different way when we get there and uh but i know the ones who know that's the way you know the ones who know the truth are going to be the problem if it's me or whoever it be but i'm trying to get you to a point of thinking get out of your previous thinking of things and how you had it all figured out to get into the real things of listening to the bible as it's written and the prophet's message as you know it's written to where that we can get a better understanding and see ourselves because what good it is to see somebody else good or bad you know i mean that's wonderful seeing somebody good right well what is the point of good or bad if it's not but just that's that's all we see we get it to the point of seeing christ and then we can glory in the fact of what we see all right trying this morning to get us to a thought about god and how real is your god i'm still on that point of thinking about how that the bible says even the eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see you know to look around and understand the things and understand god the great eternal one that you know yourself that when you first started before you heard of this message your idea of god was some spirit form or some uh angelic type of being or some um supernatural thing that would never in any way be able to be comprehended by mankind well that's going to be an eternity wouldn't it of trying to figure him out no i want to know a little bit about him when i get there then there's going to be a whole lot when i get there that i won't have figured out and it'll be an eternal partaking of the word of god because you cannot exhaust his word amen but to see it that way and comprehend it as as being seeing the truth you remember the other day we took that message and you shall know the truth and jesus said i'm the way the truth and the life well why didn't the people that heard him say that believe that he was the lord of glory they would not have killed him had they believed it that way but they were deceived by satan just like eve was in the garden and you and i can be deceived in the end time just like that and be justifiable in our own sails to think that we're right and we got it figured out we believe the prophet's message and everything and you see people used to especially is really was bad in the early part of the ministry of when i come around in the 67-68 say what the prophet says just say what the prophet says well all right that's what we need to do and this one brother you know he was wanting to to do that and he was real bad about it and i found where brother branham said luther denominated and died and might have used the word went to hell but i know he said he denominated did not i said brother would you mind quoting now you're always the one that says say it like the prophet said it would you say that well see he knew that luther then it wouldn't luther denominated it was the people after luther that denominated and and and things like that well see he knew that he was trapped he couldn't say those things i said but that's what you want always to do say what the prophet says i said the prophet said that judas went and hung himself and you go do likewise but you see to be that away then you become a sarcastic hateful old dude well if i save your soul i don't give a hoot about the rest of it you think what you want to about me as a human being but there's one thing for sure you'll know you're looking at a man that believes in the word of god and in the right way to where that i want you to have an opportunity to be able to see hear it and and all like that all right but looking at it the way we were talking about this morning that god is not a trinity of beings now that won't work that's your trinity doctrine then all right but he's not a oneness in just holding it like your finger and just you know and and uh the lysine morphe or form of god no he's not in those things he's in there not in the middle between of those two points no he is the truth that is we gave this morning that god is not complete without that triune being all right see you've got to have father son and holy ghost there was a time that he was manifested as the father there was a time that he was manifested as a son there was a time now manifested as the holy spirit but it's the same god all the way through it's not making personalities and things like that we gave it this morning that he's not the third person he's not the second person he's not even the first person said because if he's the first person that would mean there could be two more and he says he is the person all right see then we set it down to understand and we talked about how that we first were made in the image of god all right but then that he came in our image and likeness and you know all right we were dealing with then the triune being but not a trinity of beings okay we gave a bunch of quotes but see i had so many i knew better than to try to just uh you know to uh bring them all this morning it would have still been here trying if i brought all that i had on it but my wife and i tell you she won't throw any of my notes away because you know there's little pieces of paper laying all over the desk and there's quotes and there's things that i run off that eventually i will use if i get back to that you know and uh doing it but to me i look at the whole message and see then i can see that and i was thinking there this morning about six o'clock when i was sitting there studying thinking about how wonderful a man could for 40 years talk about one topic and keep it straight start off in 47 talking about one god and wind up 65 talking about one god and just set them i'm amazed to the the just keeping it so straight until you can just go anywhere in the message and just you know and keeping it in the right order that had to be god leading the man that's just the best way of being all right but now here was our thought this morning if you're going to believe it i want to know any other way that you can believe it then the fact that he when he came into our image that mankind it takes body spirit and soul to be a man all right and if god was coming in any of those ways or image then he would have to come see body spirit and soul and that that would be the fulfillment of the things and watch it in a minute when we we break it down just to hire that he could not be back there in the old testament in the form of the new birth because in john there it says that jesus had not yet been glorified the holy ghost has not been given that's the bible but told you i'm sorry i'm sorry that i can read but i knew that in the baptist church now we talk to these things in the baptist church if that belittles you it ought to where was you at walmart no i didn't at walmart when i was back there but why didn't you read the bible that john being the greatest of all the pro but the least in the kingdom is greater than he why didn't you read yeah you know but now listen then to be the true understanding of god not be a oneness and not be a trinity what was our thought this morning i'll get this in then we'll move on to the rest part of it that in body it was a body spoken into existence by the word that took six thousand uh four thousand years to build by the prophets to bring in that that hebrews 10 5 could say abadi thou and brother around said father has prepared me that's not trinitarianism a father preferring a body that was simplest statement of saying what god created a body and then stepped into it he created melchizedek and stepped into it right well is there any problem to seeing that when he created that body that when it dropped from the wound of mary that he was right there to step into it if you can see that he can step into mel chastic as a full grown surely you can see that that baby to fulfill all of the scriptures he didn't come forth a grown man came forth a child to fulfill the bible but that child was who the bible said he was born lord to christ the bible said he was an emmanuel which by interpretation why didn't they call him you ever thought about that said you call his name emmanuel you know that used to bomb falls on me not the baptist i don't worry didn't you but he said i shall call his name emmanuelle well why didn't they call him emmanuel because the bible said call him emmanuel well then i finally got enough sense to read you know especially in this message where the prophet begin to explain it says emmanuel which by interpretation is what god with us right but of course like i said big following of the message now says he didn't become god till the river jordan well who was he before then oh he's just a man within your savior it's just a man and see that won't match up all right but see in body he came forth a virgin-born body all right the spirit stepped into that body and the soul stepped into that body just as when you are born from mama and daddy that brings the body all right a spirit comes within you and he breathes into your nostrils and you become a living soul a being a person all right i still don't we think that we uh are believing that soul is real i think we're still kind of into the stages of of uh some form of spirit part instead of the realities of what it really is but i had quoted this this morning and brother joe ran it off and brought it in there then the message called faith 1961 all right look what he says we got to use faith in god to make it work and all coming down or the resurrection it says but before he died he committed oh and he says uh he repented not in the long suffered days of noah his body went to the grave because his soul was going to hell right but before he died he committed his spirit into the hands of god into the hands into thy hands come in my spirit so you see his spirit went to god his soul went to hell his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him was the spirit of god now watch him and that spirit in sondra times and divers manners anointed the prophets to bring the message to the people in the last days through christ and now in these days hear through the gospel all right so his spirit was the spirit of god who in sundry times in diverse matters spaking the prophet that's what brother brown would say he knew things because that was the spirit that was within him and then his soul coming into that would be the almighty god right the very being or person of god not a second person right god himself stepped into that body but here we go see i know our minds and that's what everything well if god got in that body and that spirit and that soul was in that body who run the world boy that's really got a masterpiece of a revelation who's handling all of this while he was in that body all they do speak it before he got that he took care of cause when he said in the beginning let it be that's it but see we think we're so smart until we show our stupidities in our thinking it didn't limit god to come into a human vessel and live that's right come on if you're that carnal about it you say well he was in the baby well how could he be at 33 years of age and it'd be in him you've got to admit some work come there even the ones with the two soul i mean the the river jordans they do admit that it comes somewhere all right well see but it's very simple a god the prophet said with no teeth the bible says lord the christ to look at that little baby and see all the things of almighty god was dwelling in that child but now come on we know the whole story because as i said this morning then that child and when that child was born it could not be your savior he couldn't display that then he couldn't manifest that he couldn't manifest a healer or deliverer etc he had to wait until time would come to those things would come into being but then when he would come into being see it would come into being correctly all right now what i want you to think about this afternoon and we're going to read a good bit about it is that god lives in a three-room house my god is in heaven and ruled everything oh wonderful he still lives in a three-room house but you just you're limiting him brother dale if anything you could say that he limited himself it's not got much to do with me and you right now you explained to me how he can put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and never remember them i won't have to explain a lot of the other things because he evidently put him in there and closed the key and forgot about him i can't but he did all right but see think about it all right we covered this morning talking about man in his makeup of a triune being and that he was a triune being of body spirit and soul that's taken from god's covenant with abraham he said like god was a trinity in a man god was a trinity all right he goes on to anoint it not number two and what does he say that's god god in her trinity is one and without a trinity he's not god he can't be manifest in any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the trinity person that you are that's body spirit and soul without either one of them you're not complete see you didn't you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a spirit you would be nothing you didn't have a body you just be a spirit not a body so god is complete in the triunity of a being not triunity of beings but one being in a triunity father son and holy ghost is one true manifested god all right he goes on into the godhead number three in paragraph 255 and he speaks of god being in three offices not a trinity three gods we don't have no three gods certainly not there's no such a thing wasn't taught in the bible and there's only one god hear your israel the lord your god one god first commandment thou shalt have no other gods before me certainly he's the one god not three that's a catholic version of it and it was you know that's for you if you want it in some other way right but think about it to be almighty god to come down as the prophet explained it not sending a son or a second person but coming down himself then would he not come down himself in the image that he was before we ever thought about him that's where you don't like to go that away with me to go back and think before the foundation of the world before anything ever happened as the prophet called in the beginning before the eternal that's going way back isn't it and talking about this being well what form was he in well why can't you think that he was like a years now did he create some kind of a way of coming into being that's coming down to where he is now would you agree now that if you went to heaven that you would see him and that you would have body spirit and soul to be able to see him and he would be body spirit and soul for you to be able to see him i know what that requires of the human mind that requires beyond all things for you to believe it i know that and i know it's hard to do but it requires you to stop your own conceptions and thoughts and to take what god says by faith and wait upon him to explain it or reveal it or make it known to you i know that and see that's why that i do not try to preach to bodies i don't try to preach the spirits because you can sit there and grin at me and be right spitting through your teeth and saying dirty words about me through your spirit that's inside of you see i try to speak to that very inward part of you that is worth the world's because it's your soul and remember it's not the body that says that sinners shall die it's not the spirit that sinners shall die it's the soul that's in it shall die now if you want to read some go into ezekiel and read that you know from the book of ezekiel where we'll get into the uh points of of talking about you know the new earth eventually when we get it laid down enough in the human mind to see what mankind really is and and are in ezekiel where he said i'll give you a new heart a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit in you and thing see we were so massively confused on that until we where it said give you a new heart and your spirit we thought that was the holy spirit the prophet said that wasn't right he said you couldn't even stand yourself with that old spirit well see we got a lot to go right but now listen think about it for a moment god had to come in into our thinking into the ability for the human mind to comprehend enough he had to descend into the point of being a triune being not a trinity but a triune being and to do that then he would be coming into our image for us to be able to understand his image are you with me it was not to come into our image i'm into like us to just be one of us do you realize that god in jesus christ learned a lot of things that oh hold on that he didn't know you know he didn't know what sin was you know he didn't know what sickness was you know he learned those things by coming into human flesh right that's why the bible says he can sucker sympathize with us right is that our high priest but don't you ever think about a triune being as what we were talking about this morning body spirit and soul into dealing with and in the triune being as in the relationship to mankind see in body he was my brother that's what he is he doesn't mind calling me brother that's in body my brother then is necessary for the human part of him to be also my sacrifice right and the only way i can get healing from the point is it's got to be that his body had to be beaten to bring forth the healing of the body right now we'll have to hold a little point because see your redemptive plan was is not finished just in the part of your body even though that's part of your plan but it's got to be finished in a person all right so in body he was my brother he's my sacrifice well in spirit he was the anointing that anointed mankind back dire dramatic him now the prophets to speak and that by being the anointing that was back dire he can anoint our spirit right to do great wonders and that's what blinds people brother dunny and i were talking about a certain person that prays for the sick and sees them get healed but at the same time he's smoking his pot and probably drinking his liquors and everything else is that true is it the fact that we just covered the other day the anointing can be upon anyone and great things hey i thought we believed that judas is carried and part of the ministry right i thought that was the bible they ain't taken that out yet if obama can make his can't have a church for twice a month he might be able to take out john 3 16. but you see that's why the anointed ones will work because of the anointing that can come upon your spirit right right because the anointing on his spirit was the anointing that spoken hundred times in diverse manners through the prophets but it was the spirit of almighty god all right so we can have that anointing on our spirit to body to body he's my brother my sacrifice spirit to spirit he can be the anointing that sure guides me leads me does all kinds of things and that's why it didn't abrupt didn't prophet we gave it this the other day anointed he wants to enter he says why you can't tell that woman that's wrong to wear them pants and cut her hair and think you can't tell her that why because she's anointed just like i was saying about the one that we were referring to what do you think about it i told a brother one time i said your gift is your problem what about an anointing on a person and there you are setting our smoke in your joint and somebody comes up and you pray for them and god heals them and here comes a genuine christian up and you pray for them and they don't get healed come on am i right see that blinds that person because they say look at what i can do when they can't do it it's not working they're working here so god must think more of me than he does them is that right is there great healing campaigns went around the country by anointed ministers but yet at the bottom they were faults and wound up being in all kinds of things am i right so then body the body he's my brother he's my sacrifice spirit to spirit he is the anointing we'll get to it where it says you know that he take away your stony heart give your spirit now take out your spirit change the problems with it see so in body he was my brother my sacrifice and spirit he's the one in sundry time this fake end times price that can anoint my spirit the word that i can love him and do a great thing but soul to soul is the almighty god the manifestation of eternal life that's what the prophet said about it right he said you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life on your spirit and still be lost but he said one time in contact with god you'll never be the same see it's body to body it's spirit to spirit and it's soul to soul that's why he had to come those ways to be able to redeem because remember as i say and when i started the body can take care of the sacrifice and the point of the worth it could be the doings and and by stripes i'm healed but the anointing won't save you and the body can't save you it's the soul that has to come forth well why don't we believe the soul to be the more real than we do the rest what are we still keeping our minds and our our because satan's talking to him see his body could not give us eternal life even by stripes i'm healed goes into the atonement which would not be just because you could touch the blood and it would heal you that would not do it see his spirit is the anointing that can anoint us to do great things but cannot bring us eternal life see because his soul was the person of his being a priest one time years ago trying to explain it and his brother went and told his other brother he said brother dale please it god's got a soul i said he was wrong i don't believe god's got a soul because that's what the brother explained it to him he said brother dale is right it's not that god's got a soul he said god is a soul that's a being that's a person that's the person of eternal life not the anointings not the things it's the person of eternal life where do we get to the baptism of the holy ghost okay see we covered it in the old testament the spirit could be there and could anoint could anoint you to do great wonderful things but could not bring you to eternal life all right because john 7 and and 39 i believe it is he said that he's not yet been glorified the holy ghost had not been given because jesus did not come to the place of being glorified you see he had to come and die to release that life this the the body could be brother the brother the spirit could while it was there in him of the spirit that anointed those prophets that signed spirit could go right over on confess and prophesy of the death of jesus christ but it never saved cophase you remember he was the guy that put the trouble so in the old testament it was impossible for anybody to have the very person of god to come upon them in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost if you want to call it that's what the prophet would call it that he sent back his soul on the day of pentecost in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost because we believe in the baptism of the holy ghost it's not the way we used to believe him the soul of man is what became lost in the fall and there had to be someone come to pay that price and it would be the price of redemption so it would mean that a man would have to come why because man fell they agree then we would understand in revelations 5 3 and 4. were the proclamation went out for a man that could take the book right and it stipulates a man he says no man was found worthy brother branham said in the breach right down under where we're giving in just a minute if we get to it he said the prophets were there he said the sages were there you know those old testament people the really great ones he said but there's no man worthy now this is all i'll say about it if they were there in a total eternity state if they were there in a total eternity state why would the prophets and the sages not be worthy to take the book that's right i say no more why would it not be but see no man was found worthy brother brown said they searched heaven they searched the earth they searched everywhere and no man was found worthy there wasn't one man worthy that was the man christ jesus the man christ jesus many would be body spirit and soul or he's not a man i hope that's beginning to click and we know for certainty that he couldn't send somebody else well he sent the son the son came down because he was a man he was you know you know what is man a dark mindful of him so god had to come down and manifest himself in human flesh to pay the price and he had to die he couldn't just get old and do you know and give it no way he could anoint with his spirit that would anoint caiaphas that would have known all the different ones but he wouldn't do no good but he had to give his soul a ransom right the price had to be paid see he had to be a man and to be a man it meant according to what we just read while ago from paragraph 102 and knoweth it not he said without either one of these you are not complete without body spirit and soul you're not complete without body spirit and soul god's not complete without father son and holy ghost god is not complete all right god is not a trinity of beings he is a triune being father son and holy ghost all right now let's just read these to where you won't think that i make up my own thoughts and ideas that's why i like for you to read what the prophet has to say at least you've got to say then well he said what he said i don't agree with him but he said what he said at least let my my life be that the word that i believe in the message of the hour for what the prophet had to say so go ahead number four and let's talk about this three-room house three-room house is body spirit and soul all right look what he says now and god's provided way of approach to fellowship in 1960. now you can only live in a three-room house did you know that god lived in a three-room house you live in a three-room house you dwell in the three-room house god lived in christ soul body and spirit well now you argue your point with him see god lived in christ soul body and spirit you live soul body and spirit you live in a house of your own here on earth you may have two bedrooms et cetera and all like that but you only live in a one in a three-room house you got bedrooms kitchens parlors go ahead to the next a hidden life which is 1955. any reader knows that there were three watch it there were three two veils two compartments and a congregation in the set up of god's tabernacle in the wilderness you had outer court inner court holy of holies there's only two veils well i thought there's three where are you gonna put the third outer court there's no veil there's a court separating outer from the second so that's why he said three two you come right back to his point see you've got the veil here read the bible you've got this out you've got outer court inner court holy of holies there's only two veils separating all right you come body spirit and soul but you're not separated okay we're going you just think of that because if you go back into the tabernacle and study the tabernacle it was a three room house outer court inner court holy of holies all right the first was the congregation in the holy place then the holy of holies that's god's house that's god's dwelling place that's your dwelling place now you only live in a three room house remember you might have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens but you only have only live in a three-room house god lived in a three-room house when god was here on earth he occupied a three-room house the soul body and spirit of jesus christ is that enough well we won't stop look what he goes on to fellowship in 1960 number six brothers just like your life you're living your life you live in the same if you only live in a three-room house god lived in a three-room house soul body and spirit god lived in a three-room house it's father son and holy ghost and you live in a three-room house the spirit comes to a three-room house justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and you live in a three-room house natural first you have the kitchen next you have the parlor and next you have the bedroom all right number seven which is the basics of fellowship 1961. in 1960 1961. like a man getting married when he gets married you live in a three-room house you know that or you say i beg your pardon i got ten no you haven't you only live in a three-room house you know you can only be in one room why do we have all these rooms in a house you only be in one room at a time right let me we got one two three we got four bedrooms the only thing i wish in my house was eight bathrooms if i ever build another house i'll build a house i'll put a bathroom and every house in the room in the house then i'll have one just in case not in a master some more sticking in the hallway because you can never have that all right listen you only live in a three-room house that you may have three or four bedrooms or three or four pantries and things like that but you actually live in a three-room house that is the kitchen the living room and the bedroom that's right you live in a three-room house god lived in a three-room house father son and holy ghost you live in a three-room house soul body and spirit why can't you put them all together and just keep on going with it come on read the next waters of separation 1955. there's none of you but lives in a three-room house that's all you live in just live in a three-room house when god was here he lived in a three-room house that's all you could live in the first is your kitchen or next to the dining room or living room the next is your bedroom you may have three or four bedrooms but there's really there's extra rooms okay going to the next one the intervale which is the message they changed back under but they still use the title interval you're living in a house soul body and spirit that's the way god lived in jesus christ both soul body and spirit not me that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me you see all right number 10 dedication of a building to the lord he says this yeah the serpent itself and the pole spoke of judgment past god's divine judgment on the serpent and spoke of the coming of christ where he would be made sin now that was what back there spoke of the coming of christ where he would be made sin and god's divine judgment would be poured out on him that he being man and god would have to come down made lower than the angel so that he might die for the sins of all his soul could not die because he was god amen well see the spirit can't die the soul can't die the spirit can't die the spirit goes back to god who gave it right i mean talking about me and you but god had god but his body had to be made a body of flesh so that it could die to be a sacrifice a virgin-born body die for a sacrifice that we sinful people might be brought not unto god by believing okay let's get the next one we'll have all of it read which is the breach so it took a human kinsman and he asked for it and wasn't found nowhere there's nobody no bishop no archbishop no priest no irk no nothing was even that didn't have didn't even have the holiest enough to even look at the book we my my that's pretty strong but that's what the bible said friends i'm just quoting what john said nobody is worthy to take the book but there had to be a man it couldn't just be a spirit an anointing or whatever it had to be that he gave his own life brother branham said he tore the soul out of jesus christ now what does he mean i mean he's reaching or you use the word ripped out of him what happened at the crucifixion we read some this morning where we were talking about his body went to the grave his spirit went to god who gave it his soul went under the altar and when time would be finished it would release he would release his spirit it would go to his soul and go to the body and said he would stand forth he did in the resurrection all right and he says that's the things that will happen to you and i we die our soul goes under the altar the spirit goes back to god who gave it and don't ask me to explain that because i can't no problem and his body goes to the our body would go to the grave but in the in the resurrection then the spirit will be released and come to the soul the soul to the body and we'll stand forth again in the resurrection all right now what happened how did that man become the kinsmen that we needed because his body was just my brother and his body could only fulfill the part that where it was beaten that the atonement would come through the stripes that he took the spirit could not come back and save us so it had to be that his soul would have to be released to come back so what happened hanging on calvary there was the body there was the one who said into thy hands i commend my spirit he spoke over in the garden right prior to the end and saying my soul is troubled so he didn't mind associating with body spirit and soul but on the crucifixion he there hung the body he said in thy hands i commend my spirit he went back to god who gave it and the soul left the body and the body was dead had to come back to him in less than 72 hours because corruption would have set in all right his soul went to hell to preach to the spirits in prison but one day when the time was finished or the bar the prophet said was finished the fulfilling of the scripture that he had to be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth when that was fulfilled his soul come to our spirit to his soul soul to the body and he resurrected body spirit and soul because he was almighty god that soul simply stepped out of that body it was not what we would call what are the terminologies would you use to just say ripped out or tore out it meant that the exit of the soul from the body is what brings death the exit from of your soul from your body brings death to your body because the spirit in the body's you know the body's no good anyway for nothing it's just helpless body without the spirit is dead but you take all that out so what happened on the cross god just simply stepped out of the body right i mean he just simply exited the body what happens when you die your spirit goes back to god who gave it you just simply step out of your body right when everything is finished and you're coming back spirit release so come back steps in the body you stand on earth in the same body you lived in right right is that hard to understand that that's what happened at calvary and then when he raised they could see that he was a body there's a little transition period in there when he said don't touch me i'm not yet ascended but i love what he told him there he said i go to your god and my god i go to your father and my father i love that scripture but you know a few days later brother brown said and i i love this because i know when you you study in science is einstein said in the fourth dimension you travel so fast he said until one object would go through the other object and never leave a hole he said you could turn a baseball inside out and never break the cover that was his terminologies of explaining speed what do you call it g-forces when they look at these things and you see a guy he's taking off on those jets and all at once his whole facial features just run all over him because that's that g-force that's contrary to the human parts of him brother branham i was listening one day and he said it like this he said he'd come back so fast he said he'd come back so fast he said he just stepped right through the wall he just appeared right among them he just come back so fast no wonder it says in a twinkling of an eye you know the batting of an eye speed but you see he come back in a body to prove he was in that body what did he say he said bring me some fish you got any bread any fish right spirits don't eat theophanies don't eat or we were in the mess he was back in that flesh again where will we see him when it's all over with we'll have a body like unto his glorious body we meet the body in the air it doesn't come to this earth we made him in the air think on these things god actually lives then in a three-room house now only thing i'm going to say is one more word where did he live before he come across that line that we drawed to call it of it beyond eternity here and back over this way that was still not time where did he come from and what they look like now according to brother branham when moses saw the back part of the man he said it looked like jesus christ and that's the theophany so you think ethiopia is going to look like one thing and we're going to be something else well you get it about like your sisters wants to get it done to the men too because we all getting into that you know well one of these days my theophany will be just whatever it was about 18 19 years old might be you right i was explaining to a lady one day and i'm sorry i couldn't have it but i believe i read her mind she said was talking about one day we'll we'll have a glorified body you know and it'll be about 18 20 years old and she was sitting there she had it was all over her she was i think she had her mind in the wrong place because i think she was thinking about she's going to get them curved you know well i don't give a hoot what they look like as long as i got eternal life i'll let him worry about what i'm supposed to look like right won't you all right we won't worry about it let's stand together we're going to go into the communion think on these things folks next we'll get into the the new birth maybe talk about some things and like i said study the book of ezekiel especially 36 there where it comes around and you know the things and it's bringing that to a point if the brothers will go ahead get everything ready let's go into the scriptures because we changed our communion over from last sunday to this sunday because so many of us being away and do until we changed it where everybody could be here all right first corinthians 11 23 for have i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread you had never thought about that paul was chosen to write about the communion when he was never there with the lord jesus all the other disciples and all were there with the lord jesus but they were never chosen to write a word about the communion so what does he say for i have received of the lord he could take all those old testament scriptures and point it right down and bring it to the communion like wade was bringing out that time that there was always that bread those things was left there to represent this that would come forth but the lord jesus same night in which he was afraid took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you this is due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chaste unto the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat pray one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home that you come not together and condem unto condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come so let's just have a few moments of silent prayer before we go into the communion and just think about these things think about what he's done for us and how he paid the price for us made us worthy to take the communion father we thank you for this opportunity this afternoon to be able to come together and participate in this communion as we call it and lord that you would make us worthy first off because none of us are worthy whatsoever if no one was worthy to take the book and if no one could even look upon the book how much more worthy would we be on anything else so we're not even worthy to take the communion but you have made us worthy you're the one that takes care of all things so we ask you to just cleanse us from any problems it would be any hindrance and sanctifies a new in you lord that we may see what these things really mean to each and every one of us forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and let your grace be sufficient bless each one that protects the lord and may we all be together as one in you in jesus name
