the thoughts still under one God series talking about the unveiling of God and things and we'll go from John 1 then we'll go to acts 2 just remember those that are away in all waiting June is out in

things and we just ask you that you would just be with each and every one of us and bless us and keep us Lord in thy grace forgive our sins lead us and dine understanding bless those or a way and just be with each and every one and bless everybody and open the eyes of our hearts that we may understand you and your ways forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and may we walk in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen we've been reading John I said we will get to that part because remember now that we're been talking and we read in John in the beginning but remember that beginning there is not it just means a point or something when something begins to be able to be made known it's not a beginning you know like you've got a beginning of it or some starting point it just means something is there because if not then where would you do it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God but now what and the Word was God saying now you're right back to the one true and living God and do it and the same was in the beginning with God so there's no beginning like we talked about beginning it's the words we use in terminologies all right all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and like shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now let's go over to Ephesians and try to pick up the thought from there from Sunday and carry it on into the right understanding okay verse 25 for David speak of concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand and I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice in my tone was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because that will not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption let's stop there because we're going to another part of the thought but remember the thing we're talking about tonight because I will not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I've tried to bring out the thought Sunday afternoon or Sunday morning rather and trying to fit together what I've been driving at for the longest and trying to bring the point of showing that what I believe now I've always tried to express one thing to you I believe in eternal life all right I believe that God always was eternal I believe that his life is the life we must receive to make us eternal all right before because of the fallen condition we'll get back to Adam which started it out but we'll see how the fall came and to that I know we've got quotes you've got things you've got people that believe all corners of doctrines about pre destinations and in eternal you know and L say oh I come here with eternal life the prophets that I did well all right but the Prophet also said you were born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse form up from your mother's womb and come forth the liar doom and on the way to hell now you're gonna say one's right and one's wrong what are you gonna say that's just the point that I'm making to you as to think about things that you read and study we studied the Bible we went to church we done all kind of things and we still had a Trinity we still had three gods or a garden three persons for whatever has it changed very much then you know from believing it that way as to coming to some other form to bypass that and get up and come further in now oh I always was eternal well well then if he was why do you have to receive eternal life well I don't have to I already know I had it all the time well now go home and look in the mirror and you I mean I hope you have enough sense to know what that's staying you look in the mirror and you see yourself getting older and older then I wouldn't believe that I always was eternal well now it's not necessarily this that well okay now what part of it that's what we're going to deal with tonight we're going to deal with what part of you would have any opportunity whatsoever to think about being before the foundation of the world surely we would have enough plain common sense to know and realize that this flesh has nothing to do with eternity at this time it is deteriorating is failing away so surely we ought to be able to remove that part out of the situation I mean you can you can holler and scream all you want to and say that well I'm not no older and I was twenty years ago I'm like brother branham it said about it he said you lied and I didn't so that it's the best way to say it you know well I am I'm just as strong well okay give you about another twenty years and let's see what you say but the thing of it is we want to I look at things like this why is it that mankind I'm talking about the whole world I'm not talking just even the people of this message are you for me why is it of mankind all around the world that he's trying to find some Fountain of Youth he's trying to find his goal has been to find something who was it ponce de leon come all the way across America every what he did wound up in Florida trying to find the Fountain of Youth well we laugh and make fun of him but what about in the religious realm and what is it that we try to do in the religious realm try to figure out some reason some reason that I believe what I believe you know not some reason for thinking about the way we think what is our purpose what's our doing what what is our thoughts every religious part that there is in some one way or another preaches a happy hunting ground or a life after this or a thought you know or an idea and what is it what part of us in our human makeup is worth anything and I don't you know I make plain statements on as a scripture in a minute I want to get to it and read that it's been many years trying to understand why Paul would say what he has and see that's the way I look at things I come to the scriptures and I study them and I try to get to the bases as I see well this is what is being said now let me see what he's saying to me and what is this the scripture speaking to me you know and trying to show me the truth right let's see we've read the scriptures all the way through we studied the Bible well what kind of a concept did we come up with well how much more is it today like I said you could take quotes out of the Bible too prove your point you can take quotes and prove this or that or the other you can prove by your cons your way of thinking that there's three gods or no gods or how many gods are or one god or whatever they are you can do all of those things from your own thoughts but what good is it I say it for your benefit not mine if there is a god you mean to tell me that he cannot keep his word straight you mean he's so so hard about making sure that it stays straight did I remember when I first saw what the Scriptures he was the Prophet was bringing about that the Jews were promised the Messiah the Samaritans you know they would come in and they would look for the Messiah with the Gentiles no promise but yet come to find out I fir it's all finished after the whole Bible is finished to come to find out that the Gentiles were the ones he was seeking after because they would be the ones who would finish up his plan and purpose but yet they're not back to her as far as God appearing we get to our point is God made so sure that the Gentiles would get an opportunity until he brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brought it to a Gentile dispensation look like that would have been enough and you know what I'm talking about it was a Gentile it's a Gentile dispensation that's why it's called that now that means anybody can be so but it's not a Jewish dispensation it's a Gentile dispensation Nations it means anybody all right looks like that would be enough to fulfill the Scriptures that would be okay but yet God said no that's not enough he said I went to the Jews and showed them the signs and the wonders he said I went to the Samaritans and I showed him the things but a woman at the way holding them but said those Gentiles that all they've had is religion to deal with now I'm quoting your prophet huh but he wasn't gonna leave us with just religion and ideas he promised that he'd send a prophet to bring the message to give the Gentiles an opportunity to be just as equal as the other and an opportunity to receive him you understand what I'm saying and in doing that then he would spend all of the time bringing out the word to make sure it would fall into the right hands and be you know everything would be perfect to where you and I could have a message in the end time that it wouldn't just be now less than one say it the Jews got the signs and the wonders the Samaritan signs and wonders are discern what the things look what he's given to the Gentiles not only did he give the signs and wonders he gave us the word what a wonderful opportunity to be living in this last days to follow the Word of God okay so follow that doubt so I believe in eternal life I've tried to show it there Sunday but I don't believe you and I come with eternal life if we did why did Jesus Christ have to die well you just don't believe what the Prophet said that's alright you you think what you want to about me that's between you and God that it's none of my business but see you won't sit down and talk with me with the Scriptures in in the prophets message because see I believe the Prophet when he says you always was eternal but I believe right back above all of those quotes you'll find him saying if you have eternal life if you have eternal life - not that eternal I've always was eternal but there was a time that I wasn't eternal I had to receive eternal life to be able to have eternal life well so then what was back before the world God eternal life what I'm trying to say son dizzy ensuring that that was the part that was back there what the eternal life God imparted his own life to you and I so what would be back before the foundation world God Himself but in him he had attributes and the Prophet said we were a part of him and I had two quotes whether I gave him or not you heard it he said if he wasn't back there before the foundation of the world you never will be well then what was back there if we don't believe that we were back there his people what was back there we wasn't body wasn't spirit wasn't so probably said not her being here know what you see the key is to remember the one thing we must receive eternal life if we were born with it you're making the Bible a total well it's worth noting Jesus Christ come and died in vain and like I was trying to get you to see see people would say in the message well it was just I come in the message he found out I always was eternal within why didn't that do with Nicodemus if it was coming into the message to find out you always was eternal why was Nicodemus told you must be born again why do you need to be born again are you saying the born-again experience is a knowledge to you that you always was eternal we need a little bit more than that because that won't hold up in the Bible well brother the hell I just don't understand you I thought I was right until I've heard you preach well you know what that means there's something wrong what you thought it may not be wrong I didn't say that I just said there's something wrong with what you're thinking because if I made you to think that you don't have what you had thought you had then I've done my job I've exposed enough to the point that you realize you got to be saved see it's not just a thought of concept eternal life is a person he's a person he's not just a thought have you received the person of Jesus Christ Wow my brother brother Dale you tell me that that I have to receive a person is that mean I'm a person and there's a person inside of me and see once well was your mind work that away why would you not try to conceive something instead of arguing about it he's not a person comes and you get in a burden you're standing here and a person comes and steps down in you like another person no but I do believe in the person of Jesus Christ coming to live in your soul and make your soul eternal and that way then I can follow it all the way through and not have to worry about it why would you have to be born again why would it not beat the Nicodemus Nicodemus I I told you you're right now I know and you believe in right all you got to do is believe it and gave it whether the disciples two times are in Lucca bleeeh was where he opened to them their understanding of the Scriptures that's the approach that people say I know I'm born again cuz I've had my understanding opened well Paul said you could understand our own mysteries in how not charity you're nothing yet we think it's just an opening of our understanding it's a concept or a thought eternal life as a person he said I've never received a person Brazil so you don't know what the person of Jesus Christ really is it's the life of Christ to come and live in you that's what we want to try to deal with tonight because we want to go back to where we were Sunday when we were talking about we ended up or bring it into the message that the Bible says in Ephesians 1:4 and verse 5 that you were chosen in him that doesn't say you were chosen by him it says you were chosen in him well that's worth it when he when he done this and the plan come out and he looked down through time and he now you got him picking and choosing and you're not in the scripture cuz I read it well the scripture back up read it you were chosen in him when before the foundation of the world when was he chosen according to the Bible or the book of life was life with a lamb that was slain was written before the foundation of the world all the prophets said if your name wasn't written and dire and never will be written in there so we were chosen in him before the foundation world you realize what he's saying or the scriptures say and they look that we should be holding without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his wheel like Wade was saying Sunday what is the will of God is his word it's his word see didn't we were chosen in him it wasn't something we done so then Jacob and Esau is not being dealt with at 1 being a good part and the other one not your profit is one it said it he said Jacob alone was seed thereby he could be redeemed so I believe in the seed right but I don't believe could I believe what the Prophet said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God but it's the seeder word I believe in the eternal seed but if you come in the world with an eternal seed you didn't need eternal life you don't realize see that's what gets me if people are still hold on that was the original to soul doctrine that you didn't need eternal life God give you a soul it was eternal Satan give you a soul you just kill the soul that Satan give you and you always was he trouble and yet people who say I always was eternal I believe it always was eater you said well that's the to soul doctrine no it's not brother well I'm still fighting after 40 years no no son and I'll fight til the day I die because eternal life to me more it means more than a thought or a concept or an idea anything it's the person in Jesus Christ that way Paul could say if not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me he said in the life that I now live what's he ah now Lea watch the two persons right the life that I now live in the flesh he's defining himself as a person huh how did he say I live by the faith of the Son of God it looks like two person has done it one of them is over this way one of the other without oh yeah but not two people do you realize what I'm trying to do is preach it on the Godhead because your concept her idea will show what you believe and you come up with too many persons and too many things what did the Prophet say in the first seal he said I used to think that Jesus and God was the same person he said until I saw that he was I'm Jesus and and God wouldn't the same person he said until I saw that they are the same person then what did he say when he said the seal broke he said here stands a lion with the book in his hand and set out D'Argo's a white horse rider he said see you've got to be the Antichrist well because he had two persons anytime in the Bible you got two persons one of them got to be the devil there's no two persons to God that I'm still trying to preach the Guardian that's reading that's still title it the one God series if God is not complete without you the Prophet said then you must be part of God that was all I was trying to express son if you have eternal life the eternal life that you have is a part of God but we were chosen in him not to just say chosen now you'll find a quote from brother Branham so then you say well brother they'll don't believe this he you can find a quote for a brother and sister see that we was chosen by him that's alright but remember your final analysis droves back to the one thing what if you're chosen by him you got him choosing if you're chosen in him it's not him you were chosen in him you have to be a part of him to be chosen in him see then that makes it turn out to the right way right because Ephesian says what now listen go ahead and pull up number two which is John 15 we know that he done the choosing now we know he done the choosing we're not guessing her growth we're taking Scripture right how do we know we were chosen by he said we were you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you yes you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you should ask the Father in my name you give it to you to realize you and God are one you don't have to worry about the prior then would you understand what I said he said I chose you you didn't choose me let's see we're still hung up in when you say you never saw God God saw what I saw God brother Dale just don't understand I saw God I pray day and night and I fasted I done it and I saw God well the Bible says you didn't and the prophet said you did now what's this saying it's not saying you didn't pray in search after it that away he's saying you didn't know how to seek after God is that what it is you never understood how to seek God how do you seek God what you probably say about seeking garden didn't you make this statement he said pray and read your Bible he's not that the way you see God no we get down to pray this away or we get before Jesus and we pray this way they're like someone was saying the other day they got it you just walk up for brother browning speech or you stand there and they play it tight your word brother branham was praying for the situation then you go back to you see what I told you 40-something years ago he's gonna get worse than you ever thought it is very deceiving down but now listen so he said you have not chosen me but I chose you you know ordained you now is that true about daughter with it Jeremiah the Prophet where the scripture said that I knew you and ordained you before the foundation of the world to be a prophet see people don't want to take the scriptures it's just a thought let's get an idea a brother told me one time he said I know I'm gonna be there I said well praise God I sure hope I am you know and I believe I am he said coach the Prophet said pray for my children and he said I pray for him every day I said you know what I didn't want to discourage him who would that be the point of praying for his children that God would save you where's the blood of Jesus Christ all right now we were chosen of him when were we chosen were chosen of him when were we chosen the Thiessen said we were chosen before the foundation of the world so that has nothing to do what you're doing or don't do come on he saw was a better guy than Jacob but God said I he saw you know I love Jacob before the Bible said either one I've never done anything that the principle of election let's stand true what about it when was he chosen that's not the problems not me and you I've tried to say that from the beginning see we say well I accepted Jesus Christ and that's where people get that and see they don't father I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior it's up to him to save me that's a good statement but how will it hold true where the Prophet said it's not whether you accepted him he said it's whether he accepted you the maroc well I accepted him I'm gonna be there I've got eternal life but you remember in your typologies the point abraham accepted God but God gave Abraham the sign of circumcision to show that he had been accepted have you received the Holy Ghost to show you how been accepted everybody else tried to make us feel so good tell us how good we are in what we are what and you you keep telling us we're lost why would you get that idea I never told you is long I'm the guy that's always propping up things - keeping it from being to the point a saying you're lost I never said anybody was lost brother left here one diamond he said brother Dale said I've lost well you know what the order stayed and prayed through or went somewhere and prayed through but now he went somewhere else to find somebody that would tell him he's alright true alright so when was he chosen alright he was chosen before the foundation of the world before anything ever came into being the wrote the book of life was written the names the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy all that back there when they saw the plan of redemption coming into view so why not try to find out how he was accepted now by what thought a reason do you have this you place that Jesus Christ was accepted never thought about that nobody thought about us being accepted it ain't whether we're accepted it's whether he was accepted hypothetical statement but what if Jesus would have refused to die on Calvary I guess that's the bigger words right hypothetical in other words it means you ain't gonna happen and can't be that way or whatever it is I'm not that educated it's just just trying to get a point across what if Jesus Christ would have refused to died on Calvary you know we know he did but I'm trying to make a point where would be our hoax if he was not accepted we wouldn't have any no the whole thing is whether or not he was accepted now how do you know for sure he was accepted now there's gonna be an odd statement so listen the reason I know he was accepted not how good he was and what he done what he thought all that's well and good I know you think like that I think on a different side I'm sorry the reason I know he was accepted is because he accepted me a little bit different right he accepted me how do you know exit because he gave me his own life and he knew that I would not be in the group that would say well I always was eternal I got the quotes he knew it would be different than that see the only way you could know anything is right in the Bible is by your own experience but I know it's right cause the prophet said it mm-hmm be careful remember I still do have an ability to quote a little bit what about when he was preaching to my horse rider is the whole ego hmm so you don't want to talk like that you'd eat you you you get confusing the point that you don't listen to what I'm trying to bring I'm trying to bring salvation to a point to you and I to realize what we've got now is the life of Christ living within us and if not then we need to be born again we need to be born again it's not the fact of whether or not we all two or whatever we've got to be so then if you're not satisfied with your new birth heaven help you don't stop seeking God you know what I always say when they get to that point I'd rather go all to my life seeking God and find out at the end of it that I had it all the time then to go all of my life thinking I had God and get on the end of it and find out I didn't have him see then it comes back to the evidence of the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost where do you believe the word or not in this shouting speaking in tongues crying I believe in all that so does your prophet so there's a Bible but what is the real evidence that the Prophet said God straightened him out in a vision now do you understand what it means when you say the God straightened me out do you realize what that means he was wrong come on when your profit stood there to show you how much God honors our prophet in his words you go back and check and see if I'm right when he was in that church age series in time when he was preaching that the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit get on the end of the message and listen to him he said if I have told you the truth let God come and vindicate it is it right and you know what God come down and vindicated right why because truth had never shined on the light of the word of that way so he wasn't responsible so he was okay and God honored the gift instead of the man are you with me so he chose us in him because we are his children now may I bring it this away we're not Trinitarians we use thoughts and concepts right because your prophet will say he said there he was said he's the father and said out of the father came to son and said out of the son came to lo gosh did he come out as a son as one having a beginning who created all things according to the Bible Jesus Christ did but according to Bible the father created according to the Bible God created you know evidently somewhere in the line it must mean that the father and God and the Holy Ghost is the Ceph same person and Jesus is his name and Jesus Christ created all things not the flesh no listen to what I'm getting here see we think that God in some way chooses us because of some good deed we done well I didn't do this I remember trying to preach a message one down and brother Colley got onto me after them and he was alright I don't know he knows that he knows what he said I told her one time I said I'm the chiefest of sinners I said with the Apostle Paul I stand as the chiefest of sinners brother Colley got up behind me and he said brother Dale is wrong in what he said they've called he never went out and drawn this and done that and done these other things that we all done I got up back up behind him and I said that's why I'm a chiefest of sinners because the closest one is the chiefest you realize clothes we liked how close Nicodemus was he realized how close Nicodemus was come on you don't think how close Nicodemus was not just cause he's a good guy he done all of the things in he he'd always live right there over there but he put his life on the line and went before the Lord Jesus Christ to talk to him which if I'd have found him the are they to blackballed him all the way through the right tone him out of the sin of the Sanhedrin sand everything in the world the man come up and asked a simple question he asked about salvation some way because Jesus said you must be born again what about it a man that close to the truth we get he turned and walked out I thank God for the things better Brennaman we've heard him say things he said that I've heard him say wringing my heart after thanking God for he said Nicodemus and Gamaliel would be given eternal life he said there's no record there received it he said but they'll be given eternal life I said glory when Nicodemus to walk up on one day and yes hey if you hadn't come I wouldn't be here that's a wonderful thought it's not just but to think about how close a man was to the Kreutz but yet he couldn't follow the truth how close are we when we studied the message we had in the message we formed by the message we we live by the message the cop couldn't home being vine what do you put your salvation huh okay you know back up come on you back down to hurt the war all right when was he chosen their lifestyle he was chosen before before before before the foundation of the world he was chosen when what did the prophets say in the beginning What did he say before the eternal you realize you cannot explain that no how can you explain in the beginning but before the eternal the back dark he was chosen and you know what then when the hopes we got is the fact that we were a part of him you said watch out him did to father choose the son listen Church when Almighty God Father whatever you want to call him when he had those thoughts within him and those thoughts were eternal he thought of you not thought of you as an object to something he thought of you as one of his children that's what I was trying to say Sunday he thought he was being one of his children then who was accepted not because he moved over into a son that had to take place for it to work out right but I thought the Bible said the probably end wave was bringing it out and brought out to get him anytime they brother Ron said Jesus never died to give us an inheritance he said he died to redeem us back to that inheritance the Bible says our inheritance is eternal life so God had to become flesh and die we'd be able to pass out that eternal life there was no way his children could come into being without his death so then what was the choosing he was choosing his own word or seed his own children they were a part of him that was what was back there was part of him the only way we can talk about being back their only way we can talk about eternal life is to be a part of him and then let him impart his own eternal life out into his children because according to acts 17 let's get this one I don't get nothing I'll get this scripture anyway look at the next one I want you to look at Scripture and see see the way God says things maybe one of these days it'll don't own you to take the word and listen to try to see what it's talking about look what he says this is Paul Mars he'll write acts 19 I mean 17 Paul on Mars Hill and what did they have now what's the end of the story what did they have on Mars he'll I was trying to hit this the other day I know I need to come into that that's so wonderful they had all kind of little cubicles right there spots or places and they had a little guard sitting there right am i right now wouldn't just open spaces they had something that represented their God right a statue a dog a cat or a horse or a mule or you know and Paul when he gets down to that he says now this unknown see they left one little place just in case they missed him that one little place and they said to the unknown God and Paul picks that up and he says I'd like to explain to you this unknown God and he explained Jesus Christ see they were Mars Hill they they wanted to hear stories they loved to hear things according to histories and that that was really their meeting place to learn about their gods and some new thing or some something they always wanted a new thing about the people in the message okay we look what he winds up saying to conclude this one he's talking about watch what he said for in him we live and move and how our being who's he talking about this unknown God that they're looking at he's explained to him that is Jesus Christ and what a certain of your own poets have said in other words your own people oh smart he used it against them he knew what they had talked and says your poets saying that we are also his offspring he's smart he used it against him see how could he argue with him when he was quoting them the words you say we are his offspring listen for as much then as we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is locking the gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's devices now what does he mean why did he say that simply because of one thing they had their little places and they had the little images believed in they were God this group believed this was God this group this was gardius group that was going all of them had it and then it was one little space just in case they messed up and didn't get them all they left one just in case what a marvelous statement I've studied that forty some years till this week what does he mean or as much then as we are the offspring of God we're not to think that the Godhead is like undergo or silver or stone graven by art and man's devices they had their arts and devices sitting there to represent their gods right are you in me they had their images they had their things they had a toad stew you know they had a toad frog they had a dog they had of this they had an image they had something ever God they could think of and just in case they missed it they just left open hole Paul has just explained the greatest message to them and effort to marvel that could ever be thought of that Jesus was Almighty God right he just explained that Jesus was Almighty God he says then in other words in plain language he said then what do you want me to do you want me to go out here and take some mud and form it together and build me a little bitty something and set it in that hole he said because the Godhead is not that the Godhead is not silver and gold the Godhead is the offspring of Almighty God he said oh but you can't look too far I wasn't the Prophet that made the statement that he said God is not complete without you I didn't make that statement he did are you listening Paul turns back to him and he says look you say you're the offspring of God and they say yes with what we believe well it is your garter toads - why don't you look like him is your God God a horse is your God there so your guard down why don't you look like him he said the Godhead is not to be gold and silver the Godhead is to be a living people no no the Godhead was in him how many times he want me to quote brother branham now Oh God was what'd he do pour it into Christ all Christ poured into the church to take her back to the garden so whatever God is Christ is so now you see the God is not completely that's you God's not complete without you why because you're as how spring but I'd say now brother mark make me an image to represent your God he's waiting well I'll have to go down to know what I'd make him I'll try to make me I don't know you asked me gonna be careful what I'm saying you listened you asked me to show you what my God looks like that's what's your prophet said he said Jesus Christ at about thirty was the closest of anything he'd ever seen they were stalled by Hofmann all right so you know what Jesus must look pretty close like Hoffman he's not silver and gold do you want me to build you a statue of what I think God looks like he wouldn't listen a few weeks ago when I cried and tried to get you the Prophet said Hoffman caught that the closest anything he'd ever seen and you remember he saw him more than one time the card head is not silver and gold if it was you'd build your guard to look like what you want him to be but your Godhead has looked like a human being and what then is the rest of the Godhead I said be careful in catch what I'm saying I'm looking at the rest are the part of the Godhead that we're connected to you said you're going a little bit too far that ain't far enough we ain't stepped over yet do you think that's too far then you just hold on until we get to finishing with this message you might find out a little few things because you see I believe that what the Prophet said he said God wanted a man in his own image and they made the man in Genesis 1:26 and 27 in his own image he made at the off me man but it was a man that even Moses saw him Abraham saw him and what did they see what do you think Abraham saw old man dragon I thought your prophet said that they saw Jesus in theophany that's what I thought see the Godhead is not locking the gold and silver the Godhead is locking under Jesus Christ and the people are he is offspring what is his offspring to look like I thought I'd preach this out and went have nothing for Sunday but I still got a lot rolled up here you that got him just keeping with we get back to it Sunday but do you understand what I'm getting at what does your Godhead look like what does your God look like well nobody's saying God at any time well would you mind keep on quote read that Scripture I mean you you're quoting part of it you got it right no man seen got it but the Sun came to declare maybe two scriptures putting together but is it right the only begotten of the Father hath declared him or brought him out into the open that he could be saying he said to Philip Philip if you've seen me he said you have seen the father and according to my Bible it says the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him so kurtter know here a few pages and read something where your prophet said when he went to hell he said you went with him he said when he walked the streets he said you walked the streets with him since when he was crucified said you just crucified with him I said when he rose you rose with him cause we're his offspring where was the children act where were we act when Jesus was here he wouldn't in Jesus we never will be so we were in Jesus Christ not his little identities our people are persons right gonna run said we were there in gene phone where was he had I mean where was we at when he was here remember my whole thought is one thing to get to see if he if he's accepted then I know I'm accepted why because the eternal life that I have now in me was a part of him that's the only way I can know for sure D that I've been accepted well you just make us think that we think we get it all figured out and you come along and and you bring out these great things and we think it's just you trying to with your brain to show how smart you are I ain't worried about it I've said this before and I don't worry about it if my intellect can out preach your Holy Ghost then I would be concerned whether I had the Holy Ghost or not if what I've taught is the truth and lines up with the prophets message oh now I ain't talking about a little bit we differ here we differ over here you were terminologies working human beings well you think he's this I think he's that way little bit little time but not off the word you see where Paul was anchoring that thing down he was preaching Jesus Christ as a human being right and he says you think you're God he's like unto them stones out there in him them images you made said it's not so you yourself are denied it by saying we are his offspring we know we're not be beautiful and we let's make us tourism and get ready to quit I mean say that was 20 people sitting out there 20 idols you realize what Paul was saying to him did you say we're his offspring was your garden look like it would look like this buyer then we all need to look like a bar dog we need to look like the dog but he said that Godhead is not like that you've done prove that yourself because you didn't make a statement they say they're their offspring and they say their offspring and they say their offspring and they say their offspring he said you say there's a whole group that he is your you're his offspring so every one of you are wrong he said because I've preached Jesus Christ to you and he's Almighty God and said we are truly his offspring because we're his children I'm not trying to be able to name each to look like something I thought that we were to take this image to walk into the stature of a perfect land to let it be his image do you understand according relations 3 we are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus according to Romans 8 we are the children of God and we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ so you realize now that I'm trying my best to explain to you brother Dale don't know God is an image my God is a person he's the person of Jesus Christ I hope you follow that and keep it for another couple of messages oh it's burning in the heart to see them stand out there see who see Jesus Christ stand out there and say let time be in a world comes into be who from from Jesus Christ who are you gonna put my car to speak it in existence I'm at it who are you gonna say spoke it into existence I was just a spirit brother day me go ahead but remember one thing Psalms 139 in continuance was my members fashion as Wade was bringing up when he's yet not perfect you know not complete not brought out but he said in the book they were written a book the book of the lamb slain before the foundation the world must have had a whole lot what part of you was back dire what part of you was back there let me read that one we played over number eight brother Anderson let's read number eight it's gonna be the problem till we get everything set up when I get over here and then back dark and you know he's cold we're gonna be running backwards before right in the middle of the golf thing and I'm will be that'll be alright questions and answers on Genesis the first man now he made the first man in His image now you know the quote that goes back up above there where he said God's first creation was himself and out of him he created the Sun and out of the Sun created the logo son out of the hogar square you know the story you know the state once you've been reading it he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first created image when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious for anything as far as I know of but I was there oh I don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of our man Neville and the rest of you all here see we love did they get back up here now I'm not I'm not against all of your doctrines and ideas that people are that's your business you see you put everything in brother branham and you run it back up in there you got a problem I don't preach that away I preach the Word of God that's up to you to believe the rest in it I'm gonna argue with you cause our green ain't gonna sell nothing but look he said there would see we can say like I said we said brother Branham was back there I just believe he was back there in the same quote what does he say now there was some part of our man Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever begun some part of you what was that what was that it was a part of God and was before the foundation of the world and will hold true to bring all the way out to where we're at I'll leave that we get to Sunday morning let you think I'm a firm believer in eternal life I'm a firm believer in Jesus Christ is Almighty God I'm a firm believer in that Christ had to die to release the lot see he didn't die didn't listen inheritance inheritance would weave the father he died to release the life and now I know can I quote a little bit we say but God can't die you ever heard him in the message don't you on your seventh on your River Jordan people you never to make history my god take die I'll have you know my god came down Road random City do you but he said God can't die in spirit we said he died in the flesh - what was the death of the flesh releasing the life that could come out to go into you and I the only way it could be done was for him to die to release the life with God in spirit came - hi I'll show you where brother Owen said he said God in the Holy Spirit came down what about it what part of you was back there my brother do you really got us now huh we've always believed that you said there wasn't nothing back there I still say there wasn't nothing back there Luke okay we were just a part of God that was back time if I have eternal life and not eternal life that I have was back time if you have eternal out to eternal life you have was back there before the world our words get it may I quote brother Branham he says there is no honest maybe he didn't use the words he says there's no to eternal life don't make sure to get the right statement he said there's no to eternal life they can't be to eternal lives there's only one eternal life right come on musicians think on these things is your Godhead silver and gold well I never thought about you know that if your Godhead is anything other than Jesus Christ you're making it some kind of a of an image you're making it some kind of an image or something I told you my image that's why I love it and that prophet said it and I caught what he was saying back there a long time ago when he said Hoffman at 33 is the closest thing of Jesus Christ that I've ever seen he's got ones what was it bro more what did he said in there he said now I don't like his picture and you most of it if you look around you'll find most of the time that they are related in showing sometimes I believe his name is wrong brown or something and he said I don't believe in here but he said the image that was betrayed there was the closest that Jesus Christ so what would Jesus Christ look like in eternity like Jesus Christ but you know what do you look like the one that appeared to Moses you know what do you look like the one that appeared a Brian as he appeared to you we see somebody come along say but brother to help brother branham say brother branham hi so Jesus you know what he believed what he believed wouldn't you if you believe what you believe about Jesus looking like Hoffman's head of Christ and somebody said I want to tell you what my Jesus looks like then he described some hardness looking outfit what would you say well I got a right see what now you ain't gonna write to see God the way you want to see God no brother told me one time said this brother said then he believed what God was so and so I said I don't care what do you believe God is that ain't what the Prophet said are you strong enough to put all your faith into that so you're gonna find out pretty quick what this thing's all about those time's running out time is running out you gonna find out whether what you believe is right or not Oh Stan what do we got 176 and 176 anybody have a need 119 to read will
