or clock again they're pushing legislation that we do not go into that whatever that is in november this is daylight savings time right coming up so whatever the other one is we won't have it anymore so i never did like it very much anyway keep the time the way it is hey all right so let's go to hebrews 9 11 and we will just background for a few minutes i know you got your papers in your hand we're going to start on the dimensions now just before we get started um when you look at those charts that come from and we'll give you quotes to to back that up brother joe's give it to us brother dale preached on it several years ago and that's your seven dimensions on that on that chart there and thank god for a prophet because if you go online and try to find all them and verbatim like he talked about them you ain't gonna find them right they're gonna talk about different things but it's not gonna lay it out like brother i'm laid it out because the world doesn't know the fifth dimension the world doesn't know the fifth dimension is where the unbelievers go my lord in this day and time there is no fifth dimension everybody's going to heaven they said so but we're going to have to cover them a little bit now remember before time started before time started it was all in a state of eternity it was it was their youth was being renewed adam and eve was was eating off the tree of life and that's the way it should have been and they would have come to eternal life in their body sooner or later amen amen and god was able to walk through this dimension and not not worry about it so to me there was not any dimension until dimensions until sin happened then we're going to see where the prophet said time came into being after the fall all right so uh the first the time the light and the matter and then you got sea taste filled smelling here now adam and eve were putting seed taste filled smelling here before the fall to contact their earthly home because they could eat they could breathe they could talk they could see they could smell but they didn't they lived in perfect faith because they didn't really they didn't have to have faith like we have to have faith we have to have faith for healing right we have to have faith for the atonement right they didn't have to amen but now when the fall happened everything slowed down got put back into time god had to make these dimensions because all of a sudden you got abel being killed well abel got to go somewhere he can't stay here he can't go in the fourth dimension he can't go in the fifth dimension he can can't go in the seventh dimension so he's got to go somewhere to wait a time for all things to be brought back together and we'll look at that with our bigger chart that we got what where it says adam to the future home and they're laying around here somewhere so um i believe though that adam and eve lived in i believe it was the seventh dimension all of them were together that's just what i believe because they can move in and out anywhere they wanted to i believe they could see angels i believe they could see because there was no other dimension to me because god brother brown said god came down in the cool today and talked to adam and eve you know face to face all right now remember he also did that to moses but he didn't do it to moses like he did adam right that's right everybody got that because moses wasn't the son of god adam was he was looking at god was looking at his progeny now he was looking at moses as his prophet and abraham as his friend but not as a genesis 1 26 person because that had to be withheld until jesus christ came himself and brought that with him so just keep that in your mind but we're going to background just for a minute so let's go back to hebrews 9 verse 11 and let's pray dear heavenly father thank you for this evening that you give us the middle of the week that we can be re-energized and recharged from all the daily grind that we go through lord we know you're there with us but sometimes it feels like the world's just closing in on us but father you said you would be there you said you wouldn't leave us or you wouldn't forsake us you'd not put on us any more than we can stand so father i pray that you would just open our eyes give us the eye salve so that we can see you lord see the time that we're living in and that we all are part of this great eternal plan that you thought in your mind before the foundation of the world and it has not changed since lord we just got to make sure that we're a part of it that we connect ourselves to the eternal plan father we pray lord that you'd be with each one that's sick brother homer lingard we call his name lord every night because he needs prayer lord we talked to brother claude yesterday he needs prayer also lord he's doing better but they're out there in 17 below zero weather and we know how that is lord it's just it's a horrible time for all those people we pray that you just protect each one give each one travel and mercies thank you for bringing our brothers back home lord safe and we pray now that you'd be with each one take care of us on the rest of the week coming up lord and as we come to take communion may we clean ourself up lord and sanctify ourselves for this journey we know we can't do it but we know the one that can lord you're the sanctifier because of the washing of the water of the word we can be sanctified father we ask lord that you bless our pastor keep him strong be with brother curran lord and bless him raise him up lord touch him lord as he's i'm sure watching in now lord i pray that you give him supernatural strength because our natural strength is not any good but lord when you break through it that sound barrier is the prophet said and come into this dimension lord there's a noise it's a noise of healing and the noise of your saints raising their hand and saying thank you lord for what you've given us father we pray that you'd be with us in the furthermore this service in jesus name we pray amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building brother dale's been on hebrews 10 5 on that for a while neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and we thank you again for for all prayers we praying for each other we are praying daily for each other get somebody on your heart call their name if you have to call it again god's not deaf but it's good repetition to be able to call someone call the brother and sister's name and and uh you may be the one that breaks through amen so let's go to quote number one and it's one we've been reading and we're going to keep reading it because this it's worthy of reading jobs the oldest book in the bible was supposed to be even be written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption and yet redemption was far be way before that redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed so before the dimensions started before sin happened before there was an earth before there was time light and matter there was red eternal redemption there was something going on in the mind of god and he was only going to unfold it completely down here in the end time amen he let it out in little pieces all down during the church ages and all down in even in the old testament he was showing types and shadows and types and shadows but remember a type has to have a reality to it and a shadow has to have a reality to it there has to be a there has to be a book before they can be a shadow before you see that shadow there's got to be this real book so brother brown said that the old testament was types and shadows shadows meaning it had to have something real well god was the only one that at that time had eternal life in the old testament everybody understand that when when sin happened in the garden of eden adam could not produce another son of god or daughter of god the way god wanted them produced because the womb of their mind was messed up amen so god had to take that ability or take that book back from adam the title deed brother brown calls it what's the title deed is something written down it's something that's given to somebody amen so the title deed then was written though brother john before the foundation of the world this is yours before the foundation of the world but you don't know that yet all of it you didn't know it when you was out in the world of sin but you know what there was see there it was for you so god foreseeing god foreseeing always for knowledge and making a way of redemption now a way of redemption means there's we got lost and god had to make a way back because man can't wait make a way back we cannot redeem see boaz could redeem naomi and show a beautiful type but boaz couldn't redeem boaz boaz needed a redeemer that's why they all made sacrifices which covered or capoed their sin until christ the main sacrifice come being a high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle what his body and then inside that body of jesus christ was a soul a soul that not could just that could not just have to go into a dimension and stay there see that was adam's problem adam when adam died he went into the dimension he couldn't help nobody but god when he died as jesus christ when the body died he stepped over in another dimension went to preach to the souls in prison picked up the people in paradise took him to heaven come back down on the day of pentecost he's the only one that can do that he's the only commun one that can move between those dimensions he's the only one that can do that and he's moving through them to get to you so to me though the looking at these dimensions it's really interesting as we get a little bit closer to that sixth dimension which is where the believers go when they pass away so we'll get to that though maybe before easter we'll try to get to it but look for the bible plain that says that christ was predestinated for ordained and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world according to what revelations 13 8 kind of kind of something when it's revelations 13 8 in hebrews 13 8. yeah okay slain before the foundational world that's right way before the world was made god had a plan of redemption now remember that plan could not change when god thought it it was perfect can't change you can't change nothing it's like brother dale said and i've always said you say well i can't understand this listen this is the only way you can understand god or he would have wrote it different right amen he'd have sent a different prophet right he'd have sent a different brother dale he'd have sent you another pastor he sent you everything you need you know what the problem is [Applause] i can't i just don't i don't understand if you got the holy ghost you got to understand that's right so if you're not understanding pray for the holy ghost don't pray for an emotion pray for the holy ghost pray for the holy ghost and he's going to have to lead you and guide you into all truth because you promised then you can take him when you get the baptism from the holy ghost you take him to the word you say god i don't understand this but if you're inside me you've got to explain this you've got to put some preacher some brother some sister in my way problem is that sometimes we get in the way when god wants to put somebody in the way we'll get in the way but i hope that's what you're seeing it's not just times and all these charts and things that we're doing this is redemption this is just a simple plan that was before the foundation of the world it's just that you and i have a way to navigate through it now and not have any like brother brown said not to make a new doctrine but to straighten out old doctrine that you are sealed if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you cannot be lost if if is a big old word if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life always was eternal we'll get to that titus 1 verse 1 says paul the servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness and hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior we need preaching we need a five-fold ministry one man cannot fulfill that five-fold ministry now reason i said that now brother brown did fulfill the five-fold ministry when he was alive and preaching remember the angel said do the work of an evangelist he did the work as a pastor he did the work as as uh obviously he was a prophet but he wasn't that kind of prophet he was above that prophet he was an he was a seventh church age messenger prophet he was a prophet to bring one specific message now if we got prophets in the five-fold ministry now they don't bring one specific message they're for the people to help the people to discern and i believe we got them we just got to let them work but this was promised before the world began through preaching this is the way it's going to have to listen you can press play all you want to but it's going to take a prophet pastor teacher evangelist apostle it's going to take all those to perfect you you might listen to the prophet of god all your days of your life and die and go to hell didn't caiphus stand up and say we have moses's message in other words if it was a tape recorder of moses preaching caiaphas would have said we got moses preaching we be abraham's children you know what jesus looked at him and said the word looked at him the word looked at that and said you're dead right you got a different daddy than i do wow that's those two spirits and they'll hate you oh my goodness brother claude and i were talking about it last night you know the two spirits one's gonna one's gonna hate the other one not just not just like them one's gonna hate the other one so let's go to ephesians one this to me sums up the whole thing paul an apostle jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are ephesus and lula and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father sounds like he's trinitarian doesn't he bless be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessing he can speak that the world can think that but in his mind never was a trinity right right but that's the way god hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn like you and i according as he has chosen us in him before the foundational world that we should be holy without blame before him in love already before the foundation of the world having predestinated by what foreign knowledge having predestinated us into the adoption of children see he can predestinate down the line because he knows that line you're going down and not make you go down that line remember the prophet of god said god didn't put you through a little hole and pull you through a tube no it's your choice wouldn't moses stand up one day and he said choose you this day who you'll serve he was telling the people of god that right choose you this day who you'll serve all right so they had to make a choice so do me and you having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what is his will his will is his word all right to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved the only way we're accepted is through him we're not accepted in any other thing we're not accepted in our own works and our goodness and our own well you know i've been in the message 50 years so what in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded i like that word heaped heaped it upon us toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now here he's going to tell you he's going to make known to you the mystery of the will of god amen all right according to his good pleasure which has purposed in himself because remember we're working right now under permissive will i haven't really got on to that but we are this is permitted right this is permitted power that satan has this is a permitted life that god's given you because your mom and daddy brought it here totally different than god wanted you to come but he by a new birth he has brought you to himself amen chosen you in him before the foundation of the world having made known unto us what us that mystery of where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going according his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself what was he perfect why did he purpose it in himself because he can't listen he has entrusted sure he has entrusted me and you to take this to the end time but he didn't trust nobody when he stood and he said i'll do it remember the bible said the bible said when he couldn't swear by no other he swore by himself that he was going to do this plan of redemption and you know what if he's eternal and perfect and cannot right can i make a mistake but all we got to do brother luis is connect ourselves to that according to his good pleasure which is purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time like right now he might gather together in one in other words type those loose ends that's what he's saying he might gather together what well if obviously if he had to gather it together it got pulled apart somewhere he's gathering it together all things in what in in in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance we weren't just come down here with a silver spoon in our mouth people i don't care what nobody says the bible says he's born in sin and shaping the iniquity spouse from your mother's womb a liar doomed and on your way to hell put about four scriptures together okay there's none good no not one jesus even looked at that brother that was talking to him and he said i'm not worthy i'm not good now what and it's in his humanity and it's in humanity sure jesus made mistakes as a human he didn't make mistakes when he spoke the word of god though because he was the word of god amen in him also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who foresaw who worketh all things after the council of his own will in other words he wrote the bible he saw what was going to happen he wrote the bible and then he sent it down to us so it can't it can't go wrong there's no way it can go wrong and i'm again like brother dale quit questioning why god did it this way it's the only way we're going to be able to understand how would you think jesus stood one day and he said why me a father if my child asks for bread give him a rock or ask for this and i give him a serpent so why would god send his word to confuse his children he's not going to send his word to confuse you that's right maybe you're not a child if you're confused we just got to hit let the rubber hit the road okay i feel a lot more more like brother dale i used to look cross-eyed at him every once in a while when he said i wish i could make you realize you were lost right because you know what if you realize your loss you can do something about it if you think you're saved nobody can help you except god amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will let's read christ the mystery i kind of condensed these just a little bit so we could uh we could kind of hurry through this christmas mystery god now back in the back part of god's mind so that's where that's where the prophet of god went he went into the back part of god's mind how did he do that he did it by the opening of the seals the seals opened and he could see further than he'd ever seen remember he was a prophet he was the eagle he was the he was the one that came up the highest and he could see all four directions but you know what he done he didn't say okay you can't have this no even in the vision brother branham remember the vision where brother brown leaves somebody was covering it the other day he said look on this look stay right here and look on this in other words look on these 1100 tapes if i go away i'm going to go away but you look on this right here and you know what did they do they did just like the children of israel did they said yes brother and we'll do that no problem we'll do that and then when he died they scattered like the wind and never understood they never stayed there and looked but you know what you and i you and i were purposed to do that stand here and look on this what the full opening of the book in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed in other words be a father to be a son to be a healer to be a savior to be a redeemer to be all those great attributes just like you and i as men and women we we long to have children or we long to have this or that or the other well that longing is inside of you right because you're you're born in the image of god i don't care adolf hitler was born in the image of god he was a human being but by choice he decided not to do that he decided to yield himself to that other spirit and you see what happened so now let's go to genesis 1 26 and we richard said are you not going to put the scripture up there i said i think i can quote it without putting it up there so god created a man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female created he them that's all you need to know so god created a being he brought something to the forefront and remember we were talking about that was every born-again believer did everybody understand that genesis 1 26 is not every human being it's not moses it's not elijah it's not the great prophets in the old testament not even john the baptist you say oh no he got the holy ghost he might have got the holy ghost but he didn't get the new birth he might have got an anointing because he was a prophet you know why because jesus looked at him he said the least in the kingdom what is the kingdom there's your kingdom that the kingdom is the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul the new birth not just an anointing right amen and he looked at that person he said the least in the kingdom is greater than john the baptist john preached the kingdom john saw the kingdom standing there but it was not his time the the testator had to die you looked in john 5 i believe it is it says the holy ghost had not been given because jesus had not been glorified in other words jesus had not been put on the cross to release that life he couldn't release that life under blood of bulls and goats it was only that life of the blood of the bulls and goats i hope you understand that because it really will help you in in redemption now now when jesus died on the cross he put both hands this way new testament old testament he pulled those old testament saints in but they're not going to be in that city as bride bride is only those that are lost and then god by the baptism of the holy ghost takes that kookaburra nature out of you and puts that weak nature in only god can do that he didn't do that for moses he didn't do that for aaron he didn't do that for all the ones in the old testament they all had flaws i think today how in the world could he take somebody like rahab the harlot and bring something through it but he did because he's the only one who can clean it up right but there's your tops and shadows don't let us don't let us try to go marry a prostitute hello we know better we've been born again david would not have had his best friend killed if he'd have been born again because that nature of the old david was still in there and if the nature of god was in there david wouldn't do that same way me and you we don't do the things we used to do i hope amen so by foreign knowledge god knew all these things and four knowledge is what and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose many are called but few are chosen though a lot of people are called but he's talking about right here these are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no back part of god's mind those he foreknew he did see or predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son why because he saw what we would do and wrote this thing right here for us you'll never get born again you'll never be a child of god till you see yourself in the word if you can't see yourself in the word tonight you can't be a child of god something has got to resonate in this bible but that's me that's for me and i don't even if it's a type or a shadow we were all rahab right we had many husbands we were a woman at the well but he knew we would want this as brother brown said that man said said god if you don't give me the holy ghost you're going to find a pile of bones sitting out here and wherever it was the wood pile have you been that serious yet if not then maybe you need to start because like i said before the days there's two things you should not do in this church number one is misunderstand because we've been over it june and i were talking coming up the road and mama was saying last night at home she said it's i've heard this for 50 years and brother dale hadn't changed and brother claude always tells me he said it is scientifically proven that you have to listen to something 14 times before you can get it into your brain 14 times so i'm on sermon number six brother dale's been on sometimes 90 sermons and he reviews and reviews and you know why reviews it's like jim said well maybe she didn't get it this time but somebody else did but a good pastor doesn't leave anybody behind he knows what you need and god knows what you need amen so don't worry about if we're see i'm backgrounding this for six sermons i'm backgrounding this same identical thing right here but are we getting something a little bit extra every time that's i'm even getting something a little bit extra every time so like i said before if the plan of redemption doesn't isn't more clear now than it ever has been in your life you need to ask god to get you up that statue of a perfect man to where it says knowledge patience godliness brotherly kindness all the different ones as brother claude now we're talking about he's preaching on the uh the kinds of love which is eros and then the love for your for your husband and wife and then you are for your brother and your sister and your mom and your daddy and then the love for your wife and then none of those even touch that love that's what that love is agape love that agape love is way past and it's not that good sloppy stuff that we like you know huggy kissy sweetie uh no brother brown always said love is corrective hey man for knowledge everybody got foreknowledge you should but like i said before we're going to go over it again number three we're going to let brother brown explain it right here he explains stuff a lot better than we do the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better predestination looks back to foreign knowledge and foreign knowledge looks to destination but god not making set in order a little hole that you have to go through and you can't go no other way that's not the way he did it but god in order to be god he knowed the end from the beginning how about a god that even the prophet said he knew how many fleas that god would make that ever be on this earth and how many times it bat it's little bitty eye you can't even see a flea and he's got an eyeball and he's got tala that stuff that matter that gets inside of you he knows him how much that would how can we understand him but brother louise he he give us a way to understand what we need he gave us a way to understand i don't have to understand how many times the nat bats die but i know the guy that does hey man i know the guy that does know google ain't got nothing on god way before google ever even got started god was already doing it himself he's got all the information we need all we got to do is pull it up in his bible pull it up in the prophet's message number four questions and answers this is the one we were talking about and listen we're not trying to be different but we are different i know some of the ministers that are here i'm just going to say it they probably had a little a little problem when they first got here about because all you hear everywhere you go is you always was eternal you had this eternal seed in you all you needed to do was realize the message was right all you had to do is realize you know hear the mother eagle crying you're all you know that not even going through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost and and you hear that so much prevalent in the message and then you come here and we're you're you know we're not trying to disprove that i believe that but you got to put it in his right condition you got to put it in his right way if you are born again tonight you that i'm looking at not was not always eternal right that thing inside of you that you accepted on the day you got born again that is eternal and it's working its way out through the plan of redemption don't ever the prophet of god said i'll bring the quote maybe next sunday he said never forget that word right redemption how can i take a cuckoo burn america grain oh brother wait i always was wheat well well i'm gonna read you a quote and you'd argue with brother brown okay we've read this before i got like seven quotes on this i just picked a few how can i take a cuckober and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it i can't save myself you can't save yourself you can't save your children but i know somebody can i know somebody can and look it's impossible for me and you but what did the angel say to mary he said with god all things are possible so i know somebody that's got a possible not an impossible you know if you ever take something to god says impossible he's like you asking the wrong guy ask the devil he thinks that stuff's impossible he said ain't nothing impossible to god the only way it can be is because inside that kuckerberg has been transmitted there's something going to happen something's got to break a dimension something's got to come down into this dimension and break this thing up that you and i are living under this time life and matter because this life that we're living down here is going to go away but eternal life has to come from somewhere and come inside of you then the bible says we're what sitting together in heavenly places it takes us right back up to that seventh dimension where god is we just can't see him with our natural eyes and we'll talk about that a little bit the only way it can be be is because inside the cuckoo bird has been transmitted from a kokober wheat a cockabur to a germ called wheat germ now that cocker burr always wasn't a wheat it wasn't the cuckoo bear not always was a wheat right plant to cook a bird without anything you plant a cocoa berry it brings up cuckoo birch but brother branham is talking about by the power he preached the sermon the power of transformation that transforms you from a cockapur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that kookaburra it'll produce what a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in the kuckleberg and the life of the kuckelberg has been taken out but the nature of the cocker bird is still sticky now brother brown i'm talking about that second realm the spirit realm memory reason conscious affection imagination everybody got that right but the nature of the culture is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully been let me let me quote that right and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cuckolder but wheat but wheat but while it's here on earth and out of the earth and a cuckleberry it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticking have a carnal nature now we know that but remember that thing that's inside of you that in that soul is not sticky that's god that's the genesis 1 26 that's the seed of god that's the theophany of god if i just said that most churches they'd be shouting y'all are sleeping if this don't excite you ain't nothing we can't like brother now we're talking about he watched the preacher online he said that preacher we got them people all worked up and emotional and they weren't even listening to what he was saying i'd rather you sit there and listen and not say nothing but now not with your eyes closed cause you're not listening then okay but look it's going to bother you as long as you live we know that but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you that's the thing brother brown said that's the thing let's go to the next one now number five and the seed shelf was essie gates of the enemy 1961 but that's what we are like we are now a wheat a grain of wheat and god's garner when we was a cocker bear and i'm going to say this one more time i know i'm a cuckoo bird i know where it's at i was cuckober through and through when i was out in the world i was born a coca bear even though come through godly parents it had to come through permissive will for me to get here and then god gives me a soul when god gives me a soul that soul is perfect and until until the day god starts recording my choices the age of accountability my soul is perfect and i will go to heaven if i die during that time all babies go to heaven brother brown said right because they're not judged they can't be judged by that but when you come up kids when you know right from wrong when you know to turn your head when you know not to walk in where you used to go like i said before you could go take a bath with a five-year-old two five-year-old man a boy and a girl and now you can't do that why because your mind starts thinking when your mind starts thinking your body starts reacting i don't know why i'm getting on this but i'm going to say it anyway be careful because you're cuckober through and through and listen when you put two cuckoo birds together take that any way you want to that's why the prophet of god and i'm telling you if you get the baptism of holy ghost though you're wheat you have the nature of the wheat inside of you and you have a you have a a more of a moral rudder you don't have i mean you should have a moral rudder not to cheat still lie and run around and all these things but you still got that bad nature but when you get that thing inside of you that's born again it will steer you in the right direction amen now most of you that's live life like i've lived you'll say amen but what does god do he takes that kunkelberg nature listen he doesn't kill you the person he likes who you are that's right or he wouldn't have made you that's the exactly but he knows that you'll want that new birth and you he'll know that that thing will you'll yield to it one day and he'll come in and what will it do not kill your old soul but burn that old nature off of it that cluckleberry will get burnt out and a germ of the life of god will be put in that's so simple not that it always was there it always was in god's mind it always was in the bible they didn't have to write a different bible when i got born again i got born again out of the same bible amen i got born to get out of the same bible that luther got born to get out of that wesley got born again columbia martin irenaeus same bible same word of god and god changed this from a cuckoo bird to a grain of wheat it makes the fruits different changing your own mind your own ideas it's the greatest miracle that ever happened you talk about miracles of of raising the dead what about raising somebody to newness of life what about raising somebody to a eternal life that satan can't ever take your regular life anymore oh yeah this one may drop off but where are you going to go you're going to step in that sixth dimension you'll step right back up pick that body up you're going to come back in a young kid and satan's not going to have nothing to do with that it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or woman is born again of the spirit of god and becomes a what new what's new new creation something different your thinking changed i love that come on people goodness gracious this plan of redemption excites me because it's not just i always was this great something but you know what i was thinking yesterday though though now though if you stand in a place to where you look and you see that you are born again and you know that god's working through your life and you know you have a purpose on the earth i can now look back and sit and say thank you papa god that you i was in your mind i was there before the foundation of the world i was in your thinking you thought of me way before i thought of you and now i'm down here and you know what all he wants to do manifest what was up there real simple and then we have to look at representation because that's where it comes from because remember the little woman at the well had representation way down in her what in what she had the words she had we know that when messiah comes and see she was looking for this to be made flesh she wasn't just wandering around with a pot on her shoulder and going to husband number six and just no something down inside of her actually really was there that sounded off when the word met what she had read and she was looking for the hat but remember he came looking for her he said i must needs go by samaria right brother brown even tells you he said well the apostles probably thought he was going to go by just go buy some groceries or something why don't we need to go buy some area because it ain't you know ain't him on the way he said i must need to go buy some air why he knew by foreknowledge before the foundation of the world he knew where she'd be standing he knew she'd want what he had he knew now i'm not going to do that no more but she had representation he saw what she would do that's right he saw your response you had more than five husbands yourself he was married to everything in the world now if you want then i apologize but most of us were but see what i mean this eternal plan of redemption cannot change but when we attach ourselves to it it ought to make us shout just like job said where were you job what was god doing he by foreign knowledge in his mind it wasn't us his people but it was the attribute of somebody loving what he did loving and knowing that his children were going to come we're going to read it in psalms there's no way we couldn't come except by the way psalms says in continuous was our fashion as yet there was none of us listen god knew the children of israel would all die except for joshua and caleb and all them little people that grew up under joshua and caleb he knew the rest of them people was going to die yet he fed them every day he clothed them every day he'd give him a light by day and i mean a light by night and a pillow of cloud by day he took care of them he kept telling them when you get in the promised land this is what you're going to do they send 10 times about time seven or eight i would have just said forget it but he kept saying bro john he said when you get in the promised land do this when you get in the promised land do that when you get in the promised land he wasn't even what see god wasn't worried about because by foreign knowledge he saw he knew that somebody would make it to the promised is land all right but this woman had nothing to present she was filthy and dirty but she had heard the word and god knew that she would respond because brother brown said when the word met the word what the word down inside of her same way with me and you then she was looking for this to be made flesh so she had representation i took the other quote out but she had representation from predestination all right to me that's very simple and remember she didn't receive eternal life right then because there was nothing to give folks i won't be i hope you see that that only on the day of pentecost did god come back and release his life so that genesis 1 26 man couldn't be bottled up anymore in a man called jesus christ when that life was released when he come out of that tomb and said all power and heaven earth has been given unto me brother brown said he could have just took it right on back and not give it to nobody but he'd come back on the tail of pentecost and give it all back to the bride amen and that wasn't my job that was his it's my job to believe it like we're going to see in just a few minutes we're going to see that in these dimensions we have sea taste filled smelling here and brother brown says every one of those every one of them can be deceived and tricked but one cannot the sixth sense of faith cannot be tricked and it cannot be taken away from either so look here's this melchizedek number seven really quick here but i like these quotes because it really solidifies here it is 1965 brother brown has not changed his way of preaching he's just preached a future home on the future home he said thank god i've preached these three steps of grace from a child justification sanctification baptism holy ghost now we see the attributes sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word formed body now listen you've got to be careful we have a word for body inside of us that's what's developing and it's forming inside he's talking about the people he's looking at because that body come from mom and daddy a germ a sperm and an egg got together put it in a warm place and you came but god still had to give you the soul so you have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body we're all subject to the word if you're born again you're subject to the word of god but you know what you're also subject to the word if you're not born again because you get the condemnation part if you're not subject to the word of god inside of you tonight you're going to judgment and you're going to have to stand in front of the word and you're going to have to give an account of what you did not what god did now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word he could stand and say before abraham was i am john said in the beginning was the word words with god and the word was made flesh all right everybody got that so he was worried before he was human flesh we all don't do i know that because brother brown talks us he talks on genesis 1 26 he said that was a word body a theophany so he could speak and even the even they tell him in the in the new old well matthew martin luther and john's still in the old testament okay but in the new testament in your book jesus says somebody says well you're the creator god we know that inside of you is the guy that created all things now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning of the word in a morphing body because remember we didn't come here the word he came here exactly the way the word said but remember you and i came exactly the words that the way the word said to we just came wrong and had to be by transforming power listen jesus didn't need a new birth why did he not say he should have walked up next demons he said now nicodemus me and you need to be born again no he looked at nicodemus and he said you need a new birth and i hope that's what he's saying by the word tonight you need a new birth and if there's anything inside of you if you've heard the word and it's quickened in your life the word meets the word and then you become as the woman at the well there you have the potential of going to the upper room and receiving the holy ghost your own upper room amen we all have to have an upper room experience it don't matter where you at right you have to have an upper room experience you didn't see the lick of fire maybe but if you could see in another dimension you could see it cause that thing was coming down through the dimension into this dimension and there was licks of fire oh i want to get on that i've been looking at sound barrier brother brown talks about them birds out there in arizona breaking the sound barrier and what comes with a sound barrier a cloud thunder and a cloud always comes with breaking the sound barrier and the sound barrier is moving faster than the speed of sound we'll get into that just give you a little tidbit maybe you'll stay awake another 15 minutes then later we never heard no more melchizedek because what he in morphed he immorphed from melchizedek which was we know that was jesus christ theophany jesus christ not flesh jesus christ all he done was just slow down into this dimension as brother aaron always says he just picked up some dust and just went and it just formed all around his body did it for the other two angels and they come walking down into this dimension later we never heard no more melchizedek because it became jesus christ what brother member said melchizedek just disappeared went into this dimension stepped right out left the dust there and just stepped right back into another dimension until one day you heard [Music] a baby was born now theophany was made flesh then later we never heard no more melchizedek because it became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ what the high priest melchizedek could not be touched by the feeling of your infirmity he never looked at abraham and said i know how you feel no he looked at abraham and he said you're going to have a baby and you're going to have it through sarah and you're going to have it in a time of life i'll visit you he was telling him prophesying of what was to come now you bypassed that what you didn't come here with eternal life in you yellow he did because he was the chosen one he was god himself but he came in human flesh you and i just came in human flesh right and got a soul that was perfect you bypassed that what you come around it because in that form he knowed all things and you've never been able to know that yet right oh what about a time though when we get over there what about time even in the millennium what about time even during the future home i mean not even the future home the the wedding supper brother john we're limitless we're not limited by anything this has been made eternal this has been made eternal we've already got eternal life man it just explodes and you'll know all things but you'll not remember the bad because the bible says the former things will be passed away behold all things have become new you came like adam like me you come from attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if it's at the time and i can be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word that we can look back and see what we've done then we can look back that's what we're doing now now we don't understand it we have never become in other words we haven't become all the word you understand everything the word says no you don't as human as humanity because you're right here now some of you are asleep you can't understand what's going on for your sleep right then you can look back and see what we've done and we don't understand it we never become the word we just become the flesh man not the word but look but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word though unless you was a thought at the beginning very simple that proves the predestination for knowledge of god see you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you had to realize you were lost you had to realize you came the wrong way you had to realize that you were doomed and on your way to hell you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father's giving me will come to me and i'll raise him up to the last day see you had to be first in other words you had to come here first and realize who you were you had to realize you were lost listen you didn't realize you always was eternal i hope when you first started growing up and you started doing the things that all people do you didn't just up one day and say i'm eternal but yeah but yet listen but let yet listen though god did god did and he was just waiting on a time when you would strike that image that he saw before knowledge and he's then the word didn't meet the word and you become the theophany of god not of your parents because your parents didn't give you a soul anyway god gave you soul satan didn't give you a soul that's why the two soul people are wrong a soul listen the soul is so precious it's worth how much how much brother ten thousand worlds one soul is worth ten thousand of these earths and if you're eternal you're worth way more than that and then you see he come right down the regular line from after you before the foundation of the world his name is put on the lamb's book of life then from that he becomes the word the theophany that could appear and disappear then he became flesh and returned back you know he's talking about jesus christ and his name was written on the lamb's book of life he's he was there it was him resurrected that same body in the glorifying condition but you bypass the theophany what the genesis 1 26 man that's what you bypass you did not come here as an eternal child of god you come around that to be a child of samuel and peggy dale but with a ability you know if you bypass something and go around it but remember it's still there the city is still there you got to go back and get in the city but god help me god help you to realize that we became flesh man first to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved now brother brown is quoting scripture we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god this body in subjection to god everybody all right amen all right god's power to transform keep going that's good sons and daughters was in god at the beginning amen that genesis 1 26 man now look you've got eternal life you say we believe that that we got eternal life well there is only one form of eternal life and that's god and that's the only thing that eternally is god then if you've got eternal life you're a possessor that's right if you have eternal life that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of god before there was even a world and when the word itself jesus himself is called the word saint john 1 and beginning with the word words that god in the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and you were in the loins of jesus went to calvary with him you died with him that's why the bible says if you're chosen in him that's what you've already went through chosen in him before the foundation of the world chosen in him then you were in the lords of jesus you went to calvary with him you died with him you raised with him and today we're sitting in heavenly places in him filled with his spirit son and daughters of god died with him raised with him sure amen psalms 139 verse 15 says my substance was not hid from thee who's who's who's he talking to who's he talking to he's talking to god david talking to god under the inspiration my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth when your mom and daddy got together you were foreign because god knew you'd be here in the lowest parts of the earth all of us came from that part we didn't come from the high part we come from the low part thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect he knew we were going to come here on perfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them revelations 13 8 written in the lamb's book of life slain from the foundation of the world your name was already written in the book and we were put here to show the devil that our names was already written in the book amen pretty simple all right so everybody got that so we're not we're not i'm listen i'm not negating that you don't have eternal life you have if you have if you have eternal life tonight that always was eternal amen i i agree 100 but i believe you had to go through a plan of redemption a plan of grace a three-step process that everyone has to go through i don't care if it's luther wesley william marion branham listen he couldn't have taught it if he didn't go through it he couldn't have thought it you and i is what i said before if you can't take your um life through those three steps you don't have the new birth i'm just going to be playing you're just not born again if you can't know you know where you were justified you know where you were sanctified and you knew when god filled you with the holy ghost now here's the whole the whole difference in the way we preach it is what everybody else preaches that doesn't get that gives you all the ability to go up that statue of perfect man but you got to be sanctified every day you got to be justified you got to keep getting filled with the holy ghost you got to keep wanting more of god you got to keep wanting to be more like god but god saw who would and who wouldn't they told brother branham they said brother brown if you teach this like you're teaching why in the world are you even preaching what'd he say he said i don't know who's saved and who's not what he said brother louise he said i throw the net out every sunday and i draw the net in he said i get spiders and snakes and and all kinds of things he says but there's some fish in there somewhere i do catch a few fish he said so that's what we're doing we're fishing didn't god tell us to be fishers of men yes man we're not fishing for fish anymore we're fishing fishing for men all right so let's go and let's look at these dimensions and i want to prove to you in the bible that when you pass from this life just to make sure because i'll bring it maybe next sunday or maybe the sunday after where brother brown says he doesn't believe in transmigration or swapping or moving of souls and i'll read the quote and i don't either i don't believe my soul can go on brother boyd and i don't believe his can go into mine i don't believe my soul can go into an animal and i don't believe my soul can go into the fifth or sixth dimension and then come back into this one not until things happen is everybody okay with that so you know if you saw your grandma walking through the through your yard i don't know i don't know i said i don't know that's what i meant i don't know because you look at these paranormal things and all these different and then then you look where brother brown says he was in tucson the other day and remember the woman hit the man throwed him up in the air he comes back down and several people witnessed it the car hit it couldn't find a man to me that's um leave it alone look but abraham said son now remember abraham's dead by the time luke's been written right and the rich young ruler has already passed away also everybody got that but abraham said son remember that in thy lifetime receivethis died good things he's abraham is in this whatever dimension abraham's in he's stuck right there he can't go anywhere because he's but he's telling that guy that's in another one he's going don't you remember what happened back over here in your in thy lifetime receiveth thou good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou are tormented and besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot right remember the rich young rulers looking at abraham or looking at lazarus in the bosom of abraham and saying hey can you come over here and help me right and abraham is telling them you can't go so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence in other words there's none of this going on you're stuck in whatever dimension you're in so these dimensions are real and the bible's proven that it's real because the rich young ruler is burning in hell in in torment and he's asking for some water from abra or from lazarus who is in the bosom of abraham everybody got that then what does the rich young ruler say it shows you that you don't lose your senses your senses go with you over there because he said oh go and tell my brothers not to come to this place what about that right there in the bible but it took a profit to separate all these dimensions out right amen now let's go to the next one down here the dimensions according to brother branham are light time and matter and we look at these you look at your chart and that's what you and i live in and we were given see tasteful smelling here to contact the first three dimensions everybody got that say amen all right so what happens now is this let me read i'm going to read this right here this quote where brother brown says look they don't have it they can leave it right there yeah i'm gonna read that one that's right good job now when we come along we remember that we live here in three dimensions and i don't know whether i can name them or not one of them is light the other is matter tommy you remember what the third is someone says something huh adam no someone says time time right now light time and matter or light matter in time and our five senses contact them dimensions our sight contacts light our feeling contacts matter and so forth everybody got that now now we know one thing's for sure before there was a fall because we know and i'll bring the quote next sunday brother brown says that there was no time now remember be careful with that there was no time but yet there was already light and there was already day and night remember he caused the moon to shine in the night and the sun to shine in the day but now remember that light right there is not the sun and the moon that's that light we were talking about that just blew everything up and just c and lit everything to me the light of god but what happened was though and i'll bring you another quote where brother branham says that when adam did what he did he said his soul became dim in other words there was a cloud put over him where he couldn't see back into that other dimension and i'll read another one right here it says dimensions in which we live in that are contacted by our five senses this is a slower dimension than the others that are not seen you know why they're slower because the fourth dimension you can't see you can see tasteful smelling here you can see light you can feel matter and we definitely know we in time everybody got that but now look when we get into that fourth dimension i want you to remember though that we are influenced by that fourth dimension now the fifth dimension in sixth dimension is where people go and they're held right so we're not influenced by that we're influenced by the fourth dimension and we'll really cover that fourth dimension but look what happens when when god talks to adam and he says adam where art thou and adam's like i'm hiding i don't know if i want to be around you or not right now well now what's happening is is god is doing what he's withdrawing himself he said i'll put enmity i won't talk to you like i used to talk to you but i'm not going to leave you adam i can't come down i can't this to their sin now you got to make i got to make this sacrifice to cover or capo your blood the the blood of the animal to cover your sin but watch this let me read this right here real quick look here friends let me give you this illustration i might have done it before what color is that shirt what color is my shirt blue all right have i got that but now listen what if you ask the blind man what color my shirt is anybody in here colorblind louise is a little bit colorblind and bless your heart but there are certain colors they can't see why why because something in your eyes not something in your soul you're not it's not something wrong with you you just got a deficiency well watch this i'll show you in just a minute i might have done it before what color is this shirt it's white anyone that's got sight knows this shirt's white you have five senses of the body see taste field smelling here now none of these senses will declare god now remember though brother brown said god put adam and flesh in five senses to contact the earth but see in my belief i can't find a quote and it's not in the bible but adam was ruled by the sixth sense of faith because he can move mountains he can move trees he could change the weather he could travel through any dimension he wanted to how do you think he ruled the whole world he didn't stand in one place he was all over the place but what happened was though is when he when sin was committed what did it do it limited him to where he's at in other words this became solid time became his killer because the bible says adam lived 950-something years and he died time was not before that though god never told them he was going to die until they did what they did amen and they still had the five senses like i said before you're not going to lose your five senses ever again when you go into the other dimension you're not going to lose your seat field smelling hair i just proved that to you abraham was looking looking at the rich young ruler and said and was talking to him and said we can't go over there and you can't come over here what happened to samuel the prophet he was called up by the witch of endor what happened he still had his robe on still was prophesying still was looking the way he looked because the witch of endor said i brought samuel up wait look just like he did but now remember here's your key that was under the old testament he looked like he did when he died right he wasn't a young man why because he wasn't born again right he didn't have that gender the only thing he's going to change your body backs that genesis 1 26 man now they will get changed you understand what i'm saying we're not leaving them out but he came up the same way he died because he was in what the bosom of abraham are in paradise and we'll cover that what brother brown says about that god made man he made him in his image instead of man's and he put him in five senses to contact his earthly home not to contact god with those senses don't declare god now god uses them but who else uses them too the devil uses them too they declare why because it's you steal a cocker bear out here they declare the earthly home where the man had to contact his earthly home he had to see taste fill smell in here but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of what thing's not seen you do not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it see what i mean you see taste feel smell and hear now let's go the statue of perfect man because i want to cover this real quick and watch what happens now we all know this it's where the prophet of god created squirrels or he called the squirrels to come into existence but but there had to something no i'm sorry i'm sorry that's not right this instant he was writing the statue of a perfect man he was writing that down on a piece of paper that he had not written before sorry but watch what happened so for days before we have the service i constantly pray go to the woods take in my pocket tell the wife i'm going squirrel hunting this morning put a pencil on the paper in my pocket as soon as it gets light enough i'm sitting against the tree somewhere hands up in the air and said lord what can i do today what will you give me for your children now remember god we know god comes into this dimension and he and he um influences us but what about his presence because there stood brother branham in a prayer line he was standing with the baptism of the holy ghost i believe a adopted son of god and he still had to wait on that presence to come there because that was a different presence that was something else working this is a different watch with this but watch watch how it got there this is my whole point watch how it got there and we'll look at how the the first three dimensions are so much slower and then we'll talk about next uh we'll close right there and we'll talk about uh um the speed of sound next sunday then when i strike something that seems to burn down comes something like when his presence gets near i began to hear something like way off in the distance something in the order now if you've heard this tape sister cleda can probably tell you exactly what he says 2 times 2 equals 4. then the next time he says closer 2 times 2 equal 4. then 2 times 2 equal 4 2 times he gets faster with his 2 times 2 equals 4. brother brown speaks each repeats a little faster well they told you right there but i'm sure sister clay can do something on and on and on like that it's his presence coming in it wasn't there at the time it was coming in but what was it doing it was coming faster into this dimension because when you will look next sunday when brother brown talks about the birds and the little birds and the bigger birds and the angels he said they came from eternity so fast into this dimension yield yourself and after a while you break away from yourself there comes division go to such and such place now remember visions do not come from this dimension even television you can't get it in first three dimensions it has to be a fourth dimension thing it has to break into another dimension and you can see it so the prophet of god has to wait on that thing to come out of fast out of eternity slow down enough to where he gets there where he's at and then what there comes the vision go to such and such a place such and such a thing starts off from meditating your mind on god out of the world away from the world out in the wilderness to yourself and watch and it starts coming one one and he keeps doing it one number anything just something starts gradually faintly coming in then it comes faster and faster what it's coming from a faster dimension into this one so we're in the slowest dimension listen you're the slowest dimension you'll ever be in then it comes faster faster you sit there and raise up your hands don't say a word just hold your hands in the air first thing you know your whole being is caught away then you see things that he wants you to know showing you things that is to come how about that he's standing in life and time and matter and then here comes something a presence from another dimension into this dimension slows itself down enough so he can talk to a prophet but you know what though how many times have you heard musicians come we'll stop right there how many times have you heard though that that presence would come to him and he'd say i spent all day searching the scripture because you wanted to make sure that that presence wasn't coming from somebody else because the devil i promise you the devil has got a presence also he will present himself just like god but he can't be on the word right he can't be the word of god so the first three dimensions life time and matter will start on them sunday but that's where you and i live and we're given five senses to contact our earthly home see takes phil smelling here and they can all be tricked they can all be tricked except one and that's faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you don't have to see do you have to see your healing to get it i thought you had to believe it to see it not see it to believe it because if you see it you don't have to believe it so faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen bringing it into this dimension listen when you get a revelation it's not from this dimension right because satan is prevalent in this dimension to give you his revelation but when god comes why did why did he have to why'd the prophet have to explain that god the presence had to come into his dimension right but now we're going to see in just a little while though next sunday where that he was taken into another dimension remember he went in the sixth dimension he was taken into another dimension that was much faster than this one but he looked back and saw his body because his body couldn't go with him it was that one inside of him is what went his theophany was what went his body stayed down there so we'll get into it a little bit next sunday but let's stand our feet god bless you love you with love of the lord there's just a lot that we cover talking about eternal redemption and i don't want to leave anybody out or leave anybody behind but they we need to understand these things so that there's not questions in our mind but we know one thing's for sure we live in this dimension lifetime and matter but we are reacted by other dimensions remember i already told you the fourth dimension is running right through here right now and there's every every website there's every there's there's pictures of you don't want to see there's conversations of men and women and men and men that you don't want to hear going right through this room right now and you can receive it but you got to have something to receive it with you got to have a phone you got to have a ipad you got to have a what you got to have a piece of equipment and i believe god's equipped me and you to hear from him let's sing a song let's sing a song then we'll be dismissed prison chain with bleeding stride paul inside [Music] just think about your prayer your prayer has to go into another dimension your prayer has to break those sound barriers and go into another dimension so that god can hear your prayer to sing there change worlds think about him now and they were free i bless your name i bless your name every time god spoke there was thunder but there was a voice behind that thunder because it broke the sound barrier and came from this other dimension into the dimension that you and i were in are in now and i believe that's what happened when the seals broke this dimension was broke and there was thunders that sounded was the voice of god given a message not to william branham but through william branham to the bride you're in a prayer think about it son in your mind all them demons talking to you from another dimension reach out and pray defy what they say defy stand up against it they will fall in jesus name sing it to him oh i bless your name i bless your name think about him why give

amen i bless your name think about him now here we are we're standing in the ocean and we understand all these things now more than anybody ever but let's not make it just head knowledge let's let it go down here where we can stand in front of the devil and say uh take your hands off of that alpha that's my child that's my husband that's my wife that's my friend that's my family satan you don't have a right to that oh you just wait and let it thunder sometime your voice your voice will be heard over everything that goes on in heaven everything god will hear you before he'll hear anything else not an angel no one else he'll hear your prayer and your voice be sincere when you pray call the name that's what i've been doing i i've been calling name and calling full names because you know if i say just pray for brother john it may be 100 brother john but i say brother john durrett i say brother homer longoria i call the names of those people because it means something you love the lord you each one take this and realize that you were predestinated for ordained before the foundation of the world but remember everybody is but you make sure you were predestinated by in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and your name was placed on that book before the foundation of the world yeah you can realize that and it gives you whatever fear there is in this world that ought to take the fear out of that anyway to know that you're a son and daughter of god sing it one more time oh we bless your name we bless your name we give you all think of the people that he saved just
