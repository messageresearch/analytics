========================================

your bibles if you want to turn to uh what we read genesis 4 verse 26 we're still talking on prayer and uh i hope you all prayed this morning amen we need to be a prayerful group of people because we need prayer and you need to practice genesis 4 verse 26 and says to seth and him also there was born a son and he called his name enos and then men began to call upon the name of the lord it took several generations because from adam adam and abel and and uh cain even we're able to talk to god the bible says in genesis 1 genesis 2 even genesis 3 when god said i'll put enmity he was talking straight to adam he was talking straight to eve amen and then he was talking straight to abel and straight to cain he definitely talked to cain several times in genesis in genesis three and four as we look and see even chapter four he talked straight to cain and said if you'll do as your brother so there was no mediator in between that there was no communication gap god spoke straight to cain and said if you'll do good do as your brother everything will be fine but then god knew when cain left the presence of god god knew one thing for sure he couldn't talk to him he couldn't come to the garden anymore he couldn't sit down with man he couldn't he couldn't be with man like he wanted to be so he had to institute a thing called prayer and then because if we began to call upon the name of the lord don't look where it says in your marginal reading i was just reading that it said but then man began to call upon the name of the lord now the name of the lord they didn't know what the name of the lord was back then so they called him jehovah because scofield says call himself by the name of jehovah so that's where you got jehovah god with the family in the old testament they prayed to jehovah but we know that that was what that was the part of jesus christ the part of almighty god that he was playing at the time it was jehovah and then that jehovah brother brown said jehovah the old became what jesus of the new so like i said before we don't have two or three mediators to go through when i pray i don't pray to an angel that prays to jesus now we know brother branham used several instances where that he says the angels would take the prayer requests to the lord now see that's just a line of communication because we talk as christians we talk straight to god and man we don't talk to an angel uh but now remember see you you gotta remember um gabriel was an angel but remember michael was christ so it was an angel but now remember too we're going to read this afternoon gabriel was an announcing angel in other words he was given to the jews in the old testament to bring something to the people to bring an announcement because he came to daniel to announce the 70 weeks of daniel he came to mary to announce that she was going to have a child now see we don't have to have that angel to come announce anything to us we have michael we have christ that immorphy of god has moved from an angel in the old testament to a person named jesus christ because that's who i pray to i don't pray to michael i pray to jesus christ which is michael but he was he had a form back then that he couldn't he couldn't relate to man i say relate because remember god is eternal that's what i was trying to get this thought across to myself the other day god is eternal but he did have a time where like i said we don't pray to jehovah anymore now he never lost that title he's still jehovah god all the compound names of jehovah he is still god he's still jehovah god but now he and morphed down into melchizedek so that we could understand him in a certain area there then he was the captain of the host that we understood him in a certain area there then he became our brother see that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon he became our brother he became not a type of boaz was the type of christ see a lot of things top christ but christ doesn't type anything that's why i said the bride doesn't type the whole bible types christ and if the whole bible types christ and you and i are what christ made manifest in another form then the whole bible is typing me and you because if i'm a type of christ i can be something different but if i am christ made manifest in another form it's type in christ is typing me that's why paul says christ in you the hope of glory so he pointed exactly where christ was but in the old testament there had to be something instituted we know that he instituted the the ark and all the different things and but remember god didn't communicate with man after a certain period of time in exodus 19 they said okay let moses let abraham you know let let this other person pray let this important guy pray for for me for us and that's the way god set it up in the old testament because that's what the jews asked for because remember he told moses he said you bring him back to this mountain he said i'll talk to him just like i talked to you on this same mountain and they said no we don't want that we want to we want a mediator we want something in between all right well the only mediator we have though is not moses not william branham's not a prophet it's jesus christ amen so but that was instituted in the old testament so that there would be a law and that law though brought christ on the scene they just didn't know that all right so look prayer let's pull it up now we as we were reading last sunday prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication well lord thank you for this food no you want him in this day and time more than any you better pray over your food everything if if uh if the guy in the in the um confederate soldier who was a stonewall jackson it was noted that he never took a drink of water without saying thank you lord now do we do that no we don't do that don't shake your head not 100 of the time but maybe we should stop and and say god thank you because you know what water can make you sick faster than food can that's what's wrong with a lot of these third world countries they're getting bad water and it causes diarrhea and all different things which causes other diseases but prayer then we continually be in prayer look in the narrow sense the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession now what does that mean you have set yourself aside to do something i'm going to enter into as the priest enter entered in to go into that holy of holies man talking about having to be right one little act off of that priest and it was certain death under bulls and goats but see under the blood of jesus christ you and i now can go boldly to the throne of grace with prayer of intercession with prayer of faith directed toward a deity which we know who that deity is the world does not know a lot of times who they're praying to right that's why they don't get anything because the bible tells us and i'll bring it out maybe next sunday the bible says that you can pray in other words or say jesus jesus and not get anything the prophet said and the bible says you can come to me in that day and said have i not prayed prophesied spoke in tongues and done all these things he said depart from me i never knew you what you never knew who you were praying amen because you know what in this day and age the world can be praying to the devil and think they're praying to jesus christ well that's how bad it is but we know as the bride we know that our prayer is heard by god all right so let's go genesis 13 8 this is where the first time now remember that word i pray thee and abram and light means an an exhortation or i pray that we can finish this service today well that's not a prayer to something that's just a term and i want to bring that in because a lot of times you see that and it's not a prayer so the first time a prayer was was genesis 20 verse 7 it says therefore restore the man and his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee now see god used prophets in the old testament amen so you got to have though it wasn't that abimelech prayed to abram or abraham and then abraham prayed to god he just went to abraham and said you need to pray for me all right and god heard that prayer and you know what happened but that one was is the greek lexicon or hebrew says to mediate intervene interpose to intercede or to pray come on in sister clinton bless your heart good to see no no ma'am no ma'am i'd have helped you in the door if you didn't notice you bless your heart good to see you good to see you sister's back there waiting on you your sister's back there waiting on you [Applause] no doubt what a testimony and there's the power of prayer just walk through the door amen because you know prayer changes things what if you just don't pray could you imagine going through your life and just don't pray at all what would you as a christian i see as a christian how could you be a christian and not be motivated to pray you can't right because always something to pray for there's always something to to to help others you know pray for this one pray for that one we got all these long lists of prayers that we pray for people the wall downstairs we always try it i can't name every one of them hundred and something people on the wall but i always tell god to save those people in this wall right under my feet that we've got in the sunday school class now look genesis 20 verse 17 so abraham prayed unto god and god healed the bible and his wife and his maidservants they bear children so theirs was the prayer of intercession and then god interceded i'm going to try to hurry through this psalms 5 verse 1 because i want to get to we prayed the lord's prayer and i want to start right there with everything but i want to get a background for those of you that weren't here hearken to the voice of my cry verse 2 my king my god for unto thee i will pray now who is david praying to he's praying to jehovah god he's praying to jehovah my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and we'll look up proverbs 15 verse 8 the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord look but the prayer of the upright is his delight he loves for you to pray isaiah 56 verse 7 even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer this is the scripture i told you that jesus was quoting when he was driving the the money changers out of the temple they burnt offerings and sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar for mine house shall be called the house of prayer for all people that's why we pray over everything we pray over the people we pray over the service i hope you're prayed up before you get here then we pray for the sick and you should be in constant prayer because we're going to get down here real quick where even as they were praying in the new testament the holy ghost fell on the people praying not worshiping not singing they were praying and the holy ghost fell on the people daniel 9 verse 20 we're going to get into this afternoon a little bit more but look while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sins try that sometime confess your sins first and then begin to pray as i said before when when someone comes up for prayer you hear me you see me raise my hand close my eyes i'm saying lord don't let me forgive me in my sins don't let me don't let an evil something i brought in here and a spirit you never you oh y'all don't bring spirits in there okay yeah we do the thoughts in our mind is a spirit if it's wrong against god it's wrong so i'll raise my hand and say god don't clear me out don't let anything happen for my cause to make that person not receive their healing so confessing my sins and the sins of my people israel presenting my suffocation before the lord now what happened when daniel got on his knees and prayed somebody showed up yet while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel who had seen in the vision at the beginning being called to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation so he got what he was asking for daniel was asking how much time we got left what's going on and all the way to the end of time all right and then we're going to read this afternoon daniel 9 24. matthew 5 verse 44 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you do we do that do we feel our prayer with just people that are nice to us and good to us and pray for the all these this this sister just she just loves me i'm going to pray for her but now that nobody understands can't talk to me in about two three weeks i i don't have enough time to pray for that one no you need to pray more for that one first yourself then pray for that one and then this one might be okay right there's an order of prayer ask forgiveness of your sins i'm just saying yes while i was speaking but look matthew 5 verse 44 blessed in the curse you do them to good that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you persecute you lord bless that person that's persecuting me how many of you prayed that prayer don't raise your hand because you're not going to you'll be praying for lying spirit on you i mean really when it comes down to prayer prayer is easy to pray when it's somebody that's your friend or somebody that's that you like but what about that guy that just at work he just or she just on your last nerve all the time and don't pray that god would take them out of the way or out off the scene either i'll be doing that pray that they get saved that's my prayer to people i said lord if you'll save them people they won't act like that or they may not act much like that see how much prayer changed something matthew 6 verse 5 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corner of the streets that they may be seen of men i say unto you they have their reward but now when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou hast shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret of thy father which seeth in secret shall we reward thee openly but when you pray use not vain repetition see that's a lot of times you that goes back to you look at the i've heard people pray a catholic prayer they just opened the book and they just start reading the prayer we were hunting in colorado and there was a girl she's really nice saying that to be a catholic she was the best i've ever seen close you know she was devout she said can i pray this prayer for you and i said oh sure prayer is good for anything so she opens up the book and prays the prayer of intercession for the saint of so and so that was a sign of travel well i thought well she's sincere but she may be sincerely wrong but that's what he said about no repetition don't just say lord bless these people and then the next day lord bless these people and you understand what i'm saying when we pray we should pray a new prayer that's what the bible says pray a new prayer may it be fresh let it not be repetition as the heathen do why because they chant to their god remember the heathens if you ever seen heathen worship they just continually chant one word or two words or something that's not we're trying to do with prayer to god for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking hmm use not vain repetition be not thou therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask after this man and therefore pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name that's what we were last week we'll not read that so now let's go to matthew 21 verse 22 continue on and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing have you ever asked a prayer and said well i don't know if this is going to work or not but i'm going to pray anyway well now that's the wrong attitude to start with when you pray when you open your when you take your time to call on god make sure that you're sincere make sure that you're and i know the bible tells us to pray without ceasing and sure we might have the radio on and we may have a tape on it we may have something going on around the house but if you get an option to pray you just start praying right in other words conditions don't have to be perfect all the time but the prayer life that he's talking about up there in verse 6 and matthew that's when you say all right god i'm going to give you some prayer time i'm going to take in my closet you don't have to go in a closet you don't have to get down on your knees but you can just be sitting in your chair you're going to sit on your porch and then just open your heart up to god now that's you communicating with god to me i believe that's you talking to god about you you say oh no bro no you can ask god things about for you amen now watch for i barely say unto you mark 11 23 that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which are saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive see that's what i said forgive ask forgiveness and forgive if you have odd against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses all right let's go to john 17 verse 9. i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine acts 1 verse 14 this is where look these all continued with one accord what in prayer they were in they were in the upper room they were the holy ghost was falling on them and suffocation with the women marry the mother of jesus and with his brethren now acts 4 verse 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake with the fake the word of god with boldness wow when they had just prayed enter into a prayer i'd never done that before until i was in jamaica and we had a youth camp it's been five or six seven years ago and they asked me to speak at the youth camp and i told the brothers i said you just uh the song there lily of the valley where the bi the scripture said or the verse says there's a wall of fire around me well i told all i said if you got the holy ghost you just circle these young kids if you know how the holy ghost don't do it man if you've got the holy ghost you circle these young people and we started praying and we probably prayed for 30 minutes but god came down and filled a lot of people with the holy ghost and uh it wasn't laying on the hands or prayer line it was all just right there they were just in the sanctuary and man it was it was an awesome time that you just start pouring out your heart to god and it'll just start coming right it'll just start flowing amen romans 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit also helped with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought in other words you don't know the outcome you don't know that that maybe aaron has just had a wreck in the car but aaron comes on your mind and then somebody comes on your mind about this and then somebody comes on your mind about this you don't need the details right right okay i you know you when you come up here for prayer you don't have to give the detail to the preacher you don't have to tell him what you've done three days ago and what led up to it tell them what you want prayed for and that's it all that other all that other is okay but the least i know the better i want to pray for what you need not what you did okay but that's what he's saying here but we know not what we should pray for as we all look but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered how many times have you done that though been sitting somewhere or be doing even at work and then all of a sudden an unction hits you to pray or somebody comes on your mind or something something you know something shakes you just start praying say lord i don't know who it is but it must be something that needs to be dealt with and you just stop and say a prayer there for just a moment look at verse first corinthians 11 verse 4 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head but every woman that prayeth are prophesied with their head uncovered dishonored with her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven now i didn't bring the quote here but remember the quote where brother brown said god will not hear the prayer of a bob-haired woman except for her confession or forgiveness that's hard to see but that's what the bible says right here that's where he got it from brother brown didn't just bring it and say well this is a new doctrine if you pray with your hair cut god's not going to hear you that's what the bible says but every woman that pray after prophesies with her head uncovered and we ain't talking about a hat talk about cutting your hair dishonoring her head now who's her head sure husband but her head is christ for that is even as one as if she were shaven now look at first corinthians 11 verse 13 he continues on says judge in yourself is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered and it's not now he can hear prayer of intercession for you for forgiveness but now too you got to remember what he just said about the men too you know so be careful man we can't have a hair drink dragging the ground because the bible says every man praying having his head covered dishonest his head in other words if he got long hair and won it that way all right so now let's go and read this next one in first timothy four verse four if you musicians come on rejoice ever more first thessalonians i'm sorry brothers 5 16 rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks come on in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ concerning you there's the will of god what pray without ceasing first timothy 4 verse 4 we'll stop right there and every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving what he's talking about eating for it is sanctified by the word of god and by prayer amen god bless you we'll uh start right there next next week pray without ceasing how do you do that start talking to god god bless you
