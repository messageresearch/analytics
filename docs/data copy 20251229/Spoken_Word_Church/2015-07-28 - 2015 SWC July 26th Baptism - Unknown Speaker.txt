========================================

let's read here in Romans chapter six what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound policy god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you not did so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death that's why it's the death burial resurrection so I told them in the building we were going to a killing that's what it is we're going to we're going to go to killing we're gonna kill an old person because right here what they said therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death then like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death that's what we're gonna do wanna plant but we're not going to leave them down there bring them out for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death have no more dominion over him brenn that he died he died unto sin once but then that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise so Paul give that summation of Christ likewise reckon ye also yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive it to God through Jesus Christ our Lord that's what we're gonna do with a go death burial and resurrection then we're gonna walk in newness of life all right I agree man we're all witnesses today so let's go to the promised land just told us he said going to the whole of the world preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost so our sister has come in repentance to be baptized according to Christian baptism so today we baptize our sister Warren Snipes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know our sister so today to fulfill the Great Commission that Jesus told us to go in all the world preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost we baptize our sister extra-small wood in the name of the lord jesus christ Rebecca you're refilling freedom and all Minds Claire Claire Claire tell these two sisters how much you appreciate their their coming out and being a witness in the example and pray for his baptism be with us and go Winston take care of that she's running back safe time for Miss will give you all
