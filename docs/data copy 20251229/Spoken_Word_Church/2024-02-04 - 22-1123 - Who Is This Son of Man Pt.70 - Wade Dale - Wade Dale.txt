I told David uh the boy was up here with me he's 70 years old and uh I said you know we were struggling with this big old deer and I looked at him I said David you know there's 132 years of people down here trying to get this deer out of the wood it's only me and you he was 70 and I'm 62 so it's just uh uh a struggle when you get older just to walk much less try to get a heavy deer out of the woods but God God had that deer die right in a at a tree that was growing like this so we just hoisted it up the tree with the plis and drove the plis under it and set it on it and come on so I appreciate your prayers thank you for taking care of brother Andrew Glover he did a wonderful job this weekend and we appreciate him for that and U um I want Tuesday brother Bob will be preaching next wed Wednesday night um for a week from today or week from tomorrow actually and um and y'all all have a Happy Thanksgiving eat a lot of turkey whatever you do see your family see somebody see your family church family doesn't matter to you see them but see your natural family we've had so many reports of of shining the light you know we want to we want to um um give this message to everybody we just think everybody ought to take it and everybody ought to see it like we see it but remember brother Brown said the preaching the sermon is not it it's living one and we've seen in the past few months um how that our little light that shines out of this Sanctuary through you has portrayed into other people that said they really wanted to be a part of that a part of the uh not exclusion but it you know let God exclude the people let's not do it oursel you never know you never ever know who's watching and the ones that are watching sometimes are watching to refute but but when they find nothing to refute what do they do what do they do they say oh man this is this must be real these people must really live what they preach and I I was thinking about it while I was in uh Illinois that you know it's just it all comes down to your to your foundation it all comes down to your foundation everything is built on a foundation this uh even the Empire State Building is built on a foundation so we're built on a foundation all right and we were built here on the foundation of the word of God and then let's let that out let your light so shine the Bible says to the world all right so now remember this coming uh man it's already December um this coming weekend will be just normal weekend but on December the 3r there'll be no Bible study December the 4th will be the church dinner we'll have one service here and then we will go down to Hidden Acres and have a catered meal there and if you have gifts and all to give uh can do that Rachel what did y'all do last year y'all do gifts here with your Sunday school class and then go down there it's been a year you're the youngest one I was going to try to ask you first Monica don't remember don't ask me so anyway we'll talk about it that we'll either do the gifts here for the usually we do Sunday school here but we can do them there too it doesn't matter but we're going to have a day we've got it there until like 5 or 6:00 so we've

when y'all get back from Central America we'll have a youth service that Saturday and Sunday that last weekend in January brother darl Ward will be with us all right so let's just keep those things in prayer so you love the Lord I love his word I love to just meditate on his word and to hear what he has to say to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's trying to get the world to see and you know what he's going to get them to see through not that Bible right there he's going to get them to see through you good or bad good or bad come on folks good or bad amen they're looking at us all the time our kids and our aunts our uncles our in-laws our they're all watching to see as brother R said one time me and brother Claude was talking about yesterday people are now coming into church services and they're looking online and watching Services of brother Brams to refute brother Brown said it would be in the end time it wouldn't be that you'll sit down in a church service to get something this people be sitting down to refute what you're saying try to find something wrong with them you wrong with it you know there wasn't 12 men fell off of bridge so they just take wipe off the whole Ser whole 1100 sermons but they don't understand that when a man stands up and says if God doesn't meet me here I'm a false prophet and he'll stand there and 20 or 30 people he'll tell them where they were what size clothes they wear what house number they were on the telephone yesterday and he sat there and just pour their life out they're going to have to meet they won't meet brother brandom folks they'll meet Jesus Christ cuz that's who brother brand was trying to present so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this evening you've give us Lord I pray that you just be with us give us a wonderful service in you father being here now in the middle of the week everybody's getting ready to travel and do different things for Thanksgiving Lord I pray that we should give you Thanksgiving every day for the things you've done for us you've give us life you've give us homes you've give us jobs you give us time to to have our uh as the world would say it gives us time to have our um a little Rec rest and relaxation and and and hobbies that we do Lord I Thank you for letting us do that but Lord your word is the most important so we've come today Lord to hear from you father I pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick be with brother Dale and all the different ones brother Mike TIG the ones that are that are mending Lord and getting better father we pray that you'd be with them bless a little bride around the world father bless the missionaries on the Foreign Fields be with them Lord give them fruit for their labor father they labor way more than we do Lord but we need to pray for them more and more as the day approaches where they're not going to be able to get out and deliver the message Father let us live this message let us be this message let it not be paper and pencil and ink but in the fleshly tables of our heart Lord just be with us and further in this service in Jesus name we pray amen U now remember we the last time we spoke we we spoke on the power of your thoughts and I hope you got something a little bit about that so we're going we're going to come back together now and into who is this son of man part 70 and we're going to look at a few things as far as what did we leave because we left some we left something we left something Jude tells us that we left that first faith we left what was it th different you left your first love Ephesians you left this you they all keep you took a name that you shouldn't have took there's all these things you messed up that we all messed up with and we did it not God but he allowed it to happen what to prove that he's right to prove that his word is right and he did have a bride in every Church age that he sealed away under their messenger they got the message they got the Revelation so same way with me and you we got to get the revelation of this message but it has to go that we go back to the faith of the fathers pick up the correct interpretation of the word and bring it forward to where brother brandham was then say he said it's not in the years of preparation not in these years of the in other words the prayer lines and and and all these things he said it's in the opening of the word the Seven Seals opening of the seals bring it up higher to bring it up to what the statue of a perfect man where the Capstone is not just the building part all right we're at the part where the Cap's going to fit down over everything that we do and everything that we are it's going to fit on something cuz the capstone's coming folks he's not just well you can pray all you want to Lord Jesus is coming and he's coming in a people you can hinder it if you want to and I'm saying for everybody we can all and we do hinder it what we're trying to do is what shed that off think right the power of your thoughts you think right you get right with God and we'll get to right brother Brown said the right mental attitude toward any promise boy wow the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that is the son of man that is God in human flesh everybody with me on that that is him but he what now she is him so now you and I are going to take over that part and be that what full of grace and truth we're going to be the ones that that that dwelt among us see God's Among Us now he's Among Us in his people all right so God's among us every time we assemble together we get people together God's in the midst God's doing the work first Thessalonians says that every one of you should know how to every one of us you can't stop you stop yeah you stop God but you can't you say well I I just I've been in this message 30 years and I just don't understand nothing well you know what you just said the little word you don't understand nothing you stopped it somewhere cuz you can look back and if you want to start a checklist or whatever you want to start like I said before you know you start with with with coming to church and then doing the things of God and reading your Bible and studying we all need to do that we all need to do that but there comes a point in time where that becomes part of us amen not a struggle to get to it amen it's because Jesus never struggled being God never did he struggle never did he stand up and go I just ain't going to be God today he said I only do that what the father shows me right amen I only do that what the father shows me you say well we can't do that with a carnal mind it says you can because we need what a renewing of our mind as we're going to read here in a minute that but it says that every one of you so Paul didn't exclude anybody in Thessalonians he didn't exclude no one he said that every one of you should know how to possess your V I can't possess your vessel right preacher can't possess your vessel you can allow God to POS possess your vessel through the speaking of the word but it has to be by the Holy Ghost it can't be by a person it's got to be by the holy ghost that knows how to possess his vessel in what sanctification and honor Romans 12:2 and then you can sit down be you not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove you're going to prove one way or the other if you're of God or you're of the devil you're going to prove it amen all right by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you may be seing the Lord as his Blessing reading his word and I want to clear something up a little bit as we've been talking um about heart and and the different things we're not ever talking about when God talks about the heart of man it's not this thing right here it's the core the apple the core it's the core it's the center it's the heart of the Apple so it's the heart that we're talking about the soul is what we're talking about but it is the heart of you right it is your heart it is your being right now when your being leaves your body that thing that's thumping quits working everybody with me so that's not the important part we're going to read Paul where we talk about he talks about Waring against that flesh but you don't War if you're born again you don't worry about you don't war in your soul right that's what I've been trying to get you must if you're born again you can't there's no way you can fall there's no way you can worry about your soul if you're born again it's God it's perfect but we were born in sin so we have a another section that we have to deal with which is a Spirit a spirit being called memory reason conscious affection and Imagination all right now what did Jesus say in Matthew 12:34 he said oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things now he's talking about now look he says how you being evil speak good things they did everything right in the church the whole world was deceived by them except one man right right k Kus was the man he was the one we depended on if you were a Jew you depended on kyus to go into that holy of holies sprinkle it seven times and make sure that our sins were forgiven and that was cyas and we we put everything on cus the high priest he would come out he said okay your sins are forgiven well then you got Jesus standing there saying you're a Viper cuz he saw Into the Heart of the people oh generation of viers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the cardio the cardiologist the card the cardiac your heart your soul the mouth speaketh think about how we used to speak I'm sorry uh but you know if you didn't have a filthy mouth then you you you still was lost right come on somebody you still was lost we ain't know have good well I only curse three times in my life you curs four I'm better than you are no that don't mean one thing amen I would say Peter being an old fisherman I'm sure he probably said some words a little awkward before he got born again but Jesus said Satan is going to sift you like s Peter but I prayed for you well you know what Satan's going to sift us like Sam but God prayed for us in St John 17 God prayed a prayer that we would make it that we would be one as he and the father are one right I was um I don't know where I was at I was somewhere preaching oh it was here and we had visitors here and I when I was talking about us being Oneness and you know we we bash the Oneness and we bash the Trinity and we're a bunch of Tess you know Jesus over there and we're over here we can't get over there and we're not good enough to be over there uh St John 17 says let us be one as my father in Heaven's one was it two no it was one that's why we haven't come to we haven't come to realization because our carnal mind Still Still takes over still tells us that we're unworthy that we're lost that we can't get it we can't make it listen if God is God I was thinking about this the other day before the foundation of the world obviously he knew what was going to happen right and he let it happen he make it happen he put He he laid the canvas out and he put man down here on that canvas and said here take care of it but he knew as soon as he made Satan that the whole thing was going to mess up but he continued and let him do it he's let us live our life he knew we were going to fall he knew we were going to stumble he knew we were going to be lost but he knew that one day we'd come to a realization that we needed him and then what would he do he filled us then with the Holy Ghost not that we walked around with it all of our life the things I did the Holy Ghost was nowhere to be found oh yeah he was there he was there but he wasn't he wasn't proud to be anywhere close to where I was at I don't know about y'all sometimes y'all look at me like I'm just real bad y'all real good so that's okay maybe y'all never went through these things I don't know but I did and I'm just honest enough to tell you about it but look at verse 35 look a good man out of the good treasure we're going to look at that just a few minutes uh out of the good treasure I looked at were of treasure all right so and he says that Bible says it twice so we need to watch what's saying Jesus said a good man out of the good Treasure of the soul may we say that because he's not talking about the heart he's talking about the soul a good man out of the good Treasure of his soul bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his soul bringeth forth evil things that's why we were evil we were lost we were undone we did the things of the world why something inside of us made us do it and we just said okay why be had we had a carnal mind now watch in 2 Corinthians 4 I thought we'd read some scriptures tonight being Tuesday night middle of the week not so much as teaching but read some scriptures watch this but if our gospel look being hid it is hid to them that are lost lost okay if our gospel be hid Paul said it is hid to them that are lost now he's talking to the Corinthians everybody with me here and whom the God of this world now that's little G so the God of this world is who Satan and whom the God of this world ha blinded the minds not the hearts the minds you can be born again and your mind be blinded come on come on somebody Martin Luther his soul never had a trinitarian idea but his mind did his mind was affected by Satan I'm sorry yeah he was a church agent messenger but God never in no way preached a trinitarian Doctrine through Martin Luther right but now since we've come back to the faith of the fathers where they didn't teach it either that's why we had to come back to it and get these major doctrines down right I talking to brother CL last night we're talking about the church age book I cannot see how anybody in this message cannot use a church age book to further your walk with God that church age book has got every major doctrine of the Bible and everything you need is in that church age book but they call it a woman's book just because she typed it up anyway I don't see how you can tell that is a very vital part you know we don't agree with that we we use the church AG book all the time actually one brother was we were hunting with years ago and he said that's just a woman's book leale wrote it and this and that and the other that and the other and I said well brother I start to call his name I said brother I said my daddy's preaching tomorrow I said you better hold on to your seat he's going to read at least one quote out of that church age book he read four and the brother in the back was sitting beside me and I poked him I said told you what he was going to do I said that church AE books important or you can't preach the full message of the hour without that church a book we don't need to give out steal books yet we need to give out Church AE books we need somebody to learn the the what the foundation the doctrinal issues right if you don't have your Doctrine right why brother Brown he had to come to get the doctrine right all right the foundation right so that zerubabel can build this mountain of 1100 sermons that you and I are supposed to listen to and so then that the cap could fit on top of all that which is the the culmination it's just Jesus Christ all the way up but it's now going to be in its fullness and where you and I listen listen you're not going to fight with your soul as much as you used to now there's going to be a fight brother R said you you're going to be sticky till the end but it's going to be less and less I just believe that cuz what's keeping us now is our carnal mind that saying I don't know if I can do that or not I don't know if I'm good enough to do that or not I even say that Brother D says it all everybody does you got that little thing that's in your mind that little one little Point Body Change I don't know if I can do that or not well if you don't you won't but you got what the power of your thoughts think on these things if you think on what the world says we were up there hunting this week and there's a guy there that he's he's a nominal Christian guy and uh he was talking about wearing mask and you know being under a covid thing he lives in Colorado and uh he said I walked into whatever it was and and they were that whatever that County was you had to wear a mask it didn't matter if you was inside the house you know so David goes through the goes to CV line in CVS to get some medication or something and he don't have a mask on and he said they're going ah what are you doing trying to kill us he looked at him he said you all going to die anyway so you going to die sometime so but that's the world the world says okay we live we're born we live and we die Right Through the Ages it's always born live and die something's got to break that Chain's got to break in there somewhere cuz there's got to be a group of people that says that's not going to happen to me and it doesn't matter if you're 80 or 90 years old you say well I ain't got no chance I'm older than everybody else that doesn't have one thing to do with it Abraham was 99 years old when God changed his body hello somebody boy you ought to make your shout we ain't all 99 yet sister CL I said yet but if our gospel be hid it's him to them that are lost let's get through this and who look and whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them what I was just talking about that light's going to shine through me you it's going to shine the what is the image of God there it is right there that's the image of God that we've got to get to all right and you say well I can't who's made it well there's been a lot of people in the first three Church ages had all of these virtues working in their life so it should be not so hard for us to just read the Bible and see the virtues working in the book of Acts and Corinthians and and Romans and all the different ones everybody with me all right see see that's why we're here we are we're pushing it well that was for them no Jude says I'll read in just a few minutes that that we got to get back to that faith that was once delivered to the Saints right and whom the God of this world is blind but see that what it is so what's Satan doing he's making you believe you can't do it cuz can God tell you you can't make it he'd be a liar everybody he wanted everybody to be saved you anybody can make it adol hler could have made it if he' had give his life to Christ okay all right so we're there lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them watch this for we preach not ourself I was talking about the other day we don't pre we don't we don't put oursel above anybody we are servants We Serve the People for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves what your servants for Christ's sake all right and then Paul stands up one day and says you'll be judged by my gospel what gospel is that it wasn't Paul's gospel it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness so he commanded it so it's going to happen hath shined in our what Hearts right in our soul if you're born again the light God is not shining in your soul it is your soul to give look to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ what these virtues Paul didn't know how to call them virtues but he's preaching the virtues right here cuz watch this but we have this treasure we have this treasure that's the second time treasure is used we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us all right now watch what does that what does that word treasure mean the place in which good and precious things are collected and laid up a casket a coffer or other receptacle in which valuables are kept you know you don't put in a you know I got a safe at home and pretty much all of you got a safe or something somewhere and and you go out and you buy um you buy this plastic Cutlery it's what we use at the hunting camp cuz we don't want to wash dishes I tell them I'll wash the plates and the knives and the forks cuz they're all plastic and I just stole them in the trash but that's us but anyway but brother Donnie I know you got one and a safe and do you have any of that in there are you putting now you might want to put toilet paper in there the way it was the other couple years ago but basically you're not going to put a plastic fork and a plastic knife you're not in other words you're not going to store that kind of treasure because it's not valuable it has no value and it's not something you want to protect we want to get rid of that we want to protect what's dear and valuable to us now listen when we were out in the world we did value other things but that value we put on them is what killed us this value that we're talking about here it's going to save us look down there at number 1 C brother randam had a vision about a what Storehouse a storehouse and you know what you can look at it as a storehouse as a building but I'm looking at as me that inventory that he preached in 1100 sermons you can put them in this building right here in tape form and and digital form and it will do nothing but just burn when the world's being burned over but once it comes inside of me and you there's your Storehouse cuz you gather up your Treasures Storehouse repository the things laid up in a treasury collected Treasures you know you come to church and you you say well I didn't get anything much but maybe later on if you keep meditating on God God will come to you and that thing will fit right together that's a treasure you hold on to you hold listen if you've ever had a revelation it can't get away from you you might not remember the whole detail of it but you can tell that it changed you it made you read the Bible different it made you read you know when we were we were in other churches maybe may I say and we we read about the Seed doctrine and we heard preachers preach about this and we heard preachers preach at Daniel 70 weeks there was only three and A2 years left after the Rapture if they' just read the Bible they'd understand it's not but we what we stored that up as good food everybody with me we stored that up as good food people have stored up as good food that brother Brandon's got to come back oh he'll come back all right he'll come back he'll ride this Trail again but you know what he's going to ride it on he's going to ride it on mine and your faith to get him out of the ground so that's the way we got to think don't think Rapture think Resurrection think destroying death but that's what we got but we store these things up but what happened was we had a preacher come by Brother Dale started preaching we started listening to some of his tapes or or or listening to his seals and different things you know that that these good ministers is preaching and then what do we do with that that's in our Storehouse we tossed it out it wasn't good treasure anymore but but but but Jesus tell us right here look he said but we have this treasure this treasure what what treasure it it go back in can read has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ that's mine and your mandate when we become up this statue of per or go up this statue of perfect man that's what it is it's the light of the knowledge of the glory of God it's not just that knowledge right there it's the knowledge of virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness that you have a knowledge of it that you store it up and you know it's kind of like a hard drive you it's in there and it's spinning around and you may not need this certain file but it's still there right but what happens is you click on that certain file and it pulls up that information doesn't pull up everything pulls up that information and then it puts it out on the screen for you to read it that's the same way God is you got it stored in there somewhere but listen you got to hear it first you got to hear it first you can't just come up with these ideas on your own right brother Brown didn't come up with these ideas on his own he got them from the Bible all right so that's why I put my faith in what the Bible he didn't say face final arting places in brother bram's message brother Bram said face final rest and place in the word of God that's why I said you can take all these major doctrines and you got to take it back to the Bible and brother R can't say anything any different than the Bible all right so you got to base it on the Bible what the Bible say 70 weeks are determined and he shall confirm the Covenant for one week who that's the Antichrist we're going to be gone so there's one week left you figure that out you can't change the Bible you can't change the Bible to fit a quote you got to change the quote to fit the Bible everybody with me that's that storing up that we've been stor listen somebody in this world is going to store up good food no writing food at all good food and going to what that's going to sustain them to a resurrection sustain them to a body change it's going to sustain because what we took these treasures and we've held them what in in steel and mortar it says Earth and vessels right here clay the Frailty of man cuz you can take a clay pot and you can just hit it just a little bit what does it do it falls apart right it falls apart there's nothing to it but God decided to put it in that Earth vessel he decided to do that and use it as the greatest weapon against the devil which is what overcoming you that's it and having your flesh not cursed like it used to not flesh but what they Outlet of your memories and Conant affection to do the things you used to do things I used to do I do them no more but a storehouse repository magazine the things laid up in a treasury collected treasure every time you come to church what you're collecting a treasure putting it in your storehouse and brother Brown said it was good food oh big apples and oranges and and big you know it wasn't just like he didn't walk in and the vision didn't have well I think that's a that a box of cheese over there in the corner that's one apple no he said it the thing was full of good food that's what this word is it's full of good food if we what if we'll eat it everybody with me we got to get this down before we can head toward the son of man revelation we got to get this son of God Revelation we've got to have the virtues working in our life cuz that's what God's coming to okay and I didn't make it I didn't make that the rule God did so in the Statue perfect man brother ran says as we've said many times before the first thing you got to do you got to be born again all right you got to be born again now you get born again and what you've got to be changed okay and it's going to show on the outside eventually Mom and Dad years and years ago brother Mike Al came to the church here and of course when it was a little building mama said um I'm sure Sister Janet won't mind if I tell it said she said she had her hair was cut off as short as a as a man's and had big old thing earrings you know and a short dress and but they had just come into the message well what you do is though you look at her a month later and hear she's dressed you don't brother Brown you know he talks about hair he said if you're a born again believer your hair is just as long as somebody that's never cut their hair it's just got to keep growing out it's just something that you got to do right with your flesh so that listen I told a girl that that's right beside of us and she's a hairdresser I said Genie I said if people live by the Bible you'd go out of business you'd cut some men's hair but you'd never cut a one she she just kind of looked at me like that you know and I said no I said you know it in the Bible you're the sitting there with short hair you know it in the bi it's in the Bible not to cut the hair but you sit there and cut their hair and I mean day in and day out 10 and 15 people a day mostly women and what is it common for this world to do cut their hair right it's just common I mean it's you're weird if you don't but you don't know they're weird right cuz they're not doing what the Bible says so beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation common salvation in other words foundational truth all right common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you this is Jude writing and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints he could look back and see Peter James uh John the different on the founders the the the the Cornerstone of the church there they were they had these gifts working in their life and jud's going in other words let's put it in 2020 Jude walks into a message church and there's no gifts working people living any way they want to there's no virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness jws like come on man y'all missed something somewhere he said but you need to earnestly contend to get back to that earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered so listen that faith is here cuz if it was once delivered to the Saints God don't change whatever he requires of them that's what he requires of us God worked down through the church ages through partial Revelation but when you get to Peter James and all them and Paul not one thing Paul said was wrong come on somebody now not one thing Paul preached was wrong why can't we get to that amen nothing he preached was wrong I'll read to you just a minute remember philus and hus he called her name in the Bible philus and hus he said they're preaching that the resurrection already took place right and you know where they got it from Paul Paul was the Paul was the prophet of the day so I don't I don't think it's so strange brother darney that people around here today not here around the message doing the same thing well brother Brian said well Paul said there's already been a resurrection he was talking about an out Resurrection he's talking about an inside Resurrection but Philipus and hus go to their church at their little I'm not going there their little Camp the little group that they huddle all up in and they're preaching Paul's message but preaching it wrong that's right that's right you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men men not man men preachers for there are certain men crept in unawares now unawares means they didn't know they was in the congregation yet come on somebody who are before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our Lord into lasciviousness which is horrible and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ but thank God he gave us Ephesians 4:11 he gave us a perfect five-fold ministry that could take us on that could get us out of what our indiffer or our differences and indifferences and get us what get us up this statue of perfect man get us to that Son of God Revelation to where listen folks it ought to be in your heart if you're going to be a Christian why you want to be a Christian and just be that is there not a desire in your heart when when when You' got a a dad and I'm included in this you got a dad that's sitting at home that's sick as a dog 10 and something degree fever and can't hardly think and can't hardly get out of a chair and there I am supposedly a born- again believer that has the power to pray for the sick and to see demons cast out of people and to see chains loose from people's life and to see the sick healed the dead raised that's what happened in the first church age Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have and even they believe them so much that they said if just if I can just get into the shadow of Paul that's right I just get in the shadow of Peter they're so Godly till it just what that virtue just oozes out of them and I don't know if that's a good word to use but I think it's a good word to use it just oozes out of you right overflow that's the kind of thing I want folks that's what I want now listen we can't conquer the world but I'll guarantee you there got to be some time when the devil's got to back off to the people of God there's a time and a place but it's got to be a time and a place where we can believe that and not have all these other things in our head going I don't know if I need to pray for him or not Heavenly days you're a Christian yes lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it doesn't matter if a woman's got bob hair or no hair that's right right human beings are sick this whole world sick I'm not talking about just mentally physically this whole world sick CO's coming back around again the Great greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to the world oh that doesn't say that is a committal to God the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it now we know the greatest battle ever fought we know that I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe that I believe he's been dressing them and training them that's why it took us 60 years to get this message right I said not get the message right get us right in the message let's put it that way this message has been right since the foundation of the world am right actually before the foundation of the world do y'all understand this this message is not just man's ideas this message everything we see and everything we read the Bible in 1100 sermons and we hear we hear the voice of God speaking to us that's what our mandate is is to listen to the voice of God not a voice he's been selecting them he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start that was 1962 you know what that was that was 311 the seals were preached in that same month a year later brother Bram a year later comes back in March and preaches the seals comes from the greatest battle ever fought he knew it was going to be a fight he knew it was going to be a struggle what' he say he said it's gone from you it's not for you preaches marriage and divorce he said thousands of my friends are going to turn me down and they did why why cuz he wasn't the normal oh you can do what you want to it's okay no the greatest battle the Battleground begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind or the head your decision that's your filter right even if you got the Holy Ghost listen even with the Holy Ghost you gonna make mistakes I hope y'all understand that I hope you don't think that you know you see these commercials where the where the they're getting ready to put on some uh uh some real pretty cologne or or or some real pretty washing powders and everything smells good so butterflies go off all over the place and sunshines everywhere and you know you got a rainbow in the cloud you know and and you're going oh this is so good then you just fall back in the cloud that's not not going to happen it's going to be more like a war zone that it is a flowy bed of ease a know what the Bible says you know it's not going to be a flower bed of ease but listen if you'll commit it to God the committ commit it to God let him do the work unless we suffer with him we can't rain with him you have to suffer to rain the reason this is that character simply is never made without suffering what' I just say character is a victory not a gift so that what that's the characteristics of God so it was what even Jesus learned by the things that he what suffered and being made perfect became the author of Salvation to all of us see that's hard to swallow because you think well he was lost no he wasn't lost he was a human he had a human brain just like you did he had a human psyche just like you do the devil talked to him as much as God did come on the devil was actually closer he took him up on a building took him out in the desert took him up a high place and said here's a vision of the whole world it's yours if you'll worship me nope you have to suffer to rain character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule you think boy see rule rule or that's rule rule rule no rule over yourself rule over you start with that husband start with that wives rule over yourself and that will help rule over your children why am I against organized religion brother R said look if what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue and all these things Temperance things and godliness brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you it's a requirement Lauren was telling me good to have Lauren back with us it was good Lauren says she was going to be take this course of Criminal Justice and she like some C you got is a requirement are you just going are you going to take like chalk drawing you know kids on the sidewalk they take chalk and they that's not part of the curriculum right no that's it's not required that may be an elective but it's not a required course a required course has to do with the subject matter that you're studying right same way with here these things are required of us they're required of us to be like Peter James and Paul you say I can't be like Paul I can well see there then you can't because it's all in your head it's all in your head listen to this James 1:6 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waver is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed one of the best sermons brother Brown preached in his early Ministry was why are some people tossed about man that was in the early 50s and he laid it out he told them why they were tossed about they wasn't born again for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord because a double-minded man is unstable in some of his ways it says all his ways and that word means wavering uncertain doubting divided in interest I don't know if I can go to church or not I I think my cat's got diarrhea who somebody ever said that before you know I mean you got all these excuses that's okay it's all right listen I want to tell you something about that I you know because if you're out and you're going to vacation I'm not talking about people like that you know brother D's never said that either but when you just don't come to church you're lost right when you just don't come you have no excuse and you just or you have a bunch of them you know you're lost but but now if you take a vacation or like I was gone last week different things that's all right but that's 52 weeks out of the year if you're gone 50 of them you're lost take a couple weeks of vacation go off some where be with your husband and or wife be with your family take some time off when I was not doing anything Sunday I was watching the service here amen so so it's a desire that you have in your heart go take time off be be with your family be but don't say well my family's coming in next weekend I think I'll be with them and then they come in the next weekend and you got three brothers and they're all going to come in separate weekends and we don't see you for three months that's what I'm talking about or your job has just Tak you all year and you're going to be out the whole year you know if you're out for your job that's okay once or twice but when you use it as an excuse to be out you're the only one that knows that you're the only one that knows whether you need to be in church or not so it's not up to the preacher it's up to you I'm fulfilling the word of God I'm telling you about it but the right mental attitude the right mental attitude 1951 a prophet of God your right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass any promise you know what we we take that we take that I believe and we put it toward healing what about salvation the right m attitude God I'm lost I I'm lost I I'm I'm I'm tormented I don't know what to do right mental attitude start making an effort read your Bible instead of reading whatever you you read before remember brother random he said if you're sting you start giving stuff away do the vice versa now the prophet of God told us that ever how Elementary you think that is he he must thought it worked CU God had him say it to us that's right that it's not some great something you got to do no it's the power of the right mental attitude and listen this is not this is not the power of positive thinking that's whole different they wrote books about that and and you know you can have that if you want to but the most positive thing I know of is the word of God so if we think on these things then we do need to think on these things and have the right mental attitude that when you come to church you going to get some from from God I mean really do we come to church and say God I need XYZ be specific I need healing I got a question about my life I got a question about my job I got a question about a boyfriend or a girlfriend I've got a question about what kind of car to drive or buy I got a question whether to buy a new house or or rent there's questions and you say well boy you going to make God real busy he ain't never been too busy to answer every question that you got but you know what if you'll listen to it and you know what you got to ask the question now look now maybe you don't believe that brother Brown said now look you said well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith and I know that's hard to do when you have temperatures 103 and you're laying in the bed or you're throwing your guts up it's hard to believe that but you know what you got to just keep saying it just keep saying it just keep saying it just keep saying Thank You Lord just keep saying thank you for my healing just say Lord I know people are praying for me it's out on the uh you know on the internet and and I thank God for that because for that part of it because real quickly we know if somebody's sick or if somebody's been in a hospital we know it real quick and we can pray right then take that situation to the Lord right there all right and take it to him right then fresh right there cuz you know who's you know who's fresher than you are the devil is cuz he's one to put it on them amen somebody so we want God to get there with we want the prayer angels to be there we want them to drive all that out that's what they did in the in Peter and James and John and all they didn't have this denominational thing they had to worry about of a different idea that God's this and God's that and and you know brother R meant this and he was wrong here they didn't have that Peter stands up one day and he says you've crucified the Lord Of Glory it's your fault right read the book of Acts he stands up and he says this Jesus whom you've killed whom you've crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ in other words now he was inside of Peter and then 3,000 people were so pricked at their heart they said hey how can we get what you got that's right that's right how could we you've told us a little bit about this Jesus we want to know some more about him and then you know who got in trouble Pearl Steven got in trouble he preached a wonderful sermon about all the way took him from Moses you know them big San hadin they just sitting there going we know all that we know about Moses we know about the Red Sea but oh when stepen got to Jesus and he said you crucified him you destroyed him it's your fault that's when they took him out and stoned him when he told him about Jesus have you ever been stoned because of what you believe H think about that but I wouldn't confess it don't let the devil know it I always say I got good faith I believe God with all my heart don't testify nothing of the devil Queen of Sheba 1961 let's hurry through this I want to get to a point the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God this is what we were talking about the other day I thought it worthy to read it again if you have a situation this is how brother brandom the prophet of God handled his situations all right everybody with me all right the first thing I want to find out is whether it's the will of God or not everybody with me right there that's the first thing if it's not the will of God don't go to the next two because it's going to be your motive and your objective but if this was the will of God it just might fit in the plan of God but it ain't going to fit in the plan of God if you start off wrong the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it then if it's the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith that it'll be done because first it's the will of God and my objective is to glorify him what with what he's trying to whatever he's trying to to do is to glorify God not to glorify himself and my motive is to give him all the glory see there's no selfish motive about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something well you'll never succeed and then try to do something outside the will of God it's not going to work to begin with 1963 read this and I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you not to your neighbor not to the ones that once had the faith according to Jude no a now Faith as brother um green preached at one time now Faith is the substance of thing now we need a now Faith right listen you you should not have faith that God's one you should be pasted that that should be so solidified in your soul that you don't wonder about that cuz you know what if you wonder about something you don't have faith boy I'm glad y'all got quiet you think about that if you have a doubt about something something how can it be Faith can't be if you have a well I don't know about that maybe there is two or three or or cuz listen people fight you over a trinity yes cuz that's what they what that's what they built their treasure on that's what they put in their Storehouse that they think God's going to honor that but God cannot honor false word never can and never will he can wink at your ignorance for a Time but remember what I said about ignorance it's not wrong to be ignorant but if you stay ignorant long enough it comes to stupid and when it gets to stupid you're in trouble all right cuz ignorant would be I don't have one clue about criminal justice and Lauren just got a headful of it over there but if I say well I want to be a criminal justice guy myself I'm just going to walk in the court and set up there in the yeah she's going ain't going to happen me is it you don't oh I don't think so she said so what do you got to have you got to have the right curriculum you got to have the right what motive and objective you got to have what the backing of God and then that'll happen he's going to equip you for the battle I want to read this right here we haven't read this before 2 Corinthians 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh I'm reading Paul cuz if you stop right here it would seem contrary to what Paul's been talking about but he continues on he in parenthesis for the weapons of our Warfare not the weapons of our picnic the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds every one of us has got a strong part in our body in our psyche that we need to get tore down every one of us has something that it stops US so there's weapons of our Warfare that are not carnal they're spiritual and they pull down those strongholds and that's what I'm trying to get us to do pull those strongholds down let God do it in your life let him pull them down because you know what when they pulls down a wall Jericho they would stand up on that wall of Jericho and they go this wall is 14et thick we run chariot races around this thing and y'all I can't even see you down there what do you mean you're going to destroy this wall what do you mean you're going to destroy my city of Jericho we got walls to thick you can't even you couldn't bore your way through it and what happened God showed them that their defenses were not brick and mortar it was a bunch of Earth and vessels standing outside that was the chosen people of God and they hollered and screamed and shouted Ed Victory and the walls fell down so man so see Joshua and them didn't have to have the battering rams and they didn't have to go get the climbing gear and they didn't have to go one piece at a time no they just said God said hey if you'll do this it things will fall right same way with us folks so how's this going to happen here we go right here casting down imaginations memory reason conscious affection imagination that's part of our five senses in the in the in the spirit realm right casting down imaginations well I imagine I wonder what uh-uh God has never set one day and said I wonder how it's going to happen if I do it this way he knew it was going to happen you say well I can't that we're not God well you got God in you well maybe some of you do and some of you don't casting down imagination and look and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God now look as get the knowledge of God there's going to be competition or there's going to be someone always Paul always had an adversary Deus Philipus and hus seven sons of ska the the woman sorcerer the copper Smith he always had somebody that was falling along and and and and trying to mess up his his campaign in other words so you going to have them too you they probably not philus and amus but they may be whatever you want to call them but cast down that imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God look and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the power of your thought think on the these things look and having in a Readiness not having to go find it not having to call the pastor I know there's times we have to call others to get to get uh help and power and and to talk about things but you need to start standing on your own two feet I believe brother Dale's taught us enough that we don't have to come crying to the pastor all the time handle it yourself and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience here's the key when your obedience is fulfilled because if you're disobedient how can you cast out something that's disobedient brother brandom prophet of God I would say the most obedient person since Christ Jesus on the face of the Earth would you not say that he tells a little white lie actually he tells the truth but he said it was a little while afterwards he said tell them I'm not here run outside now what happened when he went he had a leading to go pray for that child right come pray for my brother BR is sick you know okay I'll be there in second he gets over to the house what does he do gets ready to put his hands on the baby and God says take your dirty hands off that child how can you Revenge all this obedience when your obedience is not fulfilled so what did he do he went back and made it right then he come and prayed and what did God do his obedience was fulfilled so then God honored what he said that's why I tell you I when I don't pray for people well I used to sit over there but sit over here now but when I used to sit right there I'd raise my hand and I said God don't let me cuz the preacher that's praying he's praying the prayer he's he's connected with them right the anointing is there and all of us need to be praying but brother B said if one unconfessed sin in the congregation can make what the whole congregation fail it can keep somebody from getting their healing so I say God you got a brother praying I don't need to know what it is and I I'm not going to diligently pray for what they're praying for you say well boy that's kind of strange no you better make sure you're right first so I say God if there's anything in my heart anything I did against you or anybody else please forgive me so that I won't hinder that person getting their healing when your obedience is fulfilled having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled I like that that's why we should pray before we come to church why we should pray before we come in the door that's why we have a time of prayer or are you thinking about tomorrow's work are you thinking about something else there's your hindrance that we're not getting what we should be getting and I've done it too we all have but come in the Bible says having a pure mind what a renewing of your mind I I know in the world we get all muddled up when when you're not out of church I don't know about y'all but if I miss a service I don't feel good right one service I just don't feel good I don't feel it's like brother Lis was saying in back there mind if I tell it's just not the same without me it's not the same without brother Dale it's not the same when we're when some of the pieces of the puzzle are missing it's just not the same but boy when you get them all together it's a powerful Army second Peter says this we'll close right here he says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain un to life and godliness we're going to start into the virtues starting on next Sunday through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped strongholds been pulled down hey I'll promise you one thing if you've been behind bars all your life and somebody walks in and smashes the wall of the prison down you're going to go no I think I'll just stay right here oh I kind of like it here I like this slop that they feed me in this bed that you know in a toilet over in the corner I love it I just absolutely love it that's what we do to try to get the world out of us I think I like that I think I'll keep it now when God pulls a wall down walk out don't walk out run out having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this so we've got something besides this because Peter on the day of Pentecost got the Holy Ghost but he had a besides this moment when he was at the gate beautiful and he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk that was his besides this moment you and I start needing to have besides this moment listen we're Christians we do the right thing like I wait a minute when your obedience is fulfilled God's going to give you the desire of your heart and this is how to do it and besides this giving all diligence or haste or earnestness earnestness in accomplishing or striving after anything interest in oneself self most earnestly add to your faith so we're adding now that faith that was that was a faith one once delivered to the Saints well it took a prophet of God in the end time to what tie up the Loose Ends what was the Loose Ends the doctrines that had accumulated by the devil through the church through the bride hello somebody through the bride but God said I can't take that no more because these people are going to have to be me come back in flesh again and if I didn't have a false Doctrine they can't have a false Doctrine so Baptist you can't have it cuz you got a trinitarian doctrine that I can't I can't I can wink at it I can save you come on somebody I can save you but I can't make you a adopted son and daughter of God because you have power without character but Power with character it's fit to change a body it's fit to bring the dead Saints out of the ground that's what the difference is God winked at them because he knew the devil was going to get in didn't God write the Bible he's the one that said you've left your first love he's the one that said you've took on a name that's not mine he's the one that said spoke there Revelations remember that's the only book that Jesus spoke directly to pet I mean to John right he was telling John this is what my church is going to look like and then he comes to a prophet in the end time and he shows him a vision of the most horrible Church in the world but it was a church half naked twisting right he said oh my God is this what my message has brought but then remember the preview of the Bride which she walked right she talked right she dressed right and she didn't go down she went up that's it amen so we got to add to our faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge that word add mean means Minister nourishment we talked about this a few weeks ago Minister nourishment listen we'll read this then we'll close magicians come on a person of virtue makes the progression from knowing what is right to doing what is right we don't need a lot of knowers we need a lot of doers he or she intentionally chooses what to say do in value reaching beyond the good toward the best in every situation a virtuous person knows that they have an opportunity to honor the Lord and reflect him to others that should be our desire why do we come to church for just see each other see what the next person's going to wear see if we who we can talk about right 2 Timothy 2:15 let's stand the Bible says study to show thyself he didn't say preacher steud to show it says you study amen study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman a Workman somebody that goes to work not sorry and lazy a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they were increase unto more ungodliness in other words going to take you away from God away from God and their word look will eat as do a canker and of whom is hus and filus who concerning the truth now Paul preached them the truth truth but concerning the truth have ered error saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some wow when I read that I was like Wow Let's Take it back take it back 2,000 years we got a church service going on philus and hus are preaching Paul's Doctrine and their word will eat as do the caner of whom is hus and philus who concerning the truth Paul preached them the truth but what did they do have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already what and overthrow the faith of some totally take them out of the picture totally take that Foundation of Faith away from them by false Doctrine that's why prophet of God had to come and preach the truth so now we have something to what something to rely on I rely on this message if it's not right I where are we going to go where are we going to go find me somebody find me somewhere Paul says right here real quick here's a prophet here's a guy that writes 80% of the Bible of the New Testament okay Paul really you know one of them double thumbs up like y'all do when you send messages it's not just one thumbs up it's like two or even three or four or five and a couple of smiley faces and praying hands so anyway we become Emoji crazy yeah we have don't look at me like that we send emojis for everything happy ones sad ones crying ones for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal so sold under sin this is Paul talking everybody with me here just a minute that's Paul talking for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not I'm going explain that just a second but what I hate but what I hate that I do I hate it but I do it anyway this is a church a messenger did I ever tell y'all that and he wrote 80% of the New Testament and he was a prophet of God okay if then I do that which I would not or should not I consent unto the law that it's good accepting false Doctrine accepting false teaching it it's good now then it is no more I that do it but he's let sin dwell in and take over all right for I know that in me that is in my flesh not his flesh in his flesh dwelleth no good thing he's talking about memory reason conscious affection imagination because his soul at that time as he's writing the Bible has got to be born again God didn't write the Bible with Sinners he wrote them with people with a new birth for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwell is no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform but how this is this is a prophet but how to perform that which is good I find noten wow for the good that I would I do not in other words he's worrying against himself the things I want to do in my inner man my soul I I don't do it because it goes through that memory reason conscious affection imagination and turns around and comes back this way a prophet wrote 80% of the okay for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do he's honest he's being honest with us and with himself look now if I do that I would not it's no more that I do it but sin that dwelleth in me now he not sinning in his soul he the B get believer he has a spirit of God in his soul he's talking about his Spirit realm memory reason conscious affection imagination cuz you know what when Paul laid his head down he heard those Christian scream that he put in the Lion's dent I believe when Paul got up he got up looking out to Rome when he went to Rome and he'd see their that Coliseum and he said I put people in there that now follow me I persecuted these people I made them blaspheme but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present for I Delight in the law of God after the inward guy the inward man one more time we ahead just get a song Ready but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind watch and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then when the mind with the Mind look with the mind I myself serve the law of God remember he's he's talking about renewing your mind what he's doing is he's letting that soul come up to the mind come up I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin that's a church age messenger that's a that's a man that that truly was a born- again believer and and had the virtues working in his life but he still had problems he still had issues oh Wretched Man that I am but you know what he had to overcome that he overcame that cuz he had Faith he said you'll be judged by what I say he must have thought pretty good not himself but what was inside of him was what was talking that's right we got to understand when brother brandham spoke that was God speaking to us now not all the other the the life things but the doctrine that was God speaking to us that was a man moving himself out of the way so much he said I had to go back and listen to the tape to see what I said boy that's pretty good oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death cuz this death is starting in here this your death starts inside it don't start here oh yeah this looks older and it gets older because of sin but what the death in you starts inside and works its way out let's sing a song God bless you I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin there's only two things in your soul folks and that's Faith or doubt one or the other there's no in between believe God believe what he said why would we come to church we didn't believe what God Said all right so believe what he said let's [Music] sing that I might become him by Grace it's all Grace oh he became me that I might become my [Music] gra why because he took my place took my place so that I through his love could take oh he be didn't have to he didn't have to come down here in human flesh but that was his plan was to defeat the Devil in human flesh and he's defeating it through your human flesh became me that I might become by [Music] gra oh he he became me that I might become by Grace oh he took my place that I through his love could [Music] take think about that oh he became me that I might be by gra listen let's don't let the devil beat us [Music] up we're the bride We're The Chosen and if we intentionally do the right things he's got to come on the scene he's got to he's got to reveal his word to you he's got brother rown said one time he said if if if if God doesn't do it the same way every time said you can go go to God and say look God you're a liar you lied right here that's pretty strong he said but no don't worry he's not going to be a liar that's why I can defend that man might lie to you but God will never lie to you Satan will lie to you every time his mouth's moving amen oh and he became Me [Music] That by see if it wasn't for Grace Paul Couldn't Write what he wrote that I read y'all there's no way without Grace he could have wrote that cuz you know what he was condemned to die he persecuted Christians he made Christians die but God said I'm going to use you cuz you got a Zeal that's more than most other people's got he said I'm going to turn that Zeal and I'm going to put it toward me but Paul still had that human part of him that said hey you did this you did that just like the devil doesn't do that to you pray for me he doesn't to me all the time you did this you did that you can't there's not a place in the Bible God says you can't he says you can if you'll believe me that's what I want us to take with us tonight believe what he said have a wonderful Thanksgiving enjoy your time with your family remember to give thanks first for your salvation and then give thanks that your family is right there with you there's a lot of people not going to have their family there some passed on some are not going to be there so you just thank God that he's always going to be there
