crossing the calm sea with jesus the disciples were getting concerned the wind started violently blowing but he was asleep in the stern does he not care that we perish we are so afraid but jesus arose when they called him and said to them where is your faith cause you prayed all night cause you've held on with all of your might child your christ has woken the master [Music] and he knows your voice lift your hands it's time to rejoice child your christ has woken the master it hit you without any warning the storm of your life had begun seeing no hope in the distance [Music] you're thinking that you'll surely drown [Music] and you know that you can't give up now because you pray all night cause you held on with all of your might child your cries have woken the master [Music] and he knows your voice lift your hands it's time to rejoice child your christ has woken the master [Music] and you're up there worried that he's fast asleep the winds are so deadly the water's so deep but try to be

of my heart i want to see you i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see to see you [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy you are holy holy holy [Music] holy holy i want to see you greetings god bless you all good to be in the house of the lord this evening i trust everyone's doing well praise the lord we're going to go ahead and go to the word and then i'll have you all be seated after we read so we're going to read in colossians chapter 2 verse 1 starting at verse 1. colossians 2 verse 1. the bible says for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your your order and in the steadfastness of your faith in christ as you have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of man after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all not some amen all the fullness of the godhead bodily and look what he says here and ye are complete in him where all that dwells in now paul was talking to colossians here to the colossians and they're gentiles right how many believe that that god's given us further revelation in this day yet paul was saying that they were complete in him at that time how how about you that's why when satan comes around and he starts talking to you well you know you you're nothing you're you're just you're a half christian you look what you did yesterday look at that let me tell you you're complete in him if you are in christ jesus hallelujah you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power praise the lord jesus so we're just we're going to speak this evening so walking him is our title and let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity that we have to open back the pages of your word we appreciate lord god for the opportunity that that we have lord together together lord while we still have that opportunity father we're going to do it lord and those that love you father god will we'll come together lord jesus and they will not just want to fellowship with one another but lord fellowship with you lord so we father god come lord and ask father that if there's any sin in our heart if we failed you in any way lord sinned maybe said or thought anything that was contrary to your word lord that would hinder us from receiving from you lord we place it under the blood of jesus christ right now father for the blood father not not it doesn't just cover lord god it it eradicates completely lord where where the sin itself cannot even be found anymore lord god lord i pray lord that you'd help us this evening meet every need father god we just we're remembering sister sister freda this evening lord god just a special prayer that goes out we're going out to her lord god reaching father god lord to her lord where where you father died for her her her healing on the cross of calvary over 2000 years ago lord god and we know that that power lord god that healing powers is still more than able to heal even this 2022 lord god almighty is still able to eradicate cancer still able to eradicate spots and lord jesus we just pray father that you give her strength and then you give her peace father god during this time lord we just commit it into your hands and this these these things into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen lord bless you you may be seated praise the lord i'm sorry i just i gotta have my little swig right before i start talking i'm still trying to get used to this apparatus i know it sounds good but [Laughter] yes sir [Laughter] amen lord bless you all how many are happy to be in the house of god we missed you all this sunday this past weekend and uh maybe you all missed us i don't know [Laughter] but brother brother uh uh no brother brother bob and brother uh ryan you all did a wonderful job this this past sunday and uh excellent [Applause] excellent little thought that brother ryan brought there about the picture amen the picture unfolding and i believe that as as believers and we're walking in this christian way man that picture is unfolding every single day every it should be at least and he didn't give any anything difficult he didn't have no no calculus calculations or algebra into it all he said is just keep reading your bible and pray that's all it is and then god will take care of the rest and i like that i like that you just do your part and he does his so we appreciate that brother ron we we i always enjoy listening to brother ryan right he does a really really good job brother bobby i felt like i was an evangelistic sermon when i was when i was listening he did an excellent job we appreciate that word brother brother bob amen praise the lord because how many believe that god still heals amen even in this in this moment where where we see so much sickness and so many people dying left and right and just all kinds of chaos amen but but god is still in the healing business amen thank you all for your prayers for us this past weekend um i could say maybe for brother with brother wade as well brother boyd was there as well and uh my family uh sister june i believe the people were definitely helped uh they were and i know that they're listening in right now lord bless you all we love you all and uh just to just to be there in their place and and fellowship with them and and uh be able to answer their their their questions brother wade of course he was he was the one who did most of that and and it just it tied things so perfectly i mean i even i even learned some more things amen some more things were revealed to me and uh you know what struck me the most is that is that they some of them have been believers for for a while now you know but but they they've you can just see it in their heart that they're so in love with christ right now and and it's almost like i almost felt jealous for them you know what i'm saying it's like they are so in love with god right now i mean i i have never seen people watching with a zeal washing our feet and crying like babies as they were there washing our feet and just thanking thanking god and i said lord you know maybe you're just calling us to go back to our first love amen maybe he's using those brethren to do that and and so that really struck me and and they might think you know we went over there to get for them to receive something from us but i got that from them amen that zeal that sometimes because we we think we have it all here and it's another wednesday night another sunday morning another sun as brother bob there's brother wade preaching again but to them it's not that way to them they are really taking everything even going back 15 years from when brother dale was preaching and they're quoting things that brother dale said 15 years ago puts me to shame yeah and they know everybody and they know how many hair brother bob has on his hair and his face and everything [Laughter] so they're paying attention but most importantly they're paying attention to the word and and so they they're praying for us and you just continue to pray for them some of them i believe want to get rebaptized and then and and just and so we just thank god god is working and who knows what will happen from six months to a year from now god is the one that's in control what's most important is that they're in love with christ no matter the situation that they're in if it's drawing them closer to god that's the most important part so be it amen but but uh and just so glad that we were able to be part of that so lord willing they'll be here with us the brethren will be here with us more of them even from last time they'll be here with us in a couple of weeks for the meetings so so we just thank god and thank god for the protection and i know some of you all probably saw a little videos we were sending in through the whatsapp group we were just having fun too i mean we laughed we ate and did a little bit of cutting up as well and brother boyd he's a good sport but we appreciate we appreciate all the other things and and uh just thank god for the fellowship so so we're gonna go ahead and go to the word now and uh just um just a small little thought here and i'm not i'm not going to keep you all along but so walkie in him and we see here that this is a phrase that is in uh that is in verse six um but i just want to go i just want to go verse by verse and if we read here in colossians 2 verse 1 and it says for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh you notice how paul was mentioning that how he has such a great conflict such a great love such a great zeal for for the ones that were in laodicea and we know that that was the physical city back then and uh but it's interesting that that we are living in that in that at that time amen and and so we know that that our our our soul amen is not in laodicea and it shouldn't be in laodicea amen we should be living in an eighth day amen uh the bride should be in that eighth day but physically we are still living under the effects of laodicea amen and it pulls on us and it tempts us and it and it draws us but amen god has given us a way to overcome laodicea in this hour god has been the overcomer throughout all the ages and he's still overcoming in this day no matter if his laodicea no matter what age we're living in god is the one that's conquering through his people praise the lord so and we see here that he says for and for them there is for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh because paul's desire was for the people even for the ones that he had not yet met in person he had that love he had that desire for them amen and and saints a christian god called man amen that's what he that's what he desires he desires the the the the to to uh raise up the kingdom of god amen not to lower the kingdom of god not to squash the kingdom of god among within the people or amongst the people amen but it's to lift up the kingdom of god and unfortunately we see that some men they've they come in to lift up themselves and to lift up a ministry or to lift up a certain uh group or a certain uh clan or a certain thing but but amen a true man of god just like paul and man he was about about lifting the people up amen and it's not about you and it's not about me it's about lifting christ up amongst the people so that people can see christ and not see yourself not see me i mean i have nothing to offer but christ has everything to offer amen and if and if i fool with christ then i want people to see christ in me the hope of glory may not not not me but see but see christ praise god amen and we see here in verse two that that their hearts paul says here that their hearts might be comforting being knit being knit together in what in love amen and that love that he's talking about here is not it's not affiliate love but it's agape love amen being knit together in love amen when something is knit together amen then it's hard to break it apart amen when it's knit together in love and it says and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding praise god he makes a very big uh what he says here understanding is important amen and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding because saints you won't have full assurance in the word of god if you don't understand it i'm just kind of breaking down these little verses if you don't understand the word of god and if you just read it really quick you'd not get the essence of what christ is trying to tell you so here paul is saying being knit together in love first you got to have love in your life in order to be able to love the word of god because oh because i got to read the word of god i got to read the bible because i have to that there's no love there that love is not connecting you to the word amen so then you won't have the opportunity to obtain all the riches of the full assurance of understanding you know you have to have some you have to understand something in order for that to be revealed to you right revelation just doesn't come without hitting your physical brain first and you unders understanding it first then it's revealed to you someone had to explain to me first what water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ physically show me in the scriptures where it is oh i understand that that acts uh matthew 28 19 is really what peter is saying in acts 2 2 38 amen and then god reveals that to you amen you've got to have that understanding and so that's what paul is talking about here and those are richest saints that's why it's so important to pay attention to to the minute to the ministry to the preaching of the word because maybe something may not be revealed to you but but but if you pay attention you'll have the opportunity to understand and then god could come down and be able to reveal that to you maybe not right there and then maybe a year from now but if you're not listening there's no opportunity for revelation amen so he's telling the colossians here being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding my goodness when something just sinks down deep in your heart and it's revealed to you amen that brings full assurance you think the devil would take that away from you can take that away from you he can't you think the devil can take away from me one god when that's fully revealed to you there's no way amen to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god amen and of the father and of christ praise the lord amen to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and so the mystery of god praise the lord what is the mystery of god amen we know that it's christ in you the hope of glory amen that is the mystery of god praise the lord colossians 1 27 tells us to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the gentiles praise the lord which is what watch now which is christ in you there wasn't anything big or isn't anything out of the ordinary it's it's christ it's how god manifests himself through you that is the greatest mystery that the world can't understand that jesus christ is living through a bunch of people like you and me amen that fail him just almost every day but if but if if the love of god is in you amen you want to make that you may want to make that uh uh right right away amen you want to repent right away if you fail him amen and so that's what the mystery of god is which is christ in you the hope of glory praise the lord amen the hope that is the hope that we have amen that we are going to get a body change that is the hope that we have that we are going to see the resurrected saints raised amongst us praise the lord amen that is that is the hope that that brings us christ in us the hope of all of all glory amen christ in you the hope of glory something that the world doesn't understand the world is out there artificially trying to obtain eternal life amen they'll never obtain it never that you can't you cannot that you you can't pervert i mean they'll they can try to pervert it but they'll never be able to obtain what's origin from what's from what's original life amen praise the lord now verse 3 colossians chapter 2 verse 3 tells us in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge praise the lord amen you want all wisdom look what look what verse two said being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ all right and then in verse three it says in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge amen where's the wisdom and knowledge hidden it's in christ this is in his word praise the lord and so when we get we get sidetracked and we get derailed amen on other on other things we fail to obtain the treasures of that wisdom of that of of of that and of that knowledge amen because we are sidetracked amen and this ties uh this ties directly with what colossians 1 27 tells us the riches of the glory amen and so all those treasures amen were hid in christ when he was here as the son of man praise the lord he was the fullness of the godhead bodily the fullness of the godhead body dwelled in him amen and now saints that that fullness amen we might have it in impartiality but it's the same elements it's the same is the same ingredients praise the lord jesus we might just have a down payment amen but with the down payment we could still drive the car praise the lord the down payment was we were able to get the car out of the lot amen now it's better for you to go and buy the car pay cash ain't that right brother brother brother brother john oh it's wonderful amen but but you know a lot of people can't pay 30 40 50 000 for a vehicle now that's what a a a a mustang two-door mustang costs now just about amen but for some of us it might be better if we just don't even go look at it save up for it like the way our our grandparents used to do then you can get your mustang but we want it and we want it now and we're going to get in debt for it and no matter what we got to do we want to look good for the person at the red light so they could see us and you're never going to see that person ever again you're only there at the red light for like one minute maybe sometimes less you'll never see that person ever again but i looked good man i tell you what when i when i when i got out out from that thinking it helped me save more money it'll help you save more money and it'll help you think less of you and more about god and making sure your car looks really good and and and that's fine it's good you know to make sure your car looks good pay attention you got to make sure it runs right amen but i mean if you're just trying to show off and trying to just look good for somebody at the red light and you're in debt for it that's not real that's not wise that's not part of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge [Laughter] amen praise god well i don't know if somebody may have needed that but now amen now all those treasures that were in christ now he has deposited these same treasures and you and i amen praise the lord this might be just a down payment but it's part of the same treasure it's part of the same source it's part of the same life and it's enough to make this car move out of the lot amen praise the lord jesus in second corinthians it tells us i love this this scripture in second corinthians chapter four verse six it says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ now watch what verse 7 says but we we have this treasure in earthen vessels amen in earth and vessels not heavenly vessels in earth and vessels amen god decided to put those treasures of christ in your vessel in your vessel amen praise the lord jesus i i i may have mentioned sometimes but you know god did not choose amen a big vase from the ming dynasty or the chinese dynasty or something no he chose some common walmart pots that cost very little amen that may not look like let me rephrase that they may not look like much but cost a lot it cost him this much amen it cost it cost him your his life amen but to people other people that's just a plain old walmart pot amen i just set that outside it'll just get all messed up in a year or so amen not if god has something to do with it amen the world may say well he or she you watch her in about a year she ain't gonna be going to church anymore you watch her in about a year she's gonna stop reading the bible she's gonna she's gonna completely backslide not if god has something to do with it when god does the work and god deposits his his treasures in that vessel amen but we have this treasure in earth and vessels when god is the one that's depositing amen you better believe that he's going to have some interest coming out of that amen praise the lord jesus but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of of you no i think it says maybe of god and not of us amen praise the lord jesus so god deposited his treasures these treasures of wisdom and knowledge amen in you so that he can get the glory amen and not you amen some people may say oh you're just only you you're you're just uh uh uh you're just a know-it-all or you're just trying to be a know-it-all or you think you think you're some sort of professor amen but how it was god that deposited those treasures in me amen and now what god has done makes me want to go to the word and therefore as you're reading the word as brother ryan was talking about on sundays you're reading the word that word is opening up to you even more amen the picture is becoming more and more clear now the cow is not on the tree as you thought it was now it's on the grass amen and what is it eating amen it's eating grass amen and the and everything starts looking uh uh the way it needs to look praise the lord amen verse 4 says and this i say paul's speaking and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words amen so so just as jesus he could not be beguiled and and go contrary and he could not be beguiled like our the first eve was was beguiled amen now i want to point something out here for just a moment saints if eve would have stayed in adam there would have been no opportunity for their there being a a a deception amen if eve would have just stayed fortified in in in adam amen there wouldn't be no opportunity there wouldn't have been no deception amen but eve had to come out praise the lord and and that gave the opportunity for eve to make a decision whether she was going to stay with the word or not amen see if you and i you and i were put here on this earth amen and we were put here with free moral agency amen if we were always in christ jesus if we've never if we were never expressed then of course there wouldn't have been an opportunity for there to be sin from our part amen but god put us in here amen so that we could express him amen but you have to express him through a decision that you have to make and man and the tender the tempter and the enemy will come praise the lord but you have the decision to make am i going to stay with the word or am i going to am i going to be hid behind fortified behind the word of god america's just going to let loose and do whatever amen praise the lord so when eve came out of adam but in adam there would not have been any trouble if she would have just stayed behind fortified behind the word and and so that's why the bible says outside of christ you can do nothing amen outside of christ you are surely going to fall amen that's why jesus said without me you can do nothing praise the lord he is the vine we are the branches and we're connected with him amen then we're going to produce his life praise the lord and philippians 4 13 tells us that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen all things through christ amen all things that that's not all things you know you're not gonna smoke a cigarette amen through christ who strengthens you you're not gonna you're not gonna do the things of the world through christ who strengthens you amen all things that pertain to life and godliness that's what he's talking about amen that that takes you back to that wisdom and the knowledge which which which paul was talking about in verse three praise the lord for though i be absent in the flesh verse 5 yet am i with you in the spirit joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in christ amen hear paul he's he's praising the colossians and he's telling them that you've been steadfast now the word steadfast it means that that which has been made firm amen and or we're in a military sense it's a solid front and then when you got a military and they put a solid front amen i'm just thinking of world war ii and those those times amen they got all the sandbags ready they got everything ready to go it's a solid front amen where the enemy cannot easily penetrate praise the lord but when you're front or when you're so when you're front and where your defenses are weak then the enemy has a place to get in praise the lord when it's not weak when it's got places that it uh that are not covered there are not hidden under the blood they're not covered or eradicated by the blood amen then satan always has a finger to point at you amen don't give them that opportunity amen make sure you have that steadfastness amen the steadfastness of your faith in christ amen now paul here the whole time he's talking about in christ in in in amen because the the title is uh walkie in him amen walk ye in him praise the lord now verse six it says as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him amen i mean no don't walk next to him a lot of people like to walk with christ amen he that you're going to still be in trouble you're going to still be exposed to the elements amen if you think that just coming to church amen it's going to that you're fine with that and no true heartfelt religion in your heart amen there's going to be there's danger in that amen if you're just going through emotions amen there's danger in that amen but if you're walking if you walk ye in him amen that means you're fortified in him that means you're protected in him praise the lord amen not with him not not behind him not in front of him amen like eve got got ahead of the word amen amen not in front of him amen walking in christ it assures us that wherever he goes you go amen wherever he goes you go wherever the word takes you amen that's where you're going to be amen if the word is there then that's where i'm going to be amen praise the lord outside of christ i can't be part of it amen amen when you're fortified in him amen wherever he turns you turn praise the lord sometimes some people are still stuck back here and years pass by amen and they haven't turned that corner and christ is moving i then christ is revealing his word christ is still speaking amen and he and and he's using a five-fold ministry in this hour to speak to us and some of us don't want to turn some of us just want to stay with what happened in 1960 and so on amen that was great that was wonderful amen but it's time to walk where christ is walking amen where he is that's where i would i just won't follow i'll just be right there in him amen amen i read a quote this this past sunday uh to the to the brothers because brother wade he preached in the morning sunday morning and i preached in the afternoon and uh where we dedicated the the the the building there where they're the the basement and and uh but i read a quote to them about the tree of life and and brother branham says uh you being in the tree of life amen and i like that amen when you're in the tree of life and who is the tree of life it's jesus christ amen praise the lord jesus he is the all source of life praise god and him is in him is life amen and so wherever he turns you turn amen you know have you ever met somebody who was drunk maybe you were drunk yourself [Laughter] unfortunately yeah unfortunately i i've experienced that and uh and so i have experience and i can tell you it's not an it's not a good thing but when you're under the influence of something amen i mean it is taking complete control of you you think oh i got this i drink the first beer nothing's happening second beer you start feeling that little buzz third beer oh hot but you think you still i still got this and the third beer by the fourth beard you start already talking and you know that you're talking gibberish but you it's kind of like you like it though it's it's weird and then and then by the fifth sixth and and then and then they add other things in there you know and here here's this mixed drink and then you're on the floor and you're like dragging yourself and people are looking at you and you see that people are looking at you and you're like here drink this coffee i don't even have the strength to hold that coffee you are under the influence amen whatever is in influencing you that's where you're moving amen that's where that's what's controlling you amen that that's what's in you amen that's the reason why amen we need to be hidden in christ amen amen so that he amen it's him and you and you and him amen and then you're completely under his influence amen in order wherever he goes you go hey man if he turns you turn amen if he walks here you you walk there if he walks here you walk there man you want to be wherever that influence is at oh my god let me tell you i'll just be honest with you hey that influence when you're doing it while you're drinking it feels good that's why people go back to do it but then they forget what happens the next day they hate that part throwing up pizza and breadsticks and stuff the next day and trying to hide it from your parents but then i was like i'll go back out with my friends again the following friday and doing the same thing over and over back in the rut but the way it shakes his head it's not a good feeling amen you are under the influence amen but this is an eternal influence amen there's no hangover afterwards amen and you can just go back to it and it's like going back to your first love amen oh lord jesus come take care of uh meet this need and the lord comes in and meets that need for you and and you just fall in love with him once again amen just like the song i keep falling in love with him over and over over and over again amen and there's no hangover no side effects no you don't even need to drink coffee to sober up my they i i they gave me coffee but it didn't help but thank god amen i don't have to be walking in that anymore under that influence amen and there there is no man amen that is under the influence of drugs or alcohol amen you can tell that they're under the influence of something they're not themselves amen and when you're under the influence of christ amen you could tell that they're you're under an influence of christ amen i i know the the saints up in ohio they're listening in amen i could tell that they were under the influence of christ amen something's happened in their life amen amen and can you can you ask that question do people know that you're under the influence of christ amen are they wondering well i'm not sure if they're under the influence or not amen they're under some influence i can see it i see by the way they dress by the way they come to church they're under an influence but it's not christ amen and we you can tell you can tell because the outside manifests what's inside what's influencing you on the inside amen now where were we rooted and built verse 7. so paul says here in verse 6 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him amen how did you receive christ jesus the lord amen did you receive it in a in a in a in a sad way were you sad that you came to christ or were you sad that that that you heard that message that sermon that night and and it caused you to to want to just repent of your sins and and and come to christ was that a sad thing for you or was that something that was just a glorious thing you felt free you felt free even as it was happening amen and so paul is saying here as ye have therefore received christ christ jesus the lord amen so in that same way walk ye in him in other words do not forget your first love amen don't forget where god brought you from and in saints it's so easy for us to do that as we go living day by day day by day we forget the things that god did for for you in me that caused you to come to him and to love him and to love his word and not just that but to love his people and i know that there's people amen that come that come here that they don't they look like they don't even love you but you got to still love them you got to still love him when christ is in you it'll cause you to not just love his word but it will cause you to leave and love his people because his people are part of the word amen praise the lord so walk in him amen walk ye in him verse 7 rooted and built up in him see how it's how paul is saying in him walk in him built up in him amen not on him not over him not under him amen in in him amen and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving abounding amen paul was all about abounding in the word that you receive amen in other words adding on to what you've received abounding amen i mean a house when you're building a house you just don't say you build the foundation and you just say i'm ready to move in no amen you got to abound upon that amen you've got to build upon that you've got to pull that put a roof on it then you can move in amen this house amen that god is building amen god is building a house in each and every one of us amen and so it's got to be word on top of word on top of word on top of word amen it's got to be abounding praise the lord jesus and when you come to a stop amen then then you're not growing there there's something that's happened that has stalled the project you got to see what it is amen you've got to see what it is rooted and built up in him built up in him amen rooted amen and and and what what is a tree that has roots but but it's only about this high it's just a stump but it's got beautiful roots maybe under the ground but it's only a stump it's not worth anything you can't really do anything with that amen but god wants us to be rooted and built up in him amen amen rooted and given fruit praise the lord jesus amen now verse 8 says beware lest any man spoil lead away you through philosophy am i reading that right okay beware lest any man spoil you actually it says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of man after the rudiments of the world and not after christ amen now that word spoil if you look at if you look at that what that word spoil means um back in the pirate days now we use this word very differently today but it's the word booty and then so in the western world they use that word very differently now but what it originally meant was it was what the pirates carried amen when they went to go loot a ship or they went to loot amen the the the loot i'll just i'll just call it the things they stole it was called the booty amen and so paul says here bewareless any man spoil you amen in other words carry you off as spoils praise the lord because let me tell you satan will use man out there to do that to you if you're not careful if you're not rooted like paul said for you to be rooted and built up amen because sometimes when we put too much too much uh uh confidence in in in in a man amen that man can fail you and if you think that a a man that man won't ever say anything that that might be you know he might not be doing it on purpose but if you everything that he says is an amen and you're not paying attention you're not rooted yourself i mean you could be deceived you could be carried off as booty as a spoil and not amen and fail amen be deceived praise the lord see lead a way you through philosophy and vain to see after the tradition of man after the rudiments of the world and not after christ amen like like paul at the beginning when i was saying a true god called man will always point the people to christ amen always amen but when he when he starts pointing to himself or when he starts pointing to the ministry and to look what god has done through us and and all that that's something's not right there amen he's always pointing the people to christ amen so spoil means to carry off booty or to carry off sports to carry one off as a captive and slave amen to lead away from the truth and subject to one's sway and it's so easy in this day and hour because it sounds good and it feels good as he's saying it i just felt all kinds of shivers as he was saying it amen but it's off the word amen it's off the word i remember one time we were at a at a at a uh in in anderson south carolina i'm not going to mention brothers names but there was a brother that came from out west to preach under a tent there and uh man i'll tell you what his people were just shouting and praising god and and that brother was preaching straight up return ministry and in my mind i'm thinking you know something's not right i was just i i had only come into the message that was in 19 that was in 2001 2002 and i had come into the message in 99 so i was young and i had already heard you know about these return ministry doctrines and i'm like something's not right it's like it's like the lord's he checks but i mean everybody else was oh my running across the platform and everything it felt good but it was it was wrong a brother came up to me and tapped me behind the behind on my shoulder and said hey brother come here and uh he said he said understand that uh what they're preaching is not right i said yeah i kind of i kind of feel that the i feel it you know and i've had many opportunities uh different opportunities where we're man i mean it was a sincere man who were trying personally talking to me trying to sway me to go hey listen to such and such a person it's okay that you're still going to church it's okay it's okay that you're listening to brother branham's tapes but uh make sure don't don't neglect from listening to such and such a brother brothers tapes i've had brothers tell me that and i said in my mind i'm thinking listen i just came out of the nomination you can't fool me with that i i did i came out of denomination i mean i've been in all the churches you could think of jehovah's witnesses catholic baptist wesleyan church pentecostals for me to go back to another denomination and i thought i was set free but i'm telling you saints there's denominations in this message big denominations in this message and if you're not rooted in christ you'll easily fall and get deceived by every sway of every man out there and some of them will just like directly will just tell you brother you've got to listen to brother such and such because it happened to me it happened to me so you know sometimes we harp about watch what you listen to be careful what you listen to and some of us get mad about that amen but i've had experience personally to me where if you're not careful what you do listen to you easily sway but just because of the person's influence amen so so we've we've got to be wareless any man's spoiled lead away you through philosophy and vain deceit vain deceit after the tradition of man after the rudiments of the world and not after christ amen now watch watch what paul says here because it's not about what that man or that brother has amen it's about christ for in him who in christ for in christ dwelleth all the fullness all the fullness of the godhead bodily so i don't need the tapes of brother suss and such i don't need that it's all right i'll go online listen to them every now and then that's fine amen but what i need is christ i need the revelation of his word amen maybe that maybe god could use could use that brother to say something to me amen and it'll help me amen it'll lead me to to study that out amen but i can't fully depend on his ministry and think that that's just going to just take me in amen and i'm talking about even a ministry here amen i got to know god for myself i got to study it out for myself praise the lord for in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen praise the lord and watch verse 10 and ye are complete in him amen praise the lord which is the head of all principality and power praise the lord how did jesus race when he raised he said all power is given unto me both heaven and earth amen and so i want to be dwelling in that i want to be in that i want to be a man i'm going to dwell in him because in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bottom amen and so in all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen that's where all the knowledge is stored that's where all the wisdom is stored amen so why do i want to go somewhere else why do i want to look somewhere else amen when it's all in him just as the song says amen it's all in him praise the lord jesus so he as as we were reading there in verse six i believe he says so walking in him now first john 1 7 tells us but if we walk in the light as he is in the light now watch it says he is in the light just pay attention to the way the scripture says things and it all ties in really well but if ye walk in the light amen and when you're walking and man you are walking and you're walking towards a destination amen but if you walk in the light as he is in the light amen we have fellowship one with another amen when you're walking in the word let me just put it plain and simple when you are fellowshipping with god you're going to fellowship with one another right when you are in the word for yourself you're going to want to come to church right but if you walk in the light who is the light jesus christ is the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and it's a conjunction and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth cleanseth amen us from all sin now that doesn't do a way that you don't repent there man you still have to get if you make a mistake amen you will you will repent you will make it right before god you will make it right with the person that you failed amen that's you walking in the light see you're walking in the light because you want to be right right amen you're walking in the light as he is in the light because we know that he's right right we know that he's correct amen we have fellowship one with another amen and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin all all sin amen i should have just capitalized all right oh but i no i i said something yesterday that i shouldn't have said or you know i don't know if he'll do well then it's not going to make you want to come to church then it's going to break fellowship amen it's going to break fellowship with him it's going to break fellowship with the brethren amen but do you want to make it right do you want to be right amen praise the lord that is the question amen now brother brahms says here and we'll finish off with this brother branham says no no creed denomination no pope priest or whatever it is or doctor of divinity no organization no nation no nothing will ever put out the manifestation light of god when the word is spoke as she comes to light is going to do that what it said it would do no creed can stand around it no nothing can stand around it but light itself and those who walk who will walk in it amen those are the ones who will stand that's jesus christ raised us raised from the dead here manifested himself among us and we walk in him amen there is nothing that can stop it brother brown says amen nothing that can stop you amen if you're walking and cry in god if you're walking in the light as he is in the light amen satan satan is uh can't stop you if you stay fortified in him praise the lord jesus so walk ye in him amen the way you the the uh many of us maybe have to come back again to what you know and i say that for myself you know lord restore to me the joy of my salvation amen i don't want to be i don't want to be uh uh starchy and cold amen i love you lord i love you and i love his people i i'll fellowship and i'll do anything for anybody but i don't want to be starchy and cold amen restore to me that joy amen you start thinking lord what was it that was attracting you at that time amen and you didn't have any other distractions you didn't have anything else but amen you don't have to make the excus i got to have some soft music in order for me to pray or and you got to set all these things up in order for you to be able to get in the right atmosphere you know no just go and pray amen just go and do it no i gotta have i got it's gotta it's gotta be a certain way i gotta have my coffee you know as i'm as i'm reading the bible in the morning and it's gotta be this this that and see you're adding to it your own thing and that's the reason why you're not getting anywhere with god just go do what you really want to do you want to go pray just get in that closet and pray amen you don't have to wait to put some deputy keys or something like that i mean that's some instrumental music you know it's like by the way it's really good we were listening to it up up in ohio [Laughter] you can search on youtube da pt keys and it's some really good uh uh instrumental music it'll definitely help you go in to enter in but what if you don't have the phone with you you you're gonna depend on some instrumental music for you to pray just pray amen just pray jesus christ didn't have instrumental music in the wilderness amen just pray you see we get so caught up with with laodicea all around us and we fail to advance the kingdom of god in our lives amen when all those things are only just distractions they're only just distractions amen just it's all about god period everything else is fluff amen everything else is just fluff it it'll help you but it's not the main thing amen so you love the lord i just wanted to talk to you tonight and we're going to keep it short so let's stand to our feet maybe next time we'll be a little bit more long-winded praise the lord amen longer just sing that song i love you lord i love you lord and i lift my voice uh i'm not sure what key to sing in um f let's do it let's do f i love you lord and i lift my voice [Music] to [Music] worship you o my soul rejoice take joy my king in what you hear may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ears oh just worship him tonight he's worthy oh i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice [Music] take joy my king in what you hear may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ears let's sing it to him one more time if you have a need we'll be born and glad to pray [Music] to worship you oh my soul rejoice take joy my king in what you hear [Music] let's sing that song restoring to me the joy of my salvation i forgot the title of um creating me a clean heart yes pop 39 or whatever i believe maybe same key [Music] and renew a right spirit within [Music] oh is that your desire oh god just let them know and renew a right spirit within me oh cast me not away from thy presence o lord take not thy holy spirit from me restore [Music] the joy of thy salvation amen and renewal spirit within me oh let's sing it on to him one more time now created in me a clean heart oh god henry knew a right spirit within me [Music] oh god [Music] cast me now [Music] holy [Music] let me go back to my first love the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away oh cast me not away from thy presence [Music] my holy spirit [Music] the joy of thy salvation and renew a right within me amen is that your desire hallelujah maybe you maybe you don't get in this you won't get in the spirit here amen but you have a place at home that you can the lord meet you there amen but just you take your time you do your your your part and god will do his i don't know of any time where i have tried to enter into the spirit of prayer where god's where god never met me every time that you do and you give forth your full effort he'll always be there to meet you but when this is when if when this is just a routine and you do it out just out of routine or because you have to do it or so that somebody can see that you're doing it or or because uh you know that you can say that you did it but your whole heart was in in it and you're not going to meet god amen there's a difference in prayer and prayering in the spirit amen praise the lord so entering in amen and that's a challenge that i want to give to you all this amen enter in whenever you go amen even praying with your family enter in amen because i mean even if your kids can see that i mean it may not impact them right away but they'll never forget it amen that'll be something that they won't forget amen all hearts mine's clear brother wade come on good job good job hey man good to be back good to be back in the house with lorna uh if if this saturday

for her brother dale if you want to give him gifts that will be just fine so just remember that we'll be talking a little bit more about it just wanted to let you know it's not even 8 30 yet so i'm going to talk to 1509 because y'all going to stand outside and talk to 10 minutes after 9. but just pray just pray okay but just pray that the lord would be with us and uh and help us all we've uh we were talking about that in ohio this weekend there's people starving for the message of the hour you said brother white churches are full full of what i mean really full of ideas full of thoughts but there's only there's going to be a truth and there's going to be people what does the bible tell us that there would not be a famine in the land is there a famine in the land y'all look down at your belly ain't no famine in the land not that way but there's a famine in the land the bible said for hearing what not some of the truth not part of the truth but all the truth you see people falling away i was thinking yesterday lord's let this thing go a long time just to see who's gonna he's gonna let you know whether you'll make it or not right man he knows whether you're gonna make it or not but you see people falling away it's just because they haven't been taught and they don't have a birth and that's brother brown said that was the most ill-taught subject in the message was the new birth so that's why we talk about the new birth so much around here not just anointing not just running and shouting and speaking in tongues but i want what failed sunday i want one fell sunday in that little building downstairs where there's about 12 or 14 of us that place was just full of the love of the lord it was a it was just a presence that that would almost knock you down and we appreciate that because you know what you know what that's because of because they got a zeal they were expecting something they weren't expecting to see us they were expecting to see something from god because we all need help we all do every one of us when you walk out that door you're gonna need help man so we're all we all need help so we need to bind together like brother louise said in love not not not not filial love feel love you can get mad at each other and it's not then no agape love has no feeling it just has love remember brother brown said faith or doubt that's the only thing love is faith or doubt not that in between stuff and in between steps what we working on to get rid of all them feelings and emotions that that we need to have toward him not toward each other as far as being wrong so just keep us in prayer we had a good time this weekend we've been basking in it even until even today but um we love you with the love of the lord thank you for coming like i said we'll get together saturday and uh y'all don't be dragging no chairs that's everywhere what are y'all drag chairs for well we're downstairs and it's informal and i don't mind it doesn't bother me but when you're listening in and you don't have something to see you don't have a video to see you're wondering why is that one person dragging that chair for two hours we told him it was not one man it was a bunch of people coming in you know and pulling their chair out and sitting down it's not one person we don't have one guy just dragging dragging the chair around so uh but they want to see us it's good to see each other and uh and we're just we're just connected and we've we're connected to them and they're they're just wonderful people so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's bow our heads father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray now as we go our separate ways lord that you would sanctify us for this journey that we're on lord it's been a journey the lord has had our ups and downs and as brother luis was talking about lord we just got to go head toward the prize and do and go to your promises and hear what you've got to say and then we connect ourselves to that lord that we'll match that peace together that you saw before the foundation of the world that will come to that lord as brother ryan was talking about that picture there was a picture you saw and it got marred the prophet said it got marred by sin but lord it didn't mar the picture that you kept in your mind because you kept that genesis 1 26 in your mind and it's always going to be there never fails you're going to win and you're going to win through a group of people lord in the end time father just be with us help us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit bless our pastor keep them strong and safe bless each one keep the sickness away from all of us lord the ones that are sick the different ones that we pray for as brother louise said let's just don't make it a list let's make it a uh something that was a heartfelt prayer for that person when we pray lord and we'll get more for you from you lord we pray that you just bless us on a journey home be with us till we come back together as one in you on saturday lord in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed god bless you heavenly father [Music] right [Music] you
