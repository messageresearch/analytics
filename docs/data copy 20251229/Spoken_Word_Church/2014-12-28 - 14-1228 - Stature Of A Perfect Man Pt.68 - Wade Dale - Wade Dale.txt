========================================

one had a wonderful holiday and the Lord was good to you and working now so now we've come to this is the last of the year last Sunday before the new year and all of you know that we're going to be doing the uh Jack your perfect man upstairs for at least for the month of January and maybe on the end of February so we'll see how that goes but just keep me in your prayer now you you all have had 68 sermon backgrounds so I want some amens and some I want that Sleepy's beard off of you no just because hey even teachers have to show up for school all right no you do not not have to come but you do have to not a little louder than the rest of them amen yeah it's not a little bit louder because we started we started this in September I mean in February of 2013. I did not know we started then but we had them of course we took some gaps one time and let other brothers do the second school class but I really enjoyed it but we got 68 here we've come up to brotherly kindness and we kind of we've hit on the Holy Spirit but we're not going to do this until we go upstairs and then when I come back downstairs maybe after I get back from the Philippines we'll start on the Capstone or the headstone but I want everybody to just kind of we're going to do a review today we're going to review it back through and uh take just a minute to expound on something that we've talked about but I want to read the quote so that you can see it so what we started with is we start with the foundation everybody knows faith is the foundation right right it's not that you got to have all these and then get the new birth up here that's not it that's not the new birth that's just Holy Spirit that's nothing new birth right the new birth is justification sanctification and puts you in line for these virtues because these virtues are Godly virtues they're not just virtues that uh you know you have a good temperament some some some guys you could slap them in the face and they would they would say okay that's not a problem and be just as sinful as the day is long now that's not godly Temperance right Godly Temperance is when you he brother Brown said you control your ungodly temper so you fly off the handle at somebody else then that's where the problem is going to be so we've come through this let's stay down here for a minute justification sanitation baptism of the Holy Ghost Faith the Bible says add to your faith so it must be something you have to have you have to acquire this Faith all right when you acquire this Faith then God can add our birth into you virtue knowledge and professions guidance and brotherly kindness and then seal them by the Holy Spirit kind of like what brother Joel and I were talking this morning this is the token the baptismal Holy Ghost is a total right right it didn't just come in the end time that Holy Ghost let the Holy Ghost to seal these virtues in did come in the end times amen right because Martin Luther he could have had some of these but he never could have reached that Capstone he might have some of these virtues but never could have reached a Capstone nobody's reached that Capstone except the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham that we know of now that we can positively say because Jesus had to be the head he was The Headstone he didn't type The Headstone he was The Headstone all right and when he was rejected they took that off but man Through the Ages like brother Jewel and I were talking this morning man Through the Ages got the Holy Ghost right the true coat you're right there's never been a false token it's a trip right Paul true talking Iranians but all these had to have the new birth to have people birthed underneath them right right that's right I mean your leaders got if your leader don't have a new birth you don't have a new birth right because you can only go as high as your leader all right so the leader came in bc4 was born Jesus Christ grew up the Bible says grew in Grace and knowledge but he had these verses in him because he was the Holy Ghost he didn't need the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost right he didn't need kind of an anointing that came on him for his ministry is that right that's right right that was an anointing that came on him on the River Jordan he didn't need the Holy Ghost you and I need the Holy Ghost he didn't need it because he was there all right he was the fullness of the godhead Bible but there was an anointing that came on him that didn't make him a better person didn't make him a better person it put his ministry in place him becoming 30 years old as a priest he had to come to that age to where he could handle the word see he had to type the word out exactly so it comes to the to the River Jordan and the Holy Ghost comes upon him and brother Brown said it was the anointing for his ministry so that's that three and a half year Ministry Now where's the three and a half year Ministry Jesus Christ sure it's in here yeah sure but it culminates right here right because he was ahead all his intelligence he had was the intelligence of God it wasn't the intelligence of man right right okay so he had the intelligence we'll see what did they do when they killed him they cut him off Isaiah 53 he was cut off from his generation he had no children right all right he had no children naturally our spiritual Jesus didn't save a person when he was on earth right right right he didn't save nobody the holy he wants to Holy Ghost he had the Holy Ghost so same way in the end time but you got to watch what you're doing because you can't say well you got to come up here and then get the Holy Spirit now you get the Holy Ghost here because you go you got to grow in Grace and always like he did but he was born right the first time we weren't all right we had to be born again we had to have a rebirth then Peter said Being Born Again being born again with these virtues birth in us being born again right right see how many times have I said that and you just got it I've said that for a year and a half but that's right Hey listen I don't care if it takes 10 years as long as you get it it doesn't matter to me that's why I always heard quote the guy said you know what Jesus is not going to ask you when you go to heaven he's going to ask you how long you why did it take you so long to get saved that's right yeah say enter into the drug lord he knew when he was going to get saved right right you just didn't so we grow up into this then there's an anointing comes that's what we've been talking about we haven't hit that as an anointing but I want to hit it today as an anointing because I want to read something here in just a minute but we get right here watch let's read this quote 320 maybe statute perfect man now in building the virtue of building this Monument building this stature remember it's a stature not a statue all right a statue can't move a stature is a growth development or measurement all right it starts off with a foundation stone which is here now remember too the Head was made the Chief Cornerstone right right all right now here's the headstone he was cut off and rejected there was no man could attain to that that he had right right that's why brother Brown puts the typos the pyramids in Egypt they didn't put the top on it right but remember you take that pyramid as I shorter Brothers you take that pyramid yep and you put it right there there's your Cornerstone same pyramid right right you put the pyramid right in the corner he's the Chief Cornerstone so what what this is is this and it's pure form the true token right right or the fullness of the tokens that come in the end time was this Divine love right here see you received Divine love when you get the new birth there's not a love and then a Divine love if you get the love of God you hit the Divine love of God all right I mean it ain't but you grow though being a free moral agent you decide whether you go in let God in these doors maybe we spoke on doors and doors brother grandma said you let God in your house I said then you got a door right here of self-pride himself this and all that he said the Holy Ghost is a timid individual right only no it's just Timmy he won't just rush in your house to start opening doors right right he's very timid he's a gentleman brother Brown said now if he's saying now God I need you to go in that door he'll be glad to go in that door and take out your ungodly temper or your impatience with people but even a Christian you can say hey God I don't want you to go in that door right there God will say okay yes because I didn't know you would be on this yeah okay okay maybe we'll help each other but you come in here and that's what happens though see God's got this all this is for you it's in the Holy Ghost down here but we must as free moral agents we must let God continue to do these things in our life all right now when we get to right here right here it says all right you get all the we're talking about the purchase but I'm gonna run through this real quick you get all diverges say you got them all working in your life and you're just to a place where God can really use you all right you're just to a place where God can really really use you like you wanted to but now remember if I was saved many times before Paul had all these virtues right ireneas have these virtues Martin brogram said the first three Ages was the perfect age that white Church the real White Church because they have what one dog right they have water baptism around there and all the major doctrines they had right what happened was that man eroded down Through the Ages he wrote in the effects of the word right but the word was always there you can't kill the word right right but you can't hide right you can you can suppress it you could because like I said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he said if you don't want that then I'm not going to give it to you right worm and all that eat it up right eat it all up in in here in these ages now what had to happen brother Brown had to come and give a word of restoration because nobody knew about these virtues surely might have been taught on by Martin Luther but surely surely Martin Luther didn't have a whole lot of godliness sitting in a pub drinking a beer that's right and smoking a piece because what happens is we're going to read it in just a minute power without character is satanic okay we've got the power the powers are Holy Ghost and then we've got a double dose of the power because see we got the Holy Ghost plus the perfect message of the hour we're currently like Elisha Elisha got a double portion of galadia right Elijah comes bring a message well we've got the Holy Ghost plus the message yeah these people only have the Holy Ghost and the message for their day which is partial word right they have part work down through here but when you come right here brother Branham had to be the one to stand and be so close to Jesus Christ where they thought he was okay I mean you look at the man's life okay so he The Headstone did come back in the end time bringing the true token but this right here had to be the ceiling part what sealed it together remember you got a head and a body if you don't have a neck to connect that right everything that goes on in your body goes through your neck that's right everyone everything that goes on in your body go through your neck it's not a head and nothing and in here no it's a complete brother Branson move we're moving breathing instrumentality of God so every the neck had to come to put the two together all right which is the Holy Spirit the anointing and the end time the same message that was on Jesus that come off of him in the Gethsemane right the anointing left him in Gethsemane because he couldn't die before that right he couldn't die with that preaching anointing on him that's what I mean if we ever see that we get that anointing back we can't die that's the anointing that will take us in a Rapture without death it's the same one because remember they wanted to Stone Jesus they backed him up against the cliff they did all these things to try to kill him during that three and a half year Ministry but remember he said he disappeared in the crowd where he walked through walked through the crowd remember he got out of that because he was in that three and a half year Ministry that perfect anointing of the perfect word because out of that three and a half year ministry that's where brother Brown brought his message he didn't bring it from anything different he brought it from that three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ all right so he brought it back to its profession tied the Loose Ends back together and then anointed it power and character right right see he brought power and character but Power without all this character put Martin Luther in a pub drinking a beer and smoking pot you say that satanic that was a satanic demon that made him do that God don't sit in them God knows that in the pub yeah but the part that was coming was that there was going to be a perfect character coming but Martin Luther had to play a part in that but he wasn't a full part of it right right so he could do that he could sit in a pub smoke a pot and drink a beer you know now in this day you can't do that all right because the word has moved on up higher and put us in an age to where I you know I I believe we're here I believe the whole headstone is here but as I've told her before Billy Joel a lot of people in message think they're right here just because they're in the message that's a special place right there that's a special place there's only a few people reach that place that I know what I'm telling you that we know of that scriptural and backed up by the message is William Brown and brother and Jesus Christ out of all the Millions of Christians in this world that's the only two that's a tangle X so that's not an easy place to get to it right yeah you've got to fight your way through it right hang on a minute you gotta fight your way through all this to get here this is not automatic just because you're in this church nobody understand that you start from the foundation and you work your way up just like brother I don't have to do the same thing he had to get born again he had to grow on all these virtues right right hey he had a lot of this right here he wanted to kill him bullets took the gun out if it wasn't for the grace of God he'd have been a murderer try to commit suicide a couple of times but that was in his early part of his of his of his walk with God right yeah he didn't do that 60 61 62 he was back in his early part in the 40s you know when he first was beginning to see God brought him through all these things and give him a gift and give him all the things and he had the power we all have the power we but we must have the character to go along with the power not trying to say that Luther was satanic but what motivated Luther to drink Kabir and smoke a pup a smoke a pipe was a tank so we always say well power without character satanic so that means that church over there is satanic no I don't mean this is Satan's right here this morning's right here he's not anointing people like China he's already got them he's wanting to anoint you to keep you where you can't grow he hates this spot right here because he hates the Lord Jesus right right and you know what Paul we know Jesus we know but who are you right that was power without character was the seven sons of skiva they had power they did not have the character to use it right therefore you see what happened it rolled right back on this do you you have to have Divine love to make the change of the body yes you can't make change by them nobody can but what about are there people who go by the grave better at only at Holy Spirit sure there's people in the grave of that right there brother oh yeah but I know this is the time even he said in the pub but he he learned was to eat damn not the Holy Ghost the word was eat down through there he didn't have the word he baptized Jesus Christ he'd done all that why was I hold it he didn't have the word that we have wasn't like I've always said the word's always been there you can't eat the word down you eat the effects of the one down because it's just like I said many times that you take in this room say this room is the word all right this room is the word now you take hold your hand like this and you all hold it up right there well all I see is brother Jewel but now that don't do away with the word it's still here yeah that's good okay but Martin Luther could only sing right there all this was still word this was the power of God right you can't you can't diminish the power of God all right right now you can grieve the Holy Spirit and all those things but you can't diminish the power of God the power of God's right here it's ever it's never changing so it's right here but we can say okay Martin Luther had this month without John Wesley he had this much I see two people now this one had this much now that doesn't do away with you over here right you're still the word of God but Martin Luther only had a cube of it he had one tube Wesley was a little bit bigger to you then you come into Pentecost had a little bit bigger to you because she ain't gonna brother round okay the fullness of the word 1963 I believe brother random was adopted just like the Lord Jesus went on the top of the mountain and said this is my beloved Son and do my police as well here you him that's my thought right because of the characteristic of what happened his own sunset Mountain those angels came down took him up into that constellation all right but it was not because he was just a prophet it was because of his revelation because Revelation is what positions you revelation of knowledge positions you in knowledge it's not just a knowledge of Revelation brings that knowledge all right Revelation shows you where you're at at any time with God it's what the prophet says you you should know where you're at because one thing for sure if you're a child of God we're gonna read it in just a minute no I'm going to save it for upstairs but we're going to see that God's going to try you and test you if you're a true child God's going to try you and test you right because you know it's not for his benefit right it's for yours what were you going to say no I'm just using it you know because we were talking about coming up through the baptism that really goes remember those jobs that died by death but really when you come to the full adoption they got to wait on us remember this that would not be made perfect right Paul said they ain't without us cannot be made perfect so see I'm sorry excuse me Paul stood right here and said I Illustrated many times in preaching Paul is standing right here and he says they the Old Testament they without us because remember the whole Hebrews 11 is about the Old Testament saint but they without us cannot be made perfect but he became a they when he died right and now we're over here looking all the way down to Adam that they without us yeah and as long as we're still alive we're in us if we die we're obey and then you're waiting on you know just like the saints that have gone on before they're waiting on us because they could not come to control us of adoption or to the fullness of the word they couldn't come to the fullness of the word and they had to see listen because death either death cleanses you here or death cleanses you in the grave one of the two everybody understand that the dying out to yourself cleanses the salt right right the old used Dead all right not divorce your husband got to be dead right okay so it's not that they kill your soul and give you a new one that's that's exchange of soul I don't believe that but I believe it kills the nature that's on that Soul yes the Nature's killed off and then God comes in Burns with the fire and Holy Ghost and then here you are like like get your home brother Graham said God comes down with a holy fire right Burns you out cleanses you and makes you a new creature our creation and that's what the world is going to be and the Millennium it's going to be a new creation but you have to be careful with that because if you're using your types like we talking about there's more you use your kayak though because remember in the Millennium they're still the devil's still there that's right Jesus is on the earth the bribes on the earth 144 000 on the earth Satan's still there yes that's like right now we receive the new birth but Satan's still here what we're looking for is when he burns it with that Holy Fire that kills the demons when we go into the future home see not the Millennium The millennium's Still In Time the Millennium now listen to us to us we're perfect we're made perfect here right right but the world's not made perfect until after the day of judgment the Judgment Day right because you got the Devil he's still there same way for you and I you get the new birth the devil's still there yeah he's still there I don't know if he don't come to your house he comes to mind okay so I get another portion of him every once in a while and I don't like that but we've come to a place where we've got to understand that there's even in the message and we'll do it upstairs break it down a little bit more than we did down here when you say when you say you're typing the justification about the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost the fire god Burns that old nature off of that song and your new creation in God that soul is eternal yes he says Eternal as ever will be that's Eternal can't change that that's the same but what God's got to do then is he's got to work his way back out through memory reason conscious affection and Imagination and you really don't deal with sea taste spill smelling here because only she takes feel smelling here reacts to what's inside you right okay hit a man in the head you can't see no more you know can't hear anymore that's just bodily function but what we got to deal with and brojo this is where we all got to deal with memory reason conscious affection imagination that's right right because if you're born again in your soul it's only one either Faith or doubt not faith and doubt that's right it's either Faith or doubt right you only got one one sense but now that our round that next one has five and that's the Devil's Playground memory is that what bothers you my memories won't bothers me my reasoning against the word right my conscience of what I've done before that's not gonna ever let you forget about them imagination there's no imagination in God right that's right yeah there's no imagination in God and then a faction that's feel your love we have to change that to Agape Love that's right it has to be changed feel your love just gonna make you love your wife or love somebody else's wife yeah I mean honestly you know because it's a lust of the flash of the flag but what we got to do is we got to change that's why I said many times um with Adam with Adam and Eve when when she did what she did and that's what God revealed to me the other day and Matt you know maybe a little slow but you know a lot of these preachers preached that Adam had to place your seed need to save her when he didn't say sex ain't saved nobody no ever come on ever sex is never sex is the problem but anyway but Adam that was not see they're taking filial love right yeah they're taking filial love and swapping it for agape love no the reason that Adam didn't destroy Eve was because of the agape love right took over that feeling of love because remember if your wife would have come to you or tell them another day if your wife would have come to you and say look I've laid down with a beef right now would feel your love what would you do kill her I I you would you touch her really I mean would you would you touch her with filial love no you wouldn't if you're when your wife laid with a beast an animal right but agape love took over agape love took over in Adam because Adam was the son of God and he had the Holy Ghost right right right Agape took over Adam and went past that feel your love and said I can't destroy her because she's a part of me that's right type in Christ in the church but now his sex act didn't save him nobody Adam seed polluted everything yes Abel needed a sacrifice if able seed was so righteous what I believe is truly is that Adam knew he was the son of God hey he controlled everything God just said here you control the Earth I'll control heaven and I'm not gonna bother you I'm Gonna Leave You Alone you know Adam you take care of this world right but when that happened and I've always wondered why didn't God tell him before it happened he's the son of God God had to allow that to happen but he had to take Adam to a place to where Adam was the ruler of the world but now remember Adam was not a savior right there was no attribute of Savior in Adam right that's right he thought they was yeah Adam thought he could go out and get Eve and bring her back and restore her excuse me he just fell right in with her right he fell right in with her trying to go out and get her and bring her back because he remember he was the god of the Earth but he wasn't the god of Glory right there's only one person can say to you and that's the Eternal God man can't say to you from anything Adam included brother random included can't save you from nothing it takes God Almighty to save you and restore you so you know that's what I said about Adam we got to look past feel your love it's got to be the agape love of God that takes over everything because remember brotherly kindness brother Brown said brother does something to you you pray for him right brother you should do something to us we fight him shooting you know whatever but we pray for him okay are you gonna say something no no no no I'm sorry you but God had to set up a tight with Christ in the church sure absolutely had to set up a title but Adam got out there and found out he couldn't come back that's right so he got out there he thought he'd go out there and get him bring her back but then when he found out he couldn't restore her sure he had sex with her obviously because Abel came forth but he brought that to bring another line right to bring another seedling right all right but anyway so here we come up to here let me read this one I want to read that one quote here now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone now that's what we're doing now we're waiting for the headstone we just love for God is love I didn't say we're waiting on it God's waiting on to put it in us when we when we say we're ready for it right we can't have it here and not be and because down here this is not baby this is science yes this is mature men this is this is babies this is how by father crying baby bear Daddy Daddy because you're a baby down here you're not crying daddy daddy up here no no you're not now what does it do they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he has the strength of every one of these things yes sir all right let's go to this one right here foreign unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign so these are sufferings these ain't picnics you got to suffer through this okay this is life lesson you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is the time because see the seven sons of skiba that they were they thought they had power but you see what happened but Power apart from character satanic now you didn't stop there though but Power with character respect to rule you're not a ruler down here remember if you read there in I believe it's Galatians a sun is a son you're born down here your son that's right right yes right right heir of all things but you're under tutors and governors until the time appointed in other words that you can handle them car keys like we were talking about right but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis then he overcome and sat down in his father Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in US when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into the kingdom through much tribulation all right I gotta go hook bro the jewel up too so Lord blessing just uh read the stack the perfect man read black men in his name
