========================================

all right good morning okay second Peter chapter one and we're ready no I'm fine they can hear me from there yeah okay second Peter chapter one we've been talking on the Statue of perfect man this is number 14. uh brother Bob will be speaking here next Sunday and the next but we'll be in Canton Kansas we'll be in Oklahoma next weekend and throw the duck starts the next weekend Lord willing so for the mom to be taken over so what we're talking about for the visitors that are here today we've been talking on the Statue of perfect man and we've really tried to set a real um hard Foundation because the foundation is Faith all right and faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen and that we're going to get into that maybe a little bit today but um everybody so Sam is cheap salmon let's read Simon Peter are serving the possible Jesus Christ to them that have obtained so it's something that you obtain right we're going to do we've already been over this 13 times but for the ones that that have not been here maybe we'll kind of go through this today like we did before to them that have obtained so it's something you got to get it's a gift uh you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so you got to have the Holy Ghost before you even know what to do with the word of God or what to do with these character virtues that we're going to talk about to them that have obtained light precious faith in other words they had to have the same faith as Peter had right right obtained like Precious faith not something different the same with us through now what was it it's through the righteousness what an entrance there's an entrance way been made through the righteousness of your own self and oh it says God did the righteousness of God so we have to look to him for our righteousness not our own right and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his Divine look how many times this word divine comes up in the scripture I love that word divine there's only one divine right and that's God all right there's nothing in this world Divine I don't care if you want to say the Divine whoever no the most Divine one is the Lord Jesus Christ so according as his divine power so him being Divine that's the only thing he can give is divine power all right hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto what two things this is what struck me bro tell when we started this I had to back up and read this again because this is this has nothing to do the statue of a perfect man has nothing to do with your salvation not to get it after we're gonna read this after we're going to see in Ephesians it says after you have received after this but Peter's saying you got to get this divine nature first that's believe in the Lord Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right well then you become into these virtue and all the tempered faces godliness but they are a requirement for Christians to grow in God but you can you know Jonas is a baby Jonas is a Canada he was born into the family of Canada birth into the family in Canada but now if Rachel quits feeding him she just got finished now why she fed him because he needed nutrients to grow up if she quits feeding him or he decides he doesn't want any more to eat he just wants to eat junk food what happened he dies or he's malnourished and that's what a lot of Christians are they're malnourished they're Christians but they're malnourished they don't have these virtues working in their life all right so these things come after they're gifts they come because we're going to read right here because according to his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life because how you live your life and how Godly you are that's what the basis of the Statue of a perfect man is is your life that you live and the godliness that you live in the Life are the lack of all right everybody got that through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue a higher calling all right whereby our given so what is that gifts whereby are given unto us exceeding not just enough to get us by exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises the prophet said you might be partakers of the divine nature of God I'm only one divine nature all right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust period now watch he's starting a point and besides this read that and besides all this from verse 1 to verse 4 and besides this he just walked us right through the New Birth the greatest thing has ever happened in your life right but besides this that's what I mean this has nothing to do with you getting the new birth but after you get the new birth these virtues are what's supposed to bring you up into the full stature of God we read that in Ephesians last week and besides this besides this giving all diligence that doesn't say dilatory that says diligence all right there's a big difference there because we got some people that come to a place and they become dilatory not know again all right and besides this giving all diligence add let me not add to the word of God but but let me read between the lines of the love letter here add to what you believe faith add to what you believe knowledge virtue knowledge add to what you believe because it is it's what you believe you some people can we're going to read it today some people can only believe so far but you got to start with having faith you got to be able to believe something all right and besides just giving all deals add to your faith it's yours not God's anymore it's yours after your faith versus Faith regardless God's brother Thomas brother Thomas charity now I love this scripture for if these things be on you oh it says in because a lot of people can be anointed y'all said I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh people can be anointed that's your power without character you can have power without character and be satanic but you can have power with these characters and brother Brown said that's fit to rule all right so we don't want to have these these power without cat powers without character all right for if these things be in you and here we go again with another another word that says be in you and abound that's heaping up overflowing I like that next part there they make you it puts you so much in tune with God that that these virtues make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ not the knowledge of a man not the knowledge of of mankind here or even the knowledge of just having a knowledge of the message because the knowledge of the message can kill you that's power without character all these people come up with this power of of you know Healing The Sick and casting out devils and with hey Jesus had power you just had power without character right right okay but now look at verse 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind gross darkness and cannot see it far off revelation and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sin see that you said well that's talking about Sinners I'm talking about Sinners that's not about Christian okay yeah you mean growth darkness and be a Christian yeah he preached a trinity and had a new birth there was some Darkness there somewhere and you and I are blinded by a lot of things a lot of people you know we sitting some of you set in trinitarian churches some of you sitting uh maybe something of the message that you came out of two Souls seventh under virtual that's that's gross Darkness but you came out of that because watch this and you cannot see it far off and have forgotten that you were purged from your old sins right wherefore the rather brethren Peter's continuing on wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and elections sure I love this next statement for if you do these things and brothers going to tell us in a few minutes that Paul uh Peter laid out a outline if these things be in the if you do these things ye shall never fall we see up and down Christians and all this stuff you know something's wrong something's wrong in their walk something's wrong and they're godliness it's because they're up and down because this is a promise that if you do these things you will never fall all right so I love that so what we've come down to we'll come down to a place to say well that's really good but where's it going to be well brother Brown says right here he says hey this is Stephen talking remembering uh he's in front of the Sanhedrin and he's going he's walking them through the Bible and he's telling him he said Stephen spoke of Solomon building a temple in the most high don't dwell in temples made with hands for the heaven is my Throne on Earth is my footstool and where is the place of my rash but a body has thou prepared me so it's in a body now it's not in a temple it's not in a shrine a body has now prepared me God dwells in the stature of a man that's not for these six foot tall or seven or you know God takes more in because of this one or you know it's the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting oh how we could stay on that to you would almost suffocate in him from heat notice that God has always at all times reflected himself in man so don't be scared don't be scared that God's Gonna use a man to get something to you because like we read last Sunday Ephesians 4 says it's going to take Apostle prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to perfect you so you're gonna have to listen to them glean what you need from them to go up that statue of a perfect man it's not a one-man message you have to hear all the fivefold ministering to get perfected and that's what it says a stature of a perfect man and many have had questions about why when I got the Holy Ghost I got everything I need um yeah you do but remember you have flus in there and that Spirit around memory reason conscious fashion imagination right right God don't have imagination when God thinks something that happens right we imagine things you know no not see so that that middle round because remember the center realm is either Faith or doubt right you're either born again or not and it starts from that inside of the soul of man right but the outside man the memories and conseffects Imagination that's the spirit realm and that's not born again because how many of us remember what we did in the past right and it host us right we reason our conscience bothers us our affections and you know I was talking to somebody going down the road the other thing was talking about love love is just some word that's love is just a word we throw out there I love this poem do you if you define love oh I love to hunt well I love to fish well I love my wife we've just kind of put it all in the same rainbow yeah the only love that you can find is right here this is the godliness this is the love that you got to find right here this shows love so whatever this is that's what we got to look for not that I love to go to church or I love my pastor I love it no the only way you can love your pastor is to do what it says in the Bible and if he's with the word and the words behind him backing him up then are you really loving the pastor no you're loving the word but of course you can't separate the man from the message but that word love is so loose because that love at the top of the pyramid is not just like I love to go fishing or I love it no that's the epitome or the Apex of love that's where a man that's where a man came a God and came and died for you oh that's love and not just to do that for you he had enough in him to where he could take it and give it to you another man can't do that that's right that's why you know we we see these people saying Jesus died of man and the Holy Ghost left him in the garden and well if he did then he needs the Holy Ghost because it left him he he died when that Spirit left him that was the life that's come back into me and you he's the only one who can say I Lay My Life down and I pick it back up all right uh you and I there's never been another man ever been able to say that I'll lay my life down and I'm gonna pick it right back up right he's the only one so we believe that Jesus Christ is the the Apex of love that is the love of God so we have to see the character of Jesus in our life we look at it in the Bible and we we reflect it and we say okay we have the spirit of God because we reflect what's in the Bible all right so now we see that brother Brown says we notice here he said first we have faith virtue knowledge temper patience godliness or godliness and brotherly love all right brotherly kindness then add love let me read this all over again so be sure to get it now we go through the fifth verse I want brother Brown to read it for you and besides this giving all dealers add to your faith version the verse of knowledge knowledge Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity which is love if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall need to be buried or fruitful and knowledgeable Lord Jesus Christ look what brother Ryan said right after that now Peter is outlining something here for us then how to get there we never knew how to get there all right even Peter writing it in the Bible and it's been in here for almost 2 000 years no land has ever been able to put it together like brother Brown did God did through William Branham show us the chart put everything together and say this is now brother Brown said now Peter's give us an outline now what I'm going to do is and I'm going to bring that outline and I'm going to tell you how for you to get there all right and you got to remember one thing like we went back to the to the statement when you get the Holy Ghost you get everything you need that's true but remember shippers sister Shepard's dream we went through that already but I'm doing it for the for the ones that are here today it's just your shepherd's dream what was coming out of that box trash so he after you're born again you still got trash you still got trash we wouldn't need these virtues if we didn't right we wouldn't need a profit to come and tell us exactly how to go through them if we didn't have trash what it was remember he was pouring the pure water in trash was flowing out but then when he sealed that box with honey in other words all the trash got out he sealed that box with honey which he said that was love or the epitome up there of the Holy Spirit not two different Holy Ghost but two different fillings all right statue of a perfect man brother I'm saying I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge Temperance lives in patients and so forth that don't even profess to be Christians now we're just teaching Sunday school and that's true that some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be a Christian but that doesn't that won't do it it's like a black bird trying to put a peacock feathers in his wings in other words what is he saying he only disgraces himself oh be better to stay a blackbird anybody says when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he's just simply all out of place you know as well as I do you've seen people come in they've they profess Christianity and they've they Mandy just like Daddy said a candle burning at both ends and this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and what three months later they're gone right why they got a part of this they got the anointing of this message they got an anointing on them not in them right they got an anointing on them Judas had an anointing on him to preach the gospel heal the sick cast out devil but remember on the day of Pentecost he didn't make it to Pentecost because if he would have made the Pentecost he would have been okay because he had the word plant in his heart but it was never quickened because he cut it off we believe in predestination right right well we believe that we pray we trigger our predestination by what we do God knew what we would do from the foundation of the world all right but see says he's just simply all out of place it's like a sycamore tree time to manufacture apples it won't it can't do it like a mule trying to manufacture world trying to be a sheep when he's a mule it's going down here well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it first thing you got to do is be born again all right brother Dale's been preaching on that for a while at it uh you know in marriage and divorce about being born again you got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now see you're in the you're in the row you're on the road to get there all right you're not off in the woods somewhere at least you're on the right Highway now see you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again in other words you know the the peacock doesn't have to get up every morning and and and go over the corner and say no I gotta make feathers I got to make feathers I got no he just become a peacock and becoming a peacock automatically that's right makes feathers all right and he's talking about putting a tuxedo suit on a on a pig all right I'm not gonna say anything about that notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so that puts you in the pyramid that big that's why I said you're gonna have a lot of faith that's why it's down at the bottom it's a foundation and you've got to believe in something you absolutely cannot see and has not have not seen in your life before right Jean's got her hand up she knows you gotta believe in something that you've never seen before how many people have seen Jesus Donald Trump it's just hearsay until you get a revelation that's my brother Dale said it's got to be a personal revelation Jesus Christ personally revealed to you that Jesus was an actual person he actually died and he didn't die for nobody else in the world but you what you gotta believe because he died for the whole world the Bible said he died for all but really he only had a certain group in his mind which was his children right he went to die for his children the father went to die for his kids he didn't go to die for the devil's kid he went and died for his own kids all right so you got to realize though and come to a realization that you were born wrong and you need to be born again all right or born from above like brother they almost come about Wednesday night and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith you can't just jump up and say I believe the message well the Bible says the devil believes in one God believe and one God entrembled and he feeds the world of Trinity and laughs at him Satan knows Chad there's only one God he knows who he is he was there with him he knows he's his creator he knows there ain't no three or four running around up there but he comes right down and perverts what God has and he makes three out of it and makes that thing come that's why I come from the pits of Hell Brothers around himself Holy Ghost comfortable bits of hell why come from Satan come from him he's one to come up with that idea you know it proves that the Bible has to be revealed that it's written in a way right that's right that's right well that you know you go back to everybody saying brother Brown was wrong here and doing all these things wrong wrong well Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood now he didn't stay two hours and explain that now what if I walked up here today a lot of people wouldn't know me from anybody walking a crowd and stand up and say You Must Eat My Flesh and drink my blood to be my children to enter into my kingdom now buddy you go away and of course we know who you know the 700 went away real quick right we'll have no part with me if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood he didn't explain it but like I told y'all before when we were doing a communion he let Paul explain and Paul wasn't even there what almighty God Peter was there why didn't Peter explain when Jesus said this is my blood the New Testament in my blood drinking is often as you come together you know and remembers of me this is my body broken for you eat this I didn't Peter Peter didn't have that revelation Paul had to hire Revelation Paul could say I have received of the Lord because he had to he wasn't in the upper room he hadn't received it from God that's right then he talks about why Jesus said eat my black Wing you know what that was a long time for when Jesus said it to when Paul explained it long time so in other words God let him let the people steal over that for a little while and fight about it and just like the message fighting fuss about things brother Brown said but you got to read the level letter you got to read that level then yeah I just got back from California my daughter's a Catholic and they know the message that they just want and they believed that believe that you're either a body of Christ that's correct so they said if you know what they come in and just what I said okay good miss you my son good yeah there you go you have to have a blessing from anybody but you know what people think it's crazy yeah but the Catholics literally believed that that wafer when they place it on your tongue that that's the literal body of Jesus now I I just I ain't got no faith in that right no but you know what they do they have faith in that because if I don't take it like you said the priest probably said well this guy see you know you know he's he's out of here you have to go convention to be able to do that anyway and they're going to let you do that correct now sister Anna grew up Catholic so she knew sister Anna with an eight what I was saying is you know they truly believe that right sure where we should thank God for our relationship that's great because see that they probably live better lives than probably some of us do they probably go to church a lot more than some people did probably so but you know what they have a false faith brother brother Nelly said it Wednesday night brother Brown said false prophets bring false burden so you can birth you can beat birth false how many uh just to be playing you've seen false birth sisters and cows do it they have it looks like they're pregnant they act like they're pregnant but they're not well that's the same way with you and I you might look like you're a Christian act like a Christian but somewhere somewhere something's got to be produced right and when you don't produce something you know that you didn't get pregnant everybody understand what I'm talking about all right same way in Christianity so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of it all for without faith it is impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is now brother I'm quoting scripture here without face impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is what is God and a rewarder of those that there's that word again not dilatory diligent diligently seek him seeing he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it all right because what is sin sin is unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other because remember the five senses outside sea taste feel smelling here that's not that's controlled by the inside that's controlled by the inside you know I mean what you see is either Faith or doubt right with your natural eye too you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can ride okay and you know what you got to do you couldn't get this listen to me you couldn't get this from James I said well James well yeah but Peter was the one to break it down and he had to have these virtues in order for those virtues to work and I made a statement the other night in preaching about um glorified again I took the little I took a little piece from from White brother um Aaron McGarry was preaching out there at the in Wichita a couple weeks ago you see that I glorified again well you got the Holy Ghost down here and then you got the Holy Ghost up here when you've got to start here before you can get that it's the same Holy Ghost but remember brother Brown said that Holy Ghost here is what moles everything together it solidifies your Christian Life and I told him the other night the Chad and it kind of shocked them a little bit but I said man that's all news that's old news Peter already told him two thousand years ago how to do that so it should be old news to us brother Brown come to preach the seal and right on up into the heights of the message he didn't come to preach this That Never Was preached no that was Priest it just was it was just suppressed or moved over into false Doctrine or this was added and that was added brother Brown come to what restore behold I send you a line to the prophet turn the hearts and father to the children the children children to the father what father pray for the fathers right here Paul Peter and all them were standing right here when the Holy Ghost came on them they were at the faith of the fathers they had these things working Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have unto thee now does that happen to you and I people in the book of Acts you walk by and they so believed in that Christian Life that those people were living that they literally were healed by the shadow not even a word spoken those people just what that's virtue that strength coming from those people come on that's what we gotta have where it's Gotta abound so that God can reveal the seals to us and he can reveal the the things of God the Deep things of God why brother Brown preach them if we didn't need them he just need to fill tape up or what no he come to bring a message and his message started in 1963 we know that that had never been preached before life had never shined on that from what he preached from 63 on up but if you don't get 47 to 63 you're not going to understand you got to have that great Foundation of faith to get us back to this park to where we can be a living moving breathing instrumentality of God God told Peter whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth or what did Peter do he loose those virtues in second Peter he stood up and preached a sermon and God said okay now you explained it teach other people how to do it because you can't teach somebody something you don't have that's right you cannot do it you cannot teach somebody something that you have not experienced I mean I've never been in New York I've seen pretty pictures and I I can probably could stand in maybe an hour or two in the city that's about it my sister Johnny lived there it become part of her because she could navigate that place with her eyes closed why she's been there she experienced it for so many years she knows all the ins and outs and that's why God is why do you think God's Gift let us go this long what because he wants us to experience more of him he wants us to not just have faith and say well that's it I got the Holy Ghost no he wants he wants you to be to wear if you walk into a room and a baby sit and uh because see that's what Peter was saying Peter was saying I don't have enough money silver and gold I don't have enough money I I if you're sick if I got some money you know what we living allow to see him we can go down to CVS and get us something for a headache or two things or we can send you to the doctor if you don't have enough money we'll get you some money but you know what Peter said Peter said I ain't got enough money to go take you to a doctor but stretches I have he didn't reach in his back pocket for that he just spoke the word such as I have rise up and walk that's all it was but first it's got to be Faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is what faith is the substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance things hoped for Hebrews 11 see the evidence what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence I like that let's keep on going one more right down here he's talking about speaking the word now Faith does the rest of it Faith does the rest so you must have faith for a foundation all Christianity all you are all that you you'll ever be is based on faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word now look he says first you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it if you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God somewhere you're gonna fall off you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith all right then after you get Faith that's right here faith faith then you're just in position of growing now that's the prophet that's good you're just in position of growing yeah I like that quote I I found out this morning that's why I colored it in yellow actually I was showing brother Tom how to do it and I just left it in y'all but I like red but I put that in yellow for him so he could underline some of his quotes like that or highlight some of this book but then you're just in position oh my you say oh I got the Holy Ghost I got everything brother Brown said you start right here you're just in position to grow what he said you're a baby you're a babbling acts 238 babbling baby makes a little mistake every once in a while you know Jonas We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna I'm not gonna now if y'all fall asleep I may say something but he's a few months old he's late he needs to I'm so you know so does uh Harmony over there but you know what one of you fell asleep she'd be different because what you're grown up I'll expect more from you than I will from a little baby God expects more from a grown-up than he does a little baby everything I see now that you see in development of life even in teenage years God understands those things God knows and that's the growth development you have baby you have baby time in your new birth you have a teenage time and then you birth you have an adult how many and you burn right so it's something that's a growth development you know why that's the only way we can understand it try to understand God any other way can't do it all right let's go Lord bless you see in a couple weeks
