========================================

Jesus my Lord wonderful [Applause] eyes have seen hear them lost recorded in God's word isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful amen [Music] thank you can you help us at our times so I've I figured sometimes we're saying the attack I said just leave Satan alone don't don't complain about him just thank God for what he does for us he bring us through all these Troublesome times so just praise God keep him on your mind keep him on your heart because the enemy is never going to leave us me why are we on this area but God will carry us through amen we're going to read this morning from Saint Mark the fifth chapter verses 21 through 34. so let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for all that you've done for us but for the many blessings brought forth to us because you have made ways that seem impossible Lord if you give us food when we didn't know whoever coming from Lord you brought us through many places and you blessed us you're blessed to have a homes Garden it's just continually Lord we look at the many things that the enemy is doing day by day destroying killing people for no reason but Lord Jesus we still have you to look unto in this day Lord we ask you to bless our hearts bless us strengthen us will let us learn how to love those that don't love us blood teaches us to be at peace with those who would destroy us God you're ever what we have need of and this day we're depending upon you and we ask you for your worries that we're here until you open them up that they become a part of our hearts in our life in Jesus Christ then we pray amen you want to read psalms excuse me Saint Mark 5 21-34 and when Jews were passed over against by the ship the other side much people gathered unto him and he was not unto the sea of one of the rulers and he brought him greatly saying my little daughter lied at the point of death I prayed thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and left he will follow him and called him and that certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years when she had heard of Jesus come in the press behind and touched his government and straight away the Fountain of blood was dried up and she fell in her body that she was healed of the plague and his disciples said unto him thou seeth the multitude darn indeed saith thou who touched me and he looked around about to see her that has done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing that she had done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter would be of faith and may be whole go in peace and be whole of that plague amen God bless you may be seated foreign amen let's sing 380 he touched me amen as our brother gets ready to come out amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the joy that blows my soul something happened and now I know he touched me and made me home since I'm at this blessed savior foreign [Music] [Music] oh he touched me and oh joy that floods my soul oh Lord something happened and now I know [Applause] he touched me oh oh he touched me and oh no the joy that was my soul think about it oh and something it really happened and now I

you for as long as you live if you ever get that Holy Ghost Inside it'll lead you and guide you into all right all truth not just a few all truth and man good to be in the house of the Lord good season every one of you here turn around and Shake somebody's hand say God bless you God bless you brother God bless you Sister bless you um God bless you buddy good to be here good to be in the house with Lord good ahead of each and every one of you here again like I said it's just Home Folks today well Micah Micah's decided it's not home folks but that's okay am I on I'm sorry sister Lily has she's is one of us now so brother Mike is too it's good to have him today with us amen good to have him I'm gonna give you an update here let me get finished with this I'll give you an update on brother Mike I went over there yesterday and uh after work and went to visit him and uh he's got a long road to go and he's 80 years old but that don't mean nothing to God when brother Brown said brother now I'll shake your hand again brother Dowell was in his 90s all kind of problems and issues but we need to pray for him uh he does have a brain bleed they're not concerned with that he was T-boned the lady hit him in his side so that's where the most damage was and his head hit the hit the column didn't have side airbags it's a forward but anyway um he he told me he was still in pretty good spirits he said you know what he said somebody said if you didn't drive a Ford you wouldn't go in the Rapture I said you're not going to be driving that forward no more I promise you that it actually hit so hard it knocked the motor out of it broke the motor away from the transmission that's how that's how hard it hit and uh see that was pretty rough and but anyway so he's got a brain bleed they're not worried about that they had a little cover over his head um he had a strong handshake we held hands for about 20 minutes and and and talked about the Lord and talked about you know things that were going on um he was actually going to a brother in his church had died and he was going to visit the family to set up the arrangements for the funeral and that's when he pulled out in front of the lady and and uh and got hurt so just remember that family too in prayer because brother Mike won't be able to do the do the funeral and uh but he's got a brain bleed and he's got uh they're not cracked ribs they're broke because they punctured his lung because we hit on this side punctured his lung so they've drained the fluid out of his out of his lungs so he's doing better there his arm from here to here is is um well Sister Janet said bad and it was in one of those air casts so you couldn't really see uh what was going on but that's not a concern either he had open heart surgery a year ago almost to the well not to the day but to the month or two and um I guess being 80 you heal slower we know that but when he hit it tore a piece of his aorta now I know you didn't know your medical terms the aorta is that big vessel and even the even at the time if they had him open and on the operating table that they ordered a burst they cannot save him but there's the god there's a blood clot that's keeping it from bursting right now so they're going in tomorrow laparoscopic and they're going to try to repair or put a shunt stent whatever and you'll you stand in that part we keep him stable but he is immobile he can't move he does have all of his wits about him yeah he was still joking yesterday but that's brother Mike sister Janet's okay she had to wear a neck collar she she didn't break anything and the first report was she broke her her big bone in her leg but that was not it just was bruised and so she was up there and she and I and Sister Sarah um I had a conversation outside after we left brother Mike and just keep him in prayer because it's going to be a long road long recovery for our brother but we need to get we need to pray him through this aorta part first that's that's that's the pending thing right now his his arm's not life-threatening he's the doctor said the brain bleed he's had two uh CAT scans and they said it's not getting any worse it's getting better so even within two days it's getting better so they're not worried about the brain bleed so we're not worried about that and the arm will take care of itself later on and so will the ribs but that aorta he's just listen you and I are that far from Death anyway right here today right heart just quit pumping you're gone have a blowout you're gone so by the grace of God we're here by the grace of God he's still here so we're just going to keep him in prayer and just keep holding him up before the Lord so that he'll get better again I told him that we would help all we could in our assembly we would help his assembly any way we could as far as presented preachers are taking care of the church work because you know what church has got to go on we don't want the Shepherd Smith and the Sheep scatter he's got some good sheep over there he's got some good people and I told him we'd help him so we may be later on after he gets out of the hospital I told him we'd meet at home and talk about that if he needed to but he just needs to get better now get that aorta fixed and get out of the hospital and but he's in really good care um there at Augusta University hospital so it's a really good good facility and they've got him in ICU so only a couple people can go see him at a time also I want you this is how God works Mark is his son and Marx has some problems and in life and about two years ago he turned away from the message and and uh hadn't spoken to his daddy in almost two years he was in there today or yesterday because that was my first question I said where's Mark and Sister Sarah said I don't know I said I don't know if he'll come visit him or not well Janet comes out of the ICU and and uh she said oh you can go back there now said Mark's back there I thought well praise God there he was standing beside his daddy the man I've always had a soft spot for him because he's really emotional and I told him I said God's going to take care of your daddy son Pete but God needs to take care of him but that may have been just to drive them back together again we know God works in mysterious ways but I'm telling you we got to believe that God knows best it doesn't matter if we don't think he knows best he knows best he's got this thing already figured out and like I said before the Lord's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get amen but he let brother Mike go down this road for a reason and we know that he'll not forsake Him and he'll I believe he'll bring him out of that amen bring him home and uh and Men quicker than than uh the doctors will ever think he'll men because what Janet said about his arm was that it was really bad but they're not concerned with it right now because of the side that was hit it was really crushed he could he could move his hand just a little bit I asked him I said are you hurting he said only when I cough or Bert he had to take some medicine he was making him burp well that part in his chest was hurting and that's about the only he said other than that he said I'm gonna hurt and of course they probably had him on some pain medicine but just keep him in prayer I needed to go see him he he's he's been a rock for this whole for our family for years and years and years he's he's just a fountain of wisdom and that's what I said going over I said God don't take that away from me don't take that away from your bride we need that man we need his wisdom and we need his comfort he's just a comfort to be around man we all know brother Mike and only for years so let's remember him in prayer special prayer every time you go to your knees you pray for brother Michael Teague amen and we'll hear some good reports brother Aaron will be preaching for us wins tonight remember the Bethel Camp will be coming up pretty quick uh we'll get all that together I think some of them are flying in on Wednesday from Ohio excuse me I got a little tickle in my throat also remember after the second

than I am because I have to write it down so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the word for the Holy Spirit now I pray that the holy spirit will water the word Lord and he'll sink deep in our heart Lord today as we talk about you just for a few moments Lord we've made all the announcements we've sang our songs we took up the offering we've done responsive reading now I pray Lord that all these promises that you have in store for us that you'll just dump them on us today Lord just give us a double portion of your blessing today Father be your brother Mike Lord and we'll just continue to keep him on our heart and everyone here that people all over the world praying for him that'll beat back that devil of sickness that will take care that'll take that room right now and just illuminate it with the angel standing around that bed for Less Soldier that's been laboring for years Lord we pray that you just come now and Lord him and keep the pain away and and the doctors are going to do what they're going to do but Lord you're the Healer you're the one that's going to put that piece back together in his aorta the doctor's going to do the best they can Lauren so I pray Lord that you will guide the doctor's hand to my Lord and the brother Mike will be up and Home in no time father Lord we give you all the praise and honor and the glory in Jesus name amen in the beginning was the word word was with God this is part 65 I think I missed that and I think it's 65. all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth first Thessalonians 4 says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor now this is where we'll talk a little bit more today about the mind I hadn't been able to get off of it I've been thinking a little bit more and we'll get into it as we go you know brother Brown said the right mental attitude 57 times I was reading you we're going to read them this afternoon we'll read them a few of them and I got them run off for you in there the right mental attitude not you're working up not your not your uh getting a gold star for reading your Bible not coming to church every Sunday the right mental attitude toward any promise of God we'll bring it to pass any promise we say well that's for healing no any promise this statue of perfect man is promised to make us into the image of God right now be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of reminders tell them brother Bob you know brother Brown spent all the time telling you that remember you got to take it from here down to here right that's 16 inches between here to here you got to have it drop from mental to here well now in the end time though we've got to take it from here and bring it back up to here because we got to have the mind to Christ we've got to have the renewing of our mind we can't be a double-minded man we can't be a double-minded bride we've got to take what's here now and break it up to here and then what that's where the body change comes you get born again then you start back up here for the body change that every one of you should know how to possess this vessel in sanctification and honor that you be not what conformed but transformed by the renewing of your mind what that you may prove you're proven today amen you're proven today one way or the other where God's right or the devil's right and we know that that was not right you just don't have the right mental attitude what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word just pray for me today I don't know why I got a tickle in my throat but remember now as we were talking about as we went through all this and the summation of everything I've been trying to get you to see Luke 8 verse 45 and brother Carly read it Mark remember somebody touched Jesus's garment and she was made whole so she had the right mental attitude she said if I can get to him if I can just touch His Garment not him pray not him do anything just me touch His Garment then I'll be made whole all right that's how simple it is what we try to do is as we get it up here so much so we this is where we muddle it up listen if you're born again in your soul that's God that's positive that's eternal everybody with me right here this is where the Battleground is not here you've already fought the Bible if you got the new birth now if you don't have any birth then you've still got a battle down here you got a heart battle you need to change your heart but once you get a change of heart and you know you preachers around the messages like I said you got that group over here that says well we got to get them you know we got to get um emotional and it's over here so we don't need the emotion we need the word bring them together always this church has always been balanced bring it together bring it to where we do get emotional every once in a while but as a man brother Bob was talking listen folks let me tell you something this church has no excuse to not go up inside to a perfect man none none why because you got churches that are still preaching to Soul Doctrine you got churches in the message that's still preaching two Lords you got people to message preaching Daniel 70 weeks wrong you got them preaching the Seal's wrong you got all these wrong doctrines God is going yes God will I promise you he'll bring some of them up but not as a body as a church body he can't do that he cannot bring you up that's not your perfect man with false word that's why Peter is the one that starred on the day of Pentecost and then now Peter comes to bring these Faith versions places Garland's brother kindness right because he yeah I'm gonna read your quote here in a few minutes but brother Brown said the apostle apostles were not like us wow the apostles were not like us they would step out preach a sermon and didn't care what anybody thought about him and they walked off I'll read it to you here in just a few minutes amen because remember they had all these virtues they didn't have false Doctrine sure there was Grievous wolf sure there was uh little things that was going on little foxes that were spoiling the vine but there was a true church there and that true church was being built on what the statue of a perfect man they just didn't have the headstone and that's what me and you got to have this right before the headstone can come there's no way you can put a roof on a house unless you got the walls right that's right oh you might want to Place gonna fall it's going to fall it's not going to stay steady brother I'm saying the statue of perfect answer the first thing you got to do is be born again I'm trying to harp on this more and more really don't think you're born again you got to know that you know that you know that that has dropped from a mental attitude down there yeah then let that work its way back up into your mind and that's where the battle is I'll read this scripture man where James says a double-minded man is unstable should I go to church should I not that's the promise of God should I or should I you see where the battle is listen if y'all don't have a battle then I'm just preaching to me and I'm gonna just keep preaching to me till I get okay all right the rest of y'all can just sit there and look at me with a bug eyes if you want to but what's he talking about no you got to become a new creation though you got to be able to when Monday comes you got to be able to what discern discern when the devil talks to you because like brothers always said the devil the devil is not one of these no he's got a nice little sweet voice ah go ahead yeah it's not gonna hurt anything just do it God may be the one that says hi dummy stop I'll read you a quote here this afternoon where brother Branham gave us a formula to get what we need he gave us a formula it starts with knowing the will of God first not your will be talking about selfishness we've got to get away there's no way we can come up this not your perfect man and be selfish you got to be able to give what you got give what you got to me that's the virtue Jesus gave what he had Peter and and whoever it was that and Peter and John at the gate beautiful they gave what they had silver and gold how about none but what I have amen not what I can go read in a quote book come on somebody why do I go to church on Wednesday we ought to try doing that every once in a while cut church on Wednesday and let me just get this little added no they were walking down the road and they were going probably going to Walmart all right let me bring it to now and this guy standing back her and he says I need some money and John Peter's like we're poor but what I have I'm gonna give it to you and what strength virtue went out of him to what give that guy what he had been what listen that guy had been from his youth had had that infirmary from his youth he said silver and gold would have my number such as I have Divine today rise up and walk hey man so now we we're commissioned this is our commission leave the principles of the doctrine of Christ as I said before people can make excuses in different places but listen more is given more is required all right so you've been given more we've been given more so we're required somebody is going to break this chain of death it just might as well be us amenities might as well be me and you it just may as well be right here in this congregation today start you got to start somewhere today is the day of your salvation let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance to dead works and Faith toward God you know I was thinking the other day in my mind we let that thing so overcome us remember I'm going to tell you here in just a few minutes it's all in your head how many times have you fabricated something in your head and it never come to pass about six million this week amen never come to pass it never even turned out the way you thought it would turn out that's your thinking but when God thinks about something that always comes to pass and that's why we have to shift into that mind of God yeah let this come up here let this come up here that's why you gotta be born again here let this come up into what not stinking thinking of the world but the thinking of the mind of Christ but the doctrines of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the Dead we need to not get away from that as far as putting it to the side but we need to build on that we need to build on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone we need to build what build up a house how listen to the word of God listen to the apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for what the perfecting of the Saints they asked brother Ryan one time said brother around we can't get perfect how many times you ever heard somebody tell you that I just can't perfect you ain't perfect yeah well the Bible says you're supposed to be for the perfecting of the Saints me and you for the work of the ministry the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come what to the unity of the faith look and see it's not a Unity at all we're divided even in the message we're divided amen but the world is so divided they don't know what's right they don't know what's wrong I went to get blood the other day and you know what you ought to give blood if you can sorry you're helping human beings Jim's like a galleon zillionaire she's given so many gallons of blood there's more of her in that building than they are sitting here today they love her buddy they get the pump out when she comes in though you know it's like fill her up or take it away from her anyway so I went and gave blood and they asked me the first question at Birth are you a male or female hold on a minute I'm not done the next question is do you still still consider yourself and you had to check one of the two now that you're in other words you're older do you consider yourself still a male in other words help me Lord and I told that lady said now I think it was Yolanda who was sitting there and I said she said you have to answer the question so I answered the question so now listen they should be no more gender reveal parties because the world says we're supposed to wait till they're five or six and let them decide if they're a boy or a girl so why do you need to shoot something and make pink go off when that girl wants to be a boy do you see how Sodom and Gomorrah wasn't this bad you know why Sodom and Gomorrah didn't have internet and didn't have all these sites and nights and websites and all that other kind of stuff but you and I if this promises we got to come to the unity of faith we will do that under the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ look that we henceforth be no more children be no more babies toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men what preachers and cunning crafting that's where violated lion weight to deceive but look speaking the truth in love May grow up now the truth in love is the correct Doctrine May grow up in Him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body now you and I are the body not your natural body but your body the body of Christ fitly joined together and compacted like I said before you better make sure you get it compacted because the devil will absolutely stick his nasty finger wherever you gotta crack amen but it's promised that we're going to be compacted as promised it in this age you know a long time ago when they couldn't fly rocket up into the atmosphere you know they just got in an airplane an airplane as I explained to you a long time ago about the speed of sound when you get that whatever his name was Chuck Yeager he would get almost to the speed of sound or the other people and they would stop because everything starts shaking they thought it's gonna explode but what did Chuck Yeager do he said I don't know what I did I just pushed it on forward and went further when you broke when you break that sound barrier it's just like cool water he said it just straightened well that's what me and you push it I'm telling you today push it yeah push it to its limit because listen God Has No Limit well I don't know it may shake me shake me shake me but look take that stick and push it forward take that stick and push it up to start to a perfect man listen the right mental attitude you gotta ask God for virtue God let me take what I got teach me how to use it and that's why he gave us Apostles prophets Pastor teaching in advance to what to teach us how to do it to teach us how to become listen Paul never in his life everybody with me it's hot in here never and y'all gonna start falling asleep Aaron if you don't come come please come up here and check this thing out turn it on I know we're in between seasons it's cold outside and it's warm in here and then when you balance it out the air conditioner never comes on because it's cool out there but we need some air conditioning right now but we need the mind of Christ we don't need to what be conformed to the world so listen when we start up this statue of perfect man we've got to be totally contrary to our whole life our whole General Life we've got to be totally contrary totally contrary to everything you have grown up in your life whether you're 80 or eight amen everybody with me because you got to take up his cross we do each one of us it's an individual affair with God it's not the preacher and you it's not your wife and you it's you and God Amen mama don't go won't hinder me sister don't go won't hinder me that's our problem like I said before and where do we fabricate that right here we fabricate it right here in our brain I'm going to find that quote somebody said I'll find it somewhere and I know brother if I do say well brother Joe's up here usually when I say something he's up and he goes well here's what he said but there was somebody a doctor or somebody a psychologist said you'd spend 90 percent of your time worrying about stuff or about like Donnie what Donnie thinks of me and what this one thinks of me when they spend two percent worrying about you you spent 19 he's not worried about what everybody else thinks about you and they're not worrying about you no they got their own problems to worry about I'll find out though I Die daily Paul said but Paul never let me get back to Paul never heard about a seal Paul died before John went to Patmos he 'll see a one CO2 seal three he really never heard of the church ages everybody with me that he probably had some he knew he had something to do with Ephesians because he knew he was their messenger or the prophet I'm pretty sure he knew he was a prophet when he was pending all this thing but what he was doing he was pinning the seals so me and you can read them he never mentioned them but he said we need to know the Deep things of God we need to in other words we need to grow up we need to do this we need to do that you know Paul was a wonderful man but he died way before even John came on and then the then the the church age messenger started coming after that but we all look back brother Brown said what do we do we look back to Paul the pattern messenger so what he did we pattern after that he built churches he what'd he do he helped them grow spent some time got a brother established and he went to stop he didn't just say well bless God just do the best you can and he takes off no Paul was patient he would get him established in Ephesus he'd go to Corinth he may have spent a little more time in Corinth than he did anywhere else but they were Corinthians the book of Corrections so the Corinthians they had all these kind of like us had all these sayings and doctrines and all these different issues and Paul what'd you do he stayed there with him and he got a bride out of them because remember he listed all that whole stuff that we used to be Yes Man wasn't good people he said what's such for some of you but you're washed you're Sanctified in other words with the blood of Jesus Christ and Paul stood up one day and said now you're going to be judged by what I say you're gonna be judged by my gospel folks you're going to be judged by the gospels priests here yes yes you're not going to be judged by the gospel priests and Happy Valley or anywhere else you want to say right here this is where you're going to be judged by you're not even going to be judged by what said in Jeffersonville come on for so it is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence that's what I want to do put to silence the ignorance of foolish men you said bro wait that's kind of hard can we read that one more time I didn't I didn't say that Peter did the one that says you got to have patience the one that said you got to have all these virtues said for so is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men he was running a church brother I'm saying now we got to come to full Doctrine I like good shout meetings so do we we like that but now bubble dancing and all that stuff but when what and in other words when Monday happens when the rubber meets the road when you're out there by yourself and you can't get to a preacher you can't get to you know somebody that you what pull virtue from you got to start having it yourself you don't know where you're standing we must know as a church where we're standing hey man let's get back and find out find out what's making us do that that's what we're doing today let's find out what's making us be still here 60 something years after the prophet said the Rapture is overdue 60 years the rapture's overdue what's the problem look in the mirror no it's brother Brown's fault well no I don't think so no it's your fault now look brother Ryan said all right look but when it comes to The Showdown that's what we're coming to folks I'm telling you just like I said before God is going to make you make a decision one way or the other you've got to make a choice one way or the other before you pass away before you take your last breath are we going to fall in the body change you're going to have to make a choice one way or the other that's right but when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch you know I'm talking about Battleship cruise ship you know on a cruise ship when we want to cruise I mean June it was just so nice and everybody was so nice and the guys would you know bring us like nice Linens and and there was no enemies on that boat I mean we just had a good time when you get on a battleship everybody on that ship including the cook knows how to fire a rifle including the cup and it including the janitor and including the maintenance man he knows how to fight amen and when you know what when it said all hands on deck it meant all hands on deck there would be thousands of them like ants that run up there on the on the deck and start fighting because it's the battle it wasn't a cruise ship it was a battleship you either get killed or killed one of the two we've all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word to see if you'll belong to who tries you by the word look at job that was job job was a righteous man good man did everything right look what happened to him but in the very end we're still talking about job is God still talking about you you think about that is God still talking about you he still we're still talking about Joe cause you're renting Epistles they're gonna ask you I promise you when we get over there they're gonna say what age did you come from they said well we're not allowed to sin they said come on sit down and tell me because the Bible I read said yo that was the nastiest age there ever was right see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes how many times I showed there's gonna be a showdown folks you're either gonna be ready for it though but now what if you took the battleship and the cruise ship and switched all the crew people the cruise ship over here their crew goes over here and gets in the battleship what they're going to do I just know how to put knives and forks on the table and he's over here said well I didn't I'm not equipped how can I fight with it but you know what then they're trying to fight they still gonna take that fight over there in that cruise ship and if they have to use knives and force they'll kill you with them same way with the devil brother Brown said if you ain't if you don't have no teeth in your head say gum him to death chew on him don't let that guy have any upper hand coach where is it at not here if you're born again it's right here right here's where we're losing it in the mind memory reason conscious affection imagination that's all in your head I thank God we're still going to have memory we're definitely still gonna have memory when we get there right but it's not going to be a memory of the bad it's going to be memory of the good it's not going to be a memory that hey like brother Mike I was thinking about that I said you know when we get over on the other side he's not even going to have opinion in his body Danny where you at buddy no you must scar that's what God will do that's the power of God they'll take your body change it take all the scars out of it put everything back if you had your Penance took out they put the pendants back in all that it's a change of the body everybody with me and man so you ought to be happy this is just light affliction if you ask Michael T today what here's your problem he said oh this is just light affliction because what is his attitude and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he is an illegitimate child and not and Son and Daughter of God certainly not you know I think you know today you got Paul Paul's preaching away and he's preaching and and he's uh he's he's he's telling the people about the resurrection and then all of a sudden who is at Phillips and hymenius they go off and start preaching his doctrine that the resurrection had already come well you know he didn't mind rebuking him from the pulpit hello somebody he said Simon the coppersmith has caused me all kind of problems the seven sons of skiva they're against me yes Demas has forsaken me and that's in the Bible but the spiritually mind it catches the word lines up with it and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person you know you would be a you would be a celebrity if you said this alien came down Jonas Jonas said this alien came down and took me up in a ship he had like one eye he's green but he spoke English he'd be a celebrity but tell somebody that you had what and take you somewhere in your soul take you into another dimension and change your mind and make your attitude different you're not gonna be on the front page of the paper you're going to be in the back part with it put the nuts I was abducted by an alien didn't the Bible say we're aliens ah we're alienated we're aliens of this world when you get the new birth God comes down and burns out the old you the old world and it makes you a new Creator a new creature a new creation look it's a paradox remember we talked about the three Hebrew children we'll continue through that but remember every time you go through a trouble or a trial remember it's to loose you because the heavenly father is not going to ever bind you he's going to lose you so everything you go through and that's sometimes what a man has to do come out make his stand get the thing out he's talking about somebody drowning and get him out of the thing so he can get the thing out of him we got to get out of our stinking thinking we got to get out of our I can't make it I'm gonna read you this afternoon where brother Brown talks about the right mental attitude he said you've got to believe what you believe you gotta literally believe what you're thinking because sometimes we don't believe what we're thinking everybody with me why if it's of God it's got to be positive now there's a perfect way in a permissive way and I feel it's a God here on the platform can show me things that's been in my rooms and so forth it's talking about private interview he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up another I me I selfish me then he won't put his hand on it as long as I'm doing it and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself you know what the Bible says the Bible says if somebody speaks against you if you don't speak against them what does it do it Heats colds of fire on top of them it Heats it all back to them but now here we want to do we want to know we want to give them a piece of our what piece of our what oh it's all in the mind if you give them a piece of your soul you want to give them the Holy Ghost now we want to give him a piece of our mind when the guy cuts us off and body sometimes if back in the world you get that one finger wave why because you know what that's what was motivated in you though and I have an issue with that not shooting birds but I have an issue with people you know not driving right so I got another issue that I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do and I'm going to tell you right now the Lord has corrected me on one thing besides the other 700 this is one so 6.99 I'm not telling you about this one I'm going to somebody helps us to touch you now there you go you know how many times have I told y'all I like one kind of cat it's well known a dead one I don't like cats I never have like cats brother Brown even says they carry Spirits okay but I think I'm gonna go get me a cab I ain't even told you in that but the Lord listen to y'all think it's funny the Lord has convicted me on that you know what brother Brown stood up one day and he called them Ricky's and rickettas and all these different things and brother Branham said God took me behind the Woodshed in other words and told me he said you stopped that he said those are my people well God said you stopped that the other day he said that's my creature he said that's a part of my economy that's a part of my nature so I'm probably gonna go get a cat what programs they do if you don't like something do the vice versa you know what he said if you want to quit stealing I mean quit um being selfish start giving stuff away Micah you didn't know I was gonna preach on cats today did you the greatest weapon look y'all don't understand what I just said that's freedom that's Freedom just to change my attitude toward one item it wasn't seals and plagues and vowels it was a kitty cat funny I looked at him as just let's run over that but not anymore oh and y'all don't have nothing y'all just said wow we need to pray for brother away my Lord him and his cat thing well guess what come up here and tell me what yours is are you too embarrassed huh are you too embarrassed but you know what it's Freedom now you know what that did that bound me you say oh no yes it does because it bothered me and God brought it to my attention none of y'all did because you knew how I felt about it but God said hey that's my that's my that's no words that's my animal that's my nature I created that I had a guy tell me the other day we were we're uh we were he works in the Gainesville post office but he lives on my postal route and I told him I said look I said um I've seen so many squirrels have y'all not seen so many squirrels squirrels on top of squirrels people don't go squirrel hunting anymore so they squirrels everywhere there's one curve down on my route I call it squirrel curve that's probably 50 of them in there and he said well I just he said I don't try to dodge him I run over them I try to dodge them I'll wreck that vehicle before I hit a pearl squirrel my attitude versus his he said I just try to run over him with his male Jeep you know I said well I don't try to run over them I said I try not to hit them but you see that the right mental attitude though you say that don't mean nothing to me well something we may mean to you what I just said something you're working with or something you're dealing with just give it to God and look do the vice versa yeah yeah do the opposite boy that's a lot of Revelation well that's what the prophet said look it's a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it what's your problem we try to take care of it how many years I've tried to save our kids let us all have a confessional today okay you can't do it turn them over to God you know best you know how to get them here you got me here right you got me here and the monk I was in you got me here bring them here amen so an Army first getting ready for a battle first thing got to be a select some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting they got to be trained for fightings what we've been talking about a few minutes ago and I believe it's the greatest battle that was ever fought it's now ready is now ready to go into action now not 1960 what two no they fought a different battle than me and you 1962 they fought a different battle than me and you fight they're fighting just to stay alive in in the Christian realm you and I are fighting for a body change you and I are fighting fighting for going up the stats of perfect man bringing Jesus Christ back to the Earth and me and you that's what we're fighting for amen because that's our mandate the greatest battle ever fall is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start when we know where that's at right by the by the title of the sermon the greatest battle ever fought there has to be a place selected there's a mutual ground in no man's land and they fight at that place they just don't one fight over here and one over here and one run over here there's a battle front where they meet and test their powers where each Army tested strength against the other a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when the great battle started on earth now remember he's talking about the battle that started in heaven there was a battle of Heaven first Michael and his angels against the devil and his angels Satan was cast down here and now brother Brown said now the battle's down here that's why I said before Redemption didn't happen in heaven it was formulated in heaven in the mind of God but Redemption happens on the earth because something's got to fall that's right all right and we fell so we got to what be redeemed back there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battleground begins in the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was beginning that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head that's right that's what we'll talk about this afternoon though when you get the right mental attitude and you look at what brother Brown did the the thing he went through to get to the will of God you'll understand maybe a little bit more they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization could never never do the work of God let me put in their false Doctrine can never do it false Doctrine cannot do it God is not in false Doctrine don't like it and never did he formulate false Doctrine where did false Doctrine come from it didn't come from the listen to me it didn't come from the Holy Ghost in their heart because the Holy Ghost can't be wrong where'd it come from right here he came from your mind any Doctrine against the word of God was formulated in some man's mind so I said before if you're witnessing to somebody they said oh oh y'all just like y'all live in the Old Testament we're living in the New Testament that's a bunch of baloney but we live in both but all you gotta do is say look if you got a girl sitting there with a pair of pants on and cutting her hair say who told you you could do that who told you you can wait it was all right for you to wear a pants some man had tea because the Bible didn't that's right at least our sisters are trying to live by the Bible and we can go back to the old our new testament either one and say we're trying to live what the Bible says not what some man says because remember everything that's false is in your head it's all in your head right I mean how many times have people told you that you get to stay in your pain you get to sell you get this problem get this thing holy man it's all in your head that's where it starts Eve let Satan into her mind first and she began to what think contrary to the word of God one word not a whole list the problem was is she started preaching hello somebody boy it gets quiet when you're talking about women preachers it started with her preaching to start what she should have done she said look I'm the weaker vessel let me go get Adam you know what happened to that Beast he went to the far end of the garden hey man he wasn't going to challenge Adam but he challenged Eve because of her as we were explaining last Sunday and I hope you all enjoyed that I enjoyed answering those questions last Sunday I've got some good comments off of it and I hope I've answered the question that you asked right because a woman is a weaker vessel that's just I'm sorry that's just the way it is all right but a holy ghost woman can teach you something she just can't do it from back here all right but we know that I don't have to preach on women preachers my Heavens but that's where it all got started women preachers she preached the sermon it was wrong that's my brother around said God had to what now take a double Covenant the man had to be above the woman she couldn't teach or preach the Earthship Authority in the church the man was the head all right listen when we try to urge up authority over Christ which is our head what happens to us we come out from under the will of God and we're standing out there like Eve naked and alone and here comes the Beast I'll teach you something you've never heard before boy I did I have heard some things I've never heard before I didn't want to hear them again either Aaron right amen well let's don't be selfish you think I'm trying to doing this over and over again but a selfish attitude will hurt you it will not it will not in Christianity being selfish is not a part of you shouldn't be a part of you this know also that the last days look last days all right we're in the last days are we not we're in more of the last days and even Timothy writing this in second Timothy 3 verse 1. perilous time shall come for men shall be what lovers of their own self what caused perilous times there were lovers of their own self all right Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents Unfaithful Unholy do you know what's going to happen when the squeeze comes and if y'all been reading in the paper how that Biden is trying to change the currency oh yeah you know I come out with that Bitcoin thing at one time you know but they're coming out with a thing now this is Chip and they can cut your income off or they can add your income here hmm there'll be a mark brother Brown said you won't be able to buy or sell I wondered how that could happen when I had cash if you put up cash because cash is King not when not when it's not backed anymore when it's not backed anymore you come over here and you have to do what the Federal Reserve says and the Federal Reserve says we're not taking ten dollar bills to twenty dollar bills you got to take what we give you and go to Walmart go to the grocery store it's like I told that brother that was um he was buying gold bars and one ounce of gold is like what now 1600 something like that I said you got one gold bar I said what you're going to do you're gonna pull up to the gas station and take your knife out and shave off twenty dollars worth of gold no that guy's gonna see that and he's going to say your gallon of gas is 1355 dollars and you're gonna have to give me my whole bar you're not gonna be able to buy a piece off and hand it to him see what I mean about silly people trying to make it I'm just sorry for that brother because you know what he was doing all that stuff for too in case he didn't make a Rapture he can make it to the tribulation boy I don't even want to have anything to do with making it through the tribulation amen I want to get out of here On Eagle's Wings not worry about it building a bunker you see the other day where those rich people are taking those old silos that's got the rockets in them and they're building layers and they're buying layers like millions of dollars a piece and that's to make it through a holocaust or make it through a uh you know disaster give me some Eagle wings [Applause] see that and there's no gold that's going to save you but he will save those that what get in the word of God get established don't be tossed to brother Brown said listen you'll take the mark of the beast and you won't even know it isn't that correct that what he said he said you'll take the mark and you won't even know it you'll be in that system and you'll not know it till you get in wow see that's your foolish virgin anybody with me I don't know why I'm saying this today but you know what a little bit of life lessons don't hurt anybody so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God you know when we talk about in our mind we we do as human beings do unto others as you have them do unto you don't work oh I I'm sorry I'm sorry today is me it don't work for me but that's where my war is I know to go I know to do good didn't Paul say that the things I would not I do Paul wasn't lost during that whole conversation it looks like he was lost and he was saved he was lost and he was safe now he was a prophet writing the Bible he said the things I would not I do the things I do not I would there's a warring in my members not here here yes which one I'll let win chief white dog black dog let's don't be selfish because you know what when we get in the Statue of perfect man that takes all the selfishness completely out of the picture completely out of the picture why did ananas and Sapphire have to die because they were selfish they did not want to give everything they had to those disciples they wanted to hold back a little bit for themselves is that all right brother Brown said that will continue and be in the end time there'll be anodized and Sapphire Spirit come among the church what you're not giving your all and I see it happening now you can't give your half you can't give your third they probably just kept backing up they probably thought they're not going to miss this and they're not going to miss it and he got his wife involved and got them both killed and Paul said Peter said you didn't lie to me amen you lied to the Holy Ghost so they were in trouble with the Holy Ghost not with Peter Peter probably in his in his Humanity didn't want to do what he did in his Humanity he didn't want to put the curse on them but you got to think in your mind see there he had to have a mind transformation that it wasn't him they were dealing with it was the Holy Ghost they were lying to not to Peter you can tell you know you can tell me a lie and we can deal with it but don't lie to God do not lie to God because you know what he already knows what you what you did before you started lying to our own selfish beings our own ambition that we could completely surrender ourselves and be yoked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yoked with the Fetters of love we are prisoners my feet are so yoked to Christ it won't dance my eyes are so yoked to Christ amen come on somebody tell life when I see these modern striptease on the street it turns my head my heart is so yoked and loved to him till I can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yoked to him till I don't even know what my ambitions are just Wherever You Lead I'll follow Lord I will be a prisoner Paul a prisoner of Christ and everybody knows this quote we have to suffer the rain you think about your life all right just think about your life for a minute and the things you've had to give up since you're as a Christian now think about the things you gave up before you were a Christian you hated to give up stuff come on somebody say Amen you hated to give it up you just up but when you become a child of God a prisoner to God a prisoner to what the heart it was easy for me to give up drinking smoking cursing you see now you say well wait a minute bro wait it wasn't easy for me yeah but look at you saying here today folks listen you can't put your battles on me and meme on you and say well you need to work it this way different to everybody nobody with me yeah man all right could you what's the worst thing to do is is you know you work on a situation and and not just your wife and Jim doesn't do this but you know if you're working on a situation and and your wife walks up and says well my dad wouldn't have handled it that way well you talk about righteous indignation because that Daddy didn't know what we're going through everybody with me we're all different individuals and we're yoked together so we need to work together I'm telling this for a life lesson for all you need to work together hey ma'am listen put the blame on the devil don't put the blame on your spouse put it on the Devil he's the one that started it he's the author of it but you know what God May allowed it for something to happen to what to break your Fetters yeah to make you start loving cats when you didn't like him at all I'm serious with that though I'm not trying to play I'm serious and you all know that I really I hate a cat I just couldn't stand to look at him but now I'm probably gonna get one June didn't know this she didn't have a clue because I didn't want to discuss it with her because I knew what happened the devil would get involved foreign character building you shouldn't hate the creatures of God now wait a minute when we start talking about rats roaches [Music] um Rebecca snakes she called me one day and I thought she had just absolutely fell out of an airplane I heard the scream wow since Rebecca white was right after Gary had passed away and I said oh she has done jumped off the dropped off the trailer he was a snake in her bathtub it was a rattlesnake too it was about that long but it was it wasn't big enough to get over the thing if it would have it had gotten her house but she would you know how that high voice settle down what's going on then she finally said snake I said okay I'll be there in a minute well I thought it was outside she said come in I thought we're in trouble now let's go back to that back room and he's got she got a garden tub you know this big I get you call it a garden tub like a Jacuzzi type Cub tub thank goodness it wasn't shallow but we took care of that snake I didn't turn him loose outside she wouldn't let me she said I want that thing out of here in pieces I do not want them connected together when he leaves this place and I say Amen but now uh you see what I mean foreign he would shoot animals for people because he was a good Hunter you know what God gave him a gift let me tell you A Life Lesson here from a prophet right he would shoot animals for people now see that's against the law now there are certain States I want to make it right there are certain States and we'll finish right here I'll pick this up this afternoon we're not even close to memories and conscious affection but there are certain states that you can buy they call a group tag where you buy one tag for a bear and four people can go and whoever gets to Bear first they can use that tag that's not where he was hunting at though and he would go out and shoot animals for him and they would put their tag on you know what God said stop it hello somebody he didn't get caught by the game warden God called him and said you stopped that don't do that no more why because you bring a reproach what if it had got called everybody with me what if he hadn't got caught by the game warden boy oh boy a prophet getting caught by the game ward no he got caught by God hey man you have to suffer the rain the reason is this character simply is never made without suffering characters of Victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign what is rain rule over because power apart from character is what we were just talking about anything outside of the power God is of Satan there's only two Powers that's right God's power and Satan's power there's only two and remember His is all-knowing all doing all Eternal Satan's is permitted right and then she wants to share even his throne well in other words if you have character you it's fit to rule what what are you gonna rule over first rule over there first Lord all right but if you rule and what it told us in the Book of Revelations three about verse 20 something it says we will what sit in his throne and reign with him in his throne as he overcame and sat with his father in his throne not on in not on in all right and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down on his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him overcome what brother random yourself well the devil just bothers me you let him black didn't go over good you let him because I'ma read to you in just this afternoon where brother around says the right mental attitude your mental attitude not your revelation not your how many times you prayed with your right mental attitude toward any promise of God he'll have to make it come to pass wow let's read this book real quick and then we'll close I'm talking about gifts of God but these gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever look it's not accepted by God he went through all the Pentecostals and they were up shouting and speaking in tongues jumping up um you see on the um on the screen the other day he was speaking and somebody spoke in tongues and interpreted it wasn't two sentences later somebody jumped up and spoke in tongues and interpreted he he was gracious to stop but remember he goes over and says all right Brown Tabernacles that's gonna be kids anymore you take these tongues and gifts and you put them in the back room you do that before the service starts don't do it while the service is going on remember all right but it's not accepted by God this has to be first and when you have faith virtual knowledge temperations Godless brotherly kindness brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam listen there was no denying that's why Adam couldn't destroy Eve as we said Sunday Eve didn't sell us out folks Adam sold us out but he was she was so much him she said if if she's still gonna die I Gotta Die you know what Christ said he took our judgment he said she's going to die I'm going to die for him but see he could come back and be the Redeemer Adam could not Adam could have love for his wife and and shelter and say God you gotta take me didn't know what he did with Moses and now what he did with different ones God you got to tell you not I believe that's what brother Brown did he didn't do it on him on a tape but I believe brother Brown would get along with God and he said God said look I'm gonna wipe in Pentecostals off to their their no good they've stopped loving me I'm gonna wipe them off I believe brother said Lord if you take them you got to take me coach he had the same attitude if you take them you got to take me Paul stood up with those Corinthians he said y'all are whoremongers your man remember that whole list of things in Corinthians y'all were all these things and search for some of you but you're washed in other words God didn't give up on you your church age Master didn't give up on you and God's not giving up going to give up on you your pastor's not gonna give up on you amen here's the things you can have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them you've got they've got to be what God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion listen to me imitation only causes confusion right we know this is a requirement magicians come this is a requirement if you're going to sit in this building today it's your requirement to live by the word of God it's my requirement to live by the word of God every word that proceedeth thousand miles of God Amen and we fall and we fail but guess what there's a provision there when we do there's a provision there called what God forgive me I was caught in the wrong thing I was caught in the wrong trap let's stand to our feet I got caught yesterday of confessional I guess I was heading home yesterday and brother Chris Long wanted to call want me to call him so I did well the truck phone my my phone didn't sink to the truck because it Jim had been driving it yeah Monica get over here we can see what I'm gonna say I've been to tell something she went so brother John I had to call Chris because I told him I said I got and I'll tell you about brother Mike so guess what I did going down the road almost got to rail Georgia and I'm watching to make sure there's no cop because you're not supposed to do that and I'm looking down here and I'm driving and I'm talking to brother Chris and all of a sudden I look up in every mirror Georgia State Patrol and I didn't say where'd you come from as soon as I let the window down I said buddy I said I know what I did and I said I'm sorry and I told him you know one excuse to them as good as another I said but I had to talk to this brother about and I couldn't get my hands free to work he said well you should have just laid up on the dash so he took my made sure I wasn't a felon take me to jail or any outstanding warrants so he comes back and he hands it to me he said I'm gonna give you a warning he said don't do that no more I said buddy I won't do this it's not as long as I can help it without an emergency he said look if it won't work he said just set it on your dash and you can listen to it from there it was really super now I thought he's going to be really mean but he was sitting between two trees I didn't see him he was I was sitting there between two trees and he said I saw you had your cell phone in your hand I said so that's where you came from God's watching you and the devil is too but I said look I said I I shouldn't have done that I said I'm sorry he said if you'd have been texting I'd give you a ticket he said it's a lot different doing this he said I don't think of uh holding the cell phones no more and holding a sandwich he said you're going to drop it and you're gonna you know you know you're gonna be
