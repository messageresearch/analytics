o'clock saturday here at the church okay everybody got that we we usually do it the first saturday of every month anyway so this is just continuing on with our bible study and i think last time we even had it we thought about picking a subject so i think we may pick a subject and um announce it wednesday night we'll just pray and then i'll talk to brother dale see if there's anything pressing on his heart and we will uh we'll pick a subject and talk about it um saturday so come and be with us um also i guess you heard camp meeting has been canceled um all we need to remember to pray for the churches brother donnie reagan's church has over 100 people that are out that have the virus so they had to cancel their services today but we serve a god that never gets cancelled so just remember that and if you want to start wearing your mask again if you you know we're going to go round and round with this thing until we just we really need to start believing praying that god will be with us and help us it seems the virus is not doing a whole lot of i mean the uh shock's not doing a whole lot of good so if you want to have it that's fine you decide i mean nobody don't listen nobody condemned the ones that do nobody call them the ones that don't a man it's a personal choice you do what you feel is right and if you do feel bad you need to stay at home right we've got a couple nurses here ruth's here she was in rotten thick of it last time it happened so uh she can tell you it's it's real i mean we don't need to we don't need to sweep it on the rug it is a real thing but we got to remember too are we going to keep cowering down to the devil are we going to be christians and do the right thing maybe this is supposed to be our faith builder brother brown said we didn't have faith for a toothache so maybe we need to start having some faith not be stupid but have faith and then be led of the lord what to do so you just do whatever you feel it's led to do also brother dale's house phone is out so if you need to contact him you can contact his cell phone or is that right mom no yeah it's it's kind of out too if you need to get in touch with brother dale call

the lord thank you visitors for coming you won't be a visitor this afternoon if you come back ever come back again so you've already filled out your visitors card and now you got to fill out your regular card so we don't do cards around here so anyway good to be in the house with the lord let's turn to hebrews 9 and we'll get started remember all these announcements um good to have each and every one of you here today a full house i think around the around the coming of the lord i believe the church is going to fill back up because my loved ones are coming in i don't know about yours but during that jubilee that we've been talking about we've been praying for our kids because we're not going out of here if we're in our jubilee we're not going out of here with our kids with us amen but they got to have an experience they're not going on your tail your hotel they're going to go on your experience i mean their own experience with god but you know what they can have one if i can have one i know they can have one and man they can have an experience it's freda got her hand up too i believe that so let's uh bow our heads just remember these requests and all the ones oh also i know most of you don't know but i don't know if dad and mom knows it but brother uh david nunley's twin brother daniel passed away uh not of covet i don't think but he passed away he goes brother donny's church also just remember that family we knew brother david really well and then brother daniel went to brother donny's church and they were twins and brother david died several years ago and but he passed away either last night or sometime so just remember that family and prayer i'd like to thank sister gwen and brother joe and their family for allowing us to do the service and me and brother dale had a really good time there we thought um a lot of sister maggie and we thank all of you for your prayers and the cards and what you sent for food it was just an outpouring which which we appreciate we're humans we need affection we need we need closeness and if it has to come from a church family then i think we're the only people know how to love we're supposed to right we're the only people know how to love that love out there past these doors is a lot like the scripture we're talking about lust right but we know true love agape love comes from the bride of jesus christ so let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that as we open your word lord that you'll open our hearts to understand it lord you said that for us to lord be an empty vessel for us to empty ourselves out from the things of the world and the cares of life just for a few moments and lord please speak to the people lord because that's more important than anything is that the people get something today and the brothers and sisters lord will become stronger by listening to what you're saying to them lord we pray that you'd heal the sick lord raise our immune system lord to take care of this virus lord we know that every day that naturally happens in our body there's something always attacking these human bodies and you gave us a mechanism inside of our body lord to protect and you also gave us lord the new birth lord to be able to listen to what you said you said you would never leave us or forsake us so in our darkest hour lord we know you're there with us lord be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick the ones that have traveled and come back thank you for getting them back safe father we pray that you just sanctify us for this journey that we're on bless our pastor lord and keep him strong safe and bless each one lord that's in this building today father just give us a special blessing today in jesus name we ask him amen so now we've been on eternal redemption and for those of you that are that have come in the middle of it i'm going to try to background real quick but let's go to hebrews 9 verse 11. everything that we as christians look at is based on redemption because we're all lost we didn't come here not needing redemption everybody needed redemption even the animals even the earth needs redemption all right it's because of the fall that's why it's called a fall something fell all right so when man fell everything below man fell and we needed redemption and then we've been talking about resurrection because if we don't base what we have on somebody resurrecting and bringing us a message and coming inside of us then we're a man most miserable the scripture tells us so we got to depend on redemption but it's based on resurrection amen and we're going to read that in just a few minutes and then we'll try to continue on with the two witnesses so but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place look having obtained eternal redemption now remember he came to this earth not needing redemption amen he was god he didn't need to be saved he came to save us but he had a human body that needed to be made eternal so he acquired eternal redemption for us here when he rose and said all power in heaven there's given unto me there's that glorified body that we were talking about the other night so let's go to amos 3 verse 7. i know this is familiar but several of the ministers have been reading it so i'm going to read it again surely the lord will do say that word with me surely the lord will do so he's not going to do anything but he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets we needed a prophetic voice in every age israel needed it in the old testament we need it in the new testament we needed it in every church age and god sent it to us amen the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord has spoken who can but prophesy all right let's read revelations 11 3 because when this redemption of the gentiles is over the redemption of israel begins and that what we were talking about last sunday or wednesday night there's two witnesses that's going to go to jerusalem and they're going to preach this same message of redemption and resurrection to 144 000 that's going to accept it so revelations 11 3 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and three score days which is twelve hundred sixty days clothed in sackcloth and read one more before we sit down revelations one verse 20. the mystery of the seven stars which i saw us in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks now there are seven stars which is in whose hand god's hand not man's hand it's in god's hand so there's seven stars and then we read you where the um the definition of star is what a messenger from god not just a messenger a messenger from god all right so a messenger from god came seven times in seven church ages because look the seven stars i'm reading bible i'm not quoting from a man i'm quoting from jesus christ all right the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches now what in seven church buildings said in the world churches are people churches are not buildings churches are people then we know that the prophet of god come in the end time and he told us the difference between a church and a bride and maybe we'll get to that this afternoon where you got the church and then you got the bride all right and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches you may be seated in the lord as blessing for reading the word for those of you coming in if you don't want to you got to skeet over just a little bit and let unless unless sterling needs to sit on the front row he's ducked down in the back good to have him and sister cali with us today amen pray for them they finna get married that's exciting man that's exciting all right so now we know the seven stars are the angels so god sent us seven messengers or seven messengers from god to seven different church ages separate seven different dispensations according to the bible so like i said before we have contention maybe in the world that thinks that well you know god didn't send william branham he i don't know where you know he's wrong and he's this and he's that and whatever they want to say that's fine with me because it doesn't bother me at all my resolve is is that god had to send me a one of those stars because we're in the last church age so he had to send me a star behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord so if william branham is not him i can hold god to his word amen and say if you didn't send me if it wasn't him you got to send me somebody because you said you would one of the seven stars amen matthew 17 verse 10 let's go there and after the disciples it's kind of neat to have to move people over and sit down and his disciples ask him saying why then say the scribes that he lies or elijah must first come listen the old testament the last book of the old testament was what malachi there is no new testament to the jews they don't believe in the new testament because they'd have to believe in jesus christ so they believe the old testament the old testament prophets which was which was the last one was malachi and malachi says we'll read it in a second but jesus answered and said elish truly shall first come and restore all things not bring us something new restore all things back to where it was before so now let's read malachi 4. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord you say well that was john the john the baptist it wasn't the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord he was introducing the messiah he was an introducer he was the one standing between the old testament and the new testament and we know he turned to heart now look and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children john stood and was preaching to those old rabbis those old orthodox jews those old priests in the old testament that did their sacrament not sacrament but did there did there one two three go to the temple don't do anything on saturday do this don't do that don't touch the women don't look at this don't do that you understand so john was introducing the messiah to them hey look this is the messiah this is the one that's going to take you not destroy the law but make sure that you can live it and live it right because when when the lawgiver came he looked right down in their soul and he said you're not living it anyway you're you you love the prophets and you're the one who put them in in the tomb isaiah i've been reading in isaiah this week and and it's the commentary of the whole bible but you think about isaiah a young man they tore him into pieces cut him up and threw him away just like he was nothing because of what he said he was a young man trying to do what god said and who did it it wasn't the heathens people of israel got mad at what he said have you ever heard that before and left the church oh and it got mad and uh and they killed him in the old testament now they just people just leave and kill you with their influence so anyway so he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children so here stands john the baptist he's taken the old testament and he's introducing that old testament the old into the new testament behold the lamb of god and takes away the sin of the world then what john leaves then the very one that john introduced in matthew 17 verse 10 said elish truly shall first come and restore all things now john the baptist didn't restore all things this malachi 4 messenger supposed to restore all things so he wasn't talking about john the baptist he was talking about the elijah to come so there's an elijah to come so we have to contend he's either already come and give us a message or he's going to come in somebody else but we need that person here to what time the loose ends i mean my heavens look at all the denominations that we have in the world with all the different ideas there's thousands of different ideas god's not that confused he gave us one bible he sent us one messenger in the end time and then what did that messenger do he didn't introduce the world to himself he did just like john the character of elijah he introduced us to christ because remember back in these church ages man took a hold of some of this now not the seven stars that was the message for the for their day but men got involved in it with men's ideas and as men's ideas got involved denominations became up remember when peter and james and john and all them would when paul traveled to ephesus and smyrna he didn't pass a baptist church in the methodist church in the pentecostal church and the presbyterian church they weren't there now they were little ideas and little sayings maybe that were coming up but most of it what paul was doing was he was giving them what the foundation of the gospel and so this messenger of malachi 4 is going to turn read the rest of that and and the heart of the children to the fathers so anyway in other words we were a bunch of babbling baby children pentecostal babies they just thought everything as long as you spoke in tongues it didn't make no difference long as you didn't have you didn't have to have a preacher you could just sing you didn't have to have a preacher you could just somebody stand up by inspiration no it took an elijah to come in the end time and say look you need to have a church service you need to have offering taken up special songs you need to have bible reading you need to have a couple of songs and bring the preacher out and let one preacher preach not a bunch of people so see that's him restoring taking the children what does children need children need guidance without guidance oh my goodness without guidance what would we be we'd be a bunch of children running around somebody jumping out speaking in tongues this one jumping up so i got a sermon today women and men both it happens in other denominations but they're wrong according to the bible that's wrong so what what had to come and tell us this malachi 4 that turned the hearts of the children us a bunch of crying babies back to what the faith of the fathers where there's no denomination where you didn't believe eternal hell where you didn't believe father son holy ghost was a baptism that's what they believe out there the whole world's deceived by that because it's not in the bible you say oh yeah about father son yeah it is in the bible but listen father's not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name i think the bible told us that all the family in heaven was named what jesus christ and he said i come in my father's name father's not a name the lord jesus christ is the only name god ever had jesus and why shouldn't we baptize in that to connect us to him instead of baptizing the way the world tells you to baptize and the way the world tells you that hell is eternal if hell's eternal then there's eternal people down there and where there's eternal people that's where god is because satan's not eternal so whatever the place was created for the devil and his angel it's going to pass away but now how many people in denominations today will actually fight you physically why because you're tearing down their foundation you're tearing down their doctrine that man has given them god has not given them that doctrine all right there is not three gods behold israel thy lord thy god is one and we believe in one true and living god amen so now let's look at the chart we've been on the this has been 28 sermons on the uh eternal plan of redemption so paul we're slow down here okay you people in minnesota talk faster than we do of course i talk pretty fast for being for being old southern boy there we go all right can you uh for us older ones can you make it a little bit bigger so we went through all this yeah right hallelujah you see you said hallelujah so we're here where christ went to hell preached to the sinners that was already dead that's good we're good he was here for 30 or 40 days then he ascended all right this is bible all right he ascended acts 1 3 first through 11. and then he said tarry until you be indu with power from on high which is acts 2 verse 1. so god came back now as the son of god the new birth to enter into you now he would walk with you as the son of man all right and i'm sorry folks this is for the this is for the the ones that haven't been here so they can get caught up i want to see what's going on so you know just don't take a nap but but just hit pause okay so ten days later in acts two verse one he said go your way be endued with power from on high he said i'll send the comforter which is the holy ghost in my name so yeah the holy ghost has got a name it's lord jesus christ but once it enters into you it's yours and you become mrs lord jesus christ you become god made flesh in another form called a bride or a son and daughter of gods everybody got that say amen all right so that's what happened we were promised that the new birth would come then john goes on the isle of patmos in 1896 and god shows him a gentile church age amen because remember we studied this before jesus went to who first he went to the jews yes he came to his own john 1 he came to his own and his own received him not in other words they rejected him they kicked him out right but as many that would receive he gave power to be sons and daughters of god so that's the gentiles and jesus met many gentiles there's many gentiles in the old testament rahab different ones that you see there ruth just for two for an example that's the type of me and you that's the type of being out in the world and then we accepting that we accept god's what redemptive plan because ruth accepted boaz's redemptive plan amen but you had naomi there which naomi was the title boaz ruth was not ruth was the time that come together but naomi was the jew right and she had the near kinsmen ruth did not but ruth accepted naomi being the daughter-in-law she accepted and then what did what did her mother-in-law do guided her to boaz guided her to boaz because naomi c couldn't have boaz but ruth could if if f she was accepted by christ i mean boys amen he she said go to this well what's the old testament go do this don't do that go into his field stay there go lay down at his feet who was telling her this naomi the old jewish lady sorry the old jewish lady the old testament right was telling ruth the new testament girl the moabitess the the out scour of the earth because more by more bites came from lot and his two daughters have an incest so i mean brother brown said there was a hair and a biscuit all right so it was kind of gaggy thing he said but you know what i don't think it bothered boaz because he wasn't looking at naomi he was looking at roof he knew though that to get to ruth he'd have to go through naomi to get to the bride he'd have to go through that old testament because they rejected him in the old testament as bride as husband but he knew that somebody would accept him right amen in the church ages then we see and then we look in daniel 70 weeks we may look a little bit later on that interjected into this great gospel because look just hang on for a minute gentile gentile 2000 years then back to jew then the millennium is not to us it's to the jews we're there on a honeymoon ruth and boaz went on a honeymoon amen but he's going to be there in the millennium doing what ruling the 12 tribes of israel we're not going to be we're not going to be there being ruled no we'll rule and reign on the earth for that thousand years brother brown said just be a honeymoon we'll just be there be able to travel like a thought if you want to go to mars just hang on a little while you don't have to pay 20 million dollars or whatever it is go to the moon now with them a bunch of billionaires you know what they ain't going to be around in the millennium they won't be no billionaires right nope we'll all be the same we'll own the world right amen and all the gold and everything else i mean what you know it's okay we're alive we're supposedly the outskirt of the earth because you know gentiles even jesus called us dogs because he was showing that that nation was an out scour that nation didn't see they had gods yes they have a god israel had a god but they turned him down once they turned him down he goes to the gentile and once he reveals himself through paul arenas martin columba lutheran wesley and brother branham then he knows that there's a bride that's going to become a wife because in revelation 19 we see that the wife has made herself ready is everybody with me amen so anyway according to revelations 1 2 and 3 there is a church age that is bride now there there are jews sprinkled in there okay the 120 in the upper room they were all jews right but what did paul and peter do finally they said lo we turn to the gentiles because the jews were just they that was the persecution they weren't persecuted by the gentiles the gentiles opened their arms up and said hey come on in this is wonderful we've never heard this before we've had diana we've had all these gods that don't do us any good they just stand there and stare at us but you've got a living god and we want that and the jews are going he wasn't god we're waiting on our messiah right so is the church world done today all right exactly we're the only people that know this story how it begins and how it ends because we're a bride my bride knows a lot more about me than all you know about me bless your heart you all need to pray for him should anyway not saying anything else so we got a bride and then down to these church ages they've lived took a message passed away and god will send another messenger they would live that message they would they would build not churches buildings but they would build a bride body they had their message for the day and then they would pass away and as they were passing away a new one would raise up because a messenger comes at the end of the age so the messenger would come paul came at the end of pentecost to bring his message then at the ending of paul's message he's already gone he's already told him grievous wills are coming they're going to destroy my message they're going to tear me up but irenaeus picks up the thought of god and he brings a message to his people and then on down through till we get to the end time and god promised us a seventh star whether you believe it was william branham or not i do i rest my soul on that because he took me to god he took me out of that confusion that was called the world that this one believed this and this one believed that and this one believed this to the truth now when somebody brings you to the truth he's a true messenger from god how do you it's not his life it's not all the different things it's what he done he brought you to christ all right and he brought me to christ i don't care if he was hunting out there in january february march april or the cloud to me that doesn't matter but to the born again it's a vindication that he came because he didn't put brother branham's head in there christ's head came into that into that cloud all right and he already told us in right here in acts 1 verse 3 them two angels said hey you saw him go up in a cloud that's right you're going to see him come back in the cloud but see ever but see then all the denominational world they're looking i was reading a commentary the other day and we'll get into that not today but later on i mean they're pushing everything as brother um mike ulti was talking about everything does start with a hope right right everything starts with a hope but you can't hope you got eternal life i hope when i get see that's another fallacy in the denominational world is that you got to go to the white throne judgment they believe according to what i read yesterday that you've got to go to the white throne judgment stand before the great white throne judgment and see if you got eternal life see if you got god's not that way folks if you're born again it's settled you don't go to the white throne judgment you do have a judgment of the things you've done maybe against the brother or against a sister that you don't make right here or something you did in your life that you didn't make right because some sins go before some go after all right brother dale's been preaching had already preached on that so we don't have to like i said before one of the greatest revelations you'll ever have is that if you're the bride of jesus christ yeah you may have a little minor tribulation but i'm not talking about the great tribulation you won't ever go through the great tribulation and you'll never have to stand before the white throne judgment see mo all all denominations see they're not even going to come up they're going to have to stay dead till the till i hope i get it you better know you got it and when you know you got it it puts you in a millennium you don't have to worry about all this other stuff why worry about two prophets they're not to you we've already had the one we need we all right not going to get into my notes so we'll just stay right here is that all right i always wonder why brother dale did that no no when you get talking about something and something gives you a line stay in it we'll get back to it so we're looking like i said before and we'll go back and read because i'm getting ahead of myself but while we got the chart up that there's a sixth dimension where the born-again believers go if they die so and and born-again believers don't die they just go to sleep and they move into another dimension the body stays here because it was born in sin shape and iniquity all right it hasn't been changed yet that's right and like i said before i read we'll read it in a little while this is corruptable but we're going to be raised incorruptible so that's another fallacy that they tell you in denominational world and half the people in the message that this body is worthless we're just going to get a brand new one no it's going to be this one made brand new amen because what jesus is an empty tomb the empty tomb shows that there was somebody mortal and now they're immortal they were corruptable and now they're made incorruptable so there won't be any missing pieces i like what a guy said i've been reading some books brother mike ulti gave me they're really nice and they're not message believers anyway but how could god create you from a germ from a little sperm and an egg give you life let you go through life accept his life get born again and then he can't find you at the end time if you have to pass away if he made you he can find you and he will find you he promised he would it doesn't matter if you go down the depths of the sea it doesn't matter what they do with you that's right god's got you right here even your body because he allowed your body to come how do you allow what is this this is all the design of god yes that's right brother this is the design of god that you got here and god gave you a soul and then by the new birth he transformed he didn't take that soul out and put another one in no he burnt that one you got out burnt the sin out of it just like he's going to do right here in the millennium he's going to burn it off not destroy it and then you're going to have a new heaven and a new earth not a new earth where you got to go get on another one no we're going i thought the bible said we're going to live right here didn't john say he saw the help saw the new city in revelations 20 coming down where was john standing on earth he saw the city come down and you know what folks we got a long time we're looking for the future home but you know what that thing's way over here we still got a thousand years that's not our temple that's not our place to live that's our honeymoon usually you don't live where you have your honeymoon i said usually you go somewhere on a honeymoon then you come back to your regular home all right so that's what we're going to do we're going to go on a honeymoon then god's going to burn this thing off we're going to come right back down here on this earth and you know what because this earth has been changed amen all right so now i'll get to my quotes in just a second or my scriptures but the sixth dimension according to first thessalonians 4 16 we're going to look at it that's the first resurrection that's all these saints that have died and went on because everybody's not going to resurrect in the first resurrection remember this is a secret catching away thief in the night the world's not going to know the devil's not going to have a clue because he'll have no part in the first resurrection only the born-again people so he's been revealed to the church agent we'll read it in just a second as we said the son of god see the physical body of god did not come back on the day of pentecost because he wanted a spiritual body to build on the earth which is me and you and you can't have two bodies on earth at the same time he's actually in he's actually in another dimension dimension number seven he's in the seventh dimension controlling everything but he's got his immortal body yes the bible tells us life and immortality has been brought to life through the gospel and there's only one king potentate the king of kings and lord of lords that has reached immortality he's standing in the seventh dimension that's why brother brown couldn't see him that was a position that god had come to that he came and got a body that wasn't eternal to begin with because yours isn't either amen he lived a life just like you live but when he resurrected he resurrected the glorified body because he's god and he had to be the first fruits the one to do that so he's in the seventh dimension and brother branham goes into the sixth dimension but his old body is still laying on the laying on the bed for those of you that know it or don't know it we had a prophet coming in time and he went in another dimension all right so he's looking back here so that body is what mortal he was in his theophany in the sixth dimension looking at the ones that had died and went on he said where's jesus what did angel say he's higher higher seventh dimension all right so he's in the seventh dimension standing there waiting on his bride body to develop on earth and as he waits on the bride body to develop on earth he has to bring the head the head's where the controlling factor is right he brings the headship back to the church which the denominations they reject headship because they don't have anything to do anything to do with the truth sorry i drove by the old church a few minutes ago there stood two guys outside with look like gym shorts on in church going to church so i mean it's just to them it's just like you go to it's like brother brown said you go to a lodge you go and meet and greet hello boys good to see you and anyway there's got to be some holiness involved all right there's got to be some sacrifice involved in this that we see that god gave us what he restored us back they wouldn't have done that in the first church age paul would have seen it about two times and he would have cut their head off not literally but you understand what i'm saying so first thessalonians we're going to read that in just a minute so you're going to see that the first resurrection brings this sixth dimension into here you and i down to the church ages we have been motivated as the prophet said as the son of god revelation which is god in the form of the holy ghost in the group of people called the bride all right everybody got that say amen a group of people called the bride that's the ones that have it not just not just had a good thought that's right we even went through justification and sanctification because we'll read it in just a little while about the foolish virgin they were foolish because they never got oil oil is the holy ghost you get the baptism of the holy ghost you're a bride if you don't you're foolish that's just cut and dry there's no in between amen either you're married or you're not so if you're married to christ you're either married to christ or the devil one of the two amen sorry you decide so the bride the body of jesus is on the earth as the bride and the son of god is not just anointing you but it's helping you through your life it's not just something that comes on you and then comes off of you no it's what something that stays there it stays with you just like it did on the river jordan brother uh when you look at john john looked and saw the spirit descending like the dove and remaining remaining on that person all right it remains on you and actually he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age so it's not that just god said because god can anoint you the devil can anoint you but only god can save you amen satan can't save you he make you feel good he makes you feel happy he can feel the church full but unless you got the new birth you'll just wander right back out you understand because there's nothing to hold you we were talking about the at the uh you say they were somebody asked what is the new birth well to me the new birth in a real simple form that'll really help you when you were born your ship and you got sails and that sail turns as the wind turns there's no rudder down underneath how can you control that boat you can't yeah because the wind's gonna blow that way brother john and you're gonna do whatever you can try to do it's still gonna go that way it's gonna blow that way but if you'll put i don't care the ship can be as big as this building if you can put a little three foot rudder you know what i'm talking about it goes under the bottom of the ship you can't be seen that's right but it's gonna run your boat but you put that rudder down there and the wind starts blowing that way but you want to go that way what you do you turn that rotor now it may fight and what they call in in airplanes they call it like uh crabbing because you go sideways but still once you got that rudder turned eventually when the winds of war and the winds of the devil quit blowing you're going to go the way you want to go just because that one little rudder that's the holy ghost hey look he didn't change the ship he didn't change the sale he just gave you a spiritual runner that when you get into something that thing will turn you brother branham what did he tell us he said the most important person on the ship not the captain he said guy down in the bottom is throwing the coal in they're saying turn to the left and he goes and what turns the rudder hey man that's the important person and you know what it's underwater you can't see it but it manifests itself by where it goes same way with a christian that was fresh by john i didn't really think of that but okay but you say well what it is it is the greatest thing ever happened to you but it's just a it's just a three-foot paddle underneath the water that turns you the way you need to go because you never had a spiritual rudder because you did the things of the world wind blow that way i don't care if you fall a little bit it's going to go your ship's going to go that way but you put that rotor in there same thing with an airplane you put your uh you put your flaps up and down you'll get to go where you need to go that's the new birth you ask god to give you the new birth and when you start looking at the things you used to do and you don't do them no more you're not even desiring to do them anymore and believe me satan's going to put them right there beside you but when you go nope there's a higher calling here buddy you used to play now you can't play no more you can play you can play all you want to the wind's gonna blow go out in the sea the wind's going to blow but you know what you've got that rudder down there that says no i'm going in that direction and that's what's going to take us up amen so let's read now what the prophet of god said because see that's our spiritual rhetoric down to the church ages which has been the son of god the the spirit of god inside of you the new birth to control you yes according to the word of god not according to the world all right everybody got that so that's what god gives us but now in the end time we are required a little bit different because we come to the loudest in church age and we've given some extra scriptures because without me and you because you got seven church ages and look that's it that's it there's no more there's no more big profit to come you and all are supposed to be prophetic people that's right you're right charlotte it is hot up here now with all these people up here y'all need to stop breathing for a little while okay i didn't broke holly no don't do that it's 70 degrees and that's about all it's doing but it's okay we're trying to get away from a harder place amen hey man you don't worry about that but we see there's no other church ages because i believe we're the seven stars in the seven churches we're number seven so god has already i believe sent us a messenger already sent it to us by the holy ghost because look he'll do nothing amen amos says i'll do nothing unless i reveal it to a prophet first because remember a prophet does two things when it hits the earth the prophet either gives you judgment or grace you reject that message it gives you judgment you accept that message it gives you grace and puts you in the body of christ and grace is what's going to take you in the rapture all right grace is what brought think of it people go out in the world well don't go out of the world but when you go out into the world you look around you see people you see people that's trying real hard you see people that ain't trying at all but they're trying the wrong thing they're wanting to be a good person they're wanting to be this they're wanting a good james dobson preacher they want some you know tell me how to and it is listen it is good to have those things to tell you how to live life all right do the right thing dave ramsey different people like that it is good to read those things but that's not going to save you but once you put the two together brother mike oakley we you know talking the other day he gave me a couple of books to read and that one of them was by schofield but see if you take scofield you got to remember schofield larkin uh you're a smith different ones they might they had the new birth i believe for their time because god did use them but they weren't vindicated prophets but you taken god put a vindicated prophet on the earth he reads their writings because if god give them their if god gave these people these writings and they were true then when he sent a prophet now then you take away that scofield was trinitarian that this one was trinitarian that this didn't believe this and then you god sent a prophet to restore everything back and now in the message they're saying well brother branham wasn't nothing he would just use their message well i'd like to ask them if they ever preached something out of the new testament then they're using paul's message [Music] grief you see how frivolous people try to grab straws you make somebody mad see that's what a good boxer will make the next boxer mad because he forgets all of his training and he just wants to beat you up and you just sit there and go all right buddy this is where i wanted you so he starts flailing and you just go pop up that's the way it is with the devil you make him mad boy he just starts sending everything that's all right if you got that rudder where are you going to be you're not going to be in shifting saying you're not going to be out in the ocean of of life not knowing where to go amen so god sent us a message in the end time to restore back the faith of the fathers and to reveal the book see the book the reason clarence larkin the reason scofield the reason you're a smith the reason even um billy graham oral roberts didn't have they weren't operating under an open book now for you that don't understand what i'm talking about when you shut a book i shut my book a book that i'm reading and i hand it to brother daugherty that's all right brother dardy here's the book three weeks later i go oh brother darnie you read that book no but i know what it says have you even opened it no but i know what it says well tell me the story behind it it can't tell you you got to hold in the book hey you got to read what's inside yes but now once i give it to brother doherty which i know he would i said look brother daughter it's a good book to read he'll open that book he'll read and he'll come back oh brother wait page 34 right there that's something good right there page 45. see i know he's read the book so now obviously scofield and those worked under a closed book because they had trinitarian ideas they had all these denominational ideas that were wrong but god winked at their ignorance during that day because he had to with luther because luther was trinitarian but luther had a message the just shall live by faith that was his message to the people amen but now you and i can't live under that because remember god keeps moving he moves further and further and further if you stay right here then you have left god and he's moving on so he's going to close your book the part that you had and he's going to come over here and now you and i we are living under when the seven seals were opened according to revelations 10 7 or 10 1 the mighty angel comes to the earth with what an open book now buddy when you come with an open book everything's made known so all the all the wrongs will be made right when the book is open everybody got that we live under now an open book listen you can close it back if you want to your choice that's right but if you keep that book open because remember john didn't need a closed book john eat an open book amen john eat an open book and that's what we have now we have an open book listen the book got closed down in the church ages what did the prophet of god tell us he said i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ they put him back on the cross are we doing the same thing i want to ask you that question because he indicted a whole generation for doing the wrong thing when christ was standing there trying to reveal himself to the people same way with you and i all right so now let's read real quick now he he he's the son of god which is god in spirit form revealing himself to the church ages but listen not fully revealing because look the son of man is jesus christ we're going to get into that maybe later on not when we get finished with this series the son of man was god in human flesh total god you and i are apart but in him dwelt the what fullness of the godhead bodily you and i have a part of that so we're not because remember we were sex born he was virgin born biggest separation there is that just that just did away with all of us right he was virgin born and he was the son of god he was before all things he knew all things why because he was back over here watching all this take place but when he came down into this man right here named jesus christ you know god had to back up from the all-knowing and we'll get into it when we talk about the son of man he was the all-knowing god created all things knew all things he had to learn how to eat he had to learn how to move his finger he cried he had to have his diaper changed he couldn't do it himself but you know what he done it for he does it for me and you he did not do it for himself he did it for me and you he became a baby the bible says he learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect now listen in soul he was perfect because he's almighty god but when he come down to that human body that's where the eternal redemption part comes from you and i are heading toward that because listen if you're born again your soul is already redeemed all down to the church ages by the revelation of the son of god you're inside you is a theophany that real you that makes you move and you take that out today and then we do a lot of funerals the firing mechanism that's what you are that's the soul of you makes you do this makes you listen make you think what's going on and wish i'll hurry up so but not just not the holy ghost won't do that but that was a revelation of the son of god in the church ages was a part of god would come and give a message the part of god would come and give a message a part of god would come and give a message but then he said that according to luke 17 30 but let's read right here real quick i'm getting them ahead of myself let's read quote number one we got a few all right let's read quote number one take the chart off please feast of the trumpets now he's been revealed to the church ages now watch through the church ages as son of god god being a spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church ages as in the congregation as the holy spirit among the people now but according to luke 17 let's go to luke 17 verse 24 let's try to keep this in the bible i want you to read this with me real quick and then we'll we'll probably stop right here now for there's the lightning that lighteth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day everybody got that be in his day but first must he suffer many things now and be rejected of this generation luke has put him in the physical form jesus standing on earth got anybody got that read that so shall also son of man be in his day that was what two thousand years ago in 80 30 when jesus was standing on earth preaching his message everybody got that but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation so listen if he suffers and he's rejected and he's here today guess what you're going to suffer i like what brother richard hyatt was preaching sunday he was talking about you know you get a you get a revelation and you have a cycle that you get a revelation you're happy and then all of a sudden here comes trouble right and it's the same thing over again you know everything's good everything's wonderful we do everything right and then all of a sudden here comes trouble but that's just a cycle of being a look think of paul i've been reading the writings of paul from another commentator man he spent he spent half his life in prison almost he was beat every how many times and almost dead they drug him out of the street one time thought he was dead have you ever been through that before then you ain't been persecuted so don't worry about the little paper cuts that you get i told ruth i said ruth i got a paper cut i need to i need to leave she wasn't very sympathetic but now we think the trials it gets us you go back and watch look at what happened to those christians that just standing up and saying i'm a christian in the street you got your head cut off or you got fed the lines and that was the worst death because it took a while before they got you eat up so listen the little persecutions that we suffer nothing compared the bible said to the glory that we're going to receive and you've never been put on a cross either and beat like a piece of hamburger meat like this man was all right and as it was in the days of noah now look as it was in the days of noah right before a destruction everybody got that look when the son of man shows up right before a destruction so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage here we go again until the day that noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also it was in the days of what now here we go right before another destruction before sodom and gomorrah is being destroyed we see somebody come on the scene amen you ever thought about that that's why the son of man he shows up right before destruction likewise also it was in the days of what they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it everybody in this church did have one of those last week bro gary build it i planted some good good christmas llama beans so anyway so look this is then it's vindicating showing our day but in the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed all right so now that's not talking about jesus this time it showed his time before that this is talking about us before a destruction comes behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the what great and dreadful day of the lord because listen we might have minor tribulation but the great tribulation is the wrath of god poured out upon a godless people you'll never see that if you're born again all right so we know that the son of man is to be revealed in the end time before a destruction so god's gonna send us look at verse two i mean quote number two jesus said as it was in the days of sodom this was jesus talking so shall it be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel down there to the church elect what he did look at jesus what he done in his generation look down here at this generation what he's doing now they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it the whole world saw great signs and miracles and wonders that the prophet did always seven times around the world but when he started preaching his message they rejected him forgot what he did before same way with jesus they forgot the five thousand he fed they forgot the healing that he did and they hung him on a cross but now we know that william branham was not the son of man because the requirement of these son of man is is you'd be born with no sex so that just discludes all of us except one guy that's the lord jesus christ all right but the resurrection will be the sign here we go again like i said this whole everything's based on resurrection because you're going to have you had a resurrection in the old testament you had jesus the old testament saints right then we're looking for this resurrection to come then we're looking for a resurrection of the jews then we're looking at a general resurrection so it's all based on resurrection what you do here bases which resurrection you make it to see you can't do like like i said before some of the commentaries i'm reading you know you you well when i get to the great white throne i'm going to plead my case oh lord if i make it there i don't have a case i don't have a case if i have to go to the white throne judgment i have no case god took my case that don't make you happy god took my case and he destroyed it he even took the book and thrown it out the window and it hit in the sea somewhere the sea of god is forgetful is never to be remembered again but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection the sign is given to the church in this last day what did i say before no man in the history of time except jesus christ himself stood in front of a congregation and said you were at the doctor yesterday you had on a blue dress with a yellow ribbon in your hair and the doctor told you this and the doctor said this he said your house number's 242 williams street and your name is wade dale nobody has ever done that before in that grand of form where everybody heard it now it may have been done in paul's age it may have been done in iranians but it never was done on a public stage to where god is going to prove that he's opened the book and one man a prophet is going to release that power to the bride now listen we're not going to ever see it like that in one man but jesus said greater works will you do because it'll be in a group of people how many of you have seen healings how many of you prayed for the sick how many of you have saw mighty miracles that might see it's not just one person anymore but he had to take that one man standing there saying it's not me it's him amen the holy ghost come down and discern those people's thoughts and it never was wrong one time amen and look don't base your salvation on that though you'd better never base your salvation on i heard a prophet say no but remember that spiritual rudder inside if you don't have it one little thing pops up like they're saying now he did this he did that he was wrong here he was wrong there your ship is gonna go shipwrecked but if you've got that spiritual rudder you'll turn against that wind and you'll make sure you go north amen up don't worry about all that stuff but the angel of the holy spirit in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ is raised from the dead the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that we're receiving which i contend that's this generation we're looking at right now and that was a healing campaign but i'm looking for healing of the soul but then we're going to look for before the culmination of everything the bride has got to come to a place just like jesus was standing on earth you said you can't do it have you ever read john 17. john 17 says father i pray i pray for them not to take you out of the world but that you'll stay in the world but he said i pray father that they be one as you and i are one so how many ones were they jesus and god was one person and he prayed that we would be the same way and you know what that's kind of hard for a human to figure out but i didn't say it god did so he's going to have to make a way for me to get us there and i believe he has he sent us the word of god he sent us the prophet end time to open the book so that we can truly read the bible with with eyes of understanding not eyes of this may be right and this may be wrong and i'll take what paul says or not what peter says i'll take what jesus says over what peter says the whole problem with that is it's why would jesus stand up one day and said baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost but several weeks prior he said peter i'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom and whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven so jesus goes away and comes back on the day of pentecost he enters into peter and changes his mind don't change his mind through peter who had the keys he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's the name of god for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you know what jesus wasn't in another another dimension going peter no no no no no no he was going perfect that's exactly what i was saying that's exactly what i wanted you to get to the people because he heard that key and you know what jesus was in heaven and he said i told you if you unlocked it down here i'll unlock it up there he said click i just then unlocked it for you peter and no man can shut that key i don't care what denomination they can't shut that key think about that because you have peter people say well peter was saying this in acts and jesus was saying is the bible that confused no no no jesus was just conveying through a person that had the key amen peter had the key he'd already give it to him so anyway all right let's go right here and then we'll we will stop so everything's based on resurrection resurrection is a state of having passed completely through death and having risen from death to be in resurrection is different than to be alive we're going to get to where the alive and remain to be alive is the original state without having passed through death to be in resurrection is to have passed through death and have been raised up so resurrection there had to be a death that's why when we take you to the water we go to a burial yes if you want to be baptized correctly in the name of the lord jesus christ you gotta die we're going to a burial we're going to a funeral because i put you in the water brother dale any preacher puts you in the water death that's right burial resurrection in the newness of life old things are passed away leave it in the water because you'll get the promise of the holy ghost if you'll do that right you don't have a promise of the holy ghost and father son holy ghost you get a promise in acts 2 38 that if you'll do that you'll get the holy ghost pretty simple all right revelations 20 verse 4 and i saw thrones musicians get ready to come i'll stop right here and they that sat on them and judgment was given unto them them them who's them the bride and i saw the souls of them that will be headed for the witness of jesus for the word of god which did not worship the beast that's us neither his image neither receives his mark upon their forehead not tattooed on their forehead what is this part of you that's your intelligence you've taken on a wrong doctrine or in their hands what works and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years was finished this is the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him one thousand years we'll finish the rest this afternoon musicians come rule and reign one thousand years first thessalonians don't pull it up but i wouldn't i have you ignorant brethren come on concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even sow them also with sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this i say to you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain not not not have to be resurrected because it said alive if you're alive and you haven't died you can't be resurrected you were spiritually resurrected by the new birth yes absolutely but this body's got to be changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye let's stand to our feet we'll finish the rest this afternoon god bless you come back for part number two go ahead brother john gavin the source of strength when i am we thank you lord that takes me through when life is [Music] a [Music] [Applause] [Music] think about what he did for you folks for all my sickness think about it when i need healing [Music] [Music] jesus oh calvary with a request

just for me [Music] amen you love the lord [Music] let's love him a little more and i jury in the name of the lord jesus if you don't have that spiritual rhetoric today you will shipwreck this is not the time to play around we don't have a long time left not trying to scare you but i'm telling you these things we got to get settled now you don't have it settled you need to get it settled right now know that you know that you know not a hope not on my daddy's gonna make it my mama's gonna make it that you're gonna make it because you know what i didn't need my mom and dad to tell me that i made it right because they would have saved me from the beginning but they can't save you they can pray for you they can guide you and lead you but you got to come to a place that you say god what was it brother ram told the story the man said god you're going to find a bag of bones right here if you don't give me the holy ghost he said boy that's no that's something god wants you to do he wants you to say look i'm not leaving this place right here until i know that i know that i know that god has saved my soul and when you come to that spot not many people will come to that remember you know they who was it brother brown was telling another story so moses said well now you got to go out here and get in this pig pen and that guy's like i don't know about that but you know what when the inspiration struck that guy out in the pig pen he went and you know what it wasn't the pig pen that saved him it was the move he made amen it was a move that you make toward god that he'll honor that it doesn't matter where you go but he wanted to make sure that guy wanted it bad enough to get in that hog pin have you ever wanted it bad enough if you don't today you need it let's bow our hands dear heavenly father we pray lord that is we go and eat a natural meal that we'll come back together lord you'll tell us a little more about yourself father we pray that the people that were prayed

that you'll protect us from this whatever the world calls new strain a virus or whatever it is lord we pray lord that [Music] we have an inoculation the prophet of god told us and his faith faith in you lord that you'll take care of us on this road ahead father we need you more than anything we need to bind together more than anything and we pray that you'll help us do that lord take care of us on the highways and ones that are leaving lord we pray that you'd bless them thank you for coming among us in the service today and delivering yourself lord we pray that we'll do the same this afternoon father just bless the people be with each one lord in jesus name we ask amen you're dismissed god bless you i need healing i just those precious
