========================================

to see you [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of your glory power in signing in the light of your glory amen pour out your power and love holy holy [Music] holy holy and I want to see amen and amen and amen I want to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your Scripture and read along with us turn to Jonah 2 where we've been reading and then we'll go to mark 16 with Jonah two and mark 16 now remember the announcements that have been made member the Bible study will be the first Saturday in March so we'll keep that in mind and then the third Saturday will be the fellowship meeting and brother Ernie Villanueva will be ministering and it will be here so just get everything ready for that part and other announcements Terrence and then was made and just you know it's a great day and a great time to be able to serve on Almighty God and love him and know that He loves us in it amen if you got this turn to Jonah and just let's start from there I want to try to bring I'm trying to bring each thing as a thought instead of you know taking so much of this and this and this and is taking as a thought and then putting that thought down now in another week or maybe we'll just take a message and go all the way through from beginning to where we caught up to and try to you know maybe that'll help to understand but if you would just listen I'm just trying to make a thought you know or something and you know and just getting it lined up into that thought and with a prophet in the Bible and then we'll take it all together as one and it should line up pretty good to us and we get it all together father we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for the day in the hour that we're living we thank you for grace and Calvary we ask you to just be with us you promised it so we can depend on it you said you'd be with us you send your word and heal us we thank you for all of the ones that have had these old flu bugs and things Lord and he you've come on the scene and took care of them where there would be a lot of sicknesses and high fevers and things and Lord in you you took care a lot of the things and kept it down among us and we praise you and thank you for that and we ask you to just have your way now and let us see you and to walk in the light of your love got us in Jesus name Amen remember that Wade will be going to Alabama this weekend so remember that and praise the Lord would bless them and a lot of the others brother Louise is going love the others are going so just be much in prayer okay Jonah 2 & 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the force of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now an odd point to pick up but I wanted to drive a thought into us tonight from this so we go to mark 16 and we'll begin at verse 14 afterward this is coming down and the resurrections and the different things that has taken place and then says afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they said it meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart now watch because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen and they didn't believe the literal report of people that saw it okay now and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned so you may be seated the Lord had two blessing to the reading of his word all right now we're staying with the point of you know we're trying to get it settled in our binds and talks about the Old Testament getting that in order getting the things laid out and then coming in to now in understanding and we still haven't got to actually preach about the new birth yet we're just leading up to it and you know trying to cover a few things maybe the Lord willing we'll pick it up Sunday and continue on all right but now what was art what has been our thoughts salvation is based upon the fact of whether or not you can believe all right now there are some people that cannot believe okay I mean there's some people that cannot do it it just it doesn't matter what you do they can't believe what now so that means as a people Dyer that is having a lot of trouble you know all right now see you got then in the church realm you've got the three basic believers you know to make believer the unbeliever in a true believer so everything is based and we tried the last message in this one is to bring it to a thought to her that we can look at how important it is to be able to believe it's really the most important thing you can think of and what about it to not be able to believe I mean what if you were just so cut out so set to a situation of life that you couldn't believe well then they're just no hope for you right I mean it's not based see it's based on whether or not remember what we've emphasized over and over it's based upon whether or not we can believe God is real Hebrews 11:6 what he that comes to God must believe that he is and that was see that won't work you got to believe he's real all right now then you got to come to John 6:44 that says no man can come unless the father draw him all right we've got to believe then that he has drawn us or called us or guided us you know like Abraham to the basis of as the emphases in the last message on Abraham not a great guy but just a man that believed God didn't do great signs and wonders to show him to start weird to get him to going he just believed him all right and he's called the father of faith so then we need to say well let me at least be that much you know all right then we talked about it and we from Romans two and four it says that the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance it's all right first you believe that he is then you believe that he has called you all right then you believe that his goodness has led you to repentance and brought you to a place to where you can believe God's Word so it's everything based on believing all right now the night we're gonna be talking about this believing of how valuable it is because you just think about it if you can't believe then you can't be saved now God can come down and do no he can not override your free moral agency all right so you got to believe it and you got to believe he's calling you you got to believe he's dealing with you you got to put it in do you believe in that's why we read that and there and then John back a little bit before then of John they come down to the disciples finally got to a play and they said well we now know that nobody don't have to teach you this or whatever tell you and he said do you now believe after all that was said and done the sick he or the dead raised all kinds of things he said do you now believe he had 70 ministers that walk with him but before Calvary they left him right why because they couldn't believe we talked about this past Sunday of talking on believing unto salvation believing unto believing unto salvation do you realize that you're believing then is what brings God to you sure he lays it down in front of you the goodness called etc but you really realize that you're and you're believing that that brings God to you well you know that's a wonderful thought at least enough to even think about that you could believe enough that God could come to you that's wonderful in that you could believe enough now we won't get into it to say much about it but we'll mention it we're going to talk about believing and going on in your believing tonight and coming out to salvation and things but what we're going to lay it out in order cuz I want you to think on it now we believe in predestination right how do we believe that your predestinated according to the scriptures in the Prophet those who he foreknew he did predestinate well you know God knows every person and how much they can believe right remember we're taking the thought now with the predestination see he knows whether or not you'll believe and go on in your believing but he knows that some will believe except but they won't continue all right see he knows that his foreknowledge lets him know that but do you realize then your thoughts should be on the basis that you know who am i believing has brought God to me you don't consider those things then could it be that he predestinate so you're believing he knows whether you're gonna come true or not right he knows whether you're gonna believe he knows how long you're gonna believe he knows when you gonna stop believing there start believing or how it will carry on see then we ought to be more thrilled about just the thought of believing the anything that we ask God for we must believe by faith right that he has given that unto us were to be healing with a big salvation whatever it be whatever you're asking for you got to believe that he has given it to you without any costs out any thoughts freely giving it all right and how important it is for one to believe you know I've been accused in my life of taking people's word people's told me said well you just take people's word about it well until I find out it's different why not right I mean what right have you got to doubt anybody's word if you don't know but see we say well I just don't believe that what about it salvation then see we're using that word in our salvation we're not fully over to redemptive part yet because that will come into the new birth and the times but we're still talking about salvation as being what deliver us you realize you're believing starts in motion something within you that brings salvation to you I thought we believed in Romans 10 that we believe in our heart and confess with our mouth what believe in our heart and confess with our mouth what we believe in their heart is that right I mean that's the way that really is see if your confession is not according to what's in your heart well good as you can fashion so you believe in your heart something allows you or let you come to a play a basis of believing and then you confess within he is the intercessor upon our confession right we'll see then it's based upon whether or not we can believe it and keep our confession going in the right direction [Music] but what about it what about your salvation being based upon your believing and the fact that God will come to that believing honor you're believing then we know for a certainty I'm taking it real slow do we get over to a spot coder want you to follow it the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith right I mean I'd sure like for it to be different but you know that's all for fun let's me me it's names I think it you but the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith but you know what there is no way for faith to start without it being mental you know what I'm a mental faith is what starts so it's not bad it's not bad to think about even at the biggest part of our faith is mental faith because if we take the mental faith and hold on to it God can bring it to pace to make it spiritual faith a revelation but it's based on our mental faith there's no such thing as God overriding your free moral agency or anything like making you do this or that or the other so then our believing has a lot to do with everything and you know that's where your salvation starts no brother Dale my salvation started with all right but now just remember you heard the word somewhere and there's no such thing as salvation without the word being brought unto you so then you're believing in God our God being real you know do you understand that if you can believe that God is real you know I'm not believing light and that's why we stay away from those things as much as we can see the kids say they don't know the difference in believing in and in God or believing in Santa Claus because they see a whole lot more evidences of Santa Claus than they see of God raaah see that's why it's so dangerous about the believing of the children that it puts them to a basis then it makes unbelievers out of them now just trying to get a thought on your mind see you've got to believe that God is real not a thought of your imagination not a myth are not some kind of a doctor release you or something that you know totem poles and and all like that you see why that it's so important that the church the church hear the truth now I was listening yes sir looking yesterday no it's this morning we're better ana was talking about faith and how that it's a fact of actually just believing God we think it's got to be something supernatural some kind of something or whatever it simply starts by your mental believing mental believing is where you start from it doesn't matter who you are what we are that's where it starts from but it's so important that our mental believing be lined up to what the court was veteran said false prophets brain false birth he said true prophets brain true verse right now we'll false doctrine bring a new birth and there was a time that his weight was bringing out the other thing about Martin Luther and the different things and all like that there was a time that you could lean on things but you know the Bible says that he winked at her ignorance all right now that was the time that he winked at it but what has rested that scripture and don't stop just saying that he winks at her Ignis he says that he goes on not just weakening their ignorance but now he commands everybody to repent is that Scripture well you see why the truth is so important now listen and you'll understand you see why brother Branham would say nine hundred different ways of believing a new birth because this one police's this witness and believes that wait this believes that would disbelieve is everyone and just changing her heart wording changes them to another thought you see why it's so important to hear the truth I've always said this and God knows this in my heart and always has been I preach for the bases at one time I don't have to preach to be saved don't have to do anything it doesn't gain me and if I hit you know to preach I think worried about that but I preach to were that people can hear the truth that's my goal that's my dollars because now if false prophets bring false burst then false words will bring false birds right and false Birds is not true birds come on think on these things now listen to what your prophet has to say let's go over number eight brothers and pick up the thought tonight and just try to get our thought to to give us something to understand we see by faith we believe God is real that he's drawing us to himself he's called us to come unto Him and accept him as your Savior right now listen to what he says now you're going to have to listen through tonight to a lot of the message code we're going to read some things that you probably thought the Prophet never said you know so I can't so there's progress road said no I don't believe that no now listen what he said questions and answers in 1957 he talking about Corinthians and all by one spirit all baptized into into the body of Christ he talks about Corinthians but at that time we receive the new birth and watch him this takes place is that we know what it's a question like these answer that's what they want to know yes by one spirit no no by one spirit we're all baptized into one body but now watch what he's saying see that isn't it the new birth that isn't when the new birth begins and what's you the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus now I know see they're laying here there at home so don't worry about it don't get all related I know what he says I know when he comes to the point of saying when you truly believe I've got him laying out so don't worry about it just stay with me or what I'm talking about the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the new birth begins he didn't say it was the new birds when you believe on the Lord Jesus cry he didn't say you were sealed in baptized into the body etc etc he's simply saying it begins the church we've got a lot to consider there's a group of people called foolish virgins that are believers and things but yet to fall short of the new birth and they wind up at the white throne judgment and how to be given eternal life based upon what they believe there's a field field Jew did brother Branham say they would be given eternal what on the basis and what is their confession the confession that they're Jews that's really what he's saying you read it he said they'll be given eternal life on the basis of what they believe then we know that it believed in Jesus should our Father see your new birth begins when you believe now you see why it's so dangerous then of the doctrines and the things that are among the people of this message and the seed they sow the long organized religion and those seeds the parts it was so you don't you sell this is this L make no difference well then why did your prophet say it if they don't like no difference what about it so then truly what you do is when you hear the word you know somebody telling you um you read it and a man picked up a track and you know and read it oh wherever you hear it from mama daddy or whatever you know it really starts with a mental believing I'll show you what run around if I get to it and says it don't seal you in the body because you're believing shouldn't want to there's a lot brother Brown don't say it because look at what he covered do you realize that'll give you a short quick run through do you realize what the man had to do when he came do you realize he had to preach the church back to the faith of the Father he realized in the statue of a perfect man he said he took him 30-something years to be able to do that no rage statue perfect man ready 30-some years to him to be able to preach the church back to the faith of the fathers no wonder he'd say 900 different ways of believing a new birth or a thought look at where he was looking at seeing mankind had got so far away from God there was a time right there to the book of Acts and it coming forth and for about four Turks ages you had it basically staying with the faith of the father not everybody had it but you had the ability because you had great men to teach God's Word but Iran said it was none greater I liked when he when he got to what is the third church age yeah Martin he said it was none greater than Martin he said outside of the Lord Jesus Christ he said the dead was raised sick with heal miracles and ever service almost have you read the church in his book and a relating of it columbic comes only nine it's holding on pretty good with in all at once you see it drop it barely comes out of a little two shoots of that's just shall live by faith but that's what God's Word it was enough to put them into the body of Christ right then what's that that message lie stood so many hundred years or something and John Wesley come along with sanctification just a little bit deeper there and in your Zeus's Street Pentecost came on which were Trinitarians Zeus's Street Pentecost was not oneness oneness started about twelve or thirteen fourteen you know Azusa Street 1906 was Trinitarians it's finally believers somewhere in the 13 right in there you know 1913 you got the one that's starting you think and then here comes the profit alone into the 30s and look what he had to do he said can you compare the church today with the church that started at Pentecost all right that's pretty close quote wouldn't it shouldn't have to be worried about it because you know it's true and it took him all those years to be able to preach so we're going to get into some things that's going to mean a whole lot of hope what about a man coming on the scene knowing what he knew he mentioned adoption the first time in 19 and 50 I mean that song that's the records I can find talking of adoption in 1950 and they never did understand him we got a lot of lot of things to cover all right we see you must believe and then it's vital to what you believe and how you believe you remember that quote where we gave each other day telling about the Holy Ghost we run said you know spin from which incorrect me talk then he turned around they gave you one quote from what to hell to go see it he said you you you know you could how can you receive something's you don't know what it is that's in who is it smell I mean what Holy Ghost killings are you can't receive something's you don't know what it is I just got the hold it over that's why brother on Saturdays has been so mister incorrectly towels you know coat is just out is manna-fest manifestation signs and wonders and everything but do you truly believe as your salvation started can you remember when it started you can't relate to when you first accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you don't remember when you first started believing come on vote most of us is old enough to know that one thing about it when I believe in started with Trinitarians oh now you argue with me about that angle arguing we here I'm just gonna tell you it's truth our believing started we're talking outside there well ago and brother dick was missing it where that people say you know they give me Catholic Church they give me a child a six years old when you have you know what that's what the believing stage the quote was implanted into the people yes but we told them to come to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior okay let's read a little bit go ahead to number nine just remember that now he said the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus the born-again experience they dude won't call it begins yeah but what if no no no I've got your number coach begins it no you ain't got me because when it's beginning is not eternal so you're not dealing with that way okay listen and watch what your prophet said in 1956 why are people so tossed about and there's an argument over whether that's the Intervale are the the different ones and there is actually two messages there that instead of just one but now listen see I believe that you believe unto everlasting life I believe that that your acceptance of the Lord Jesus gives you everlasting eternal life when you believe it then I believe by one spirit then you're baptized into the body of believers let's see that's what I said while ago you're gonna automatically jump so don't jump too far just stay with me so you're gonna automatically say Jesus gives you everlasting life when you believe ya that's when you really believe you got sealed in I know the quotes I got them but I better remember this is holding it down because if you don't want to remember that way you're gonna get eternal life and then you're gonna get the baptismal Oh God oh you better read and listen I'm asking you just simply pray and say God what's going on I'm not asking you to deny your faith that's what I've been hollering about so much you know so you try to say something you try to get me to drown my faith ain't tried to get nobody deny the faith I'm trying to see further or not you have the faith so either listen I believe that your acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ gives you everlasting eternal life when you believe it then I believe by one spirit then you're baptized into the body believers you're gonna get to it in a few minutes all right so while you go down to Paul finding certain ones which was a Polish and remember Paul the Holy Ghost had fail but those in Paul under a Polish didn't have the Holy Ghost right so come on he find it upper coasting and he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you haven't believed see your faith anchors you in Christ that's intellectual you believe it you accept it you say that it's right you recognize it to be the truth and you're a Christian and you've got everlasting life by believing it and watch him you've entered to God your own the campgrounds manners fallen and you're eating now remember an account ground you've got to come in to the outer court enter court and the Holy of Holies the outer court is justification so now you're not mourning any justification on you you're just no I'm not confusing you I'm stirring up the confusion that's why it's so hard I know what it's doing I know what it's gonna cost because you're not gonna listen watch what he says go on number 10 little message called you must be born again he's talking about you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you tried you don't know my soul's got to be change here born again you say what about the Holy Ghost brother branham the Holy Ghost baptizes you into the body for service but you believe unto eternal life here at my words and beliefs on him that sent me as he turn alive what's really the scripture says everlasting then you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body for a manifestation of the gifts and so forth but you believe to eternal life now you believe unto eternal life - look how important your believing is and how important it is to keep that believing Judas believed in God Judas his name was written in heaven Judas had gifts but he lost his believing now here's where you're gonna run aground you're gonna try to figure it out right there you're gonna say did it did Judas have eternal life and lost it cuz it sound like brother I'm gonna stay in it you believe you could eternal know he didn't have eternal life you're not listening you're not listening to what I'm saying the thought was what the new birth begins when you believe eternal life begins wait a minute now then may I remind you that one thing is what God is looking at the other thing is what we're looking at right we're looking at it ourselves in one way and garden looking at it another way you remember the thought a minute ago God knows whether or not you're gonna continue to believe now we can go back to the statements and all Wade was talking about it Sunday and we talked about it a lot where people will say you know I always was eternal we know brother Owen said down you know brother Owen said we always was eternal he said if you have eternal life the eternal life you have always was eternal but you didn't have it as a possession right come on so you start to eternal live when you believe but you don't have it as a possession yet you don't have it in reality yet but you've got to start it somewhere and how could your prophet start in any other way then to do that you realize what I'm saying you just read some of the quotes that brother Randall says and he looks like he's the most nationally confused person there's ever been he said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body why would you want to confuse this brother there I'm not trying to confuse you I'm trying to get you to simply think about what you're talking about could you just simply think about that today God crossed your path and called into your heart you started right there believing now we're going to read in a minute we're brother Ron says that you can do that and then you can lose it well now you'll never find him saying you can lose eternal life now if you can find that quote I want it in a hurry she won't find it you can't have eternal life and lose it but you could be in the process of coming to it just remember you got to go through justification and sanctification to come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost what about it okay we read one at number nine ten let's go to number eleven just think of these things cuz it offer the message you know why worse people are so talked about watch what he was explaining when he's in Christ Precure aren t of it in the three courts the justified man out here he walks by daylight and problems with that you're walking in the outer court sure you're eating manna now he's explaining justification right read it sure you're eating manna sure you are a believer sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven truly but what kind of a life are you living he's talking about the outer court that's justification sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven amen justification just believing in God does not give you eternal life but it puts the connection to eternal life if you'll go on okay listen what he says on the next one which is questions and answers and he's answering about the Holy Ghost and the things what therefore the question is that a man is saved and listen to him I believe if he's looking towards Calvary and dies in that state I believe he'll be saved I believe he'd go through if he had the opportunity before he explains the thief on the cross now what do we read you see when God looks down and sees you he sees whether or not we're going through or not he sees and knows whether we believe or not he can go ahead and write her name in the book of life right but yet when we come to the earth we got to go through the process so when you start believing if that believe in don't stop it's going to carry you through now when I'm reminds you of something the last two quotes is written in the order don't remind you of something he never said those people were bribed he didn't say that because he ain't talked to word about them getting the baptism the Holy Ghost he just don't believe in foolish virgins or believers but they don't have eternal life they'll have to be given eternal life at the white throne right we get there believers they evening will wind up giving their life for what they believe to must be something this prophet is trying to express to you and I that's why I said you don't have to preach sealed file miles plagues Daniel seventy weeks and not like that you know how to preach that this preach the simple new birth to me that is the most and I'm going to say it and I'm honest and sincere the new birth of only any experience the baptism in the Holy Ghost is the most misunderstood doctrine that there is well I really hope you just believe it and God gives you the Holy Ghost what if you believe in stops you realize before you receive eternal life you can be a believer and I'm quoting brother Branham and be a child of God and you can lose that Lord but just remember if you keep believing and that believing don't stop now are you following me I'm deliberately moving a whole message backward for you to understand this one point if you're believer and that believer don't that believe in don't stop it's gonna carry you through right if you don't get eternal life here you know you're gonna get eternal life dire oh that's what the foolish virgins do that's you feel sealed you and the thing that's what they do because they don't receive eternal life here they go to the white throne judgment as sheeps and goats how important is it to believe well I believe I like the hip down my unbelief I like that but now watch what do we get two we're on over where we done to livin live me twelve this hitting life now watch you read this the other day it depends upon depends on where your faith stands your salvation is good as long as your confession is good but when your confession drops then your salvation is gone for he is a high priest sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession upon your confession that's what happened your salvation isn't good as long as your confession is good now remember ain't said a word about the bad fuse when the Holy Ghost yet we ain't got dar we're still in the believin stage we're to believe in stage for everybody in the world are you gonna go over and telling people real why they don't believe they might be wind up and show you they believe more than you do we're bad is bad by that I'm saying well you just don't have a new birth my bad as the Pentecostals words on what you've spoken Tom no you ain't got it right you got the bad P as well go well no I don't really know where within you're still lost let me say something to you that I've said one more time one time and I'll say it does if you just listen to who's talking to you you'll find out a lot of meaning and a lot of times I think tell me about this what I'm talking about talking to you and your mister the night and you're praying and you're doing you realize if you're just justified if you just repented of your sins and that's God to forgive you do you believe that that puts your sins and to see if forgetfulness do you believe that all right you won't never have to answer them sins you might go to hell for a lot more but you ain't gonna answer with them back because they're forgiven right there's that right well you realized then you from the day you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior God ain't gonna tell you you're lost so if a voice comes to you and tells you you're lost you ought to know who's talking to you but I'll tell you another thought that goes with it you better listen to them voices because remember one thing I might not have what I need to have but I'm not lost remember the colored lady what he used to be ain't what I want to be or whatever but said one maybe what he used to be but run said she comes somewhere see her believing had brought her to a place what about it have you believed unto eternal life then according to what we've just read back over where we read from the number 12 from hidden life it's your salvation is as good as as long as your confession ain't talking about born again clearly people now talking about believer we're still unbelievers so you jump up and I got this and I got that how'd you get tired I thought if viable said to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved I didn't know it said we come here with eternal life we come here with is we come here with that we don't need nothing we already got it I thought it meant that we come into the world lost but that we started believing and our believing is our confession and God can make intercession upon that confession so listen if we read it alright let's go to what he's explaining let's see if he can explain this part go ahead number 13 I'd ask you to please if you'd listened to the message why are people so talked about or if you want to go to the inner veil there is two messages that they keep rolling it in the it's not here it's over here but you've bring it down there's two messages it's not just one there's an interval and there's a why are people so tossed about he watch down speaking this there is two different types of Christianity's seem strange but I would not say two different types I say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it you ever notice brother Brandon you'll say something about a denominational attorney said they're Christians well now is he live or what's he saying he said they're Christians he's saying they're believers they may not be possessors but they're believers right so listen to him say two different phases the same Christianity two different phases of it now if you remember yourself in this and then come on down to the next one it helped to but just remember what he's saying one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that hard god has given the man in his heart he says the one intellectually is hungry he's feasting on God his fire feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have victory all the time he's explained in two phases of Christianity one of them is a mental believer the other one is a true born-again Christian if you go back and if you'd listened I'll try to lay it out for you and try to help you in every way if you'd listened to a message in 56 Intervale or either the message whatever you want draw the title if you'd listened to it listen very carefully what he's talking about go on then to about the lice of 61 and start picking up some like the the key going into 62 and start picking up 61 you'll pick up you must be born again you read that message all the way through when God's people are so tossed about and if you don't listen and carefully phase what he's saying and talk about you're gonna wind up confused when you get into you must be born again that's when he said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and baptize the end of the body I conclude that he's right what do you mean you can eternal life you need to get baptized into the body no don't mean it I mean just what he says he said the baptism with the Holy Ghost don't make you no more a Christian then once you honor where do we read out that the baptism with the Holy Ghost don't make you no more Christian your prophet now you're just confusing well all right go ahead and number number 14 diseases and afflictions he's talking about forever proves that you'll see the night after night someone said does the healings last they last as long this faith last but when faith fails then your healing will fail we agree with that you agree that you can be healed or something today and die that same thing tomorrow you need that quote but dude would you believe that going with it would you say now listen would you say ever person that came to the altar and got converted would be a Christian all their days he could be tonight a child of God and tomorrow be a child of the devil it's when he loses faith in God what sends him back nice purse strong in it very strong that he could be - not a child of God and tomorrow he's a child of the devil but it's based on his believing go ahead to 14 a conferences 1961 he's talking about yeah so the judge dismissed the case he's talking about in Florida I'm pretty soon you know I'm you know about Jack Cole and the things or the boy walk and and they asked anybody ever they told look as long as he was walking he was all right but when he began to doubt down he went and that's just how long divine healing lasts as long as you believe it and that's how long salvation lies just as long as you believe it but brother Dale you can we don't need to know we don't need to hear these things you tell me where to take out and move over and do about that I thought we're supposed to believe everything the Prophet says I didn't know it had okay go to next one ministry explained go to the next one 4:15 how does divine healing it is does it last all the time in life just as long as faith life and salvation lights the same way just as long as faith life's when you feel that you're not saved anymore you're not safe first by faith are you saved through grace is it right when you come to the altar what do you do you confess your sins and that's God to forgive you and then in your heart now get it in your heart you have to believe that he is forgiving you is that right you have to be have to believe that then you walk away from the platform and then you have to confess it first that you're saved you can't just keep it under a bushel you'll lose it right now you've got to confess it until everyone that you're glad no matter there's nothing to what about I like this one and maybe they'll help you to understand go to 16 taking the five identification did you know you said well brother around them I believe will listen and I'll never receive the Holy Ghost no you don't believe yet now I'll read the rest that you are just believing on to belief that's a great state you have hope mental faith is where you start from you can lose mental faith because there's nothing more than hope but when mental faith according the Black Sea since name has been made a spiritual revelation you can't lose it so you can't have eternal life and lose it which you can have mental believing that would be called Christianity because the new birth by most everybody because eternal life because remember if it goes home it will come out to eternal life but may I quote wrote a random 147 Church age book very few people believe all the way to receiving the Spirit of God so you're listening mental believing does not give you eternal life while your prophet would use it in that form it's between him and God other than one time if that mental faith don't stop and keep keep you keep on believing it will come out to eternal life one day or you go by the grave and come up to white drum because you're not finishing the eternal life till you believe in - what do you say you're believing on - belief now what am i trying to say the biggest portion of Christian world's religion salvation is mentally believing it mentally believe it and mentally believing they have it because they believe it and they have it they believe it's because of something happened they done this they done that they believe the message they do this whatever so what is the prophet saying I'm not through reading yet going to 16 hey the message the inner veil and the reason I'm telling you there's two of those because one of them is listed in Jeffersonville the other one is listed in purchase Michigan there's two types that they're playing with trying to tell you this and not this one it's not that okay look don't know narrow minded you put a pencil between your eyes behind it that is nearsighted salvation is lice as long as faith lies and divine healing life is long it's faith life you just got to experience 40 years ago forget you ever had the experience and go out here tonight and say now listen I don't even believe in it and I'm not God's servant no more watch how long your experience lies you understand what he's saying go out and say you don't believe it what happened to the man in the church age book he was born again Christian when went out and got him some beer sat down he went off saying go and try it but listen divine healing lysed what's going down and read come on it the next I think that's the one yeah sixteen be going up alright you go the Queen of Sheba how many Chris how many as Christians per house ninety-five percent or maybe 100 percent raise up their hands there Christian as long as you believe that all right but the minute that you begin to think that you're not that's the time you start sinking right there that's the time your testimony is negative divine healing life's just as long as your faith life with it your salvation the same because everything of God is by faith brother Branham knew the biggest portion of the people that was listening to him were not Holy Ghost feel true born-again Christians don't you agree but yet he'll say they're Christians and they are did he say if they die like that with that confession as that way they're going to heaven yes what about it church that's how long divine healing life's as long as you believe it and that's how long salvation life's too so I'm done on the message just as long as you believe it don't worry about it I got some more on here let's go over to number 19 and try to conclude something then broader bring a thought together to where we can understand are y'all 19 but now as far as having eternal life this is question as an answer don't Hebrews and being a Christian you're our Christians the moment you believe now that's not make-believe I told you I had it in here okay that's truly believe on the Lord Jesus and accept him as your personal Savior you're born again right there and have eternal life God comes into you but be careful this statement is right but here's Paul with a house policy that were not born again believers doing brother branham's preaching you got to listen to what he's talking about he's talking to people that are sitting there that claiming their salvation is based upon something they believed shouted spoke in tongues cried right and he's trying his best to get them to listen to what he's saying the Yeti ain't gonna die Christianize them they said a moment ago if you've got one thing in God he'll never say that you don't have anything he'll always say you need more but he'll never deny what he's already given you now listen let's go down to the next questions and answers now before you receive the Holy Ghost listening now before you receive the Holy Ghost you are believing unto eternal life I told you we've come to the end of it and bring it back in the right order but you do not have eternal life until you receive the Holy Ghost because it is eternal life the Holy Ghost is God is God life in you then you've got eternal life do you understand now you see you're believing untrue til you get to hold the ghost you're believing untrue but you're believing untrue then what are you trying to say what's the prophet trying to say don't stop believing Church whatever you do don't get so down and out in mealy-mouthed his brother for Nia says Rousey wowser you don't get down into all of that and say well what have I got but I said at least tell the devil you got something when he comes and tell you you don't have nothing don't say well what are you trying to tell me about it farther if I don't have nothing because my nothing and your nothing would be together what about it because the next message we're going to take up to show you there more what the prophets talking about what we've got to get this settled tonight the next message we're gonna take up where brother Branham said and the Bible says it that no man can call Jesus a Christ except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost until it is the baptism when the Holy Ghost you're saying what somebody else says it is not personal to you so don't worry about it we're not gonna leave dangling we're gonna leave it on the line of what we can get because your name this is the last one go over to 21 he's talking about you just come back rejoicing all of them the names don't rejoice that the devil to subject you but rejoice because your names are written in the book of life now if you notice and take Daniel also because your name is on the book a lot because it is in heaven your name has been recognized Judas was there so just because your name is in heaven don't mean you have eternal life you don't have to have eternal life for your name to be listed in heaven are you reading oh come on you don't have to have eternal life you're denying to be least in that Judas his name was listed in heaven and he didn't have eternal life okay come on cause your name your name has to be wrecked has been recognized your names recognizing them that still doesn't mean that you are saved you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost now remember these are 59 but this is 64 he said what are you talking about I'm talking about a prophet that stood back there and I'm gonna say it so listen a prophet stood back guard with a message as I was trying to explain a moment ago that he stood there with a message and he understood that there was an adoption to come he understood that there was manifested sons and daughters to come read Intervale he said I want to build people into that image Intervale 56 he knew what he was bringing but how could he explain it to the people he was talking about adoption all the way back you talking about where he said I can come pro proof from from let's see 19 and 54 is the first time he gives the scripture that no man can call Jesus Christ now remember because see it's wrong it's when it's in the computer no man can call Jesus the Christ Bible doesn't say that the Bible doesn't say no man can call Jesus the Christ it doesn't say that it says you can't do that it doesn't say you can't call it says you can't say no man can say that jesus is the cross it's not a difference in but my point is you can't find it if you go in the message quoting you can't find brother Branham using but three times then no man can say that jesus is the christ i'm talking about explaining that scripture the other times is 24 times that he uses that no man can call jesus the christ murder Branham was preaching adoption in 1960 yet II didn't understand I'm saying it that way you say I'm throwing I'll do whatever I'm just as honest as I can say it I don't believe he understood what he was saying you said the aad Goines say what you want to about me I'm saying it the way I think because remember Jesus grows in grace and knowledge so nothing you ain't gonna argue with me about it that run around come here knowing everything cuz I ain't gonna argue with you by don't tell you wrong I'm gonna tell you he said he didn't but he growed as he was trying to bring adoption he couldn't fit that together in the early 50s he comes into the light more into the 55 and he don't get to hear him until about 56 and under here um you are born again when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost eternal life and then you are baptized into the body for the gifts where do we get there that's the answer to the whole time that's what he's been teaching all the way through all the way to he through he was teaching that you can get eternal life by believing on Jesus Christ but then he's wanted to see a church they would have the baptism of the Holy go do you know what he said about ministers he said you can't even preach do you get the baptism in the old ago ain't talking about just accepting Jesus Christ he said well what are you trying to do look that still doesn't mean that you're saved you're not converted until you receive the old ago remember you're only potentially converted you remember that you asked me for an oak tree I'll give you an acre potentially when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior truly believe now not make-believe you've reached the stage that your sins are wiped away according to future all what you have is a potential remember potential is like asking for an oak tree I give you an acre I gave you what will bring the oak tree when you first started believing on Jesus Christ listen and you'll understand why your prophet stated it so much because you he's the one that said you believe into eternal life when you believe in to eternal life you get the earnest of your inheritance an earnest is the same as a potential when you receptive Jesus Christ as your Savior really meant it now not haphazard Li but really meant it God took your word he wrote your name in I know where brother Ron says it from home it's under sanctification is your name goes on the book at a believer at sanctification Judas's name went under in heaven at sanctification Judas was a believer but he proved it is believing wasn't correct I hope you're following me when you believe that a run said drive that stake down he said because you want to tell the devil right there the day you believed on Jesus Christ as your Savior as far as God is concerned you have eternal life I said it right Oh what I meant as far as God is concerned you have eternal life as far as we are concerned we don't possess it you know that brother Ron says potentially you have the resurrection inside of you he said Buddhists got to come out so you understand why the Prophet would say it he said you believe in to eternal life he said sure your Christian said sure you're going to heaven if you die like that but remember if you start here to make your journey and that journey ends before the rapture you were not a possessor of eternal life if you just believe it if you're just believing you're not a possessor you're a foolish virgin you look out here and listen church he'd listen and think about it I know it's hard trying to get across what do you think that I've been doing for weeks the people of this world there's good people out there there's people out there that make us ashamed of ourselves about a Christian life a great man passed away this day Billy Graham it was never nothing that I knew of or anybody that I know told me of any mark that was ever put against a man is anybody know of any don't know of any mark that has ever put against Billy Graham I'm not gonna tell you Billy Graham did now the only go kind of reverence he did but he was set aside for a job to be one of the two witnesses that would be one of the to witness it would not have anything to do with the Abraham and the Covenant of the seed a great land past home a milestone was reached as you could call it it's all right let's just remember he was a great believer do you understand what it means to be a believer and not have eternal life but to be a believer that is eternal life there's a vast difference you said well brother branham's one that said it if he said it there was some reason for him saying it are you gonna say he was wrong yeah well ago when I see it I don't believe he understood I never had no reference to saying the man was wrong you're a liar if you think so my only reference was one thing I believe brother branham groped in grace and knowledge and I believe this message when we conclude it you'll see the idiot come back in 50 he was trying to preach adoption by trying to preach adoption he would understand how you're born into the family but then on the stature of a perfect man he concluded it and shows you that you're born again at faith and one day there'll be a headstone strike this church it'll fill every fiber of our being and will baptize every one of us into the adoption all stages that have reached that place I said it right they never reached that place that's why the biggest portion is gonna go by the grave I said that 40 years ago I'm not derogatory to anybody because they probably got more faith in you and I yeah it might not be them waiting on us it might be us waiting on them you know Co we ain't there where they were I ain't never said nobody I said it the way the Lord spoke to me the biggest portion of people of this message will die and go by the grave before the rapture I still believe it and I teach it because of what he taught your eternal life that you receive will take you through but you've got to hold on to it you can't lose eternal life the tires were the problems that we could be at the place of confessing eternal life in our soul and not have it you could be a believer unto oh that's wonderful if we keep on believing but if it ends in age or whatever and I don't have that baptism with the Holy Ghost I want my believin to be at least right to where I believe you if I miss it I'll just be a foolish virgin or not no problem but I don't believe it there's got to be somebody gonna stand there and take a change and why not us confess we are then why not do you understand he said when you really believe he said not might believe so you know what a lot of our believing has been Mike believing whatever it's been Mike believing he's what I done to you you're you're going off on then no trying to get you to wake up and say lord help down my unbelief three years they walked with the Lord Jesus being a high they were pretty good believers you know what took him to the upper room are you listening they're believing come on they're believing took him to an upper room then God could come on the scene and fill him with the Holy Ghost they didn't have the Holy Ghost to delete him to the upper room and get off listen they didn't have it that way they were believers unto they potentially had what they needed now I thought about it the other day and I always put these in and I know that mark and Luke's not original come on so don't get under all that with me but you know that it's apples they proved they were true believers they proved you know why God what they started believing when he said Peter come on James John come on it kept them all the way through their life not as they born-again experience but as a believer that had settled in their heart more than mentally thinking it had become a reality they said working we go thou hast the words of eternal life let me at least say that let me at least say what can I do Lord I believe you don't stop believing come on musician don't stop believin Satan comes until you said you're not born again say hey whoa cowboy it'll prove one of these days whether I'm right or wrong and you won't have to face it I like what somebody said one time said when the devil tries to remind you of your pipes that remind to him of his future of what's gonna happen to me he's going to be annihilated he's a pretty good believer you just don't believe all the way that's why the Prophet said very few people will believe all the way now there's millions in the world today claimed to be Christians right there's right at a million in this message they claim to be Christians maybe more but at one time they did say they had a million in Africa are they believers are we believers what do we believe at least we could say I believe Lord you got the words I believe this message he's got the answer I've read and said studied a lot of things just like you just like the point of saying it but around said I can conclusively prove that you are born again and then baptized the end of the body what does he say he's saying very simple don't mind putting it out lets you think you're born again at faith baptize the end of the body of faith that you've got to be baptized into the manifestation of the gifts come on gifts without these virtues is what prophet said a stumbling block they call it stumble block in one of the things that you can't find stumbling they could put expel their stumble block the gifts without the virtuous now how we're going to get two verses letter on them tells us who another motive priest hitting 271 I asked him that question how do we get these virtues if tribulation worketh patience do we whoop the daylights out of each other that's not it but I said how do we get it and 19 in Haiti to the Lord answered my question I know how to get to virtues you can't study yourself into it doesn't have any head knowledge how
