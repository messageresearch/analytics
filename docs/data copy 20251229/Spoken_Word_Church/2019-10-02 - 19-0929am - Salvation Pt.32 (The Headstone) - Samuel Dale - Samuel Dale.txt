just remember him and I'll Lord we thank you for bringing each one of them along and just you've got each one have you a as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts forgive our sins got us in Jesus name Amen 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto all of us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this now besides escaping the corruption besides being a protector of the same things I've been a part of His divine nature and taking home and says now and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness in to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we'll try to try to skip through some of it but seem like it didn't work so we'll go through a little part not review much but do a little and then if you would I ask you to read the message blasphemous names we may not get to it you know right now but we're going to go into it when we get there and see the things and what I'm trying to get you to see it was remind I've had a two or three people to remind me lately of something they heard the Prophet site you ever heard him say you know you can be born again and then be baptized into the body born again baptized into the body that sounds like two parts that sounds like a split condition that sounds like like but you know what that's what I'm trying to get you to see that's what I'm dealing with with second theater that's what I believe second theaters doing first Peter he's done covered that you're you're being born again by the incorruptible Word of God then he comes in to second Peter to start off and telling us about these things that we're partakers of the divine nature and how that those things are there at the new birth and we start our journey add to your faith faith is not an ad faith is a birth so you're born into the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right then these are the things he expects you to add honor growth development are the stature of a perfect man see adding to yours but see it's added to faith all right and bringing it for see from the new birth all the way up that's what I want you to think about today now to where we'll keep it straight because we are just a little background to cover it that see the Prophet teaches in the statute of perfect man he says now how faith and be born again all right that ought to be enough to for us to think about you know how faith and be born again once you're born again at faith you look at the pyramid and you see faith well brother they're left down at the bottom that's right you're gonna try to start your journey to top but the mote had a good point about it he said and brother Howard brother Howell Thomas would tell you in a hurry don't try to miss him rungs on the ladder you're going to get hurt so don't say well I'll just run and jump up here well I just need to be up here I don't need to all this others too I just run up here to talk well now how you gonna get there then you've got to start at the bottom and grow up that would be like a baby saying well okay we just had a baby the other day but what you gonna do well we're not gonna feed it we're not gonna do nothing we just leave it laying there in let's jump up the top by itself it'll it'll feed itself it'll get out and raise a garden and that's our stupidity right see that's what I'm trying to get you to see is that you're born again by faith if Peter was saying and see Peter then covers I've said second Peter he talks about being born again by the corruptible incorruptible Word of God all right and then he comes over to tell us how to become where he was at because he was teaching this statue of perfect man in other words how do we come to that place he was and he says now of them of like precious faith so everybody that has the new birth has like precious faith all right and see by having that new birth being born again he it puts us into the body of Christ and we'll go into adoption next and get into the things but I want you to get into blasphemous names and we'll be covering sister Sheppard's dream and things just to try to cover a little bit on that you know in the next message or so want you to think about butter Braun says have faith and be born again he said that's the foundation he said you laid the foundation by your faith all right in other words then and then when you get to the sister Sheppard's dream you'll hear him say that God accepted her foundation for her beginning because that was the dream and the things that she was worried about whether she had to hold a ghost or not all right we should be concerned today whether or not we have the Holy Spirit more than anything in the world well brother Dale I believe I got it cause I done so and so don't put it on what you doing they'll never put anything with God on what you've done put on there what he says and what he's telling us all right so it's how faith and be born again that's your foundation well then these are the things the Prophet said God expects us to add all right now how are we going to add them you know one time he'll say you add one time he'll save God adds well well yeah that's the way it is God gives us the word as we risk as we study it make it oh you know the part he's made it available and we study it and as we study the word then he can bring these virtues into being into each and every one of us all right and doing it that way cause he deals you know each individually deals differently yes but still it's the same situation the birth is the birth it doesn't matter whether you're 80 years old ten years old whether you're this that or the other the birth is the same it's the birth of the word all right see then that word is it's made alive into our hearts that foundation is what holds us up and then we're being born again and that's what I said we'll get into that word brother branham will cover he says I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body well that's exactly right but that sounds odd doesn't it sounds like it can't be but let's wait and see that we'll get to the things of avoids doing because a you know some more have said some have said something about that so I see that it it's a valuable point but to feel listen that's what I'm trying to get you to see now you're born again at faith and then each one of these virtues is baptized into you by an addition of the Word of God being revealed until it comes out to the headstone all right and see when it comes out to that then it comes to the basis of where we need to be because that headstone was rejected back under what is promised to come in the end time all right now then you say well what is the headstones of the church let's wait till we get it because if I'll say it like this or you can listen if the new birth faith is the foundation would not that be as the Prophet said that there are all the same material would not the headstone be the same thing as the cornerstone is that not according to scripture that he's ahead of the corner see it's the same thing it's the same material you don't take one material and vulcanize it to another one you can't do that it's got to be the same material all right so faith and then coming to the headstone would that not be the revealed Word of God I'm just asking you sensibly to think if the cornerstone are the the foundation is the word revealed to you and you tell me what it would be outside of that I'm welcome to you to tell me to come and tell me you're duty-bound to come and tell me if you don't agree with that point I'm not trying to get somebody to agree I'm trying to get you to listen to what the prophets say it then that's that between you and God and I can't reveal it the Prophet can't reveal it you can only speak on it alright but if it's the same material then faith being the foundation are a revelation then what would be the headstone it's simple to me now I mean I'm sorry if to say it that way I'm not degrading you I'm just saying this it's simple it has to be simple for me to understand it because I'm simple-minded I'm very simple in that point you say well oh you've got a deep understand no I'm very simple-minded because I take everything simple I love to hear the Prophet explain things and it doesn't bother to me for him to explain it over and over and over how that you're a father you're a son and you're a human and that just makes one of you well you know what I can understand that right that you try to figure it out you can't understand it and I can understand it being the simplicity that he's just one because I'm just one and now we're getting it to where we can follow the line and and be right in line with the whole thing alright but now listen remember it's the same material which means it's the alive word is your faith or new birth so then the headstone would have to be what the alive word see that's where I came up to the virtue have come up to to love their Sunday and just stopped it off because I knew I couldn't continue to bring the rest of the message you remember I told you keep the notes because we wouldn't go and get high void on well that's what I'm wanting you to do see the alive word the word made alive in you was what Jesus was trying to do to the disciples he planted that word into those disciples then the Holy Ghost came under their Pentecost and made that word alive right and there was the new birth the alive word what is the new birth to never individual the alive word yeah but I've done this shouting I cried oh you're not talking about the new birth I'm talking about the new birth I'm talking about those things are just outward manifestations that you're talking about that's why Paul could come along and say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed well I believed it brother Dale I believed it and I accepted Jesus Christ my say Amen but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe brother Brennan says saying having previously believed do you now have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but see if you don't like for me to talk about the baptism in the Holy Ghost you know what I'm gonna tell you you don't have it that's as simple as I can put it I don't have to be interpreted it's just truth that's what I said I love to hear someone talking about their experience of the new birth I believe in shouting I believe in emotions I believe in all form of of and as I gave you through that in the series brother Brennan said a dead baby will work you know this is a dead Oh what we're just dead up at Lulla I don't agree with that because as long as the live words here then God is here now if the live word ain't here guard ain't here we need to go somewheres else that's as good as I can put it we all need to leave go somewhere else if it's not the alive word well see I can't depend on nothing but the alive work yeah but we just don't shout we don't do that I'll say it and you can take what you want to about it like I said well what's that another one you said yet they're really they're emotional over here uh-huh but remember what the prophets say what did he say he said just remember it don't matter how high you jump who said you gotta walk straight you come down right you said with it now we go down here and we've got the word well that can kill you too cause the letter kill it and the spirit giveth life so let's get in the middle somewhere and have a wonderful time about what luck God is revealing to us but always remember one time it's the word first then your emotions because emotions proceeding are coming before the word then how do you know where the words right or not what we was going over to a certain church years ago and his brother said and he said brother mote said he's coming over that he's gonna preach farce and he said means to call this brother other brother tonight said he's coming on Friday night no he said brother loads coming on Friday night and said this brother is coming on Saturday night and then it kind of you know because he knew the situation he was in one was a great emotional form of a person the other one was brother Moke under you know like me kind of dry hide I guess you'd call it you do what you want to but anyhow he having it he said a brother boats gonna be here and he'll tell us what to do which said brother so-and-so be will be shouting he said well we'll know what shout about the brother motor tell us what shout about so didn't we shout well that's what they've done man and one lady one lady done a good two step for the longest huh I thought that's pretty good that's you she had her ourselves just right but anyhow I'm making like just being me and listen what is then we come through the virtues and are covering each one of them there this past Sunday afternoon especially at that point all right I mean dispatch winds team all right we were covering the virtues how the Prophet was covering each one of them and showing and I remember what we gave you we gave you the death nation the Prophet gave of the virtues because the the depth definition in Webster is is not the same as the Prophet gave it maybe part of it what the Prophet would say you know said now this this virtue said it's it's not just being a virgin said not in this case well I mean he believed in being that and been straight right well what was his point this has a different form of meaning and he said it means to be strength right instead of just being chaste to T or this that or the other body it means to be strength all right then we went over just giving you a couple of minutes to see if so some of these others were what we're doing that we went over to like patience and then you know temperance and remember we got into temperance well that's a good one cuz run around said now that's not not the factor drinking alcohol you know that's what Webster give you the definition of temperance he's not to drink an alcohol see now why is he saying these things like it's not tasty and it's not just like that of being temperance of the definition of the word because he's given you the Bible definition he's giving you the Holy Ghost definition of the virtues all right and the Holy Ghost definition come on it's like I said well what are we doing see as dumb as I am I can see the prophet standing there looking and he said I don't have to cover virtue the way that Webster says Webster I'll tell you know it's virginity y'all right come on he said another word is he sayin I don't have to cover that you know why cuz it's supposed to be Christians there's not supposed to be they have to run the definition of virtue in the natural lineage of the thing of the world or what it means we shouldn't have that to start with and temperance what we shouldn't have that to start with we shouldn't have to be told about the temper you know it's a prophecy said an uncontrollable temper whatever those Christians never brought it down we don't have a temper well watch your face and get rid come on don't play woman the eyes don't play with you we just talk plain you know you tell me so I don't have no problems well I just tell you right up front you're a liar is that enough is that plenty enough to understand it you tell me you don't have no troubles within they something wrong with you pray for me now that's the best way I can say it because I know what happened with me because I thought the Prophet was the one to tell us he said when you get born again the devil will point ever gun he's God at you is that right whatever temptation ever trial everything's gonna be there you ever brother dealer I'm a Christian I'm not more I'm not that way I know how no no trials are troubled you're louder that's the best way to say it if you'd ask the Lord Jesus about it that's brother branham about the Lord Jesus did your prophet say that Jesus was tempted with women over brother Dale you're not bringing that out your prophet said it he just didn't yield to the temptation right nothing wrong with temptation long as you don't yield to temptation is a part of life you know you can't be human beings without things how about being a husband and wife and and having children that wouldn't work out too good if you didn't I know okay now why don't we leave that now listen then as I said we were covering the virtues and what each one of them were and went through that Wednesday night covering what those virtues were by the Prophet know now for me and you but by the Prophet all right then coming up - and I spent just a little bit of time whenever we clipped it to the to the capstone are the love and I've wondered if I went back listening to the tape you know and I wonder did you listen to what I was trying to explain maybe you don't pay much attention to certain ways or things but to me it's just part of my nature to do brother Brennan spent a lot of time on faith virtue knowledge temperance patience decent amount of godliness but when he gets brotherly kindness very little it's sad now he's a few pages in the book you read very little it said when it comes to love I know we're ministers and we don't work out but a lot of times I agree with you that we ought to take the end of the sermon first and preach it and then preach the first of the sermon lysed and I agree that that would probably be better to make to where you could understand but it don't work that away you know you understand what I'm saying the Prophet spent a whole lot of time here but yet when he gets over here he's running out of time yes we know that but you know what he wouldn't ever know to good at running out of time right he just kept on going specialist Tabernacle and hitting divider didn't bother him to go another hour so on something did you listen to think about what I'm saying see if the time you come from faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience godless brotherly kindness you know you're coming up the pyramid you know you're coming up the stature of a perfect man you know you don't shouldn't have to say a lot about the other things because you ought to know you're to know that the love of God is in our heart as a Christian world of call on God and thank him for the fact that the way the Prophet would express it to us within come to the point of telling us about love and is that cor said the headstone was rejected right he said it hadn't come yet well that was back in 62 he said it hadn't come yet well and then he talks about the capstone of love now I'll repeat the wording again if the foundation is the revealed word would not the headstone be the revealed word I mean that shouldn't take a lot to have us to understand you no matter what you take it in line of what you're putting it you know what I've got to have we're gonna respect this we for whatever you're putting it I think I ain't dealing with that I'm dealing with what it is right you say well I'm expecting this all right come on get where I'm talking about because I'm expecting to he said brother day we've never heard yeah you've heard me over and over say what the Prophet said he said one day God will fill this church with his fullness of his being take us in the rapture we don't have to worry about what it is he's already told us he said it would take such a baptism of the Holy Ghost said it would fill every fiber of our being he said brother Taylor you mean you're looking for that yes I have a right to look at it because it's mine it's for me I have a right to believe it he spoke it to me alright Church then what about it what would be the capstone if the cornerstone is faith well now you can't make the cornerstone faith and then the headstone something different right no if that's what you think then you're not in them you're not in the channel I'm talking in because I don't believe that never have I'll always believe one thing this is the one thing I believe in I'm gonna say it and then we'll talk about it a little bit your prophet come and brought a message he started back there in the 40s and he was trying to preach the things that God was revealing to him right he gets over to the stature of a perfect man in 62 and he said 30 years or 33 something like he'd been preaching that well you know if it took in 30 years to preach it evidently we didn't know it we didn't accept it show me the Pentecostals accepted his message what I talking to you about the other day you say well this and that the other Billy Graham brought around and said nobody could touch Billy Graham in the message he had to preach of salvation but he didn't have a message he didn't have a message like this prophet had he come with the Word of God and laid it out on the table in front of mankind and said all right now you come and show me where I'm wrong he had the message of Malacca forward right so then all the way up through there he was trying to preach go back to Intervale 56 elected Intervale and listen to him talk about a living moving instrumentality of a human being that had come to a position to walk in Christ and come all the way up to the message listening to his growth development sure he'll get on over to Locke mm maybe I miss it but it would be someone but he says you must be born again and you know we start saying things that are odd to people he starts talking about that you must be born again and then baptized into the body and we think he's all messed up he starts bringing things closer and closer and when he gets up for like stature of perfect land look what he was doing look where he stood he said no not knowing this the other day they got this up in the woods up there about this drawing how this feed into what I was going to preach so he was already preaching it listen he was already preaching the statue of a perfect man he just didn't how the tying together of all the scriptures and the things then as it began to tie together he brought it on out further and further until it made it to the people when listening to the statue of a perfect man you know what I'm talking about true the doctrine is especially still in the foreign fields that you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost until you get all these virtues you're not born again the doctrine it until you get all them virtues I can't say that but if you wait until you get all of them you're gonna be waiting and die come on that's why I told you before you can lock it or what and I believe God spoke to me and said most of the people of this message even born-again Christians are going dying go a grave because they can't take what the prophets say whether you like that or not that's no business to me I just tell you what he say it and that's 40 some years ago because what I saw back then is what I see now people that are sitting dull and no wonder the people think that we're dead at Lully you said so Dryden uh don't know it's like you're scared it's like you're afraid of what I'm saying like if you think that I'm trying to lead you wrong well if that's what you think you need to go somewheres else come on church ain't no problem do you think that I'm trying to scare you into do know I'm trying my best to repeatedly we preach over and over and over to try to get us to see the truth of the message of the hour that profit bringing that message that it began to progress more and more and more and more that he comes up to the statue of a perfect man then he gets up to let's say one rot for the seals mmm services it's the time now there's a department you know one of them stayed in one way one in the other but surgeries it's the time and he starts talking about the great things that are laying just ahead cuz remember that was the visions and things when he was to go west and connect with the Angels and come back and the thing was being brought into that on and he's he did he begin to speak of things he began to say it like this he'd say serves is this the time as it is those sunders wants to cap off the church you remember that first what time it is these those thunders there to cap off the church the things that we didn't don't know if I'd heard he begin to see there was things he didn't know he preached the seals in what was it 60 somewhere right in there where he preached to see what you remembered he preached it like one just preached like real fights through it somewhere right in there is he preached that and you still holding it to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost right but then you begin to see it fangs unveil further and further on into the message then you'd say if what you want to but I'm gonna say it this way and mean it he began to grow into the stature of a perfect man I believe that I believe he began to grow but he was a prophet prophets has to grow especially this prophet did he get into the statue of perfect man and say Lord fill me up these are the things God expects us to add didn't you read the statue of a perfect man okay now listen did he get over into the message of the statue of a perfect man and he says this now I'm not asking them to pull them up because I don't know whether they've got him if they have it'll be number one if you can pull it up if not then we'll just read it I passed out and had Terrence now anybody you still got him there's we gave out and we've made about 30 copies look if you don't have one you won't one get it later of the quote for today because we didn't know where we were gonna be able to use the computer parks okay so then you you get one of them if you don't we'll make you a copy on the statue of a perfect man paragraph 328 building this monument building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue and knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controlled and he is the strip that they were one of these things right yes sir right in here right in here see I got in between all these works in here now what's he got in between the words the Holy Spirit right in between this and this between the body and the head he's got the Holy Spirit look what he says not in between these works and here and you're these little waves now that'll go with sister scheppers bless me miss names if you'll get into that but a little waves come what is that now listen to Al and the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ well that's exactly what he's got he's got love coming down through the Holy Spirit which this is Christ right okay now listen the Holy Spirit is above all this welding this together there's he headstone building what a perfect search for the capstone to cap it off no now listen to what he's saying what it's been done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven church messengers now remember from the Chrysler mystery there's a statement in there to where he says you know as the individual grows so does the church you remember that you remember reading that the Statue of a perfect man as the church come up and done and progressed through the ages the individual comes up so the church comes up the same way all right what faith virtue or knowledge temperance places to Wesley Luther West and all of the time it comes up the church comes up the same way as the individuals what through the revealed word right through the revealed word he goes on through paragraph 358 and we'll go down to 360 save time so when you surrender your complete being now listen to it then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living tabernacle then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue or knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love and of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who who knows what they're talking about you never seen a kinder sweeter a godly or person you're sealed seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seals just the sign there you are see when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost all right when the headstone unites with the body it will seal all the whole thing together and you remember how that we've taught it many many years just a little point for you to understand it don't mean nothing maybe to you but it sure does to me if you drop that headstone down it ain't gonna fit at the top of that pyramid so just leave it where it's at that's what he's saying the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ leaving worse at if you drop it down look what you got well don't you just fill in the side and let him seal the whole thing right that is the body of Christ that's the individual of the statue of a perfect man well all of those things sealed in and that is the body of Christ bust through the church ages to bring it all to the correct place right bless me mister items first foundationally is faith second add to your faith virtue to divert your knowledge to your knowledge temperance from temperance patience to patience godliness and from God in this brotherly love brotherly kindness and then to love being the capstone seven of those things seven church agency and seven stars of this church ages you know the messengers and all of it is tempered together by the Holy Ghost listen now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ build his church in seven Church ages his bride a person a woman Church seven Church ages constitutes and make the bride some out of this I'm out of that some of that altogether shaping it up to period now you're listening what is the cornerstone they remember that we used to talk with that in the denominations how that the cornerstone was Jesus Christ standing there but it becomes a full headstone later on because we could even study that because it says that the cornerstone has to become the head of the corner all right it's got to go all over and be the same stone the cornerstone and the headstones the same stone is this the position of which the stone is in you know the headstone and the cornerstone take your your drawing you look at the headstone then you take your drawing and you do that Rutter and that cornerstone is exactly the same as I write the cornerstone is the headstone it's just according to the manifestation it was a cornerstone the Prophet said in the church unless see if I can get it he said in the full church it'll be the headstone believe that's ask perforation it was close it'd be the full church alright what's the full church you and I the end of all things the bride of Jesus Christ in the full church the kingdom that's the point we're at where we're at now walking in these things and thinking about it but then I'm gonna just drop it and I'm gonna leave this with you cuz this part I don't have a quote that tells you the Prophet said so and so verbatim I can give you a lot of all things but any word about it I'm just gonna tell you go see to me if the cornerstone and the headstone is the same stone if the entire pyramid is the same material and if it all is the revealing of the Word of God no that's what I believe I believe it's the revealing of the Word of God faith is a revelation of Jesus Christ but in the full church it'll be the revelation of Jesus Christ a mystery where brother Brian said how is it let's see if I can get it he said in other words it's 33 some across some history but he says what is the new birth he said it's a revelation Jesus Christ personally to you but right above there he covers how that the word is so and so and the word of it and the word in the fullness is in the bride now here's where we're at see that's why we die when we come forth with the word we die if we don't accept something and go on go see you say I don't see it I know I've made you upset at me for saying it so go ahead get upset I'll tell you want you bring the book of Acts up here and put us back dar and let's see what they do you say in the book of life that they had bring them down here where they got ten thousand demons to fight where they got two thousand thousand demons to fight against when they only had the Pharisees and Sadducees and the hero D under which one bring them down here they'll be glad to go back where they were to giving their life did your prophet say the church always does better under what persecution we'd be better off where we were being persecuted I'll never form at least we would be trying but instead we just die cuz we don't see it maybe you don't know what you're looking for mm-hmm okay hey brother though then give us your statement then Oh what you think the headstone really is because I believe this ever since I come in the message and begin to study it if the cornerstone is the revealed word the headstone will be the revealed word that's where I stand all right he stood during 62 preaching the statue of perfect man laying it perfectly in order and he says she's waiting on the headstone what would be the headstone to the church well this brother so-and-so he'll come out and walk out here and will be or it's just so here or set over to ours he's looking for people what is the headstone for the church did not the prophet sister Shepherds dream with off the top look down in the pyramid and what do you see no right but he saw the seven seals you had to go west and come back now here's what's gonna flop hard and if you're thinking brother branham said in Daniels 70 week message if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you can not understand the seals the plagues the vowels of trumpets in time but nobody wants to know anything about Daniel 70 weeks remember Daniel 70 weeks was preached before the seals statue a perfect man is preached before the seal okay what do you think is the headstone brother there I believe it's those seven seals you tell me what it would be those seven seals comes off the entire body of Christ I thought the seven seals was the plan of redemption and we're wrong there I thought that's what the prophets said that it was the plan of redemption we'll see then brother then what do you do then what are you saying I'm saying if we don't understand the foundation back here and walk from faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness coming up to the headstone then when the headstone come we wouldn't know nothing about it and that's where most people are because they know nothing about it they reject the seals oh they'll follow it one two three four five maybe maybe in Flour it through the sixth seal but then they get to the seventh and miss the very little things and I'm just saying there's come on musician miss the simple little fine little random what is the Seventh Seal he said it's the coming of the Lord now whatever that consists of ain't got to do with it do you understand me what that consists of is not up to me it's up to God what is the Seventh Seal the coming of the Lord the revealing of his word what is the seven seals the complete plan of salvation the revealing of his word I've taught that now for fifty almost fifty years and I believe it more today than I did when I started and how many of you to remember the first sermon the priests you ever remember the first sermon of priests there's an Athens Georgia brother learning in was probably the earth I preached what that the bride of Jesus Christ according to the Prophet and I read it and I'll be glad to read it to you again that the Son of Man the revealed word the bride of Jesus Christ will be the son of man brother Branham was not the son of man I stand the same way I stood that day there and I stood for 30 minutes or more pounding up on the basis of saying hey wait a minute now brother Branham is a son of man the Lord Jesus is the Son of man but when the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell into the bride which would put it into brother Branham first and be able to bring it out through him through the teaching of the word in God revealing it to you and I and would bring us all into it and bring the fullness of the Godhead bodily into the Browder Jesus Christ I stand the same time do you think people want to hear it I went to one church outside of this message I mean outside of this year I went to one church and preached on the seals only got four I'm gonna go no father see none listen if your prophets right that's for you then he says you can't understand the seals until you understand Daniel seventy weeks now words the ministry preaching on the Daniel seventy weeks they're scared of it afraid of it they afraid to approach it oh they do a lot of things yell then they make it look good boy let's see you bring it from Daniel 70 weeks before he said that he said you don't understand the seal sometimes do you understand that you see you say well brother Dale what is the headstone to the church the revealing of God's Word and the revealing of God's Word is the revealing of those seven seals which is the complete plan of redemption given to the bride of Jesus Christ the one thing that was left out in the finishing of the Bible Jesus came and stood there in his weeks time I said it right weeks time or highs and stood and preached to the Jews and told them who was to be walking where the the headstone and what it was and they rejected it the now bride has rejected the teaching of the seals the afraid of it afraid of Daniel seventy weeks now this is one you love in a message called the seals run around and preached a message and later came back to that and this is what he said he said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals the Moriah marriage and divorce he said was revealed in the seals but worst people want to hear about marriage and divorce now they do they'd rather go on and take their changes upon anything they can place it instead of sitting down talking about it and letting it be put together from the beginning to the end why don't we write we're afraid of the thing that has come to set us free which is the reveal Word of God think of these times less tan well we got bread i apprec every father i apprec [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] door [Music] heavenly fire hi seven feels faint [Music] the profit minor to me [Music] [Applause] do [Music] probably come to expound upon leave me [Music] [Applause] Wow probably other apostles prophets evangelists pastors date further perfective are bringing these things into the body well if we turn that down we're not God Kenny you can't go before God and say I try to do everything [Music] that's not trying to make nothing out of anybody go there in five minutes I'll listen to anybody that probably takes and listen and do it I don't listen to nobody else unless something comes along that's valuable for me here something I'm concerned about you I'll listen to a brother preach on him to be able to say I heard that myself miss Eleanor bitching put in a lot of the five four minutes or I wouldn't truck that's no problem the Bible says they have ministers of righteousness Satan has not ball givers they got away from that preaching the higher to dress the clothes got down to getting these little bitty things I'm saying now what the profit was wrong well how can you trust anything that was wrong the jerk I am NOT Sun to try to declare the gospel unto you when they said let's boot on the internet I said no I said I will get in arguments and I'm not gonna argue with nobody it's not will get it just loads of junk coming through thank God it hadn't come well what do you think I think God's kept his word I think he's gonna bring forth a little bride it's gonna be a small bride and ain't gonna be worldwide and millions of people now and I ain't against evangelizing I we send out we go out we do so you can't say I'm against it when this trait transform I believe the headstone was preached by the Prophet Nate none of us got any ride to go in there and try to do anything change anything or do any part that's not a fivefold ministry if you are a fivefold ministry and try that just let it be known that I'm saying you're not one of them because they're genuine fivefold ministry is gonna stay with the problem they won't have the province ministry no not looking forward to it but they'll have what God gives them and they'll bring forth the Word of God and God will come to that and join himself to that word you see that's worth it I've always tried to get you involved you remember years ago when the brother had a dream he saw the pillar of fire floating among the church he would see it now and then then one day he said I've got something to say well if you'll let me say it I said say it he gave him the pulpit he said I would stand in the air and said I saw the pillar fire was here who brother Dalyan but said it went out toward the back they meant he didn't say it went out the door he said it went out toward the back a couple of Ministers from here declared that the Holy Ghost was leaving us but that pillar of fire was going out I said you didn't listen he didn't say it without the door he said it went back that's what I've always tried to do I worked the Holy Ghost is in me that teaches me this word were to go back to you that's my desire ready to be in you it's not me it's not us it's all look together the brighter cops or Lord I want that holy spirit to float among you and beating you cuz that's the only hope through God well I'm looking for this that that ain't done I ain't done away with anything you're looking for now you come and tell me for I owe you said without looking children well that's all right ain't never said nothing wrong in that line I've always said it you've spoken it that's it you said you expecting the profit ray I'm expecting the profit to raise and then he'll be here with us 30 40 days and he could preach to us and then we're going in the rapture I've always talked that and that's what I've always believed that's one so they don't don't accuse me of trying to say well this is wrong with that Iran I saying it I'm saying what I've always said what about it jerk father you know this has been on the heart thirtysomething sermon to go Lord knowing that have to come down to say thanks just put it down to what I believe Lord thank God for the Prophet to come to bring us the word the opening of those seals as it would come down and reveal all the secret mysteries marriage and divorce the rapture the thing was revealed in the seals thank God for the truth have you away just go with a nun myself as we travel up the road lord give us a safe journey that wouldn't be all right we love you we thank you forgive our sins if I said something wouldn't write to forgive me cuz you know my heart's right the desire has always have been there for that to try to help the people and to get us to see what you want us to hear have your way in Jesus name you dismiss [Applause] [Music] you I love you [Music] about before [Music]
