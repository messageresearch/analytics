makes a big difference gonna be in the house of the Lord I'm gonna have each and every one of you here today Nate you took one step out of this run the whole thing so now I'm gonna use it we're gonna sanctify this with the Word of God and my finger some and that some I told him to leave it up here I want to get some of that anointing from what was this morning that was a good job a man that was a good job good job by way of announcements we need to remember the Father's Day fishing trip we're gonna have June the 17th through the 19th if you don't have your little packet brother Joel you still got something somewhere he's in the back all right if you need to know where to go what to do see you brother Joe Canada and that will be June 17th we'll be leaving here right after service Sunday afternoon and be staying Monday and part of Tuesday in Lake Hartwell which is at two below state parks so I hope some of you older ones can come brother deck we got a place you can come if you want to want to come we sure would love to have you and the rest of you say brother Colley said he's coming so man remember tomorrow is Memorial Day is for the there was some confusion this morning Memorial Day is not it's not for people that are alive this for the ones that's passed on okay so we're honoring the ones that have given the ultimate sacrifice amen so we thank God that we never had to serve but we thank God that some did Amen right that they did serve and some did give the ultimate sacrifice and I just don't know sometimes I think Nate I don't know I think maybe somewhere there's a place for them I don't know I don't know you know because we send them to war God don't send them to war we said we have a warfare that's not like you said this morning it's not with flesh and blood it's with what we're doing right now this is the greatest battle ever fought the prophet of god said was not out on that battlefield it was right here in the human mind some and that's what we're gonna fight this afternoon we're gonna fight another battle a human battle that is in our mind or a spiritual battle in our mind so remember that also start keeping this in your mind and put it on your calendar August the 7th through the 10th to be the camp meeting coming up that's where brother Joe green and brother Nathanael gets gets all the people from all over the world come in all the missionaries so we try to really support that so keep any prayer that would be all that the 7th through the 10th but the Donnie Regan brother Ron Spencer and Wayne Lawson will be doing the for services so keep them in your prayers and we usually go up on Saturday Friday night and support them so we'll probably the same thing so if you got your Bibles let's turn in the book of revelation 6 this would be the third seal part 2 but we're going to background just a little bit before we continue on I'm enjoying the series I don't know if you or not but I'm enjoying it so it's it's bringing a little more to light things that you see we're talking about the book of Romans downstairs and even today in the book of Romans you know Paul Paul died in 1866 that's what men brother Brian was talking about wins now Paul died 1866 he never heard about a seal the seals came to John on Patmos in 1890 something Paul was already dead 30 years before there was a talk of a seal but Paul his writings is exactly talking about the Antichrist about about the mystery of iniquity and about all these things he's actually preaching the seals and doesn't really know but then it took the prophet of God to bring it in the end time and put it all together for us and so that we can have a real clear picture and we can glean out of Romans and Hebrews and all the different writings of Paul the breaking of the seal come in so we just think the Lord that he's allowed us in this end time to see it all see every bit of it the whole book is open there's not a mystery that's not brother branham said the mystery is now history amen and I was telling them this morning we have Satan's answer we have something like Nate was talking about this morning we have something sorry brother Nate that's my boy brother Nate we have something to fight him with we won the battle but we really got to go through I was thinking this morning you know you get out there and fight but but when you come into the adoption stage of the of the part of your journey it's not that Jesus Christ is in your corner if you say to this mountain now I've got to go back and get it from this one Christ is fighting through you and in you well here we go we'll get started revelation 6 verse 5 let's pray before we get started the only father thank you Lord today for this journey that we are on and thank you for the people that you've given us to take this journey with we pray that you would bless them now Lord and you be the active participant in this service you be the speaker you be the hear you be the one Lord that gives revelation because without you here today it would just be a meeting of minds we pray Lord that you would just bless the ones that are sick that you will take care of them Lord today even as we speak be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father just be with each one people brother Nate and sister Caitlyn now they've started their journey Lord in life and now with brother Nate standing with the sword with him we we've sure pray Lord that you just protect him and keep him safe and just may sister Caitlin be a true support I believe she is so give her strength to Lord because when when you choose the man you choose the woman to go with him so god bless them all Lord we thank you for all the things you've given us thank you for this day and giving us our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 5 when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I'll be holding a lo a black horse and him that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying I remember this is a part that has not been through the first two seals there's not been an extra voice it's the combat beasts saying come and see combat beasts they come and see well the combat beasts which the third beast the man will talk about in a minute says come and see and then you see something extra that's why I tell you the the third seal is very very important for us to get what this third seal is all about and not the seal but the Thunder we believe in preaching the thunders in this church I we never all you all know that and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts so there was another voice there was someone stepped out and said don't you hurt the old and whine amen and we know who that was that was the Lamb himself so you may be seasoned the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and as we get help brother than to get the chart out here we will begin our study here on the on the third seal and give you a little visual again background a little bit for Nate and Caitlyn before they go to sleep we'll talk about them yeah Oh keep saying things that way I'm sorry keep thinking out loud again I told Bob if he'd set up here in the front he might get something to look at that he's alright fire falls in front done brother dick hey man first three ropes at least there you go okay make it plain four five six they just keep going on back all right so now in the opening of these seals and bring up the other one I'm gonna have to background a little bit for our visitors because we've read this quote how many for three months so this quote is a me quote it's the brother Dale quote so you're not gonna find this in the message but I believe it's all in the message okay because the seals are not the Antichrist is such and such and so and so we were looking at before and for those of you that haven't been here this was what the book was sealed with him and the book was sealed with seven seals not a book like this it was a scroll and then it was a scroll and was sealed with seven seals and then when the seal was tore back the problem we have in the message is we we take too much time on this but remember what the prophet of God said he said the seals and the thunders are two different things the seal was what had it sealed up but when that seal was broke this is not what we're supposed to read this has already been revealed and we can let it ride off because it rode off right horse white horse red horse black horse I want to know what the Thunderer says underneath that seal hey man I don't want to know what's gon happen I didn't find one with some quotes on it this one you usually have some with quotes on it but you brought my horse back don't bring my seal back the one thing away but that's what we want to say we sure we took a profit to guard to open the seals but he said it'll be those seven unknown thunders that'll wake the bride up amen and it will what it will give us rapture in faith not the seal not the seal but the seal has to be tore off in order for us to see what was underneath it hey man because remember brother Branham preached to seals in 1963 and we were we were we quoted it the other day where brother Branham told him on the on the questions and answers after seal number six he said you're not getting it it's not for you in other words there's something going on but you're not catching it and he told the people he said you're not supposed to get it he said but now putting another quote together right around the coming of the Lord all these things are going to be put back together and I think we're right around to coming over Lord amen so we're need we need to understand not that the seal is a wild horse ready show hold on I got a quote so look the breaking of the seals then is not necessarily for your soul I hope we're getting something now that we're really trying to get the people to understand how we compartmentalize take the soul if it's born again it can't be improved on you can't make eternal more eternal amen you can't if you're born again you have the very soul of God in you today that's why they brother Dale there's many people that are truly not born again they have an anointing on their second realm that tells them by Satan that you're what you're okay you're sitting in the message church you may get up and you may do this and you know you may shout a little bit and I thought we were in Jamaica a few minutes ago when we were singing that song man had a bee didn't it if we'd a been Jamaica if I looked at that window they'd have been about 40 people doing this but I guess we're just I'm maybe we'll catch it one day but anyway so then as we compartmentalize this thing then you got to take the flesh out of the way we were talking about this this morning your flesh don'ts in this flat listen can you see this your flesh never seen today in this life whoo we get in somewhere it's a product of sin and it's in a fallen condition because it came the wrong way through mom and daddy but it's not sinful you say well prove this let me prove it to you because somebody will go well no I know you've sinned in your flesh your flesh doesn't sin you've sinned in your flesh right your flesh what Jesus told him because before then the priest could say I have not touched that woman so I have not committed adultery touched that woman but Jesus told him what'd he say he said whatever you think you don't think will you flesh he said whatever you what you look on a woman to lust after her you have committed adultery with her already you never touched her with this so what it is it's in that spirit realm Amen it's in that spirit realm that God is trying to work on from the inside if he's in there if it's not it's just devil devil devil and then to me this is what the seals makes them so much plain in Ephesians that the word is a divider of the soul in the spirit and then the joint in the marrow in other words it pulls everything apart but it's totally one unit I can't have a soul without having a spirit it can't have a spirit how much soul but now I don't have a soul without having a flesh body if I die and go to a grave that's not a flesh body but I'm going to connect back to this thing right here right here I'm not getting to knew what I'm getting this one redeemed because redemption is not replacement hey man I'm telling you when you see the break into these seals correct you cannot preach false doctrine you can't did Jesus preach false doctrine he preached the seals his whole life his whole life where's the Thunder underneath those cells I am the way the truth in the life amen so the breaking of the seal is not necessarily for the soul because the soul is redeemed by the new birth like I said Paul never heard about the breaking of seal one two three four five six seven yet he was a born-again prophet of God so we must take that out of the way and say well this the seals doesn't does not it's not dependent to be a Christian to know the seals you don't have to be a Christian you have to be a Christian to be a Christian and as a Christian as we are in this end time as being Christians in this day I'm come by sitting right here today it is a requirement that we know what those virtues are how they're placed and what do they do with these seals and what does those seals have to do with you and then but your soul is redeemed by the new birth shed blood of Jesus Christ John 3:16 and then but when you're born again go see Martin Luther you know conclude by the seal why say didn't have a clue let me play it back he probably didn't study him enough to even worry about him so that wasn't his time his time was the just shall live by faith a little bit of light but listen a little bit of light of God is eternal so we had a little bit of light and then John Wesley had a little bit of light Pentecostals had a little bit of light but you and I have the full book open and then we have the full book but what will it do knowing these seals knowing what's underneath those seals will in full fellowship in the manifestation because God could not fellowship with Martin Luther like he wanted how can God fellowship with a father son Holy Ghost baptism can't do it how can God fellowship with a eternal hell and all those things that Martin Luther brought out of the Catholic Church but yet God said all I want you to do Martin Luther is to preach to just show there by faith I want you to get those people out of that denomination gettime out of that system with penance and like we were talking like we're talking about here with the balances and all with the novenas get him out of that but he didn't get him all the way out and then never brother Brown says he said they had a little white couldn't get all the way out they had a little light couldn't get all the way out they men in the church ages but this age there's no eighth church age we're either going in the ground or we're going up and man there's not another church age for us to throw this to so we have to learn and I promise you if you got the Holy Ghost in your soul don't tell me your Holy Ghost in the soul does not want to learn more of God it's an impossibility now it is a possibility that you can what in your spirit realm you can say that's enough doors in doors brother Bram preach doors in doors as you let Christ in your house you keep that door shut he won't go in that door cuz the Holy Ghost is a gentleman like I said before Nate if that was me and you though we'd be going what's behind that door right but the Holy Ghost won't do that he's a gentleman but you know what if you'll go over let's say God I got a problem behind this door I hear that I've got a problem I'm opening it up you know what he'll step in and take care of it cuz he promised like brother Nate would say there's more there's promises in the Bible that he will fulfill if you ask him just like you go back to where the the boy that shot the guy and they went to the puck got the pardon a pardon it's not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon amen but these sales will bring full fellowship back in the manifestation so that God can fellowship with us just like you fellowship with Adam in the Garden of Eden hey man you know what we want we want more fellowship with God all right so have more fellowship with God then we must learn these things that have a little bit of teaching have some preach and have some fivefold ministry to where they can teach us these things and it'll make the picture more clear because the pictures there and then remember even brother Branham said the picture you can have the grass and the cow and the tree that's the picture but if the cows in the top of the three eaten grass the pictures there but it's wrong the cow needs to be down here well then it takes a minister or somebody with a little bit of a gift to bring that cow out of the tree and put him in the grass and man so that's what we're dealing with now I think is worth as brother Branham I told you last Sunday as brother Branham come to tie up the loose ends coming from the denominational world bringing tying up the loose ends and bringing us into the message I contend that God is now using us us the fivefold ministry around the world to tithe to loosen that got unraveled from 1965 to today so this message is a mess to some people it is a mess age but you know what there if there is a mess there's a truth they man and I contend that we have the truth amen I contend that we have the truth and can see this picture all this statue of a perfect man that's it's not it's not needed brother Brown said power without character it's satanic right so if you have power but you don't have them virtues to work through you I'm just telling you what he says don't don't get mad at me I'm gonna telling you what brother Graham said he said power without without character satanic those virtues not used correct as the stumbling block to the believer and I've seen it you've seen it a man so the quote is very much true so let's read the first couple of quotes here I got to go back to this one give a little background from from a little buddy back then from natives we can not fall asleep on me 1961 Revelation chapter 5 see what it's doing it's these seals opening up just beginning to reveal the plan of redemption not the plan of the devil everybody goes home horse rider that's that's Antichrist that's the opening of the seal that's the tearing off of the seal and then we as message believers we start following that know it's what's underneath it's the Thunder is what's going to wake us up I read you closing a minute where brother Bobby said the bride hadn't had a revival but it'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up you know I tell I told you before we look at the seven seals as revealing the devil brother upsets us to plan a Redemption the plan of redemption which brings what brings back what has failed all right the plan of redemption how he did it it's all over now just about just about finished up so we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed go to number two this one I like because it's in the breech now remember what I told you happen in the breach right because God's got to change the womb of our mind we were having a breech baby feet first I thought was this that and the other but God had to reach in the womb of our mind and turn that baby around so that the head could come because the Christ the head is Christ he's the one that's got to be here he's the one that breaks the seal and then now when we go to breaking these seals you're gonna see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals not only in every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seal cannot be broken until that time I'll prove it here just in the man notice the book remember it's sealed here's one here's this seal then another one's wrapped a seal another one that brother branham is making mention of the rolling of the scroll right everybody got that same am but look it's a book of redemption the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and being us on the backside is because it's wound up the seal mystery is on the inside not on the seal inside all right because watch what he says and it only says the wild horse rider or the black horse rider want more on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in themselves from Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals so it's not the seal sure the seals why had it sealed he had to be tore off it took a prophet to tear it off the Christ through the Prophet toward the seal off but what was behind the seal is what we need just doing wireless routers Antichrist we should have took a rapture in 1963 it's been 50 something years and we're still walking around horrible why because we ain't got the mystery the thunder the voice of God wind the seal breaks and you said what is the thunder john saw john solemn so they not too mysterious john saw him without brother branham being here hey man he didn't have a problem writing him cuz he was getting ready to ride him down and God said stop not time for that John said would you told me to write everything I saw right remember he was commissioned to write not interpret right he was commissioned to write everything he saw he was getting ready to write we remember read revelations 10 1 through 7 and as John was beginning to write what the mighty angel said no stop don't write it John seal it up why go there wasn't time because you and I weren't there I'm telling you this whole thing hinges on who's sitting in this building and around this world right now that are true believers this whole thing this whole thing hinges on us I told you the right player we've got the right play we've got the right player we've got the right conductor we've got the right instruments it's all here it's here so then we must see this complete plan of redemption we've always seen for the Soul Paul James John they didn't have a seal book they didn't even have a Matthew Mark Luke and John book they just believe what Jesus said be here we've got all this information and look what kind of mess we got we got all these 1,100 sermons we've got all these and I've been using downstairs I brought out my emphatic dog lot and I like to have because that's the that's the real come from the Catholic Church but it was a Latin Vulgate and it was the real transcript and you can read that and get a little more information I like all these translations but unless God puts it together for you and reveals it to you not me you told him downstairs this morning listen if you don't get anything else dos break into the seals has to be an individual affair with God has to be you God has to bring it through me brother Dale it doesn't matter just don't even put a name in there but you're the one that's gonna have to receive it and did what make it live back out hey man that's the hard part making it live back out so now we see that to break into these seals then John solemn was getting ready to ride him what did John see he saw the full plan of redemption because there is no one Thunder Revelation chapter 24 verse 1 does not say the first under says there is nowhere in the Bible that's my brother branham's didn't know where no Bible you're going to find the seven thunders but if it don't compare from Genesis to revelations so it's got to be in there somewhere and John didn't have a problem beginning to write it that's why I'm telling you it's not so mysterious that John but remember what is John got in common with me and you there was only one thing because he never had our mess into the hour he barely listened to Paul had a little bit Irina's but he never had a messenger to tell him what these are John saw the full plan of redemption that's why he could understand didn't get ready to write it so the thunders are some you know the people in the message that made it polygamy they made it seven men they made it this they made it that it's just the continuation of the simple plan of redemption amen it is what I'm going to read it to you a few minutes we read it last Sunday where brother man said it was there was a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification and then let's skip that and go to number four and let's read that I was going to go through now remember to as we go through this we remember the property God was in the seventy weeks of Daniel the six fold purpose there's six there's a six fold purpose that redeems Israel all right there's a six fold purpose that redeems israel brings them from lost to save three two prophets when we get out of here that god's gonna go to them they're gonna get the baptism of the holy ghost in their soul they're gonna receive jesus christ and they're gonna take a rapture a man right just like you and i did so they get six fold purpose to complete their redemption we get six seals because remember six seals finishes redemption not seven hey man right sick cells finishes redemption seventh there's nothing there where'd that come from there's nothing there silence in heaven one through six there's things happen that things went on that's what we've been talking about so as six seals finishes our redemption the six fold purpose of Daniel seven new weeks finishes the Jews Redemption and we'll get into that next Sunday I'm going to cut some of that out but let's read the third seal here and now we find out that these mysteries I've already been no longer in here then this morning I get his hour I told Dobrin eight I said you know what I said they want an hour and a half a daddy this morning I said they're fishing to get an hour and a half for you I said what are you gonna do about it so I preached 35 minutes so anyway now we find out that's good that's good he did a good job today I'm telling you he knows I told him he did a real good job I sent his daddy attacks and told about you'd be proud of it and now he's on the Internet so y'all may never see him again okay let's going no I don't think that's gonna happen you guys start really laying this clothes out for him and now we find out because she doesn't and now we've hot that these sales are supposed to be revealed so listen let's get back to a point I'm sorry our point is there is a revelation of something that previously was not known and now it's all coming to light we've got enough of this information revelation and we bringing it together and we're gonna see the complete plan of redemption because we're gonna stand on this earth with a glorified body in this dimension amen that's what I'm looking for that he fills every fiber of my being with that Holy Ghost that I've kept down in my soul and I let him out just every once in a while because he has to filter through the spirit realm and Satan filters through the spirit realm and that's where they meet the greatest battle ever fought brother Graham said it's not in your heart it's in your mind remember Satan chose the mind God chose a heart they see their faith their doubt in the heart but it's all different kind of five different things memory reads the conscience affection imagination is right up here the battleground is right here and why didn't these other men Wesley Luther those great reformers who brought out justification sanctification in the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and things why didn't he catch these missed messages why didn't they get them because they were reformers no brother that was gonna cover that more he's been covering it now for a couple of Sundays they were reformers because they couldn't get it they couldn't get everything out and they couldn't get everything settled okay because you can't have restoration sure you start restoration with with Martin Luther and different ones you start that but they didn't fully restore we were stored it's not a father son Holy Ghost baptism I keep going to that because that's the most common thing you know father son Holy Ghost baptism Trinitarian doctrine they'll fight you for that now in the denominational world and in them and in the message they'll give you a good Tunis doctrine amen to Lourdes do this do that amen there's only one true Living God a man and if you're a second person that's what I'm telling you most of us in our mind in the womb of our mind it's God in us separate that can't happen that can't happen and that ain't the way God wanted it Adam and Eve were one you read oneness with God brother Brian said Adam and Eve and God in the garden was true one that's now if we walked up on that conversation we'd see how many three he said that was true oneness was God and Adam and Eve in full fellowship together when we see the bride in the new city that bride will be one mrs. Jesus Christ one person many membered body but one person and then just like take it on the other side there was people come in who was had power as kings but wasn't king see now watch he already talked about rolling back he already talked about Luther and Wesley under justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now scroll oh my god or down just like take it on the other side that was people come in who had powers kings and Kings you have to notice the Bible terminology of anything and then now watch but these the reason that all these stray ends of the mysterious part about justification those remember as we've been preaching look over here me forget that look at me thank you justification baby form justification chopped off your past sins right now that justification will take you on to glorification if you continue on but if you stop that unclean spirit is still in your soul it's just chopping off your past sin you keep sinning the root of evil I'm quoting the Prophet the root of evil is still there and then but now this justification we're talking about in the in the seals is not baby form justification it's a justification that you didn't do it the real unit and do it and you got to realize not just quoted Amen what sins are you talking about we got to realize that that thing that is inside of us son cause of the theme because the Bible called it thing colder than it - yeah that thing that'll be in you that the Holy Ghost will write so that thing inside of you is so powerful if you're born again today you're already glorified amen you don't have a bad thought in your soul amen God never had one it's just as eternal it's not just as the eternal is gone it is gone hey man that's what we gotta say it is God it's not God coming talking to a sign talking to a spirit talking to you [Laughter] please brother Brown said it's God and you in there as persons and you can't divide them you can't separate them once God has filled you with the Holy Ghost he there is no way he can separate from you no way that's what I was telling you the the greatest revit one of the greatest revelation is I first got Nate was that I don't have to stand judgment talking about a weight lifter talking about I mean you realize that cuz if you're not born again today and you die you got to go to the white throne and be judged by your works your dues and your domes I don't ever want to be judged even right now by my do's and don'ts I put everything that Christ has done it off if he made it I made it that's why he came but he didn't come sure he come to clean the soul up and put himself in but that's not all he wants that's not all he wants he wants complete preeminence then when your hand moves God hand moved when you speak it's not speaking in a third person it's not thinking in a second person it is the person speaking that wasn't William Branham the human that created squirrel it was God in William Brennan that he yielded itself so much oh if we could just get that but we're not gonna get much when they'll hurry up the mysterious part of justification is that if those who is justified he is all ready glorified you're just as eternal as God is doesn't matter if we preach your funeral tomorrow it ain't your soul we're talking to but I contend I'm a we until that happens we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent our what hinder that's our problem right now we're hindering we're hindering the resurrection called it's not here and the only reason that's going to come here is because we say whatever you say the only mountain we got left is death that's the only mountain we got left there's death and when that's destroyed and it will be by the Word of God and it ain't gonna be a bunch of people either it may just be a few but I contend I'm one of the field until I get proven different I'm saying I'm one of the field you should say the same thing the mistake of remember he can only go by your what confession so let's confess that this thing's going to be over when we say it's over and that's not making us some big something no that's God speaking to you today a mysterious part of justification we played long enough listen hair dress and all that stuff that's good I y'all heard me meantime but listen brother Brahim didn't come to bring us hair and dress he did not come to bring us a hole in this life no way that was not his message that message was preached a long time ago that message was in the Bible the Nazarenes lived a better life than he did he said okay somebody blow something up back there it Oh in the media room oh boy y'all be careful back there I think I'll stop and have a drink man are we good now okay huh everybody okay back there okay brother Anderson's there we good okay there's no smoke maybe that was a thunder who knows the mysterious part of justification listen the mysterious part of justification is this that you're already glorified we're already risen sitting in heavenly places that's what the Bible says the light brother Dale's always said back to brother Browning's message was not in the years of preparation he said that I've got the quotes I got him right back in there he said not during the healing campaign not during the first part that was just debate on the hook his message was these seals that were trying by the grace of God to help everybody see that was his message that was the seventh pain those message was not herring dress and we heard it for years but I promise you we didn't preach the new birthright that's why we had to preach on hair and dress right because if you get a woman born a brother mom said you can't get a Holy Ghost field woman to put on a pair of pants you can't get a Holy Ghost field woman to cut her hair well then why preach on it get her born-again then you ain't got preach on it the more we are standing on the edge of something that man has never before attained to Kosair was not not enough belief there was not enough people to stand in front of them every Sunday and say you can do it I'll fly away Oh glory when I die hallelujah by and by that's okay for them they didn't mean that's not my confession brother Graham said deaths gonna come up your sleeve one day and what you gonna do brush it right off that's powerful people because the only reason those people in that six dimension don't come in this dimension is why one thing there's no death in that dimension and there's death in this dimension when death is destroyed in this dimension by the opening of the sealed by the thunders what not the thunders just sounding know it living out to somebody thousands of live voice --is and God will back up what we say because it won't be us it'll be him talking through us amen the mysterious part of sanctification not that you were just cleaned and set aside for service because remember Satan can get back in in baby form sanctification Satan can come right back in the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking and dry plates us seeks ravenous nun right that's what the Bible says but he comes back finds the house swept and garnished bring seven more of his friends more evil than him are more just than him put you in the message for you and tells you you're fine that's exactly what he does but when he comes back and finds the power of the Holy Ghost in that vessel he can't get back in there no more but eating war he can work on that second realm he said well I'll give him in his spirit because I can still get in there but this part of sanctification the mysterious part of sanctification is just you're so clean and set aside brother Brown said Satan don't know what to do with you we're not going out of here with false doctrine it's all got to be 100% the truth you said what are you saying brother wait somebody's got to have it somebody's gotta have it and you know what it's not just somebody's got to have it somebody's got to believe it and live it the mysterious part of the baptism of Holy Ghost what is it mysterious part of the whole ego that he can change your body who you think's gonna change you buddy you are know we tried for years we tried for years we put on we put well some of us can put things in our hair in everybody but we've tried our best and it's okay to take vitamins I do it's okay to do these things but it's nothing doing that your spirituality could be zero and you could look like Arnold Schwarzenegger and man and you know what Arnold Schwarzenegger's died think I mean yeah he's 70 something years old if time goes on you're gonna die I don't want that no I want that inside man don't keep working his way out our problem is we don't give him enough room to work amen everybody goes a man specially those that are asleep tried to get him forth to go to land a nod but sometimes they go home anyway but the mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost is you already got it you got what you need he just needs something to work on something to work with that's why like brother Nate said this morning the foolishness of preaching you've got to have a fivefold ministry you've got to have a preacher in this dimension say no more but anyway so it's the mysterious part of justification the mysterious part of sanctification mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost that's what we're coming and facing now not just that we're born again and everything's good you know like the analogy I told about the bitkeeper you know we got a little big keeper man and he just wants three beehives and that's all he wants he likes to watch the bees go in and out get a little bit of honey but there's others want more but you got to start with the same house but what you do is you learn to expand what you got somebody getting something from there you got to learn to expand what you got what you got to read you got to study you got to pray and read your Bible but if you want to be a good bee keeper a better bee keeper you got to pray and read your Bible pray they don't sting you and that's the same thing with anything that's why we were talking this morning in Romans the first chapter God tells us that we can understand the Godhead by the things we see and there's no other way we're going to understand God except this way because you know what he didn't go oops I think let's try this subject no no God's ways the first way and that's the only way he saw somebody get it mahalo room did you know what spit on you but he saw somebody did it the way he preached it hey man so that's the way we're just gonna have to get it whether we like it or not but I kind of like it look number five so there's a mysterious part so there's a mysterious part that we haven't seen third seal now that's what the reason today the revivals were not supposed to have we have denominational revival I mean we're supposed to have we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we have it this is 1963 the third seal the one that we're talking about right now all right don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members this message has got millions of people in them church members but not a revival no where no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God you think William Branham have you went crazy what do you mean no manifestation you've raised so many dead there's been 10,000 people 200,000 people healed at one time or 200,000 people come to Christ 10,000 people you know 15 or 20 been resurrected from the dead in this ministry and he's telling you there's no manifestations of God to stir the bride yet that don't stir the bride because you can get this thing all worked up and be dead as a hammer in this hole and then no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again now what's going to wake us up more than anything the plan of redemption is what you and I need now you put everything you won't do in that but we need the plan of redemption that's already placed in the Bible we just got to pull it out we just gotta get it we just gotta get it out so that we can what use it exercise our faith and then Paul said exercise the gift that's been given you what not exercise this way no read study go church all right now we've come to this part and let's look just for a minute at the seal that we got to Sunday till I'm on I want to read one more thing before we go and then we'll kind of cut it off right here and we'll start a little bit more next Sunday and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see now what is the third beast all right you ready what is the third beast the man amen the first beast the lion ox man and eagle right the lion ox man an eagle so the lion was the first Street Church ages that wild horse rider the red horse rider was in we have overlaps the third fourth and fifth and then the man anointing was the fourth fifth and sixth age why coming out of the Dark Ages into the age of what man's intelligence books were put together Martin Luther John Wesley people started putting things together Tyndale and all those ones started bringing things together but like I said before this is an important seal because it's a black horse but there was a voice protecting something of that seal that's what it says there was never another voice there's only one vote one time a voice speaks out and says a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine all right so the third beast then is the man anointing so it's demand the intelligence not the intelligence of man to put a bomb together to blow you know we have to have an intelligence even in this pyramid this knowledge right here is not man's knowledge that knowledge is the knowledge of the Almighty God the one that created the world if he's inside of you don't you think somewhere down the line you and I are gonna start thinking like he things hey man I can understand that Bible more now why the man that wrote it is inside of me looking through my eyes Pelin showing me what showing me what he wrote the love letter think of it the man that pushed the button Big Bang Theory if you won't do but had to be somebody push a button that same man is pushing your button today alright we're going we're going to find out one day where we really have come through life even in the message and be a second person [Music] brother it ain't gonna happen you got to know that your God made manifest in another form believe it and manifest it you know what go that's not what I said that's what the Bible's already said Jesus said the world will see me no more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you because God hides himself in this simplicity right here and by all rights a man so we got to bring these things because remember in the Garden of Eden that's what a problem is Adam said I was afraid something separated him from God what now what is the plan of redemption pull it right back to where when Adam called an elephant an elephant God didn't say Adam you shouldn't have done that he said I don't that's exactly what I was thinking and it become an elephant for eternity and Adam named them all you'll see someone of these days I hope all right so the third beast was the man anointing witches covers the part of the fourth fifth and sixth and even part of the seventh age because remember as we realize now that the fourth field the rapture takes place on the fourth seal right what's prophecy because the Holy Ghost is gone the line arts man and Eagle which will be the next seal the fourth seal we cover after the fourth seal you don't see a line knocks man an eagle that is the Holy Ghost into believer hey brother branham said it disappears why it takes a rapture amen till the rapture takes place on the fourth seal but in the seven churches that makes people go crazy but it's real very simple right there it is the first seal is these first three ages the second seal is these third seal is this before seal this and then we go into rapture there's no way Church age and there's no tribulation for a believer and no judgment man that still makes me feel great so you got the line ox man and then we come here we are at the man then you got the white horse rider now the wild horse rider was white it was a white righteous church the mystery the man of sin the mystery of iniquity where he didn't attach itself to the bar rooms and the prostitution hall that wild horse rider Satan riding that white horse attached himself to the white righteous church that was already on the earth because remember Satan is a white copycat Satan is not an originator so there had to be by the law of contrast there had to be a white righteous church on the earth to Satan to try to work through and then and then he comes and gets on a red horse which is coming into the Dark Ages we showed it the other day 606 ad Nicaea comes in and brings the doctrine in and that doctrine literally killed 68 million people lot of red that horse the Prophet said rode right through that blood of those martyrs that was Christians supposed killing Christians Satan does not we look at him way out yonder somewhere the Bible says we're going to walk by one day and say is that the man right in Ezekiel I believe it it is that the man ERISA is that the man that brought nations to their knees water no SOT drunk linen laying in them his own puke that's the devil so he's not an originator so when he gets on a horse and rides God's already there God's already doing the work hey Manny will we're only 18 and you know what brother Nate when you put their hands up like this and God's not behind you he's in you Satan's already defeated he just don't know it because the four knowledge that God is now your foreknowledge write that down you need to use it it's your it's the foreknowledge of God that tells you you've already won five but you still you can't just go now Satan I think I'll just fight you like this no he'll hit you pretty hard but when you put all that up I'm gonna have another message on that thing that's pretty good hey there good job this morning again he did a good job I love these young preachers coming in yet they have a zeal and you know they give this a little life in the blood you know but the red horse those people in that Dark Age all they done was said there were Christians and they got killed that ox anointing that real slow but I was telling them brother Nate listen to this now a lion when it's born drinks milk the sincere milk of the word we like milk in this church but I don't like milk all the time but the lion starts out drinking milk but he becomes a what a meat-eater and then the Ox stewart's out drinking milk is a baby and eats grass not a lot of power to that but they made it through the man the man starts out to his life drinking milk a man don't feed a baby a steak when it's don't feed Khloe steak please don't she barely just put a bottle in her little mouth but you know what you start with a bottle so we start with milk milk milk but now the Eagle never drinks milk but what does mama Eagle do mama Eagle chews up the big pieces of meat so she wants so that babies won't choke she chews it five times apostle profits pastors teachers and evangelists that's all right Regina that all right that good wasn't it that just came to me okay and then what does he do she do she feeds it a little little time and then when they get old enough guess what they already got the talons they already got the beat they just don't know how to use it yet that's it right there now teach you how to use what you've already got right but an eagle likes meat Eagle won't think even knows what milk is hey man strong meats good for you people so then you got black horse coming up in this age you've got a black horse now as we said before watch I'm gonna read you a quote here in just a minute that I looked up this morning but you got white red black and then pale right now if if the mystery underneath the seal we know what the seal was the seal was the white house rider the Antichrist and it's the same guy gets on the next horse not a different guy same guy gets on another power brother Brown city changes his ministry he can't be white righteous in the Morgan and wife because he's got god-fearing people on the earth that said hey watch out for them people policy grievious wolves have come among you and are among you now separate yourself from that right so Satan says I think it was kill him instead of riding with him and going to church with him I think I'll just kill him that's what he did he changed this doctrine right here and began killing Christians for a thousand years he killed sixty-eight million literally killed 68 million under Christianity hey brother Brown said untold billions by their doctor that's why we're coming we're heading into this black because black is death because remember we don't know what to call it until the next seal but at black is death and then but it wasn't so much killing this time the natural person how can you kill a man brother Ram said you kill him when you kill his influence you don't have to fitzy than that ain't the flesh it's not the flesh physically killing somebody that's called a murderer but how many murders we have even in this message that kill people's influence hello kill people's influence you've killed the person the prophet said so here we go Satan is getting more and more and more deceptive but thank God God knew that and everything he does is a contrast everything Satan does it's what God's already done so what we're going to look on here third seal extremely important it was so important it was protected by the lamb the lamb said hurt not the only one stopped Satan you're not doing this anymore I will restore not reformed I restore that which you have tore down in these Middle Ages you tore it down I'm going to start restoring and I'm gonna restore it back to the original because remember we must brother branham the message your melancholy force to do two things what restored the faith of the fathers back to the church again and to what reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seventh to end the seventh seal not on an Amen because you can have the anointing of the Holy Ghost every day in your life dying go to hell but you can never have the Holy Ghost in your soul and dying go to hell ever you're sealed you're finished you're done but now we must what build on what we've already got so we've got a voice we've got wheat barley all in wine all that is what nourishment nourishment wheat and barley makes bread and all the different things brother Brown says the staff alive we're gonna go through this real quick read a quote and we'll be finished oil that's what the Holy Ghost and the wine is the stimulation once you get to holy go okay so now let's put it together so we've got the the white horse rider type in justification right the red horse rider red is always sanctification amen so the red horse rider typing sanctification what cleansed and set aside for service now you say well brother how is the black going to be deal with the Holy Ghost it's not all that liveth so I must be dead it's not eyes it liveth but Christ that liveth in me how many of us are gonna believe that we got to start believing that we are dead our old past life is not divorced that's why there's no thing called divorcement in Christianity it's not a type but if your husband dies dead back dead you can marry again so if the old you is dead you can marry the Christ but the problem is is we just like to do like brother Brown said we'd like to put him over in the closet and shut the door the old man that's not a death that's not a dying out so much to where God said hurting off the oil and wine I'm gonna give these people power to overcome power to live power to have a life I will restore now let's read this last quotes and then we'll finished right here okay only an hour and 10 minutes maybe you don't get it Wow brother branham what do you mean maybe we don't get it that's what he said I'm just reading quote maybe you don't get it let me go over it again I want you to get this thing you know what listen to this this is our promise because remember you and I are spiritual Eve right bear to leave look I want you to get this she was promised the bride Eve read that to me - what it didn't say have a redeemer it said be a redeemer see that's our problem people would think well you know it's God God out there no sin hearing God out there no we just we just ain't getting it yet but we're gonna get it we're getting it we relieved we're getting it okay her Redeemer would be the word so if the bride Eve's gonna be a redeemer she's got to be the word and when the word came made flesh she rejected it now he's talking about Israel at this moment but why Marie quote she was given substitution now hold that substitute given substitutes to go on now look this is the third seal we're talking about the new birds we're talking about Redemption and now brother Brown was talking about redemption in the third seal all right she was giving substitutes giving substance used to go on until the redeemer come in other words what bulls and goats substitute and when the Redeemer comes she wanted to continue with her substitute and rejected the true word brother branham was the prophet and I just believe that he's going to come back and we're gonna get this rapture in faith and please people please don't believe that that is a lie of the devil that is a lie the devil because Eve the bride Eve to be a redeemer redemption lies in this room right now [Applause] that ain't a skim milk and when the Redeemer come to she wanted to continue with her substitute and rejected the true word and that was the Hebrew bride so did he by the second debride the mother of all spiritual living see Eve means the mother of all that spirit all that's living either as the mother of all living we know that now when he come to the Hebrew bride she was a mother of all that was living but she rejected it naturally fell in Eden by listening to Satan's reasoning against God's Word and it was what brother Bob only one word that's how she fell all right sir she fell because she did that spiritually now that's the church Christ bride she fell not in Eden but in Rome would look at me he fell she fell in Rome the nice thing council 606 take it right back to here that's a nice end counsel when she rejected that Pentecostal church that went down - Nasia and listen to Rome's reason instead holding onto the word she fell and everything away from her died with her look god this black horse it's so horrible but it's a doctrine and it's the folks dead doctrines in this message is what's keeping us here can't get an amen now just as naturally I'm telling you God's got to reach in the womb of our mind and turn that baby cuz we're gonna have to have the correct birth the heads got to come first and the heads Christ amen so whatever our thinking has been it's gonna have to be turned or when I die hallelujah by and by Oh we'll just keep singing that song now just as naturally felt spiritually fell God's bride fail fail in the garden Christ's bride fell in room by the same reasoning against God's Word she also forfeited her rights of virtue to Satan which we found in the breaking of these seals that that was Satan and still is Satan there and the Bible said it's the very seat of Satan and as he forfeited her virtuous rights and give them over to Satan in the Garden of Eden the church the Bride of Christ did the same thing at Rome when he forfeited they forfeited the Bible for their dogmas and reasoning that's why coming out of this into this age that red killing was natural but it began a spiritual killing it began a spiritual killing and it turned into the blackness the blackness of Cain what was Cain's problem he went out from the presence of God he went into outer darkness where there's weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth art go to the next quote this is the last one that God has promised this is the same third seal actually it's the same thought now God has promised her because look what I read you there's no hope back he didn't give us a way back now he's gonna give us a way back all right now God promised her as he did he told Eve there would come a time that the word would come back to her again now you remember that what she lost from it would be restored because there's only one thing can restore and that's the word as I said shoot a gun if you don't hit the target find where it went off at you got to come back there and start again see if you go back you go - Nasia that's where you start again see go back away from them organisations in this message away from all that church we've been seeing these seals is perfectly I always wondered all my life why I was so against the organizational system not two people know the people are just like me or you or anybody else but that system that denominational system now I see it right now I never knowed it till now that's right when he come to that third seal see look look look for a minute there was no denominations from here back none zero there was no denominational now there was denominational ideas spirits and then there was denominational spirits but there was no Badgers Methodist Pentecostal Wesley Luther where did they all come from them - ages right there it's where all denominations come from Rome started it but then they developed the what the Reformation are the Protestant movement was started right in here right because John Wesley's wondered I mean Martin Luther's wasn't started right protesting products my products that means protesting the Catholic Church well instead of protesting it and taking them on to God they protested and went right back in the denomination again and created a blackness that's so horrible I'll read it read the scripture next Sunday let's stand their feet the Bible says there's a woman that's dead while she's alive she's dead by what she takes that's not the Word of God my question to you is could that be us I say no I say the word is protected by the Lamb just like it was in that third seal and if I'm part of the word brother I'm just said Eve would be what the word the word would be what restored her back that restoration of the word brother Ram said comes restoration of power what power back into the people not the denomination sure they're going to get there they asked the will that went over there that's the guy and where was the Welsh revival they wanted to find a building they wanted to find a place to go they wanted to find a booklet the guy said you're looking at him why can't we say that if there's not been a revival and the bride is to be the revival why can't we say you're looking at the revival amen this thing is awful we get all worked up you love the Lord he done it's already done ray is named the battle is over the victory is won

little message that maybe thought was so insignificant but just lit a fire in our heart and brought a sweet spirit to this church oh yeah I remember that let's talk about it what a day that will be we pray that you just be with each one on the way home Lord on the highways Satan would truly love to get rid of all of us but you have a protecting hand you have there's a promise that somebody's going to make it and we're are those that are alive and remain at the moment and we pray Lord that you would just sanctify our hearts we're fixing to go back out in the world and go to work and do the things that we have to do Lord knowing that the wheels are turning on the inside there's an eternity walking on this earth that the world has no clue who we are thank you for that Lord you've hit us you said the world will see me no more but you'll see me well I'll be with you even in you till the end of the age by the forgiveness of our sins bless this day and take care of us Lord as we depart and go to our separate ways Lord we pray this you just be with each one because brother Natan sister Caitlin as they go back tomorrow they're gonna stay around tonight with us that's good but they're gonna be going back home tomorrow Lord we just pray that you just lighten their load help them to love each other but one thing is to love you more than anything there is give all our love to Jesus Christ and then all the other things will work out for their self we thank you for these things you've given us Lord we ask you to take care of us in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed [Music] swing
