I want to say I want to see [Music] shining in [Music] pour out your power in love we say Oh Oh hi [Music] shiny of you go perhaps your power in as we sing holy holy [Music] holy holy holy you are [Music] Oh [Music] I want to see [Music] if you want to see them you'll have to look into the world that's the only way to see well I want to echo brother some of the things we said on Sunday about how much we enjoyed the Father's Day trip and everything and and just enjoy and spin this it's a good time of fellowship with everybody talking to listening and and I tell you we've got with what some of the old-timers in here we've got so much information and knowledge in here if we could just kind of get it in a book we'd have something sometimes it's just good to sit around and listen and get some good fellowship in and everything but I tell you love this little group is I think we got to talking about the ministers and things and aside I said I just I'm just glad I get to rub shoulders with this group right not just the ministers but all of you I just really appreciate you and everything so anyway let's tonight I'm gonna look into the The Book of Luke chapter 17 and book of Genesis chapter 18 and we're gonna just take a little thought that I've kind of been meditating on for a few weeks now let's just go to the Lord in prayer well God as we gather together Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll make this night not a night of just vain worship Lord but a night of coming together to look into the mirror of your word to see the day and our that we're living in to see something about ourselves Lord we know that the churches is a is a place of Correction Lord God and we pray Lord that maybe something the night would be said to help us examine ourselves a little bit closer look our to see how we measure up with your word Lord God grant us that you'll give us something Lord to become a little bit closer to that final masterpiece that you're molding us into Lord that we is required of us so that we can take a body change so that we can get out of here we asked o God that your spirit will be made welcome here tonight little Col that you'll just come amongst us and and move amongst the pews and amongst the hours Lord Jesus 30 the angels of your heavenly host will be feel feel welcomed it's just coming among us Lord and rub shoulders with us Lord tonight we pray we ask these things these blessings upon your people in your name Amen so let's just start reading in Luke chapter 17 verses 28 and 32 and it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted their building sounds like things were just kind of going along they they were doing things they were just kind of like we are building building stuff selling stuff but the same day light went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even the shall it be in the day where the Son of Man is revealed in other words it's gonna be just like that does seem like everything's just going along stuffs happening nothing anything to be you know shocked at or anything and it says in that day he would shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife so something interesting about that that scene where Abraham and Laden all that's going on back then so let's turn to turn over to Genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 5 and and read what it says back in the Old Testament and it says and the Lord appeared unto him and the plains of Mamre and he said in the tent door in the heat of the day my kind of picture that in your mind it's hot maybe a little bit miserable they didn't have deodorant back then you know just kind of get it get center stage a little bit and here comes three me and come walking up and he lifts up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now I found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant a little little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are you coming to your servant and they said so do as thou I said you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I know we've heard many many times preached on that many times wouldn't preach on this scripture we talked about that how Abraham recognized he did not recognize a Trinity but he recognized one God he knew the person that he hadn't met years ago and after he'd fought that to go rescue a lot and he recognized because he had a revelation of who God was and he knew who he was talking to and so he he looked and he saw one coming the one that he wanted to speak to but tonight I want to talk not just about that one but about all three because there was a purpose behind all three coming and maybe tonight I want to take the topic of because it was each one of those people that came just to each one of those messengers there was a messenger for Abraham and two messages that went down to two lot they all came with a purpose to address a situation to address a specific category of people that that were there in that particular time period and so you see the same thing is happening today and so tonight I want to take a topic of what kind of believer argued because those three messengers came to address three different categories of people and so let me just read a quote would kind of set the stage here and brother Brown said in it it become with us to fulfill all righteousness he said all right what was it in the days of law was signed it again there was three classes of people in the days of lot was that right that was the unbeliever that make believer and the believer each one of them received a messenger that's right when Abraham was sitting under his though what taking place look what taking place there was an angel came down and went down into Sodom this man went down there and taught we're pennis to them that they should repent and turn to God what happened only three came out lot and his two daughters his wife turned to a pillar of salt only three came out when there was a modern Billy Graham who shot the message down in there too and we see that happening today we see to the nominal Church we see a messenger going forth preaching so we see there's three categories of people now now historically maybe a lot of the older ones could look back at all the different times this kind of sermon has been preached in churches before and you know you can use ministers are many times almost use it to kind of beat people over the head with it I remember my parents might be listening in but I remember years ago they told me about whenever kind of coming up in the message they sat in a little church and and there was it was a very small church and it just happened to be the pastor the pastor's family and them that was all that was in there and the print the pastor began to preach about how he could smell out the goats and all this kind of stuff and he had began to look around his life there's nobody else here but just like one or two that belong to the pastor's family so yeah I don't believe that brother Branham preached his sermon I don't believe that he preached this to to kind of walk you over the head but I believe he preached it to to cause you to inspect yourself not so that we can inspect one another and look at underneath one another and say aha aha I think that you would make believer I think you're an unbeliever but so that you would and begin to realize maybe the the place that you are in your life and the category that you fall in because we may be maybe a little bit later on and this message we'll examine at the end of the message three kinds of believers when brother Branham was preaching that he began to to move the people's minds into identifying themselves with the category that they fit in now now if you want to look at maybe Abraham the the category of Abraham the category of the true believer first of all you got to realize that Abraham was on a journey and you're on the journey too and at the end of Abraham his journey he met he met this band God revealing himself in flesh he met himself he met this man at the end of his journey so so what's gonna happen to you at the end of your journey see - at the end of that message as I was saying brother Branham began to say if you want to identify yourself with any of these categories of people you got to look at these people that are in the Bible that played out these same scenarios you got to either look at Abraham a lot or the sodomize down there in Sodom or look at NASA they'll um or you got to look at Judas or all these different ones that played out all these different roles so so we want to look at what Abraham was and what it what it means to be a true believer first and find out if we fit ourselves if we can fit ourselves in that category because we want to find out what the difference is what's what's the difference between a real true believer and an unbeliever who thinks they're a believer and a make believer who's just hanging out what's the difference there's got to be some kind of some major difference now now I would say you know Abraham and his go on this journey he was a changed man from that from the when he began on his journey and we're all here to be changed and we're looking for the thing that will give us the tip will give us change and I believe the thing that will change us the things that is changing us is the new birth experience it is the opening of the word as it's being revealed to us and you see a lot of times when especially as you see the things going on in the world today we look for something else other than the word and maybe that's really what I'm majoring on tonight we start with what the real true believer is anchored in the Word of God so he's not going to be shaken when bad things come when bad things happen and so you know the danger of the make believer and the unbeliever and maybe a little believer even when he starts backsliding is to get his mind off of the word because anything off of the word is gonna start giving them a shaky foundation are you gonna start getting off of you're off of the thing that is gonna give you real power over the enemy and I say see we think a lot of times just kind of when you when you begin to talk to people you begin to think that the reason that you're put here honor the reason that Abraham was put here on earth the reason he was here put here on earth was to bring forth a nation and all of those kind of in other words to fulfill the Word of God I see your you were here on this earth to fulfill the Word of God also and you're you're not here necessarily to um you know maybe to just just kind of educate your children and and and and and put all kinds of false in their heads you're here to lead them to Christ to lead them to a born-again experience but we're not here to change the world by passing laws and and signing things into a you know all the commotion or everything about abortion and pedophilia and all that kind of thing those are things that we can get all worked up about but yet you are not sitting here in this earth to sign laws to change the world the you what your the way that God ordained way to change the earth is to is to preach the gospel for the gospel to be preached for people to believe it and for their lives to be changed that way but what one scripture that I like to quote over and over again is that scripture in Ecclesiastes that says there's you can't make every path straight so there's a lot of crooked paths that are straight in the world and you can't straighten everything out but what you can do is help others to see Jesus Christ show that they're changed and as more and more people are changed eventually the whole earth will be changed by the same process that you and I are being changed by going through justification sanctification and the baptism the Holy Ghost now kind of think about that as Abraham sitting there under that oak tree and and later looking down at Sodom and Gomorrah as these three men come up he didn't run down to Sodom and Gomorrah to go pass on all kind of laws and things and they go get stirred up with all the politics and everything and get all stirred up in that Avenue you know he wasn't concerned about who the president of Sodom and Gomorrah was or all that kind of stuff if you if you catch my meeting because you see that kind of stuff is not going to change anything if you have a good president for a while eventually a bad prisoner is going to come in if you have if you make if you sign some good laws eventually a bad law is gonna get signed and all kinds of things are going on behind the scenes that we don't even have any idea of but the thing that will change it will really affect good change the only could change is the new birth in our lives you see that's what we all need we we to be born again we need to be born again and I think sometimes we get in our in our heads that we kind of move move away from what it really means to be born again now we know in the Old Testament Abraham was not born again because the the sacrifice the sacrifice of that day their life could not come back on the believer the believer could not be cleansed so that the sacrifice so that that life could come back and all those kind of things but yeah yeah and this day it what it was typing was that that that there's more to this just and just being a good person there's more of this and just trying to affect things in a political realm or whatever we need we need to adhere to the Word of God that is the only way that change can be wrought in our lives you see you won't be changed because you're friends with a popular preacher I think sometimes that's what we try to do we we would you know people want to be your friends which is good I like friends and everything but but being friends with a minister or whatever won't won't change you you got to be friends with Jesus Christ you got to be friends with him you got to get maybe get along get concerned about your state your the place that you're in spiritually right now and get alone with God sometime and find out what he really means to you what he wants to do to you hell is gonna be filled with good people there's a lot of good people you see and it's more there's more at stake here than just living a good life and being a good person and and maybe not listening to the wrong kind of music and and all those kind of thing that that checklist that we check off you know a lot of times it may be even parents they think that that we can change our kids by maybe like getting them married off to somebody that that would be good for them or whatever my many times that's just that ends up like the worst like a horrible little stewpot of disaster just throw a myth in there and stir it all up and you end up with something horrible but but if you can get them changed first I would say that I want my I would want all of my children to find a good Holy Ghost field man or a woman for my son so especially for my daughters I want I want good holy-o's field man to lead and guide them and direct their lives so that so that so that you know the whole family I said in order tried trying to try to effect change any other way than by the Word of God is just disastrous the Word of God is the only thing that will change us many times we think we'll start thinking that maybe we need like there's some good old doctor feel kind of preaching or dr. Dobson somebody that would advise us and and talk get down maybe at a small level with about Family Matters and all that kind of thing but I believe that what we need is instruction by the word now all that fits in the word of course you've got you've got scriptures about a home life and all that kind of stuff but the Word of God is what we need you see that is the difference between the unbeliever the believer and the make believer is the revelation of the Word of God and this our revelation is the only thing that will keep you it's been the same I say in this hour but it's been in every hour and every hour that is the only thing that will keep you as a revelation a personal revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's the only thing that will keep you and in John chapter 6 verse 66 to 68 jesus said ask the twelve he said this is Jesus and this is really the scripture that brother in John chapter 6 that brother Branham was preaching on when he preached his sermon on it and when he got to the point where he Jesus will begin to he was preaching the third pool and began to talk about I accept you eat my flesh and drink my blood and all these kind of things and everybody it when it when the word went forth it began to split up those three groups of people now now I'm reading this because it says Simon Peter we're talking about the believer here Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life now that doesn't mean that Peter understood that doesn't even mean that he had a revelation but he wasn't gonna go because he was convinced that this man had the words of life a believer is going to anger because he's look he knows he believes that the Word of God is true he's not looking for a loophole or some kind of escape hatch or some kind of shortcut or something he's there he's hanging hanging around because he knows that it's right he's convinced within himself that it's true and if you can ever get your blade to a place where you convince that the minister that your pastor is bringing you the Word of God convinced so much that you believe that brother Branham is a prophet for this age you'll get down and get serious with God about it and get to start to digging through the word and find out what it says I believe that's one thing that I I believe a real true believer ought to do is to find out what they believe fine don't just sit around and let somebody else do the believing for you but find out what's what's over here what's over there and find out what he said about Daniels seventy weeks and what he find out what he said about the seals and find out whether it's something that's important or not because that is the only thing that is going to change you it's not going to change you if you it might change you for the worst if you get married to the wrong person or it might change you to the better if you get married to the right person it might change you if you go get a job at a good place it might change it if you get around good helpful people in the world but the only thing that will change you enough to get you out of here is the Word of God the Word of God you see Simon Peter when when when Jesus asked him who do you say that I am in Matthew chapter 16 and he answered thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he wasn't basing that on what somebody else had told him he had he was convinced within himself because he had received a revelation of the father and that's how you and I have got to be you know the new birth is not something when you can go to your friends and say God do you think I got the new birth dude let's talk do you what's your opinion about what the new birth is what do you think the new birth is if you go around to all your friends and I think well I think the new birth is where you get a feeling now I think the new birth is when you find the right church I think the new birth is when you when you move up to Jeffersonville and you stay around that group of people I think the new birth is when you what maybe stay around this other group of people you can make the new birth all kinds of things but brother Brown said that the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ personal into you and you don't have to go ask somebody what do you think do you think what do you think about this because you know you Peter didn't have to go ask everybody around the campfires opinion he knew that you are the Christ eagle and as he was talking to Jesus I know that you're the Christ the Son of the Living God I know who you are that's the kind of revelation that will give you that will give keep you anchored in times like this that will keep you anchored and brother Brent talked about how that that when a believer goes beyond the veil that it's like they're they're anchored in there they've got an anchor in there so that when they come out you can't see the anchor but it's still there it's anchored in there behind the veil it's like a ship another example that he gave was a ship on the sea in it it tosses its anchor over the side and down into the deep blue sea the anchor goes until it anchors on a rock or whatever down down at the bottom it's like the ocean is a veil and you can't see that where the anchor is but yet that boat is not going to move and when you go beyond the veil and you're eating from that man of the hidden manna that's only available to the believer that is an anchor to you that cannot you will not be moved because even though you can't see the anchor you're now looking to the unseen you're looking not with your natural eyes anymore but you're looking past that mail pass that Bay like with a boat with the ocean with the anchor pass that veil you know that you're anchored that's the place that the believer has got to come to that our believer will come to that the believer is anchored not oh some hopes or dreams but an anchor of who they know God is the Bible says that they that know that God shall do great exploits why will they do great exploits because they have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is the Bible says this and wonders will follow them that believe why will they follow him because the one that gave them the revelation is now living in the inside of them performing and doing the works it's Jesus Christ made alive in you that's the only thing that will change you is the word revealed Jesus gave an example of a house built upon a rock and a house built upon sinking sand and then that parable he gave both of those houses were buffeted you know many times will think well I'm going through a rough time I'm being buffeted and everything well both houses all the houses are gonna be buffeted just because you're being buffeted in the rains coming and and maybe you're hearing all these tales about coronavirus and maybe you're hearing all these tales about the police doing bad things and all the things that are going around the earth today maybe you're hearing about you're maybe a little job of suffering losses that's not an accept jobs job was buffeted more than all of us but what kept job is the same thing that will keep you job had an anchor and you know there's a promise in God's Word if you go to inspect to all of the believers down through the history not one of them came out without a victory when Joe came out at the end of his journey at the end of his trial he had double what he was what he started with there's a promise with a believer that God is protecting you God will keep you God will provide for you just it's up to you to be anchored you know I was thinking about what brother Dale's been preaching on about Calvinism versus Arminianism you know God has done his part God did his part by dying and paying it and paying the price on the cross let's make the Calvinism side of it but now that our meaning of this sitting is at the mark Arminius side of it is now you got to do your part you gotta come to church and you got to read and you got to do everything you can to get is that so anchored in the word so that you so that God can have a have a open channel to get inside and work through you and use you and use your body and use your and use your feet and all those kind of things and you see you you got to be anchored in this time you know you look around everybody's got an explanation of this and that everything but only the real true believer has the real true correct explanation of what worked what will precipitate the rapture what what is the requirement for the rapture what do we do it here where did we come from where are we going all those answers there's a lot of people in the news tries it with coming up with a lot of answers there's a lot of people on Facebook that have a lot of answers but the only person that has a real understanding of what's taking place and what we're doing here is the believer with a revelation of Jesus Christ get anchored in Jesus Christ and all this information all these many voices that brother haven't talked about listen to the real true voice that comes from that going beyond the inner veil and anchoring yourself in there in the Holy of Holies I see where I am in my nose let's kind of look at some of the things that were identified in the life of Abraham because God had God had promised God God had promised that Abraham that to Abraham that he was father a nation and so Abraham was believing in that promise and as part of that promise he believed in that promise as Romans chapter 4 says he he this says as it is written I've made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who a guest hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so you see Abraham was looking at the things that he could see and just ignoring him in other words he was saying that everything that I can see is alive all the things that I can see is a lie and you know I believe that that's what the real true believer will do is he will disregard everything that he can see that is contrary to God's Word and look completely holy at God's Word and what you see what that means is that you you will become where you do not stagger at the promises of God because it says that he staggered not and so you will not stagger when you see the doctor's report and when you see the news report the stock market it oh you you think about you think about the faith that Abraham had where he disregarded everything that he could see with his natural eye and then you go to the doctor and the doctor gives you a bad report if you're a seed of Abraham disregard the things that you've seen with your natural eye when that doctor lays that foul report in front of you if it's contrary to God's Word it is a lie do you see do you see that that under that idea of it is a lie builds all the way up from your new birth experience the devil will tell you you're not born again it's a lie the devil will tell you this it's a lie the devil will tell you all the way up until you realize that that mystery of iniquity is a lie because there is no iniquity if this bride you've been purged you've been lost and you've been made spotless everything that the devil's been telling you is a lie it's a lie you've been washed and made white as snow you're clean there's nothing you can come as the wife coming to the groom coming to the marriage walking down the aisle spotless with a veil over your face because you are the word coming to the word the word made flesh everything that the devil tells you was a lie every bond that the devil has you in and when the devil comes and says there's nothing good in you you young people that you have no value let me tell you something if you had no value God we're not coming down the cross for you you begin to think that everybody hates you that the ministers hate you and all that kind of stuff listen listen we wouldn't study and pray and labor for this to get in front of you to tell you a message of good cheer if we hated you and your mom and daddy don't hate you listen nobody hate you you have value let me tell you this you have value and everything that the devil can throw at you is a lie because the devil is a liar and there's no truth in him listen that is what a believer is a believer is somebody they can identify alive say that's a lie I don't believe it I don't believe it I don't believe nothing you got to say devil when you can identify the live it the devil has no hole over you anymore he can't bind you how can the devil bind you with all his lies in his fear if you recognize it and said get thee behind me devil I'm not listening to nothing you got to say listen your whole journey the devil's been trying to tell you that this and that if you look back to your original one day brother Branham came to the point where he said my own natural birth is a lie I'm not the child of Charles and Ella Branham but I'm a child of the king he's the king of kings and Lord of lords because I'm one of his I'm wrapped up in him and I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world I know where I came from I know who my Poppa God is why because I'm a believer I believe Jesus Christ I have a personal revelation of who he is that's what a believer is that kind of believing that couple of believing will anchor you whether devil can throw whatever he can in your face and you you can call it a lie because that's what it is you won't be dissuaded by all the news reports and all the things that people are saying you believe Jesus let's look at another you know brother Brian preached a message five definite identification of the church and that is he was preaching that he used the scripture March 16 to identify what a real believer would be and so if you look at that scripture that says Jesus in mark 16 verse 14 Jesus actually upgraded the disciples for their unbelief any-any said he operated them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen my goodness could you imagine being rebuked by Jesus Christ himself and saying you don't believe and he upgraded them and told him you don't believe you don't believe in the witness to testimony and then he said go ye into all the world he's telling them I'm gonna make you believers and when you're when you come become a believer this is what you are what I want you to do I want you to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature why go into all the world cuz that's the only remedy for what the the predicament that the earth is in preaching the gospel is the only remedy the only thing that will change this earth is the word preached and receive into the heart of an unbeliever or a make believer somebody that doesn't know the beginning from the end somebody that doesn't know anything about God and that word falls into their heart and it sparks into an eternal life and and they become changed that's what I want to be is changed not just sit here in a make-believe situation or an unbeliever sitting well I'm coming to church and Here I am and just go through a life cycle after cycle but I want something further within me I want something burning so much that I something's driving me to get along with God and my prayer closet and get with him something's drawn me to get along with him and pour through the pages of the Bible if you're not being tonight then would you get home or maybe before you leave the night you can come up to this altar and get right with God cuz it's getting right with God time if you're not identified as a believer it's time to be identified that way it's time to get serious Chuck's and stop playing around I want to be a believer I want to be genuine [Applause] and it says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in in my name shall they cast out Devils do you realize what kind of power you've got I think many times we fail to realize the power that we have that you have power to cast the devil out of your home to sanctify your home to cast get rid of all of those pornography magazines and get right on all that rotten music you have power to get rid of all that stuff because it's written here in God's Word power to cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover listen church I still believe that God is a healer because these Hebrews 13:8 if you get in your mind that well we're such a word Church that we don't believe in being healing anybody healed anymore we don't believe in God moving anymore get cast that out of your mind because that is a lie from the devil though all of those things are wrapped up in the word they're part of the word and we still believe that God heals he's still the healer he still moves he can heal your body even right now while you're sitting here listening to me speak he's still able because he's still Hebrews 13:8 he's never changed the only difference is while he was walking on the shores of Galilee in his flesh now he's walking in your flesh and that's the only thing but otherwise he's still the same he's the same God and he's still a healer still a deliver oh my she like get on this listen when when those three men walked up to Abraham and Abraham got up and walked with the Lord over to see the two men go down into Sodom and Gomorrah and he stood there and talked to the Lord listen to what the Lord told him about the attributes of a believer this is another attribute of a believer I don't know if we're gonna get two unbeliever in a make believer but anyway maybe what let's talk about believers not and he said it and verse 17 and he said and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do singing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him now in verse 19 is another attribute of a believer for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him oh my this is a treacherous scripture a little bit because you see a believer is not just gonna go to church and then go to their job and then they have some children coming up and they just don't care anymore a believer is gonna be watching over those children because a believer knows that the only thing that's going to change those children is the thing that changed themselves and that is the Word of God a real true believer is going to sit down with their kids and talk to them about the word and a real true believer is going to be cognizant aware that the things that they do are being watched by those little kids running around listen when you begin to talk about the ministers and things that are going on in church in that the children are listening to you talk about that and then they'll come to church and the minister's behind the pulpit will be ineffectual because they've heard you talking black bad-mouth the things that are going on in church it won't be able to help anymore the children will get their their hearts hearts all hardened up because of the things that you've said behind closed doors not realizing that those little children are listening to you but listen if you bring up those children and and aware of the Lord and edify them and instruct that I'm not talking about just kind of like little baby form doctrine but I believe that in this same age above a real believer can sit down with their children I should be able to talk to you about serpent seeds and tell them all those stories about their brother Brown I'm talking so that when they grow up they have heard those stories about the squirrels being created it's almost beyond fathoming that somebody could come up and not have heard about the squirrels being created you should be ashamed that I'm a middle just a little bit and then I'll apologize or you should be ashamed for not teaching your children those stories those basic stories of Christianity you should be ashamed that's a reproach upon this church do not teach your children those little basic stories about what brother Branham told and the basic things about what Sir Percy Diaz that's a shame and I never approached a little space and now let me back up from that I apologize I'm sorry for meddling I've done did it I committed it [Applause] well you see your children your children are watching the things that you do they're watching the attitude that you have toward the word they're watching whether you are committed enough or whether you've got one foot in and one foot out and they're watching that they're watching to see how your reaction to the word they're watching to see when you go home if you talk about the preaching and say well I don't know if I believe that do you know that you can trickle now that's that's why brother ever said each generation watches worse and worse because it trickles that the momma will be a flapper and the child will be worse than that and the momma might be an unbeliever but what next if you're an unbeliever and make believer don't send that on down to your children but maybe step back and get out of the way so that they can receive the new birth if you don't got it [Music] listen about I think sometimes maybe Minister may be my own self we get to thinking that we're in church to be popular or whatever but popularity has nothing to do with it I believe that preaching of the gospel is to bring truth because truth is what will set you free truth is what will change you it might hurt a little bit in my sting but truth is what we need and that's what you need I don't don't go home and say I'm not going to tell my children truth truth is what they need they need you to pull them over to the side and say listen you're living in sin you're doing wrong I love you but this cannot go on they need you to tell them truth [Music] what they need is for mom and daddy to have a backbone mom and dad have a backbone and tell them like it is and tell them this is what they believe I'm sorry you disagree but but I believe in addressing this particular way I believe in dressing like a Christian because I'm dressing for where I'm going my eternal home into the glory and they don't dress like the world in New Jerusalem and that's where that's where I'm going one day so that's how I'm going to dress and if you don't like it as long as you sit with your feet under my table you've got to abide by my rules listen I believe in setting standards because that's my next point as a believer stands for what they believe in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 it says wherefore taken either whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand in other words after you been clothed yourself in the armor of the Word of God then you were equipped to stand and you will stand you will stand for something you're not a man that will doesn't stand for something is going to fall for anything and I believe a real believer in this day is gonna stand for something they're not just gonna have a wishy-washy backbone they're not gonna let their their family their the man a real Christian man is not gonna let his wife run all over him and tell him to sit at set him in the back seat and say I'm gonna drive wherever I'm I'm gonna lead my family a real Christian man is gonna be the head of his home and if you want to stand for something you got to know what you're standing for a real Christian man is gonna know what he's standing for a real Christian young man or young lady is gonna know what they're standing for you know I you think about maybe if maybe tonight think about the things that you stand for do you stand for something what are you staying for I stand for a genuine new birth experience I don't stand for just coming to church year after year and just kind of hoping that everything works out all right but I stand for a new birth experience where a change has been wrought in your life I stayed I stand for an old-fashioned altar experience like Abel had like weren't able we're brother have talked about when he brought a sacrifice up to the altar and he and he laid himself upon that sacrifice he laid himself up there because listen I believe I believe sometimes you get to a place where you just you can't you're so sick of yourself you want something to happen and I believe that's what happened with Abel's life I believe I believe when you when you realize that maybe you don't fit in that believer category maybe you're sliding over into that make believer or unbeliever category something on a prick your soul so much that you want something to be changed in you you own something you own something real and that's that old-fashioned alter experience like brother Rama had in his woodshed where he got to pray it and he got to calling out to God God was drawing him sure but he was responding God was doing the draw and that's the Calvinism it but he responded he got on his knees and fulfilled his part that's the Arminianism don't let the Arminianism slide you've got to do your part you got to get in the word and find out whether you're a real believer or not and then the last thing that I'm gonna talk about a believer at that time is moving around a little bit it's already eight o'clock when Abraham looked down and Sodom and Gomorrah something began to prick you when you look at that make believer when a real believer looks said that make believer and unbeliever something goes to stir it when you've got when God's got a hold of you and you you have a real true revelation of what this message is something begins to move it inside of you a feeling for the people listen you know that's the only way that really you can reach people is the love of God is inside of you and the only thing that'll bring that kind of Agape Love not figlio not storge all those other greek expressions of love the agape love the feeling for your brother is is that revelation of who he is and Abraham had a revelation he was talking to that son of man standing there beside him and he looked down at Sodom and Gomorrah and began to call out what about lot what about these are righteous believe is there anybody down there that can be saved you know there's a quote where brother Brennan said that lot was saved because of Abraham because and I believe that in this day the foolish virgin are going to be impacted by the life that the believer lives and it'll keep them sanctified they don't they'll desire to L desire to stay away from the denominational system the desire to stay away from all those things and it'll keep them it'll keep maybe your prayers will keep them maybe maybe your desire to talk to him a little bit will keep them and what what saves people this attribute that I'm talking about is that sigh and and cry and this doubt that a real true believers make man making manifest do you know there's so many scriptures in the Bible that talk about a believer sign and crying a believer something inside of them to longing to see other save if you don't have that longing inside of your heart to see other people save just not not just your kids but the whole church the whole the whole human race something's missing in your life are you falling in that category of a real true believer tonight is there something inside of you this sign and crying to see other people saved let's read what the scripture says in Abraham do near and said will thou also destroy the righteous with the root wicked peradventure there be 50 righteous within the city will they also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and then the other scripture that we commonly quote as the sequel chapter 9 verse 4 and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof but the scripture that I really kind of fallen want to focus on is the scripture that's that's kind of the hallmark of a mixed multitude is about in the Bible and that's when the Israelites came to kadish Barnea that mixed multitude all huddled around and all mixed in Israelites Egyptians have mixed all kind of whatever you could say the same thing as we're talking about here those three categories the real true believer the unbeliever and then make believer and look look at what Joshua and Caleb his reaction to this situation is the make believer and the unbeliever said I don't think that we can go in now think about this now this is one one kind of maybe a topic that I've talked to Zack a lot before how few there were how few there were just to Joshua and Caleb were the only ones that had a revelation that they could take the land they had a revelation they were so anchored that they knew that their God it didn't matter all the Giants it didn't matter all the obstacles because they were seeds of Abraham they're of the seed of Abraham that's being of the seed of Abraham was when you disregard you call everything that you can see that it's contrary to God's Word as a lie God is able to give us power to take over the land and it says in numbers chapter 14 verses 4 to 6 and they said one to another letters make a captain and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh which were of them they searched the land rent their clothes could you imagine that dismay that they had to see that they were they were there they were there at the door to the promised and they were raided it cross over it's like it's like when you're going to a good get together with your friends and all your friends are like I don't want to go at the last minute and they were there at the place at the crossing over and everybody else said God is not able to live could you imagine think what was in their minds maybe the same thing that's in many of us many of the true believers Minds today as we think about how God has sent a pillar of fire God has sent signs and wonders God sent a prophet that turned his back to the audience and called out sins and sicknesses behind him and God said the word in this hour to give us rapture and faith to turn our hearts back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers he pulled out all the stops and then to come to that crossing-over place and say we're not able to do it that would cause anybody to rent their clothes to rid their clothes and say what's it's God not the same yesterday today and forever is he not the same today that he's always been he still Hebrews 13:8 he's still able to fulfill his word he's not a backslider on his promises if he started you on your journey he's able to finish it and that's where we get into the unbeliever and I'm not gonna I know we're kind of closing in on on I'm not gonna take as much time with the unbeliever and the make believer as they did with a believer don't get worried I know it's was denied and I'm not going to keep you forever but but look look at some of these these kind of high points of their unbeliever because that there's a difference between the unbeliever and the and the genuine believer and then make believer and the unbeliever you know he thinks he's a believer but the unbeliever has a problem with and you can go back and search this out through the message what the unbeliever has a problem with is a revelation and so an unbeliever looks at everything through that carnal and the story of Abraham and lot lot o types to make believer by the sodomites and all those carnal down there type the unbeliever now now they're in a city but today brother Branham said the those three categories are all looked together under the same roof and we might not have any sodomites like that here but you can still be carnal in your mind and be looking at the word through through your flesh through your fleshly understanding through the understanding of your brain matter without looking at it through that understood a filter of the revelation of God's Word through that thinking man's filter the thinking man's filter will give you an understanding of what the word is and so a carnal believed a carnal unbeliever will try to figure everything out and they'll they'll they you know they'll come and argue and I just kind of wrote down some things just some things that brother and I said about it they're fine as long as they can get it explained and so that's what they want you to do is they want you to explain it out just line it out so that they can get it through their carnal reasoning and then that'll be good enough for them they want to be convinced in their mind like Cain think about Cain as he came up to that offering he said let's talk it over a little bit now Abel had a revelation that it was by blood but Cain was looking at it through his natural understanding I heard it was a fruit tree so I'm gonna go out and get some guard I'm gonna do some garden I'm gonna bring some fruit and some some some baskets of stuff that I got in the field because I heard it was a fruit God said don't eat it fruit so he's looking at it through his natural understanding that is the unbeliever but see God can take God can take old prickly unbeliever and make him a believer so if you're looking today looking sitting with a critic line and thinking I don't know if that's true whatever your state is God is able to take you from that state and put himself inside of you transform you change you by the opening of the word and make you a real true believer somebody that doesn't dispute with the word and I was looking for Luke just looking for a chance to turn around and go the opposite direction bugger up said an unbeliever it's fine as long as long as they can get patted on the back fine as long as you could think about that an unbeliever does not care about Revelation you could Pat them on the back as long as you pat them on the back o give them a hot dog or give them a nice treat or whatever that'll keep them in church but a real believer is there for the word you know brother Brown typed it a lot of times it's like you're fishing and you put a bait on the hook and people come for the bait which is signs and wonders lovely people who the fellowship food a lot of times all that kind of stuff but the fish is gonna bite on that hook and then it's got its got caught and the hook is sharp it hurts a little bit and the hook is the hook of the word so a lot of times we come we come around the unbeliever might be attracted by the good fellowship and being among good people and everything but let him get a taste of that hook one time but he'll get changed the fisherman will pull him out on the shore and it'll change him into something let's see well brother Brown is another thing that brother I just got just a little snippets of things that he said about what an unbeliever is he said when truth or rebuke came they couldn't take the word think about how true that is listen that that hooks got a point on it and it hurts and everything but a real believer wants to be changed they know that's what we're here for and if you tell me the truth I can be changed if you hold it back then really if you're holding back from a believer they get upset with you because they they start thinking you're you're trying to hurt me you don't want my good tell me the truth pop me over the head with it what I want the truth because the truth will change me but an unbeliever just can't take it it's hurtful you tell an unbeliever well you need to be in church well III come on my own time you telling unbeliever they with a long list of all the things that we could say and they blow up and everything because they they don't want they don't see the value in a revelation all they see the value in is being patted on the back and being being built up within themselves so that people can look at them and and and say they're a great guide on everything but we don't want great guys we want somebody that's a real got a real revelation of the truth and they'll say here's another thing brother Brown say that that's too much he said an unbeliever will say that's too much I don't believe we're sitting in church and you started talking about like Jesus when he said except you sweep my flesh and drink my blood that's too much except you eat my flesh and drink my blood whoa whoa now and he said another thing oh I can't believe stuff like that I've never heard of that in my life ain't that a lot of times when you come to church hear hear things that are very strange hear things about a lot of a lot of things that aren't really preached out in the denominational world three pulls that sounds really strange but don't turn around and just go back the other way but hang on a little bit and find out what it really means don't be like an unbeliever and just turn around and go back and listen I'm preaching this like like like we got somebody that might have somebody about to leave the church and that's what not what I mean but you can be an unbeliever sitting here you do that you can unbeliev it be an unbeliever just sit here and turn the dial off and not go further because that's what brother Branham said and I'm believe unbelief will just stop you right in your tracks if you if the bullet if the preachers preaching the sanctification and you say I don't believe that you you're gonna be stuck at justification if the preachers preaching the baptism of the holy ghost comes by receiving the incorruptible seed of God which is the Word of God and you say I don't think that's right I the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just kind of feeling stuff or something whatever else you you will you won't be able to move forward it will stop you in your tracks and that's true all the way up so maybe you get up you get up and closer and closer to adoption and the minister start talking about what adoption really is and the opening of the seals and you say I don't need that I don't I don't know if I need to understand all that then you won't be able to move forward don't don't yield the unbelief like evening but open yourself up to the Word of God so that God can have preeminence in your life and and I'm gonna kind of skim through some quotes so we can get restrict to the mate and make believer in and close up here but Bertha I'm stressed so highly that the church is entirely built upon spiritual revelation and that's the difference here the unbeliever don't want spiritual revelation the believer won't sit at least the believer is honest about what he believes I believe the unbeliever the unbeliever will say well I don't believe that the unbeliever will say well that's too much but a mate believer will sit there and just hang on and act like he's a real true believer and brother around was stressing now that's the most dangerous one of all now not dangerous for you and I not dangerous for you know a believer it's not dangerous it's dangerous for a make believer to sit in that situation and that's why I believe that he preached this sermon so that he could he could identify so that the make believer could be identified in that category and then do something about it now y'all hang on with me just so just a little bit are we doing all right don't don't get don't get tired on me I know sometimes you back get so hurt and everything hang on but if your back hurts too bad then you can go back and listen to it on the recording I guess brother ever said Abraham and the message to Abraham he said now I see Abraham sitting in the tent door one morning he said there was a big oak tree in front of this place there this is a 1961 the message Abraham he said they claim the oak still stands they got it preserved they say well there were we had his tent pitched out there on the desert lot was down there my guess if they had had such a thing he'd had a big sit listen I would describes a lot I guess if they had had such a thing he'd had a big cigar and mayor of the city you know and misses a lot and her daughters and all of them going around to all the fashioned soap shows watching the TV and patterned after the styles of those days but Sara stood truth truth Abraham stood truth they stayed with God stayed out there now those things that I just read in that quote they might not really heat anybody nobody's here mayor or nobody nobody smoked cigars and all those kind of things but the point still stands that a make believer likes to have their foot out in the world a little bit or out in some strange doctrine a little bit or just kind of dabbling in this stuff that it's not sticking right straight right down the line with a true Word of God they like they like they liked all the comforts of the world and you know the Bible says that if you love the world or the things of the world that love of God is not even eating you a make-believe or maybe maple or just we just play a little bit of country music on the side because I you know it doesn't bother me when there's talking about us singing all them songs about adultery and all that kind of stuff you see I make believe I might not have a problem with out with with drugs or movie stars or looking at all this fashion lascivious clothing or just a little bit of fornication or what if I've got a little fornication going on in my home I don't have a problem with that or a little bit of swear words that we say every now and then because I got my foot halfway in and halfway out and listen you can almost go down the road of making it looking like a legalistic form but I'm talking about doctrine to a real true believers gonna stay right with a word but a make believers halfway in and a half way out and dabbling with stuff that he shouldn't ought to be but listen because what a make believer is is he's not quite sure what the real evidence of the new birth is he's not quite sure how he should be acting he's not quite sure how everything operates I'm not quite sure how the healing operates but we're going to kind of go through the motions of preying on somebody not quite sure how the new birth works or everything but I'm going to try to try my best to kind of act and put on a good show because brother I'm said of make believer is the one that puts those like a crow sticking those peacock feathers in him he's not quite sure how he should become a peacock but he's going to do his very best to act like a peacock and that's what I make believer is now see an unbeliever will just kind of turn around and go the the way sigh that's too much I can't believe it but a make believer will hang around and say yeah a P being a peacock is a good thing being a real believer is a good thing I want to stick this peacock feather in me so that everybody else will think that I'm something that I'm not see I make believer as a hypocrite I make believer doesn't realize yeah I make believer doesn't know what the word says but he thinks he does you see how it all comes back to Revelation and I'm believer dunwall revelation and a make believers trying to fake it and we were talking on the way over here my wife was sharing a quote that she read were brother I was talking about the Pharisees how they could they were they saw Jesus even all the disciples before the new birth they they touched him and they held him and they could talk to him and so they knew Jesus in the flesh excuse me but they didn't they knew Jesus in the flesh was how many people do today they know by coming to church and it's being around they know from an intellectual understanding everything but what's lacking is a revelation a personal revelation of who that person is it's not enough just to be able to read the Bible and what we were talking about eyes out how denomination Baptists and what not it's a lot of times by because they know Jesus by the flesh they can argue Scripture and back and forth and talk about go around and around in circles and everything but they're still lacking a revelation of who he is they're still lacking the ability to read between the lines see I make believer brother am said will always be sitting around hanging around looking for a fault why they why are they looking for false all the times because they know within themselves that they're faker and so they think everything else is fake there they're like we talked before many times in private about projecting for somebody that's guilty of something they'll project that on somebody else a lot of times to say you're you're an adulterer or whatever when they themselves are guilty and see that's what the make-believe they themselves are not a genuine article so they start pointing fingers and everything else saying well I wonder if that's truly true I wonder maybe maybe say about the ministers I wonder I wonder if those ministers really do have the new birth how would you know how would you know if they really got the new birth how do you even know that brother Branham was right how do you know that brother rounds are real prophet all those kind of thing looking for a fault faking it and what they're doing is they're presuming and brother Brown said to presume as to venture without authority and authority comes by the revelation of the word so if you go out without and without a revelation you're just presuming and a make believer just presumes now some examples just to look at it real quick in the Bible or you know when it went when Ghazi when Elisha and Gaza got surrounded by all the Syrians Ghazi got all wrapped up and began to look at circumstances and everything and he began to you know began to look at things look at circumstances and whatnot now now we don't we don't want to keep our eye on circumstances we want to but but see when the lie just said he prayed and his eyes were open and all of a sudden he became anchored in the word now what would anchored him in the word all those angels that he saw all of a sudden they didn't do nothing they didn't yank their swords out they didn't go to fighting or whatever but Gahan Z realized that those angels were there and that presence of the angels realized to anchor to him in the faith and all of a sudden he knew that now we are able the God God's on our side the Syrians aren't able to do anything against this because now Ghazis anchored in the word you can see that's what that's the difference between presuming and actually being anchored before he's all afraid and wondering look at look at the signs of the times you might look at all the things that are happening in the earth and not be anchored but now is the time to pray that God will open your eyes to the revealed truth and when your eyes are opened like the Hajis eyes were open it will anchor you in the word now here's another example Peter Peter began to presume you know you know yes Jesus can I step out on the water onto the water and he he began to he began to walk out he had on that substance faith and then began to look at circumstances and he began to sink but now see that's our problem we look at circumstances and things news articles and things going on in the world instead of looking at the world of God but when his eyes got back on Jesus then he was able to walk back into the boat on that substance faith and see this is what Paul was worried about he said in Colossians chapter 2 verse 4 he said and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words in Colossians chapter 2 he said let no man beguile you of your reward and the voluntary humility and worshipping of angels but God you means to get you off of the of the right thing to make you to get you to look at something else other than the word if you can just stay focused right on the word that is the thing that will keep you and will change you and will keep you to the finish line see another thing the brother under said about these make believers he said they'll say oh I believe this and I believe this and I believe this but oh you know I heard somebody say it's so in so x to see that's beguiling words I heard somebody say I heard somebody see you there's so many voices interpreting the events and things but modern events are made clear by prophecy if you if you can look into the message you'll you won't be led astray by all the a brother I said Oh see just long with ears see it make believers got them long years trying to find out the secret to the whole thing what's the secret to a new birth what's the secret what's the secret to a body change trying to figure it out so that they can think it and he said and that's exactly what the Judas finds right now he'll come right along with the meeting and watch ride around until he can find that little spot that he oh there it is that's it see oh that's the way it's done that's the way it's done so he can impersonate it and that's why I believe that the angel random when you're preaching the third pool keep your mouth shut because if you tell it all then the enemy will be able to do great damage you don't tell everything because the devil will be able to impersonate it and fool people and and and do who those were let's see a real true believer will keep their eye on the word in Matthew chapter 24 it says behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say to you behold is in the desert go not forth behold his and the secret chambers believe it not for see all these different interpretations of the word I'll tell you what you really need to be doing is good be going over here I'll tell you what you really need to be doing is coming to this church over here all these all these kind of things for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shining even under the west so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together and what that means is the real true believer is not going to be paying much attention to all these carnal impersonations and all these kind of voices all these different news interpretations I tell you what this what this coronavirus is is this and that I'll tell you what this is what all these things mean I tell you when what we need when when Donald Trump was elected that's the last Trump well that's a bunch of hogwash that's not identifying that's not identifying that the secret to a body change the secret to a body change lies in the word not who's the president or who's who's in politics and all that kind of stuff now one day there is going to be a final president but that's not the thing that I'm looking at as the indicator I'm not looking at what when they start building the temple when they finally figure out the place on the Temple Mount where they can start building that's not going to give me a body change even if even if the earthquake happens there's another earthquake in Los Angeles is gonna happen and there's gonna be plenty of people left that's not gonna be the secret to their body changed but the secret to your body change the secret lies in the word it's a secret that only the bride will know the bride knows what she's here for and what she's doing and the word the word the truth is the separator it separates the unbeliever and I'm winding down now the separate though the truth is what separates the unbeliever to make believer and the real believe the truth now I think many times over the years people have tried to set do the separating by beating one and over over the head and and being mean to one another but that that's not how it works it's the truth that separates the all can go the musicians can go ahead and come on up I'm gonna be winding down but but you see even in this day as in that day I believe that believe the true believer is still crying out to cease lost souls saved I believe I'm trusting that the door is not yet closed yet that the last one has not yet come in and there's still time to change if you're if you find yourself falling in that category of an unbeliever or a make believer then quickly get out of that category find find it into your heart to get down on your knees and get in God's Word and get serious about God that's where I want myself tonight to get so serious with God that that I just get more and more closer to him every day I don't ever want to get stagnated and stale and get like old cesspool or something I always want to be drawing more and more in love with Jesus Christ don't ever forget don't ever forget that first love don't ever forget how to get close with God get just shut that that prayer closet and get alone with God and get get along with him and just talk things over with him I think that's what so many times we we've forgotten those little basic things a real true believer will know their God because they have a revelation of who he is and they'll want that fellowship in that communion with him they won't de stick close with you amen let's stand to our feet just just saying something since forwards [Music] I'm not real prone to having spiritual dreams but I've only had a couple in my whole life that I can recall and y'all remember brothers act black had a dream he shared with us real simple dream but very scriptural and it was about three months ago I think and he his dream was simply that he went to a table and he was eating and he looked down he was never full he kept eating and eating and eating which goes along with my dream that means eating the word he's the babe right I mean he's just been born again so he's eating well we have been born again for a while our supposed to be doing the same thing we're never supposed to stop that we don't look down on Zack said well you need to eat no we all need to eat right after he had that dream I had a dream and this can all just be seated for just a minute just take about five minutes I'm sorry to take your time but I had this dream that I was I was here at the church and out in the parking lot there was a pool in the ground something like a pond roughly in volume about the size of maybe three of Terrance and lisas swimming pools about the size of the sanctuary I guess and you know in the Bible water represents a lot of things but if it's a body it represents people so let's assume this represents this congregation because it was that church and it was this is where I go to church so I was out there and in my mind I thought I was making corn bread it was just kind of weird but that was already those three ingredients that was the water that was already in that pond and I was adding to it handfuls of cornmeal I had like a bucket under my arm and I was putting in these handfuls of cornmeal as I walked around and around this pond okay and then the third ingredient was oil like vegetable so water cornmeal and all there was not enough all in my mind I thought I needed for some reason four measures of all for this recipe I had to go back in church to get more all I don't know if this is an if game but I'll tell her because she was in the dream sister June was helping me get more all I don't know why while she was in the dream but anyway I was in the basement of the church getting more oil and then came back out and there was still not enough all to have four measures and there's not a shortage of word there's not a shortage of Revelation but there is a shortage of seekers people seeking and making themselves available which by the way just saying God I'm available that's not making yourself available as studying and praying and seeking God that's making yourself available anyway there was not going to be enough all but I added all that I had I kept and I was walking around and around this pawn adding these ingredients okay there are three significant characters to that pond in other words three characters that were somehow interacting in different ways with that pond your believer make believe an unbeliever the most important one was on the far end and she was facing that way which is odd to me because that would be West I think but she was submerged under the water the whole dream she never surfaced she never came out which I was spooked out I thought maybe she's drowning but she was not panicked she was just sitting underwater looking up at me every time I made a pass adding these ingredients of cornmeal and all she was just looking up at me she was very receptive very attentive and she was not paying attention to what the other two were doing to me she represents the bride the believer because she was sitting there just receiving these ingredients staying underwater staying settled established firm never moving and always stay in there in that water and receiving those ingredients but now and and to describe her the best I could say is she was young 20 to 30 years old but I can't tell because I couldn't see her she was underwater looking up at me the other two there was one on a a a lady girl on a platform above the pool always at the pool but never getting in the water she would sit there and talk about it she would sit there and talk about how good it looked and how much she wanted to go the water but she would never just get in the water she wasn't afraid she just wouldn't get in the water she sat there always at the pool but never getting in just talking about it all the time and I'm afraid that's where a lot of people are sitting like brother Bob was talking about because they just won't go on and receive a new birth the other one was like a boy ten years old Latino looked like a dark complexion dark hair and he was just jumping in and out of the pool in and out in and out up and down he was always in and out sometimes he was there sometimes it's not getting in and out of the pool and just like he was playing in a pond you know oh I laughed at the dream I got up and I said Gabby I had a dream I made cornbread for the whole church and I just went on and thought it was just a silly dream and the more I meditated on that dream for the last three months the more thought about how spiritual I was and I thought maybe it's just for me I asked the Lord do I need to share this with the church and I waited and I waited and I waited and then earlier this week I woke up to the sound of brother Dale's voice saying tell the dream and I don't know I thought maybe I should just go ahead and tell it and I'm still kind of waiting and then brother Bob came to night and preached believer make believe an unbeliever so I thought I should tell it but ever since that time I've had in my mind a vision of this girl I'm not worried about the believer and the mate believer and unbeliever just that one girl that represents the bride they're sitting there receptive always attentive always listening and receiving the word and it's been just an image in my mind it'll order let me beat that one like my wife sits up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning listening to sermons of these men she's not listening to other ministers in the message she specifically listening to our five ministers because these are men sent to us there were deign to see us through that's why I'm so built up on this fivefold ministry that God's given us and listening over and over and over if I fall asleep whether I fall asleep or not I go back missing over and over and over to these sermons gleaning every little nugget that I'm getting because I want those ingredients which is the word and spirit that's what I want the word in the spirit god bless hey we shake that the Bible says young men will seep dream dreams old men or young men will see visions old men will dream dreams they may appreciate that sing I know I stand back up and just worship I hear the call [Music] [Applause] that should hit all three categories tonight to give up if you're a believer a big believer and get out of that category and get in this little believer so that you're identified like brother branham said a another sermon to be identified find your identification what kind of people in the Bible you identify with [Music] slide [Music] st. wrong on you tonight what you just kill me talk it over with tell me where it all [Music] prayer cloth goes to when Jesus accomplished beware the senses are so accomplish your purpose and the bless of God traitors he wants your all not not luckily not just a little bit give him everything like that woman with that came with an alabaster box and she she broke it all because she wasn't planning to take it take it to go back and get a refund she had come to get everything to Jesus she broke that alabaster box [Music] [Music] and please maintain [Music] a man who's just loved his presence it's good to just linger in the presence of the Lord sometimes you know another attribute of a believer is that nobody can worship like a believer because nobody knows where they're worshipping like the believer did a really Verne O's how to worship a man let's worship him some more let's think something else Jesus hold my hand you see 2:28 [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to be to their blessed Jesus for my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] leave me [Music] [Music] [Applause] let's say Jesus a man we love the Lord a night I dig here there's so many benefits to being a Christian a real believer I'll tell you when I when I came out here I had I've had the worst headache all day long and it is gone I just thank God for His healing mercy and for His grace and for keeping us all we have so many things to be thankful for and listen as you go out the doors no matter what comes will come what may tomorrow the rest of the week just remember that God is on your side because you're a believer let's go to the Lord in prayer and we'll be dismissed we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace to us and I thank you Lord God for your visitation for your moving among us tonight Lord Jesus for opening up the word to us Lord and I pray God that you'll be with your people as they go on their separate ways a little god and help them and keep them through the rest of the week Lord God bless your people all would pray we thank you God for your goodness to us Lord we ask these things in your name Amy sing it to amaze your desire
