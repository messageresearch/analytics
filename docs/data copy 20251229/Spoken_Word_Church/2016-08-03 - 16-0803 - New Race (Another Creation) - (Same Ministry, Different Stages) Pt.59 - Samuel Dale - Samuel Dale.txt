========================================

[Music] shining in the light of your glory is that your desire pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy I and lifted up shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your power and love holy holy [Music] holy holy holy holy holy holy holy amen holy hly holy and I want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you so then what do we do we look into his word because it's been delivered unto us and there we can see the day and the hour that we're living and you know we can find him the prophet said if you can't see Christ in every verse he said go back and read it again he said because you missed it all right so that's what we're looking for right Christ not necessarily the word Jesus but the Christ is the main point right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord remember now that this coming Sunday now Friday we're leaving to go up if anybody else wants to go along with us up to the Ruth meeting we run up Friday night and come back so you got to let us know tonight where we can make any kind of arrangements or whatever to go up but we have to leave here about 1:30 Friday to be able to go so that's just if you want to go with us we'll try to haul year whatever we can do but just remember that and all right then remember this coming Sunday brother George Quinn from Ireland will be with us ministering for us on Sunday Services then brother Keith Reed from Jamaica will be with us on Wednesday the 10th and then brother Nester from the Philippines will be with us on the 14th and I'm sure every time we get there Friday night that they'll be more added to the D and I really enjoyed brother uh Serano this past weekend I thought he' done a marvelous job I told him that was the best things did from the pull pits you know that's best I've heard him preach and I really enjoyed it because it was good and I pray that we're going to be blessed by all who comes to speak to us because that's the desire of our heart right is for the lord to bless and help each one of us so remember that okay Terren made one announcement but I'll make this one uh remember that uh the church wants to welcome Thomas into our church family and to help out on the expenses and things or getting things to whatever to do to him and all they will have a money tree it will not be put up now until August the 28th okay so don't look for it and try to do but the reason they're saying a money tree is because you know you try to buy this and you buy that and and all like that and I'm sure he would like to have it but uh you know it' be better to have the money where they can go and buy the things that he will need and then that that Sunday the 28th there will be after the evening service will be uh the fact of having cake and ice cream and so just remember that I'll keep that in my in my Bible where I remember to announce it so if you'd like turn in your scriptures to Revelations 3 and 4 we'll try to pick up where we left off last Wednesday and we're going to try to get up to a point tonight and cut off and then uh it will be a couple of weeks before we'll be back to Ministry so that gives you time to kind of think things over and meditate in your mind as to what's being said now we covered last Wednesday we spoke about how that the ministry of Jesus Christ it it it will have to be in the bride of Christ and we're talking about that but to see the ministry of Jesus Christ in many stages now and maybe you don't understand my word stages or whatever mean it just means a process that he went through and he we'll go back to it a little that he gave this and then he gave this and then he gave this and he just kept instilling into the AP Apostles the ministry all right see then we're going to come on in toward our day if we can but we're getting to that point okay Revelations 3 and Malachi 4 father we thank you for tonight we thank you for your love and your grace Lord unto us and we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence that you'd speak to our hearts that we may see you and want to walk in your love forgive our sins and guide each and every one of us remember the sick among us remember what you said Lord we just remind you of what you said through the prophet that Lord that you wanted to heal us more than we wanted to be healed and we thank you for that then in your word you said that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we can anchor into your word we love you and we thank you have your way in each one in Jesus name amen amen all right Revelations 3 14 and I would ask you U let's see it'll be a couple of weeks but read Zachariah and read that in comparison with Malachi 4 all right you got Malachi 4 read it in comparison in Zechariah what is it 10 U is that the scripture Zechariah 10 where he talks about The Headstone coming crying Grace Grace unto it read those in relation and just read them over and over and say well now he told us to do this so let's see where it all fits together okay and unto the angel of the Church of the lady o and right these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness who is he the beginning of the creation of God all right Malachi 4 verse vers four remember ye the law of Moses remember what I said the entire Bible is backed up backing up what he's going to say as the last few verses will Express what is you know has been is and will be all in these verses to where we can understand remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horb for all Israel with the statutes and the Judgment remember now what we said to you the Prophet said what are we talking about the Ten Commandments the law the thing he said the law was God in letter form now the law was God in the letter form it wasn't a book of rules it was a revelation of a person and that person is almighty God okay now watch behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord okay now the promise but there's uh three things involved with this verse 5 see because right where it go behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord okay John the Baptist is coming right number five uh three then the prophet to the Gentiles is in included there number four then number five the two witnesses so now you see why I said that verse four he says I'm I'm putting the whole Old Testament everything is backing up what I'm going to say now I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do okay I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now watch and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now not just saying a point to where that you'll keep it in your mind to think as I said three things is covered in verse 5 John the Baptist brother brandham coming in the last days and then the two witnesses to Israel is included in that one verse all right now you say but now I say things sometimes to make you think you say yeah but we we we've only got a couple of things in verse six yeah but that's where you're going to miss it CU see John the Baptist according to Luke 1:7 John the Baptist turned the Old Testament people to the New Testament men message pointed out Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world all right introducing him turning the hearts of watch now to the fathers to the children now watch listen he didn't turn them from Deep things to baby things that's what that sounds like fathers to children that's what our mind to get in there and thinking you mean he went from father things to children things no it's not meaning that it's meaning the what who are the children who was the children that wound up accepting this part of Malachi 4 that we talk about that would be the John the Baptist part of the ministry right all right who was it the disciples y that's right and look at the height they were and I've got the quotes in here at home either way brother Brown said those disciples had these virtues but he said they didn't have the headstone cuz it hadn't come yet now that's right so hold your point now so then see when he turned them he didn't turn them from great deep understandings of the fathers he simply brought into being a new testament amen right A New Testament and he started that new testament on the day of Pentecost right with the apostles the the disciples that come to that place and they came to what we call the faith of the fathers amen all right now I want you to follow that thought see then you you'll see exactly what I'm talking about see then the next part is to turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers all right now as I said the other day on it it's been taught by people I've heard it even in this message to try to make it a beautiful point but it doesn't work too good because you take in Luke 117 there and he'll turn the hearts of the Old Testament to the children's message but in a minute it says he turns them back to this well I searched for it till I found it where the Prophet said he didn't turn them to the New Testament and then turn around and turn them back to the old that's paraphrasing it but it's right cuz that wouldn't work that part is saying simply that he turned them to the faith not his babies right the new New Testament never begun listen as babies the New Testament began first with the 120 in the upper room right amen now then we talk about dropping Downs to babes in Christ remember go we come outside until the 3000 now they start as babies but those disciples receed the Holy Ghost right here but then we should receive it down here the rest get it down into faith all right then you say yeah but said you only got two parts CU you got a turning from the Old Testament to the new and then look like we're going to turn back well listen we are not even involved here as the natural story cuz God will one day restore Israel under that fifth Elijah he will take them back from that Faith the New Testament point he'll take them not back to the law no he'll take them into Glory with the rest of us now they have their place they won't be bride we know that but see just in case you you miss that point of thinking about well Malachi he went this way not that way no just get it and then get us in the middle all right just get us in the middle okay get us as a faith of those Old Testament Saints moved over into the early church Paul took the Old Testament and brought his sermons to a new Testament people to show them the revelation of Jesus Christ true amen right all right standing on that one God see then we drifted away from that down to the ages so that's got to be restored back to the faith of the father you may not have got nothing out of that but one of these days it'll don't on you say well okay he said it now and I believe it all right because maybe I don't say it in your terminologies but I try to say it the best that I can all right now to start with what we're wanting to do tonight the prophet of God said that you and I are living way below our privileges yes he said living millions of miles below our privileges he said our God the whole Christian church today is living thousands of miles Bel their god-given privilege that's right watch because of just so half asleep right amen I didn't say that because of just so half asleep this small life he says take the promise believe it God said so that settles it forever amen take the promise all right but we're living below our privilege because we're not taking the promise right amen now I do believe one thing for certain it does say in Malachi behold I send you Elijah the prophet all right we ought to believe it for that but he said then to than that the day that we're living and so many people cut off that privilege from the people why we're living millions of miles below our god-given privilege right the Church of the Living God should never be divided we should be one and together all right living below our privileges okay now you know what living below your privileges of a definition from what he's saying there is being expressed to us we're not believing what God has said do you say I believe it I believe it I believe everything there's people right now that won't go to church at all won't Fellowship in the church whatsoever but yet they're saying they believe everything he said well the prophets wouldn't said and the Bible is when it said forsake not the assembly okay but you see we can say we believe everything I think would to be like the lady one time that um that she was somebody was talking about the uh White Horse Rider and the things and I remember this story was told way back that this lady said well you know somebody said well we One Believes it this way and one believes that say what do you believe said I believe it both ways well at least one thing she had a 50/50 change of being right the others that didn't believe it didn't even have a change my brother-in-law used to have a saying he said if you're out in the woods hunting and you see a deer he said if you fire the gun you got a 50/50 chance of getting a deer but said if you don't fire it's total zero so that's the way we ought to be maybe the lady was better off than most of us cuzz she said she B Le you both ways well we're we're not making light of nobody but it's just a truth all right because what our problem is living below our privilege is that we're not taking what the Bible says and when I say it like that I'm meaning the Bible and what brother Brandon says or reverse if you want to what brother Brown said and the Bible says either way you want to do it because I believe that's the way it came to us I don't believe he come to bring us another Bible or nothing he he come to speak to us about the Bible all right see then doing that see the way we're living below our privileges we're not believing what he's saying about us that's right now you say well them people out there they're living below their privilege now that wasn't what he said that's right he said we I just read it to you if you want me to read it again he said the Church of the Living God I think if we want to call ourselves that that we ought to realize that we're living below our privilege amen and what is living below your privilege not believing not believing it's for you right that's right what is the big thing that brother ROM says then if it if he says it it evidently the Bible says it what is the greatest problem with the Christian realm he said they're always looking back right to what was looking forward to what will be and missing what's going on now may I put another quote in there okay the prophet said that people are looking for a great move of God a worldwide sweeping Revival he said not realizing that's already taking place that's right on isusa Street that's right not to do away with the Revival no that was a worldwide sweeping Revival and there's not to be another one watch him now watch him go from there over here he says and the next thing to put that in line cuz he said that's they're failing to see Pentecost he said and the next thing they're looking at through the two Prophets through the two prophets there will be a great worldwide sweeping Revival I believe only in Israel because you could say everywhere else and bring them home if you want to but it's still for the Israelites right it ain't for the world cuz there ain't going to be nowhere white sweeping but brother R said they're seeing what is promised to Israel and think that is pertaining to them all right so now then what we need to do is find what's promised to us okay the point about a Revival what did the prophet say he said the bride hadn't had a Revival yet that's right he said it'll take them seven unknown Thunders to wake her up that's right okay so then we have that point to look forward to we're supposed to be having I've been having Revival ever since I've been in this message because when I see the word unfold and see God make it manifest then I take that as being the greatest Revival that could ever be in the worlden Y he's only one of you well that's all I thought it going to be if you want to leave Georgia and go to another state you'll be all right you know what I mean by that where he said this one out of a state so then you throw it me I throw it back to you see we're not in that realm of that right the prophet wouldn't saying just one out he would just explaining a small amount not you remember what he said to U is it right I believe it's right maton Bose was he the one that said that Chicago would be shook there's a quote in there I believe that's right isn't he and brother randam went around and told him he said it's already taking place see he was looking for something trying to find it brother R said it's already taken place what God's word had hit the town see we're looking for something instead of looking at what is all right now as I said what did we cover the last time the ministry the same Ministry of Jesus Christ in stages all right I've Illustrated that of what I'm saying you wonder why I was bringing it I Illustrated that by the five times of Elijah we know that two has already happened you know then John the Baptist was a third third brother Ram is the fourth and the Elijah of the so that's stages right now each one of those ministries of the ministry of Elijah was by five different men with different uh ways and thoughts and doings you can't take Elijah and bring him down here today he'd be in jail for night right right you take the Elijah of this day and put him back there he'd be dead for night all right you understand what I'm getting out cuz tonight we're going to talk about the same Ministry of Jesus Christ but in different stages where you'll understand the point I'm driving at different stages of the ministry of Jesus Christ it might be surprising so if I was you I'd pay a little attention instead of trying to figure out everything I would listen all right see living below our privileges because we don't believe what is being said about you and I right now forgive me for putting it that way this Bible has only been fulfilled up to the part where we're at it has not been fulfilled to Israel that's after we leave right that's right Right There Was An Old Testament there is a new testament that's different stages all right so are you following me now so we're going to look through the ministry of Jesus Christ and come down to the day it where we're living all right I said some things and I want to repeat some of it as we go along there our Wednesday night I even made a statement I heard this P ever when it was I preached I made a statement I said Jesus never told him disciples to lay hands on them for the Holy Ghost my point was it had not been given so it wouldn't work I don't think I don't know the scriptures to where they get in the book of Acts and lay hands on the people but just remember there's another thought goes for that you can't just go out and lay hands on anybody and them receive the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost ain't going to come on a person that's not repented now you can get by on the water baptism for a little bit but he's going to the water quick as he can right yes sir but you get the point now of listen and think about it and then you'll find out when I say something check it and put it in its category of where it's supposed to be so we went through like Mark 6 now they don't have these so I'm just run across it like Mark 6 the disciples went out and he told them to preach repentance he told them to cast out devils anoint with oil many of that were sick and healed them now that was the ministry of Jesus Christ given to the disciples right it wasn't given to everybody amen it was only given to the disciples all right he went on to tell them on another part of tell them from Matthew 10 we were talking about go ye and preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he told him to do that he said heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you receive freely give he gets over in Mark 16 just as after I think this is actually after his Ascension he tells them these sign shall follow them that believe in my name so they cast out devil speak with new tongues they take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover all right now I was trying to show it in stages that Jesus gave to the disciples things they could do they could heal the sick they can cast out devils and remember in the book of Acts that Judas had a part of of the ministry that's right right let me say something and then I'll say it we repeat it later you know that brother ROM said the third pool is for the bride for the church and two the total lost right you might remember that see a lot of people think well those people are not in the message you know we probably turn out to be like the man was that he said there's a fell over here that's casting out devils and things but said he's not one of us shall we go stop him that's right you remember that in the scripture I got it in here ate a while but shall we go stop him what did Jesus say he said leave him alone he says because he's for us he ain't against us in other words he's taken what he's been given to you and believing it and it's working right so now you'll see my whole thought tonight is believing it's for you if you don't believe it's for you it won't never do you no good but you see he gave him things that then he promised them things he promised them in Mark 16 I believe it is he told him go preach to to heal the sick speak in tongues and things and said there'll be great things happening Jesus spoke of a time to come right right amen he spoke of a time to come that they would do greater things than they had done right that's right Greater Works would be done and what is that the prophet said that was part of the ministry of Jesus Christ but follow what I'm saying now listen see while he was here they could only do certain things that's right but yet they could heal the sick cast that devil raise the dead wonderful things they could preach about the kingdom but they couldn't preach the kingdom why because it hadn't come yet yeah they could speak Maybe by listening to Jesus with what he would say about the Holy Spirit coming but it had not come in their lives so they didn't know anything about it that's right but listen to what I'm saying there's the ministry of Jesus Christ to heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead speak in you tongues what about the worldly Church system or the church system today amen are they not casting out Devils Healing The Sick raising the dead speaking in tongues am I right so let me say what Jesus said hey if they're not against against us and it's working let's don't worry about it right you see what I said that's right see the Lord Jesus said if that guy is doing something leave him alone cuz he ain't against us that's right cuz he's found some way now I got them laying here if you'd like that brother Brandon says you can take so much of the word and make it work sure that's right you say how does that work for them to heal the sick cast that devil even raise the dead it's because they believe that it's for them right see the disciples had to believe even Judas being part he had to believe that what they had Jesus had given them right right amen you know what he had sure you know what it's just listed as the one guy you know but still that's enough but the one guy he picks it up you know for some way and you know what he does he starts going out and he starts doing great Miracles he doesn't list him as a Simon the Sorcerer that's through tricks is causing this side or the other right in the book of Acts right no this guy was doing some works that's why I'm not against what's out there brother Ram wasn't against that that's where he went that's right he wasn't against the world system he was against the system of the church right he believed in their healings and signs and wonders he spoke of those men with great signs and wonders the war Roberts and all of those men he spoke of them right you know what it worked you know what it's still working now I'm going to hurt you know what they've got more than we have come on there's more signs and wonders out there than there are among the Bride of Jesus Christ well we're just a small amount oh you can sit there and excuse all you want to just get the point it's working if it's working in their lives God is the only one that can heal God is the only one can raise the dead God is the only one can do those things right are you with me that's right it doesn't work just because we believe it and we think it well we got gifts right whatever you got it's working right you go talk to people talking to one just recently about some things that I hope he's listening tonight because I was talking to him about signs and you know what he was telling me about signs and wonders he was telling me about things happening I did argue with him I didn't say oh you just don't know what's going on no I tried my best to explain one thing all that is because of Christ and what people can believe right but we're not interested in just Healing The Sick casting out Devils we're interested in the change of a body amen and this message came for that purpose that's right not to bring Divine Healing it was already there not to bring raising the dead it was already there well I just can't see how them denominations to raise a dead that's what I'm saying when you say I can't see it you know what that means it means your mind is shut off from the truth that's right right and say that again when you say I can't see it I just don't see anything going on that means your mind is cut off from the truth I'm trying to show you even the denominations even the worldly Church systems even the things out there the sick is being healed the Dead's being raised devils are being cast out things are happening right right right oh of course you don't believe that yeah but you see Church why I can stand and say like I did the other day and I got in trouble years ago about when I said it I stay in trouble I guess that's all right but when I ask a woman preacher to pray for somebody that was sick in this church I don't want no woman preach to pray me I don't care if it's a pope wrong he can touch God for me but what you're afraid of you your's afraid right you afraid that woman preacher will touch God and and and really what it is she touches the devil and the devil Moves In in a certain way and he does over and he takes care of all these demons and he gets all this stuff worked out and you're afraid that devil to get on you there ain't no devil can heal right I don't don't care how much you think right that's right ain't no devil can heal that's right but just remember I know people that are scared of certain things you know what according to the prophet and a Bible the things that job feared Came Upon him so if you're afraid to step out move over get out of the way don't stand around well I just don't see nothing going on I know that this great things happen happen just happen but I just don't see nothing going on what are you looking for see what are you looking for what is it that we as a church are looking [Music] for and where is our great signs and wonders that we would think would accompany it see there you look back you're looking back to the days of William brandham so do I when I read it and sat and listen to tapes and rejoice and hear those people screaming and holling they being healed I do too and you're looking to one of these days some magical something is going to transpire and you're going to walk off the earth well I've said this 45 50 years ago I'll just keep on saying it the Bible says if you can't keep up with the footman said what about when the horsemen get here right other words if you can't live and survive daily don't think there's some great thing to come that's going to take you through that's right the scripture said what if you can't abide in the what is it what about it in the in the swelling of Jordan I'm not worried about what's coming I have nothing to do with what's coming God will bring to P what he will bring to P sir I just don't want to miss it and I know one thing for certain may I say it over time how many times have ever said this we're supposed to get on the bus tonight you know we're going to get on the bus about 9:00 well we're all going down to airport down Atlanta heartsville airport why we're going to get on the bus well that's not a bus that's an airplan you said I've heard you say that 500 times what do you mean I mean one thing for certain now I quote brother random he said being in the wrong ranks at the Rapture listen is no excuse that's right that's phrase a little bit but it's very close I can find it for you being in the wrong rank what do it mean to be in the wrong ranks you military guys what is the wrong ranks right if you're a whole step out and walking you're in step right you just make a crooked line but if your high for step out that's where you get to pick up all the little butts and dig the holes and bury them and thing when the sergeant gets to with you right because you're in the wrong ranks I didn't make those statements your Prophet did but you see Church didn't we bul and stall over the things a prophet says and you claim that we believe all he says what about where he told the disciples that we were on last service John 14:12 said the works I do shall you do also and greater works now I like to read all the scripture I've been through 50 years long enough to listen at people they'll read you a high of the scripture and stop man down at Athens used to preach and boy he'd hammered to death woman shall be saved in childbearing and he just so one day I asked him out in front I said brother would you mind reading or quoting the rest of that scripture what do you mean I'll give you a scripture this is the scripture said she shall be saved in childbearing if she continue in the faith right you know what he didn't like that but you see we take the part on the Greater Works and then we go into all of the lengths of trying to figure out greater more whatever you know why not just read the rest of what Jesus said the works I do shall you do also in Greater Works that gives you the key in the rest of the scripture what dides he say he said because I go to my father that's right there's not going to be any Greater Works that was what I was trying my best to get you to see the other day the disciples while they were here heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead but they could not do the Greater Works right right right why cuz he hadn't been to the father right see we read the scriptures out of our thoughts and we just speak what we want to speak right but the prophet of God remember he we gave you the scriptures gave you all the things but he said it was given to the disciples to impart eternal life and now we how can that be done with we got all kind of explanations and what did your Prophet say he said it was given to imp part eternal life he said now the Catholics they say they impart eternal life or forgive sins because he use it interchangeably and what did he say he said now here's the scriptures if you'll follow that he said repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right so how do you impart eternal life said can a man do that come on roll it up let's start on number one we'll get a little bit we talk about this ministry in stages so if you understand what I'm getting at you had the stages or different phases points or whatever the words you want to use you had things with the disciples that worked right you have things today that work right but now I'm going to make it hard we'll read it then that Jesus could not even preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit why he was God allmighty he could forgive sins he could do all kind of things he was a son of man but he could not impart eternal life right he could not impart eternal life why because he had not went to the father and that's what he said Greater Works shall you do because I go to my father I'm going to make a way where you can impart eternal life but do we believe that but of course we've got all kind of ideas brother so and so he can impart Eternal I've seen him inart eternal life I seen him my praise God if it worked I'm going to make a statement only those who have the Holy Spirit is the only ones who can in any form impart eternal life amen right amen so all the other imparting is right right of course the Catholic you walk up to him and you pay a little in the pot especially over here you know and he comes up and he he just does away all of your sins and he turns you back and he sends you away and and he sprinkles sh on you whatever he does and he sends you back and and you go back and and you're perfectly totally set free from your sins even until women their virginity is restored and they can go and marry some sitting here you want to let them explain it I don't think that works do you I think you got to understand how to do the Greater Works amen that's right and the first thing to understand is it cannot be done unless you are born again unless you have the same spirit that Jesus Christ had in you right that's right now why can't we believe that the Jes that the ministry of Jesus is here I'm going to keep going back to it you're going to get mad at me after a while because I'm going to keep laying it back to it them denominations them people out there they're casting out Devils they're Healing The Sick they're raising the dead and they claim to impart eternal life you mean they can do what we can't do all right if you're saying that then I'm asking a question why why then I'll give you the answer cuz they believe it's for them and it works and we don't believe it in the way we need to believe it we believe what we want to believe yeah well I tell you what like I said you know we start off in the people the message they're real good I just don't see nothing going on I don't I just don't see nobody that could impart eternal life well the disciples was told that right did the disciples impart eternal life one man with one message imparted eternal life to 3,000 Souls y right right amen but yet we don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ I just don't see the ministry of Jesus Christ well because you got it figured out a certain way that got to be the ministry or you won't accept it I'm laying it down to the point that I'm telling you up to your face in front and on the tapes and everywh you can't deny it so you need to listen then instead of figuring it all out listen to what's being said because you can't argue with what I just said Willers don't believe that's what I mean you don't believe it but there's no way to argue you can't argue that them denominations out there are not casting out Devils Healing The Sick raising the Dead all kind of signs and wonders you can't deny that if you do you're stupid you ain't even got enough sense to come in out of the rain and if you think the disciples didn't have the ministry of Jesus Christ you really are stupid sorry for the language but I'm tired of playing cuz listen if this thing don't something don't happen you going to find you another pastor and it ain't going to be long I've done made up my mind it's got to work or it ain't if it's not working it's my fault no sir no I can take care of that you say you just trying to scare don't think this brother ever going to try to scare you I'm trying to save you ain't trying to scare you amen trying to tell you the truth but you won't listen you can't argue they're doing the signs and wonders you can't argue that Jesus gave him the ministry who gave it to them that's right ain't no devil can give it no no right we see we don't think about well the ministry of Jesus Christ but I just want to see this I want to see this what about it look what he says on that day on Calvary and and notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers now you're not going to impart eternal life to unbelievers right okay solves the problem all right look the Holy Ghost was coming and giv into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant so where did it come back there so part of Jesus's Ministry is now stepped up into another stage if you're listening look what it done it took St degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick to impart eternal life how by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers now how can you give the Holy Ghost to anybody we're going to get down into the scriptures because that's what I know your minds cuz I made the statement there was no giving of the disciples to lay hands on to receive the Holy Ghost see you took that and split it it's in the Bible if you lay hands on for receiving the Holy Ghost that's right it's in the book of Acts okay but can you give it to anybody you want to well it says lay hand WR I'll remind you that the man Simeon orever how you pronounce his name he wanted the gift right offered to pay money for the gift of being able to lay hands on who he laid hands on and for them to receive the Holy Ghost and what did they tell them you don't know what you are you have no part with this why cuz he thought it would be something he'd be able to do I'm going to make another statement so listen just laying on your hands is not going to give the Holy Ghost you got to have the person in line you know what I mean you got to get him in line with the rest of the scripture because that's what we're going to read in here you get him in line with the rest of the scripture that he repents and follows the Lord and baptism then you can lay hands on him because remember they were laying hands on him down there and praying for them in the book of Acts and they couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on they sent for Peter or one other of them they came down laid hands on the Holy Ghost came was it the hands see you can't just lay hands on people and him receive the Holy Ghost what you do pray for people to rece see the Holy Ghost and you lay hands on them while you praying for him but remember car them through the stages that's right look by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers you can't give it to anybody else and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say to the sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while see rais the dead right but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever well I just don't believe we can give eternal life then you're not believing according to the scripture right and see one of these days you'll realize what I've been preaching for 50 years eternal life to them that will believe it eternal life well brother D I just can't believe you cuz you got so many problems well then why don't you go find somebody else that don't have some and that'll take care of it and I'll give you some money to go right never had no problems poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greater thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people the greatest thing Could Happen what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God can so it's not for just everybody it's only a Son of God that's right now may I say this what are you going to do you're a pastor and the man comes up and he says brother Dale I want you to pray for me to receive eternal life but yet I know he's living like the devil that's right now brother brandham said in other words if you know there's a problem and you pray it off he said you'll get yourself in trouble with God right so it's not just anybody and hophazardly lay hands on and H no no but the reason it ain't working is because the people are not listening what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God Can Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now here's where the Catholic church and many of the others made their big mistake they go out and say I forgive your sins that wasn't it now can I go back up in here and pick up that he's talking about imparting eternal life he's talking about forgiving sins that's the same thing are you with me he's talking about in paron what is eternal life in pardoning eternal life now ain't talking about sins forgiven don't be silly and say oh that's your sin's forgiven the greatest sin to be forgiven is the sin of unbelief to where that God can give you eternal life look they go out and say I forgive your sins that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible Well we go over here and we pick this up lay hands on the sick and they go here and say lay hands on and they get the Holy Ghost now you got a problem you got scripture but you're misusing it what you're saying is right but to misuse it we're going to follow the ministry of Jesus Christ or we're going to forget it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost they said what can we do to be saved what can we do to have eternal life imparted unto us right right amen how can we get this that you all got like that he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in in the name of Jesus Christ what for the remission of your sins there's the Greater Works right now we done been through the point that water baptism does not forgive your sins that's right but the scripture says it also says he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved so now we got to get it all together or forget it what a baptism don't won't save you it's an answer of a good conscience all right they received it at K's house before they were baptized right but tell me they didn't go get baptized now I'm going to tell you you you don't even understand the story but are you listening I know I ain't getting down to where I want to but that's all right what does he say to do he's talking about going there and preaching the gospel and the gospel is what to set us free the prescription is laid down repent everyone and be baptized name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive eternal life because the ones that were saying that were already doing now I I'm like this uh say me and brother collie you know we both find out the truth well that's all right he baptized me and I baptized him I think that's okay right I think that's okay but if I say brother collie would you baptize me and he said yeah I'll baptize and I say when I want to baptize I think you he said I ain't going to do it I'm going to go get me somebody else to baptize me because he didn't do it right even though he done it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he done it in a deceiving manner that he was is not going to do what I done you're getting the point I don't want somebody baptizing me they already been baptized unless is a a this an account happens that where the two would wind up and you know right do you understand we could go into a lot of things but that's okay listen what does your Prophet say go ahead to number three let's get these points of EX what Jesus done and get that out of the way John 3 John 7 3839 out of the belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified all right now go to number four which is a revelation of Jesus Christ preach 1960 paragraph 149 he that believeth on me St John 14:7 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do shall he also do the same works and greater than this because Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you know for certain if Christ couldn't preach it the disciples couldn't right right why because Christ could not preach the baptism of the G would be greater he could not bring it to them are you reading it he could not bring it to them what about God Almighty could not bring the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the disciples right that had followed him for three years a half or something right why Christ could not preach the baptism in the ghost would' be greater he could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given but when Jesus came and sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost returned then they could impart eternal life to the people that's the greater we know he can't do anything greater we we understand that it means more right do you need those where the Prophet said it means more but then read these where he says it's greater to impart eternal life you realize he couldn't preach eternal life that's why he would say the kingdom is at hand right because it couldn't be done all right look at the next Jehovah Gyra 196 61 greater then you will ask talk about the greater and I'll tell you what it is so you come do the works he done first now what does he mean you come and do the works he done first then we'll talk about the greater what was the works that Jesus done he walked the life he followed the word to the letter even was baptized right he followed the word to the letter amen he lived it to the letter you see what your Prophet is saying did you say the Greater Works now come on I can go through the whole message right did you say the Greater Works is preaching the gospel look how close they are the denomination said the Greater Works is preaching the gospel look how close it it Jesus couldn't preach until he was crucified right he couldn't preach the gospel he couldn't preach the eternal life until the life had been given amen you see what he's saying people say we preach the gospel that's the Greater Works he said do the lesser works and then we'll talk about the greater live a chrisan chrisan Life cast out Devils heal their sick raise the dead but live a Christian Life and then we'll talk about the Greater Works that's right of imparting eternal life Jesus could not preach the baptism with the Holy Ghost it hadn't come yet that's the Greater Works we're doing but to do the same Works he did he said you would don't you see what the church has been given not just a Healing The Sick casting out Devils even raising the Dead the World Church can do that that's right that's right but they cannot impart eternal life now you're going to say Brother D you don't think nobody be saved out there I didn't say that because brother rown says it can he said a dog sitting over a egg will hatch the egg that's right okay what are we trying to do look at the next one getting in the spirit I read these to you the other week but I want to read them again just make sure if you think of theology is the sign of Messiah that's to the people they say they're preaching look if you think a theology is a sign of Messiah and that's a and that's a greater sign than this Jesus said the works that I do so you do also right you say preaching the gospel is a greater work all right then you come here and do the lesser works you see he could stand and say things you and I can't say that's right but I have been playing on one thing I have preached the gospel of Salvation and somebody challenges me from the platform I've been there and walked that challeng me from the pull pit I'm going and if I don't go you go away from me come on I didn't say I challenge them come on we get the Bible correct we'll be right Elijah didn't challenge them read your Bible yet you think Elijah challenged him and told him to do this that the other go back and read R around him he said they challenged Elijah I ain't talking about being stupid I'm talking about being the truth if somebody challenges you and you know you're standing on the truth why are you afraid that's right that's right sir I'm right here every service on the internet live and speaking to you what I believe amen you think I'm going to back up because of some silly situation no I'm going to stand for the truth that's right man challenged me well I'll put it right he challenged somebody else and then somebody else said he never did hear the man challenge him I got up and walked up there and I said I accept your challenge you got three months I'll meet you anywhere in the United States for 3 months and you preach what you believe but I said I want one service to preach the truth thank you Lord the man never said no more you see I don't care who it is why can't we stand for what we believe well that's a brother I didn't challenge he challenge Cheng me I didn't get a ver I challenge all of you no uhuh no I ain't going to do it but if you got something in your heart why are you afraid of it right okay come here and do the lesser here's a platform he said help yourself come here and go down through this prayer line and let the Holy Spirit move in and out of the audience there over you let me see you do them works and then go preach the gospel then you do do a Greater Works Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it had not yet not yet come that's a Greater Works it certainly is the church is to preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit Jesus said it was coming but the church has it and saying we got it and it's for you and see that was a greater that is true when are we going to stand up for what we believe what's the matter maybe we don't believe what we got is enough all right go to the next one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the things that I do shall you also More Than This shall you do for I go to my father is that right the word Dar in the King James mean is greater but a righty translation is more because you couldn't do greater he he raised the dead stopped the nature and done everything not greater in quality but greater in quantity why because now there's more Jesus is right there's more Christ right More Than This shall you do for I go to my father amen and I'm late said did the disciples do it now he's answering it right did the disciples do what Jesus said watch him did the disciples do it the same Ministry that Jesus Christ had the apostles carried on just exactly like they always did the apostles going down through and all in their rest and everything he said the disciples done it now then are we going to admit that the disciples done the Greater Works he said they did said it was the ministry of Jesus Christ see we can we can agree with that I'll take another minute or two and quit we can agree with their disciples we can look back right and we can say Peter and John said Silver and Gold Have I None but in the name of Jesus Christ I believe that they' done the Greater Works they preach the gospel they healed the sick they cast out Devils they raised the Dead they've done the great things but are we like the Church of Christ now I'm throwing off on them but the point they're the one that makes the statement they said only the 12 had the gifts of the Holy Ghost that's their Doctrine so we're not supposed to have nothing we just sit L waiting on the bus what did the brother R say he said Paul would be one more that you'd have to deal with and said look at the life of Paul and the Ministries and said look at him said the Holy Ghost was being ordained in the church and gifts and things 30 40 years after the Lord Jesus was crucified but are we of that caliber we don't see it now how many times have you heard me say this do you realize when you say you don't see it right you have shut your mind off from the truth you say I don't see it among the bride today you're going to say you don't see it out there in them other churches when they sick healed and revivals going on around the world and all kind of things happening look what you're doing when you say you don't don't see it you're saying it's not here at least you could say as far as I believe I don't see it and give you a little category of looseness right okay but we would all at least agree that the apostles at the ministry of Jesus Christ could we make that a statement I'll read a couple of more and then we'll quit and then pick it back up later would we at least agree that the apostles had the ministry of Jesus Christ amen they even had it before his crucifixion but they had it Greater after his crucifixion that's that's right amen okay you agree there but let's see if you agree with this what was it number same Ministry Jesus Christ had the apostles carried on we picked that one up we've done picked up the part of the Philadelphia and let's see I'm trying to find one8 go to number eight the big long reading you've got it there for me already the big long reading and you can go through it roll it on up because he's talking about and bringing it down to the disciples and their Ministry stop right there he said go into the way of the g go not into the way of the Gentiles into any city of the Samaritan enter you not now what Jesus told them right watch him but rather go to the Lost House of Israel as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is hand heal the sick cleanse lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give this ministry that he gave them who he talking about the disciples this ministry that he gave them was exactly the sharing of his own Ministry with them for it says that in Matthew 9 35 and 38 so Jesus said went into the second o preaching you believe that this ministry they had go to number nine try to get in a hurry confirmation of the commission all right roll it on up go to paragraph next paragraph save time reading now that same Holy Spirit we find it now he's just giving you the Holy Spirit iner disciples okay will you take my word without having to roll it back down and reread it that he's talking about the ministry to to the disciples and he says in that same holy spirit that we find it right amongst the Pentecostal people cuz see everybody wants to jump now here's that back and here's coming up forward in a point because everybody looked back at the apostles and then they look at brother bradam right and they say brother Bram had all these Ministry amen but is he the only one to have it come on don't worry about it we're going on over to The Headstone don't you worry about it a't none of us going to be able to bring anything that's why I ask you to read Zechariah because it's zable that will bring forth The Headstone amen not lay a Cornerstone read your Bible we'll get to there after all these brothers get through preaching so I'll give you a little time to think it over look now that same Holy Spirit we find it right amongst the Pentecostal people today the evening light right down amongst the Pentecostal people what preaching the same gospel giving Vindication of the same gospel the same signs that followed there is the same signs that follow now and if that Pillar of Fire or light that we have with us did not produce The Same Spirit and the same evidence that it did when it was in Jesus Christ then it would be the wrong Pillar of Fire the wrong Spirit be the wrong thing but if it does produce and do just exactly what Jesus done then he said to he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also you ever heard brother random talk like this about uh he prayed for a man for his nose to be restored took a little time FF bosford prayed and it was immediately restored see we think brother random he jumped from the disciples and into brother random and and that's it he said it's among the Pentecostals the ministry of Jesus Christ today is among the Pentecostals yeah but they don't preach the word we ain't talking about that we ain't got to that part yet we're talking about the signs and the wonders because if he's Hebrews 13:8 then whatever he done back there he's got to keep on doing that's right that's right right okay let's go to the next one go to number 10 is talking for the patmas vision roll it on up you talking about the church angel of each Church age that's going to be a beautiful this week when we go back Y in history and pick up them angels and see the very Ministry they had they had the same Ministry exactly the same all day down through the age in that little church the ministry of Jesus Christ never left right come on folks let's be serious all right where we at number nine number 10 we read that one let's go to number 11 the theasian church age the same men that I haven't got here and know by Revelation that they was the angels to the church they had the same Ministry that these did at the beginning and that Ministry cannot change it must stay Pentecost all the way through right the ministry of Jesus Christ never left right amen look at the next one the unconditional Covenant the sun was going down and watch and the Holy Ghost is on the church tonight leading the church just like that he was when he was leading Christ now do you believe that tonight do you believe that amen oh well like see it was in around okay see anybody when not9 s can do that that's right devil admit that look the same way the same Ministry Christ had is in his church tonight same signs same wonders Same Spirit same kind of works that Jesus did here on Earth the church has to do the same thing if it's not it's not the seat of Abraham it's not the Church of Jesus Christ okay what we got go with the next one roll it up CU you get in and read in between to see if I'm wrong I give you the whole quote it's on the internet don't worry about it it'll be light evening time the holy spirit's here with the same Ministry that was delivered to the Lord he stopped what by the Lord Jesus Christ to his apostles and she's coming through a Darkness but the clouds are clearing back the same Holy Spirit has come and revealing the same thing God bless you think about it I'm going to just quit right there because I just want to make a few statements do we believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is here tonight Amen Brother Gary Atkins asked me that years ago he said brother Dale do you think we have the faith of the fathers I said not everybody know but for me to say that somebody doesn't have it I believe I would be derogatory to the point you know I would be wrong because I believe some of the Bride of Jesus Christ has the Ministry exactly like the apostles had right then he asked me he said Do you believe we have the headstone exactly I said if you had to put that exactly on there we could talk better but now you're saying exactly and I said my answer is the holy spirit is The Headstone and it's here and it has been here all alone right and it's coming down to cap off the church and I believe some ministers at least are catching on to be able to preach and I said some Ley are catching on to be able to believe it and I said then the Lord Jesus Christ is here around the world not to be in one man it's not to come in one man anymore it was in brother Bram it was in the Lord Jesus but he made way in the Lord Jesus to come to all mankind the only thing you have with brother Bram is a man standing showing the ministry is restored right right because he couldn't be it he said that's where you messing up he said the seventh angel is not the son of man see he's a son of man introducing the son of man man amen now folks when are we going to finally believe in 1969 in Athens Georgia the first sermon I preached in this message I taught Sunday school and all kind of thing but the first message I preached was the Bride of Jesus Christ 1969 would be the son of man in the last days the word made flesh I proved it by the prophet if You' like them they're written in the front of my Bible and that was just a quotes that I had in 69 brother brownon said the bride would be the fullest or the godhead bodily he said the godhead is not complete without you we have a lot of road to go but we've covered a lot of Road yes sir Brother D do you believe the ministry of Jesus Christ driv it here I do at least let me believe it listen at least let me believe it I could believe that the disciples had it before they were born again at least let me believe that you don't have to agree but you know they had it and you know they had the ministry of Jesus Christ after the Holy Ghost came and could do the Greater Works by imparting eternal life through the preaching of the Gospel that's why there ain't never been a person in the Bible that was ever born again that did not first hear the word proclaimed unto them because it's impossible to be born again without the word coming because the new birth is the birth of the word do you believe that the ministry of Jesus Christ is here that the faith of the fathers is here what is the faith of the fathers I thought we believ it was the revelation of the fathers I didn't know it was a super duper out of this or out of the other that's what we're looking at faith faith is a revelation right how many gods do you believe in tonight one how many did disciples believe in right that's right do you believe hell is eternal no the disciples didn't believe it's Eternal that's right how long could we stand and talk about it where are we at in the stages of the ministry of Jesus Christ because whatever we believe we are that's where God will hold us accountable the ministry of Jesus Christ in different stages just like the ministry of Elijah was in five different stages right AR we'll be when it's finished right what do you think about it well I just don't see you want to say it wake up church I'm going to make this one more statement that I've made many times brother randam said that there was more in one service in his ministry then in the end entire I believe he said book of Acts I know he said it that way but he may have said in the whole Bible I know he said in the the book of Acts listed I've asked you to go home read the book of Acts and write down every miracle that happened and write down that that was over a period of some to going to 53 for Paul to start the first church age you at least got into the neighborhood of 20 years and in 20 years they had these how many miracles did they have come on folks now don't don't play with me and I won't with you I know the Bible and what it says he said the things that was written in the world wouldn't be able to contain I know that so don't go wrong I'm saying what's written down we've seen more in this little church over 20 years of the accounts of happening than what is written in the amount of happening as the book book of Acts but yet we don't believe anything's going on you know why it's not going on because you don't believe it and see the reason you don't believe it you say if it happened to me I'd believe it we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick healed of the word amen we've seen rain come we've seen Rain Go we've seen miracles happen with this little group of people right y amen but we can go right over there in that church and find Miracles happening also I don't deny that I preach that because that's why your Prophet said it he said the third pool and I thought he said the third pool was the opening of the word I thought that's what he said it was and what did he say he said the third pool is for the bride and the church you mean it's for them out there if they'll accept it it's sure it's happening because it's here why is it happening out there because it's in the bride around the world Amen me virals that never went out things that are happening we were having a meeting here one night and we didn't know a lot of people was coming and you remember this they came to me and they said we ain't going to have enough food I should set it before the people there'll be enough there was plenty enough what else you want to talk about how many miracles and signs and wonders can we talk about and listen folks I want to see more and more and I believe we will but I thought your prophet said that when the squeeze comes then the third pull will come into operation that's right right paraphrase but it's Clos right what about it do you believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is here now listen not saying the ministry is here in brother Dale cuz that will not do you no good other than help for you if you really believe it I'm talking about inside of you it's got to be in you it can't be in one man that's done been off the scene and he's in the ground waiting on you and I that's right yes sir amen thank you Jesus but us just talking about it ain't going to do no good the devil ain't wouldn't mad at Martin Luther when he preached to just shall live by faith but when the people begin to believe it he got upset right that's right the world is happy to talk about the things brother randam said of how the world is going and the White House and the people and the thing but they don't want to hear his message right what about it the same Ministry of Jesus but in different stat ages it's going to be in the bride of Christ around the world and is now taking place if she'll just believe it amen come on musicians listen Church life is getting short but you and I have got to believe the word somebody has well not us right I had a lot in my notes s we'll get to it back later you know that brother brandham says if you will not confess what God says he cannot do it right on he can't save you if you won't confess it that's right he can't heal you if you won't confess it well when I get healed I'll believe it I'll confess it then no you won't cuz you'll never get it let's stand think on these things things see Church we're in the last days there's no need of playing around it's either Believe it or forget it if we believe it let's put our life on it when are we going to believe [Music] it at least be as brother random had to say the last thing I'll say he said Lord if I can't produce it he said don't let me stand in the way somebody that can you know what that means that means Brother Ray comes up and tells me brother Dale I believe so and so and so I said yeah but I don't believe it I'm standing in the way why wouldn't I say I believe it if it's according to the word I know of a guy one time that said God told him he was going to get a albino groundhog I said praise God we're going to see an albow no groundhog well you doubting it no I just saying if Lord told him that that's what we're going to say sure what about it what we got brother that's time 138 in the in the spiral B think about this song think on these things 13 oh Lord my God when I aw some Wonder All World hands see the [Music] star we say when I see it happen I'll believe it you'll never see it a secret rapture I thought that's what your Prophet said how great thou who was it how the greatah was either was four or eight Miracles one of the two is either four or eight that Elijah had you know that Elisha just had twice that how great thou so if Elijah had eight Elisha only had 16 but yet he was God's [Music] man and the world would be judged by that the bird singet I said the other day John the Baptist went into the
