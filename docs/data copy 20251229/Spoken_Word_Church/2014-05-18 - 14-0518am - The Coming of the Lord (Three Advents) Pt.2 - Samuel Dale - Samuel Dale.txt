power and love as we sing foreign good to see you about in the house the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from first Thessalonians and first John and we'll try to continue our thoughts along no matter what we've been speaking on but we want to that we really enjoyed Services last night and brought Jordan brother Douglas ministering them to us and he's sitting down to listen today so you know you pray for me because he's listening he wants said he wanted to come down sometime sit down and listen I said okay we'll do that but we thank everybody for all of the doings the food that you fixed all of the working the the slaving that you've done to make everything possible for us to be able to Fellowship together and as far as we know you can we can all eat together today because we have a lot of food left over we didn't have as many people as was anticipated but we always have a whole lot left over so it's always nice to to be able to depend on that and and we pray that everybody will eat together and fellowship together with uh you know around a natural meal you know but we really do think everybody for all of you working and all of your doings we had a wonderful time last night in the fellowship member sister Margie brother Homer was not able to be with us yesterday god sister Margie has been real sick so remember her in your prayers and hold her up before the Lord um there's many missing this morning Wade in June is in Miami and I talked to him a while ago and he said to remember his voice because he was already getting kind of croaky like and he's got two services to do today so you know he's finding out what it is to put five services or something in a row it gets rough on the old voice sometimes but remember him in the Lord willing they're flying back in tomorrow and I think Brother Joseph is flying back in in the next day or two from California and brother Joe and and sister Gwen and all the rest of the family and Amy and and Jeffrey and them are coming back in so remember them for coming back from the wedding just keep them in your prayers let the Lord bless each and every one all right any other announcements of already yeah remember Sister Doherty we didn't find out today but yesterday sister Johnny was telling us that Sister Mary dardy or some of you may not know she had a stroke and she was able to she's able to move her hands you know left hand and leg and things but didn't have any feeling there so they're putting her through and going to put her through therapy and things so just remember in your prayers you know that the Lord would reach down and touch her on anything else I know I always forget Tim's associate hit his wife just had a baby and she's got they found in the baby has an infection that an antibiotics don't work they're going to have to operate on the on the intestines of the small jobs I sure would remember that little baby there anyone else anything else father we thank you Lord for this day for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the opportunity to be able to come together the fellowship with those of like Precious faith and we ask you to just have your way with each one of us forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us from all unrighteousness and let us be what you want us to be remember the sick among us and just reach down and touch us you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you remember each one of these remember the ones traveling back remember Wade and his voice our Lord ministering and with those traveling back home Lord be with each one and we pray for this little baby Lord that you'd reach down and touch it that father that it would not have to have an operation for the infections and the things because we know Satan is hindering on every hand but we believe your word We Believe by your stripes the little one is healed so we thank you for it we love you and we thank you we just pray that you'd have your way this day in each one of our hearts and lives in Jesus name amen first Thessalonians 4. probably two odd scriptures for you to think about reading together because one is like speaking of the rapture called away the other speaking of his coming so that sounds like two odd things to be preaching or reading to scriptures to be able to talk on these things but think about what it says now first Thessalonians 4 15. for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which were alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now seems like a total going away doesn't it all right and first John you read the whole part of the seven the second chapter but to read the 28th verse now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming that's something you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now to not spend much time in the background but to make sure that you follow what we're doing and all we're talking about the coming of the Lord all right and uh in doing that then it's odd to read scriptures that uh talk about rapture and then you talk about the coming of the Lord but I believe if we'll get it in the right understanding that we'll be able to comprehend uh what is being done and all because I've told you before probably 20 years ago maybe uh I said I I'm I'm not trying to go to heaven I'm not wanting you to go to heaven because the prophet the way he covered it one day he says that and he gave this statement he said when the silence in heaven now we know it goes into the seals goes into all things but I mean I'm quoting what he said he said the reason is silence in heaven he said there won't be anybody up there that's an odd statement isn't it you know why would we want to go up there if there's nobody up there and I know our human minds and our our thinking you know is rapture oh we're smart now we've done found out that there's no such thing as the word rapture in the Bible it's caught up well that's good that's a good understanding but now uh think about the things that we've covered and remember that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voices for an archangel trumpet and brother Brown says he does all three Jesus does all three in the Rapture message in his descending well I know I'm carnal and I'm sorry uh brother Aaron would you come up to us a little our fan on WE we've Cut You Down to 71. everybody thinks it's so hot in here today it still ain't 71 yet all right because it was yeah it'd be turning on but maybe we need a fan to get a stirring a little bit of doing but we looking we look as human beings because what we've been taught the Lord will descend from heaven of the shower Oh Glory how you're great you know the trumpet you know on voice on Archangel big Angel steps down out of the sky and raises the dead and then we hear this you know a trumpet well we've got away from that huh I mean we've upgraded we've got away from the Hat we don't believe that carnality anymore what do you believe we really don't know what we believe you know but you see we found that the Shout was the message all right so that means that part of the rapture has already taken place because the shouts already come the message we believe brother Wright's message was the chapter what are you looking for some hollering screaming see even in the second part our phase is we'll get into it in a little bit see when you're talking about the coming of the Lord you're talking about a vast amount of information or happenings you've got we'll cover in a minute we've been over it that uh bride is what you're dealing with and he come one time to redeem second time he comes to catch his bride away the third time he comes with his bride now that's in his coming then you got to coming to Israel then you got to coming to the world then you got to coming to the millennium will cause consummate or whatever what you want to call a big word end up with the coming of the Lord so there's many many things to be covered about his coming we don't know what you mean brother you're just so this well all right but I made this statement many times the prophet said being in the wrong ranks it's a rapture would be no excuse do you need that quote being in the wrong Reigns at the Rapture be no excuse well you know what's wrong ranks you military Brothers understand it it's not a whole step out because your whole step out you're in Step you're just one step behind but you're still up two three four right to be out of step is to be a high for step when they're going down you're going up you know well that's what would show up in a great big parade we'll see in the wrong ranks now I've never preached that you've got to be in Lulu so don't get the garbage can in your mind to me being in the wrong ranks is like I've always said you you're supposed to take a train ride today and and you know you you go down to the bus depot to get you a ticket to ride the train now that might have been 30 years ago 40 years ago that that was taking place because the Bus Depot Gainesville used to be at the train station all right but it's no longer there it's up in town my point is and you know what I'm talking about the prophet said the rapture paragraph 130 153 you know somewhere in the Rapture used to be on page 15. of the book he said the Rapture is a revelation amen then he goes on and he says and the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture well that's what we're doing brother Dale we think we've been doing 45 years we've been sat down waiting are you at the bus depot or the train station for the airport well it wasn't matter if the Lord's coming if he's coming to the bus depot you're gonna miss it all right if we need the statue of a perfect man to be able to make a Rapture or changed in we need somebody to teach us how to get it and brother Randall said this is a requirement to have these things but yet we think we're in the message you see the Rapture has already started because it's a process first you must have the new birth then once you get to New Birth you're just ready to start then you hear this message and that's the shout all right and it's odd the prophet would say paragraph 130 the rapture that Jesus does all three of these things in his descending yet we spent our whole thing of a going up well you don't believe in the going up yeah I believe in a but I believe there's an order to it I believe what the Bible says and what the prophet of God said that the Lord himself shall descend so why are we talking about going away when we really need to be thinking about him coming here because if he does all three in his descending then why are we concerned about going away I want to be where he's at don't you is that hard to understand yeah well then if the shout has already went forth why are we looking for a shout we've already heard the message so the Rapture is in a process it's already taking place but what if you hadn't heard the message I don't care what you think you're not in the rapture I know I'm hard all of that but I'm fighting my own nature of ways because I know I've tried to make you believe this message and I'm trying my best to get away from trying to make you believe it he said well you hadn't made me believe it well that's all right what I mean by that is that I've tried to hold you and pour it into you and pound on you and maybe that's the way it's supposed to be you know I'm glad I've done it but it's still up to you to accept this message I can't make you believe it but it gets so on you until you see how the the people are of the message and realizing 50 years almost of studying and seeing that what they're trying to do with this message today what if it is that the Lord's coming this way and we we're trying to go that away when we're born again I thought the Bible said we were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places well I thought that was already in a process but we're looking for something to happen when one of this already happened right that's all I've tried to tell you and and all of the carnality is my ways of trying to explain it what if you've never heard this message are you expecting a Rapture without this message I mean is everybody going is the whole world going in a Rapture one day I thought the Rapture was only far the Royal Seed of Abraham the Bride of Jesus Christ oh and yet everybody knows all about it but what are they looking for discussing it recently with somebody and they said well I admit I was looking out there wanting to go out there and I've come to find out is taking place right here all right the shout the voice of the Archangel what is that the Lord Jesus Christ right you said well brother Dale I thought the bride going to call the Dead I believe she will but it'll be the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride not going to be you and me I've tried to explain that how many years 40 Years everybody thinks about adoption boy I'll be glad one these days God adopts me and I'll just be able to speak that word i i i i i yeah I don't believe it that way I don't believe adoption is the father going off the scene and the son coming on the scene you're going back to your Trinity in concept adoption is the father coming on the scene in the Sun as he did back there is going to be Jesus Christ that raises the Dead well is he going to be up there and raise the dead or is he going to be down here and raise the death and the trumpet the prophet where's there catching away in the Gathering we've got to be together but the prophet said we'll only be together in the resurrection right all right so Jesus does three things in his descending so then evidently he's already descended and I'm not those that bleed back to our and preached it boy and blessed God he came in 63. I believe he's been here all the time we just haven't been recognizing it I don't believe he ever left but that's where people are preaching on 63 63. well that's wonderful to the prophet but what good did that do you and I you know unless it's revealed to you and I then what good is anything all right so if the Rapture is a revelation amen all right and the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture evidently his references meaning that you know I mean I'm carnal I'm not trying to interpret him I'm trying to say what he says he said Brad would be waiting so if the bride is to be waiting for the Revelation Rapture evidently at that time she didn't have it I mean you know am I right come on or he would have said the bride's already got it no he said she'd be waiting for the revelation well you know what our problem is is they're saying the whole point is us getting into the position that we can hear and there's many voices in the land right but how here we without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sinned all right but now do you understand what I'm saying on the code I've tried to make it a little point because a lot of people are here that wasn't here and I'm not trying to lose that part to this go on so we believe that the Rapture is a process that's taking place here and then after that process of the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel trumpet after that takes place the dead in Christ shall rise right because that's the resurrection right and then we shall be changed and go to meet the Lord in the air so there's a lot of things that transpire before we go up any at all and if we're missing that not knowing what's going on how can we be prepared if a trumpet give an uncertain sound how can be prepared to battle or whatever you need right but see it's not it's not heard but we have our own concept about it what do you think God's going to change his ways to fit my concept or yours I don't think so I think we better be finding out how to fit into his category all right so then if the if the Rapture is actually him coming here and getting everything ready for it to take us there why are we looking up there for it why not get into the message that has been brought us our only hopes all right then we went on into the coming of the Lord that's what it said we read there and John you know about the the coming what are we talking about in the coming of the Lord I said while ago we have many Avenues many thoughts many things can be said do you realize how long it would take to preach the coming of the Lord it has took 6 000 years to bring it it took four to bring his coming all right now in his coming then what is it okay look at number one on the notes and think about it because the Lord has three advents to the coming of the Lord now I want to show you how the human mind works and show you how that we do and that we lose total concept of what's going on I want you to read the title of that message up there and you know sometimes I think about not even reading the title because your mind gets hooked on something look at the title of this message in 1954 718. the great coming revival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit now if I gave that first before reading the quote I'm going to be halfway through the quote before your human brain starts running wild I want to get that message boy the great the great coming I've never heard that sermon and I done read you the quote and then you go home I didn't hear that okay we read the title okay the great coming Revival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit now I wake up now let's read the quote you understand see I realize what's going on in the human mind because I have one too it don't work too good I got one but see you're sitting there thinking about what you're going to eat for lunch you're thinking about what you're going to do this afternoon and I'm reading what the prophet of God said I didn't hear him I remember one time I told a brother that brother Brown and said a certain thing he said he didn't say that I just listened to that tape the other day and he didn't say that brother Dave well I just went out and got the book turned to the page and said here read it I didn't hear him say that what did that mean he didn't say it no that meant her human brain was triggered off onto something else so untrigger that booger today and let's listen right there'll be Daryl B three advents of the Lord now here's the way the human mind works therapy 3x that's not what it said it says Daryl see you're trying to correct me you're spending your time trying to be so smart to show how smart you are I was listening brother Carly reading the scripture this morning and he's transferred two words just like that well how many of you heard all you didn't even hear what he said you heard him transfer them two words you see one of the folks that it gets you say well you're just getting old and you're getting hateful I think it's about time maybe to be hateful in one way to wake you and I up to our carnality you start talking to somebody and you tell them and their minds done clicked and they're not even listening to what you're saying so all right now you're down far enough to listen what we're going to read there will be three advents of the Lord an advent means a coming or appearing you know coming into being the first to redeem is right when he died for her second to receive his bride when he comes for her third with his bride for the millennium and there will be three advance now what does he say then and one of them is passed when Advent is passed and the signposts are showing that we're near the second Advent of the Lord Jesus we've tried everything we've had the big fours in the meeting tonight are you listening one part of the coming of the Lord is already passed it took four thousand years for it to take place his first coming was what to redeem the bride he died for her all right now the second part of that is only dealing with the bride is not dealing with his coming to Israel it's not dealing with a millennium or the end of the world it's dealing with coming for his bride now as I said the other day take those scriptures and move them about and what do you got brother Dale at the coming of the Lord ever I'll see him then where are you going to put that scripture well we're in the internet time we got TV there is no possible human way right now for everybody to see the Lord coming I don't care how scientific you are there's places in this world that the internet's not there right there's places that even your Facebook don't work right that's what I said one of these days the Rapture is going to come everybody come on but look the second time is to receive his bride when he comes for her and look and one of them is passed and the signpost are to show us what part we're in we're not in his first coming that has already transpired two thousand years ago we're in his second coming to the bride not to the world what did he say in the bride coming across it's the rising of the Sun coming out of the church yeah let's just read something because I said think about it go ahead brother Anderson and pull up first Thessalonians 5. we just read first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven worship and Archangel on a trumpet and we had that all figured out we had it all figured out about hey and an angel comes up and he raises the dead and then we hear that that's chapter 4 verse 17 18. chapter 5 verse 1. what are the times in the seasons brethren we have no you have no need to write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety when they shall say we've got the message we know all about what's going on we've heard the prophet's message what then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief I thought we were looking for ever I to see him that scripture is pertaining to his Second Coming that ever I'll see him put that dire Paul is telling him it's so marvelous but it was so hard for me to comprehend when brother Branham explaining Paul when he was talking about that he was trying his best to get out of people's mind that the Lord Jesus was coming right then we've all taught Paul was trying to explain how he was dying he was coming into the Run said Paul was trying to get it out of their mind that don't fit our carnality right brother West or what we used to be taught we was taught that Paul was trying to explain about the coming 2 000 years ago he goes on to say there must be a falling away trying to get it out of the mind to the people that God was coming right then we're not the children of Darkness these things are not supposed to come up on you and I on a war in the bride coming of Christ the prophet said coming out of the church well I didn't know that was the coming of the Lord the second stage of it or second Advent what do you think it was if it's in three advents there's three parts to it or whatever you want to call it a wording one of them has already transpired because he's already come and we're in the second stage of it of coming for the bride to take her away you know what he's got to be here to do that so truly Paul was right the Lord himself showed us send from heaven with a shout you remember how we went through it trying to emphasize it that you could say to Paul said Paul what did you mean when you said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven to shout before it's an argument what do you mean Paul well we read that from our Baptist Methodist Presbyterian eyes or whatever and we read Paul said the Lord himself shall descend with a great big holler great big screen and then some angels going to come up and raise the Dead and then we're going to hear a trumpet say Paul what'd you say I said what God told me to say that Jesus is going to do all three of these in his descended amen amen right so then we're already in the Rapture parties it's in phases and now we're talking about the second coming the bride the coming to the bride not to the world not to the Jews not to anything but to you and I that the first part of it has already transpired because it already come to redeem the bride now he's coming to me remember Jesus comes three times future home he comes three times well see you say that well you're talking about him coming to the Jews and come into the world and who are you talking about he's talking about talking about the three advents with three parts to you and I this is the only part I'm concerned with I don't know about you I'm not concerned with him going to Israel I'm not a Jew I'm over here all right so then we talk about well I'm going to come and come and it just they're just coming I ask you to do it many years ago and I'll keep asking Look up the word c-o-m-e the word come it has no reference to travel it has no reference to Journeys the word come literally means to be here that's why your message the parisia perusia people went out talking about his presence I told them then I said look I don't want Jesus standing beside of me because he'd have to kill me because sin can't stand in his presence I want him inside this part of the coming of the Lord I'm talking about is something personal to you and I you know he ain't coming after everybody I was talking about this morning though the Bible talks about if you're not little flock you realize there's seven billion people in the world today you know and if he was coming after one billion I'd be a small flock what does it take how many million I mean it takes uh ten hundred thousand to make a million I remember in school they taught us how big a room had to be to put one dollar bills a million of them in a big old room it takes 100 million uh ten hundred thousand to make a million it takes how many million to make a billion right so if you came after a billion would be great I just don't think it's going to be that many myself but I'm just making a point it's fear not little flock it's only for the Royal Seed of Abraham but you see we're looking for the coming of the Lord when it's already started right it started 2 000 years in a in a consummation of physical form two thousand years ago it took four thousand years for that to transpire right and it started because that word Advent means a appear you know a coming and doing but to dislocate the scriptures look where you and I would be but do not follow what the prophet had to say look where we would be back there according to John 1 14 the word was made flesh that was his first coming yeah amen right the word was made flesh all right now we're not we're not far or not are not supposed to be looking for a physical coming of a Corporal body I gave you these the other day I've got them here if you need them Jesus don't set foot on the Earth until the millennium right yet he becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we're going to rapture join his second order Advent or whatever you want to talk about it to the bride now we're not talking about the world to get all of it out of your mind say well he don't understand the scripture because of this over here I'm not talking about to Israel there will be a coming of Jesus Christ to Israel after we get out of here but that won't be a physical body that'll be two two witnesses the Millennium is really the second coming of Jesus Christ in a physical form we're not dealing with a physical form of his coming we're dealing with a spiritual form of his coming that's taking place right now through the revealing of his word amen I'm not looking for the skies to open and I see a physical body of Jesus Christ run around and said these people with blood on their hands you know an oil on their forehead he said they're saying that the body of Jesus is here and he said that's incorrect that's not true in the bride coming of Christ is coming out of the church Home Alone never was in there it don't make no difference we was born between Eve and the Beast which is organized religion we was born organizational we must be born again in the soul to get us out of these things and if that don't take place there's no need to be talking about a body see so in the bride coming of Christ where he comes one time to redeem his bride he comes back the next second part of it is to get his bride and then he's going to come back with his bride in the millennium all right we're only talking about the coming of of God to his bride we have to divide these things and what does it make any difference all right what's going to take you out of here right well one of these days I'm going to hear that Shout you see where you're at you see why that it gets hard and won't show human flesh and why did I scream out let's get out of our carnality right amen I told the Baptist I said why is it you keep saying we're saved just cause we believe I said the Bible don't say that it does I said were right I said it says he that believer right right and his baptized shall be saved believe us is a continuation it's not yet I believe I believe it's message I'm just waiting on the bus to pull up well what if it comes on a train you understand all of what I was bringing a while ago what if it's an airplane ride you're down to bus depot buying a ticket well you're just trying to make it like that you want everybody to come here I want you to go where God wants you to go because if you don't go where God wants you to go you're hindering me and I'm hindering you this has never been built upon trying to build a church it's built on one thing God's word I love everybody people don't understand me I love people I spent my life trying to bring this message down into simple language that people can understand it but you see what we're quick to quote is like brother random would say they're on the Ohio River said the voice came down and says your message will forerun the second coming it will it will but the second coming can be applied to the Jews and this message will go to the Jews so his message will forerun the second coming is a millennium without this message we don't go to the millennium so it's exactly right but yet our mind has put it to I don't understand what he's saying he's saying that that there's three advents to it all I'm worried about is a second coming well where is the second coming to you then what is it right that's all I've tried to get across church is one thing his message would forerun the second coming all right I've explained that this message we're going to Israel once we leave here right this message will put us in the Millennium so he's right right but what is the part that you and I are to be concerned with the Advent of his coming to take us away if you want to call it Second Coming that's fine we just get to point in your mind what you're talking about we should not even be concerned with thinking about the trumpet we should be concerned with trying to get Jesus Christ here that can raise the Dead amen but you see we've got it all figured out we just need to hear the trumpet well you get a young guy and he comes in the message he really is on fire he's a fireball and he's going everybody just flocks to him oh this is it this is it that's what we've been waiting on now you know what I'm saying is right you just don't want to admit it but you run after these things thinking it's some kind of a great doings my brother Brown said if they come with signs and wonders but yet with the same message you are not to hear them the Bible says if a man give you a sign and it come to pass when he takes you to another God what he used to do get away from him but yet we no no we we can't do that we see I'm talking about in The Bride coming of Christ I'm not talking about the Israel the world or anything I'm talking about the part you and I are concerned with I've Illustrated it over and over Martin Luther probably preached no telling how many sermons on the scripture there where it says the judge shall live by faith here one day that jumped off the pages in that man's heart and he challenged the world and started a Revival over one scripture let the just shall live by faith he was like Moses it had 40 years listening to Mama right you're delivered you to this you're there all of their life we don't believe that way I saw a movie one time they showed he was it was about probably 40 years old before we heard about it don't give a hoot watch you saw brother random said but we don't want to quote that run around and see his mama you told him you are not a son of Pharaoh's daughter he raised he was raised he studied he knew the Scrolls he studied 40 years but all it done was brought him a stinking dead Egyptian right but five minutes in front of a burning bush the prophet said meant more than all the Mama's teaching that's all I've ever tried to get you to see wonderful message we've heard but if it's not revealed where are we at first Jehovah Witness reading room well what about it what do you think about rapture relating to his coming if he don't come here we don't go there right that's right well why would we be concerned about going there when we don't even know he's come here right I probably said he'd become visible Among Us well brother Dale now now visible that's means oh yeah let's see Webster says visible means that that can be seen perceptible to the eye apparent not a parent you know Mom and Daddy a parent knowledge it means to manifest it means to be obvious visible to the eye the prophet said he'd be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we'd go into Rapture that's exactly the second stage of the Rapture right because the voice of the Archangel is to be the Lord Jesus Christ to be here among us to raise the dead and we're going to Rapture but not you're in a Corporal body but to be visible Among Us what do you think about when you think of visible when I see it if anything you can see there's no faith involved for the raptures the prophet said the Rapture is a revelation he didn't say it's what you saw the eyeballs is what's Made Alive in your heart right visible he said he never puts his foot on Earth until the church has been raptured go ahead let's get number six on that and I got a minute let's get it look what he said this is taken from the sardesian church age which is 1960 1209 I'm jumped a whole lot this morning pool number six but let me just drop this into your heart there will never be a Jesus set a foot on this Earth until the church has done raptured and gone well why are we looking for a physical coming I want the scripture for a physical coming he said I've you know until the church is done raptured and gone home now you just buy that in mind because there will be false Christ rise up now why is he saying that you know what false Christ are going to do they're going to teach you a false Doctrine a doctrine that wrote her down I believe he's going to be visible that means he's going to be standing here false Christ now quote wrote around him all on the hands before he says they're saying it to physical bodies here he said that's contrary to the scripture what about it look false prophets arise teaching false Doctrine but Jesus will not be here on the earth because the trumpet sounds and he never comes we meet him in the air the church is already gone and then when Jesus appears it'll be the returning back the Gentiles goes to meet him in the air is that the scripture they go to meet him in the hour and then we'll go up and Jesus never puts his foot on Earth until the church has been raptured and took home and wedding supper over in heaven then he returns back after the Jewish remnant you're coming back after the Jews right then he comes back after not even physical to them through two witnesses then he becomes visible or physical in the millennium well yeah we know all about visible what about this when going to number go to number seven where we can read that where people just understand it or the Holy Ghost given far paragraph 51 roll it on up God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into his church his fullness his power to his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into rapture he becomes visible but not in a Corporal body right he's already been here visible I'm waiting on you to think a little bit I got the notes to read okay he's already been here visible but now where does your mind say visible you got it recorded write it down on a piece of paper what you think he's already been here visible some of you wrote down Jesus on Earth two thousand years ago some of you wrote down the great doctrine of 63. when he become here when brother Reynolds say okay but remember he's the prophet not me not you look what he says on a message call number eight proof of his resurrection 1955. 404 10. paragraph 157 I want you to notice something closer now before closing on the very early morning when Murray Magdalene and Mata was at the grave first now remember this is after he'd done been here for 30 something years death burial and Resurrection right now come on Christ showed himself visible among the early risers that's after his resurrection he never showed it anymore to the span of the day off day he's visible back there not Corporal standing on Earth he said after his death burial his resurrection right and he was visible among the early risers and he never showed it any more through this fan of day until the evening time then he made himself known again where he was Alpha and omeka I'll be light in the evening time the path of Glory you're surely find visible but not corporal right he was visible to those right that saw him touched him handled him but not in that Corporal physical human part he's already been made eternal right look at the next one number nine now here's we're going to do that again because if I read the title you're going to stop and your mind's gonna cut off so we read the title then your mind Cuts back on you're sarcastic no I'm just trying to tell you the truth amen you read the title their Arrow of gods deliver a shot from a bow I never heard that message if you honey honey you ever heard that message no I never heard that message well ain't no need me reading what he said well you're still tied up into what it is now let's read what he said roll it on up God we're so glad you've got to live in God we've got one who promised us he's right here with us showing himself visible Among Us and we thank thee for it will you let your humble servant he said by predestinated gift he was visible right not down through the truth he was visible back there to the early risers he's Alpha he's Omega that didn't mean he wasn't in those ages coming down no but he wasn't visible as the prophet is covering visible yet um Martin everyone said the greatest of all the messengers he said there was never a service that A great miracle never took place in Saint Martin's Ministry yet he's talking about something visible the visibility that covers the eye that we can see or becomes apparent to the eye or can make manifest he stood there after his resurrection in a glorified state and manifested himself visibly now your Prophet is talking about is visible in the last days so it must be the same way but was it visible too remember how the prophet would stand here and say you know back there he said he was with Abraham and them and said he turned us back Sarah was in the back behind him he said now let's see if that same God what visible he said now there's a man sitting right back here behind me in this baptistry he said he was planning on getting him some new shoes but said he decided he wouldn't get him he told his wife said no need to get in the money because I'm dying now that's what he was talking about visible all right now look at the next one forgotten beatitude 61. but that real power and manifestation of the presence of God has not been seen for years and years and years we felt it and we knowed it was here and we've seen gifts work with it but when we see him come visible Among Us with power in his church are you reading on the Hem of the Garment of the master and touch it he's talking about something in his church look at the last one into a quit perseverance 1962. e 121 wrote it on up he talks about today we're looking for the Messiah and the way he did it back there God is God he can never make a decision and then change and say I'll do something else and if he's Let the church go in just on theology without showing himself visible among them like that then he's doing something for them back there he didn't do for us but he promised to do it that's what I believe and that's what he proves now back to the original quote of what it becomes visible Among Us and raised the dead and we're going to rapture what are you looking for brother Dale him to become visible Among Us and raise the dead and go into rapture no no because you're out you missed it you remember what I told you how they done it you people with diabetics you prick your finger it doesn't bleed 90 of the time now you may bleed a little bit you know what I'm talking about you milk it with your fingers and it brings the blood out right so they just put little pins around their belts and things and walk up and stick their fingers and say the Lord's going to come down it's going to be blood Among Us and look at here and then melt the blood right out of their fingers and you start screaming and hollering that the Lord Jesus is here a deceiving trick of the devil and yet if I said that to most people that have went after that and believed it they would fight me to the death about it call me a false prophet but you see if it's not in the word I don't care the word tells us what's going to happen in the end time what the Lord himself is going to descend from heaven the shout voice over an archangel the trumpet the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed putting Corinthians and thoughts Thessalonians together change in a moment of tweaking of mind be caught up amen but it's already in a process taking place here the coming of the Lord is here and when he comes here visible Among Us then he can take us dire physically to meet him in the air you say brother Dale what do we look for come on folks this message to be revealed in this message is everything that you have need of yeah we can be so part and we believe it if time goes on there'll be a woman in the White House time goes wrong there'll be a pope coming out of the United States time goes wrong Russia will come as your oil those are the things your Prophet said and I believe it what about going to shut down and say well can't do that until the pope comes out you know I ain't got to worry about rapture I just goof off and do what I want to when the pope comes out of the United States I'll be there we'll be ready were bus depot train Airport sitting at home you get what I'm saying if this message is not revealed to you and I there's no change for us everybody's going to be changed get it off your mind everybody's going to be changed the Bible says it will be but what is that change in a moment in the twinkling and well they spent how many years do we spent his third year as a twinkle it's because of this it's because of that a twinkle we're as bad as bad as twinkle twinkle little star how I wondered who you are or who you belong to because now they're talking about you what is a twinkle if we can figure out a twinkle and we could figure out 30 minutes you know about this place of half an hour and we can figure that out brother so-and-so over here he's figured it out where you want to go but what if it's like the prophet said about all this Blood Moon turned into blood he said I can show you where that's already taken place yet everybody was ready back a few weeks ago when that blood moon was coming at a certain time right that ain't no more than the old Baptist Church Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals whatever you want to call it Catholics you know they're looking for the coming of the Lord but what if it is that the coming of the Lord is this message that you and I are supposed to be talking about what is the shout is this message and yet we're wanting to find it in some other way or some body that's got some idea or some doctrine that can penalize our beings what about it what do you think about it there's three advents to the coming of the Lord that's tied to the Bride of Jesus Christ I had to re-title if somebody on tape get it I had them to retitle it I first put it the second coming but then I retitled it to the coming of the Lord because and the second coming is a deceiving point of thinking who's he coming to is he coming to Israel as you come to the end of the world is it coming at the wife don't judge me where is it coming many Avenues to be taken about his coming but I want to talk about is coming to you and I and the first part of his coming has already transpired and we're in the midst of his second Advent which is coming to take the bride away that was when the prophet descending and the spirit of God struck the Earth to bring it forth started that process of the second Advent of his coming you want this quote the coming the spirits Prof the prophet of the spirit excuse me the spirit of the prophet he talks about his coming see this is not a brand new thing most of you have been around here you know I've been preaching this for 40 something years this is not a new thought A New Concept a new idea that's why we don't get caught up by all these doctrines and little tantalizing things that will run after something that's got a little jingle to it amen what does the word say now if Satan can impersonate every gift and even pass out Supernatural gifts right then why are we worried about gifts to get us out of here yet I believe in all of the gifts and the prophet said a church that don't have the gifts in manifestation we'll have to answer to God now that's I believe in your speaking in tongues I believe in your shouting I believe in your doing I believe all that's wonderful but when you get all of that done shouting the next week won't do you no good you know what I mean shouting today next week will do you no good you're gonna need some more shouting some more emotionals more doing but if you got something to eat the word then next week you can think about it in the middle of the night he said well you know that's what he was talking about that ties together with the scriptures I can see now that the Rapture is the coming of the Lord here and then he'll take us dire once he completes the process of getting here so what am I concerned with getting him here come on musicians what am I concerned with you didn't even hear getting him here what are we let's Stand Together the three advents of his coming and he never preached a thing about Israel and uh any other things that's just like brother mode I remember years ago we were listening to this certain brother a boy he had that battle of Armageddon he had that thing down and man he was preaching it you know that these troops come down here and they come down here from China and they come from Russia and they come down and they gather around there and we're going to get dark and boy those people would just go oh I can see the Hat we went outside and brother Mo walked up to the brother of course he wouldn't he's kind of like me he wasn't too popular either but I guess that's where I learned not to be popular from was him but he asked that brother he said brother almost called his name but he said brother he said where did Brother Branham say them forces come from to fight the battle of Armageddon on the fourth seal the brother he said I don't really know I'd invite you to go home and read the fourth seal and read the battle of Armageddon he never mentions Russia he never mentions China he never mentions any of those things that's coming down in a physical form you know what he talks about the denominations coming after the bride there's your battle of Armageddon why because first is going to be here a spiritual battle then when this is all over with yes it will be Russia and China and all that because there will be a literal Armageddon but if somebody don't win this battle of the Mind the greatest battle ever Falls right if somebody don't win the battle of the Mind ain't no need to worry about nothing else we can't keep up with a footman what about when the horsemen get here if you and I can't stand and say this message is right tell these garbage can people that's on the internets and all over the world and saying that brother Brown on my road this morning said one brother used to think he made 49 mistakes and now he had 149. I want him to come and show me show me where it's at but yet that's a good brother so is the Pope how many of us have ever been shot about what we believe one of them back few were pokes back got shot because of what he was and now he so lovey-dovey he's getting to Pentecostals and everybody together them together you remember the man got up and said how many years got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll raise her hand he said you're everyone Catholic thank you so what are you saying and the people started finally they jerked their hand down then when he explained it they all rejoicing he says there's no such thing as a protest anymore he said the protest was over he said we're all one we come back together I don't agree with it it's like we were having a meeting one time with a uh muhammadan what you call them I'll get all that messed up so we'll get it right and he had this video he wanted us to watch to where this preacher in this muhammadan guy got into an argument he wanted to show us how that muhammadan just put that preacher down little brother hantus he said November is brother hantus brother oil to myself I remember the three now anyhow brother hantus or brother Altec one looked at him and said we don't want to watch your video because that man don't represent us he's a trinitarian the man said you mean y'all are not treated terrorism no we believe in one true and living God the man said he said you mean y'all believe Jesus was God it was just dumbfounding to the guy because he'd never heard anybody say it I don't want nobody representing me I'll stand on my own and worry about the rest of it what do we got anybody have a need to order it open we're going to eat together today now Fellowship together so the company you stay with us and eat with us
