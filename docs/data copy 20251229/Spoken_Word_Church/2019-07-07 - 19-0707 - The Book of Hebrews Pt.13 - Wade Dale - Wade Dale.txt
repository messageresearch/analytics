========================================

stop the process anytime you wish you still are a free moral agent with God you can never ever take away your free moral agency never don't tell me you can because even Adam did some things if he really was supposed to do and he was a little horny heat well we weren't warning him but he had the Holy Ghost in his soul and he did some things that were pretty rough and so today okay so let's just don't product it's not the statue of a perfect man if a statue moves it's not a statue right if a statue but a stature has growth development or height developments that jerk not static to you and you can stop anytime you want then you say when the Holy Ghost in your soul yeah last night I was thinking about this brother Ramsey remember the preacher birthday with the morning in Christian nature yeah so I think reaching the more he got a spirit on me when out started drinking but I will tell you something he didn't lose his salvation he just got a demon on him that overtook that man but you know why God didn't label it for a long time back since my flavor brother Graham Stig's doctor took him home showing what the margins name so see God's gracious and if we do things that seemingly is kind of like we were talking about suicide you know and then and the denominational world you commit suicide your hell I mean it's just a straight cube to hell but we know that's not right right we know that's not right what because you didn't do it in your soul you did it in an anointing on your spirit and your humanity that made you do what you did I pretty much okay now we're a mission of these is there's no more offering for sin listen when you get born again in your soul you don't have to go back through that form of justification I was hoping we'd get into that last night but we couldn't you don't have to go back to that form of sanctification you got to move out of that mental realm because it's finished it's done now where does your growth come from it comes from what's that's inside because the life is in that Steve word that you take in your soul but you gotta let it work out or you can stop it but we have the full work so that's really no excuse for us to stop it so having therefore boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us like I told you before I read that quote last seconds of people in Kentucky they looked a little cross-eyed you ever once a wild where I know them that that Jesus never come to bring you an inheritance he did no no he does not come to bring you an interview new he came a way to get you back to your inheritance a new and living way which have constantly consecrated yourself so that we can become free but he to bring you an inheritance if he brought to an inheritance they developed the son of Jesus came on earth your inheritance was before the foundation of the world you just didn't get back to it because of the watch because of the same curse I believe that's in hearing him and I think 61 is the very quote that are you the brother God says no he did not bring your inheritance he made a way to get you back to your memory by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh he had to die human being and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart a true soul in full assurance of faith having our soul sprinkled from an evil conscience so it's done away in the soul we're trying to work on the spirit guy and our bodies washed water now that doesn't mean you go take a bath and you fine brother okay that's washing of the water of the word pure word pure water plants let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering Rhydian let's hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for his faith he is faithful that promised in other words he got it promised it we put all of our faith in him and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good work oh this Oh Oh if you end the message this doesn't apply to you anymore I'm gonna read you the bottom and whatever you do with it that's your business not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching I'm telling you if you're not going to church more than you were back ten years ago you're lost you do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost how to look at me hi everyone in the interface you do not because this scripture right here and so much the more as you see what day of protein the day when we're not going to be able to assemble like this you better packing up in your storehouse to where you can't get the turn you can teach your family at home but you can't do it sitting at home I'm just read the Bible look for if we sin willfully see if you don't believe this around here you're standing willfully now sinning willfully that makes you lost if you sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins in other words there is no sacrifice for that are you knowing and you don't do it but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries thank God for that excuse me he that despised Moses law died without mercy under to bear witnesses so Moses was a man of the day and even though you say well that was just the law they live by they live they did live by the night okay he they despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment oh he's magnified it now of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy that trodden under the foot of the son of God no word if they tried Moses being a human if they tried Moses his message and they didn't make it they died without mercy how much more sore punishment they do the same thing when we read the Bible and God tells us what to do and God tells us what to do and we tried and underfoot the Son of God how much more is that Moses was just letters on the page son of God was a man guarding human flesh talking to us trying to get us to do right and have counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified and holy play in other words you're saying he's not got enough for me to live the way I'm supposed to live but you know you're wrong he does and Paul saying you're wrong and have done despite unto the spirit of grace is asking a question for we know him that said that said then just belongs under maintenance in that gun I will recompense that the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the Living God the call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated in other words an afterthought after the word comes you endured a great fight of affliction partly whilst you were made occasions dog both by reproach and affliction both talking by coming into Christ and then you know what he was partly to blame for that Paul from Paul persecuted the Christians before he got converted so he's partly to blame for this for he had compassion of me and my bond and took joyful the spoiling of your good knowing in yourself that you have I'm better than a third sentence in other words Paul saying you guys that are bound to me same way we're talking about now though people that are bound to this message we have to put up with all the spoiling of people saying this and people saying that all these different things but we know the message the truck knowing in yourself that you haven't having a better name during substance Matthew 24 those who endure to the end shall be safe that's not a way that for your confidence that's what Satan doing right now he is tearing down the confidence of the people in this message what he's doing right I ain't doing it from within so that's not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward where you have need of patience if I take your hand though I mean you tell me that this morning coming up you gotta have patience those who endure to the end why can't I have it right now you know what if you and I don't want something as an adult we wait right we have patience we wait get behind the 40 face it same way with God you get crying and crying and crying he said shut up I'm gonna let you go a little bit longer okay you gonna learn this thing where we have need of patience and that after you have done the will of God that word right there after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise that's what I say that by going you know you stay with one that you the Bible tell us what today we don't do it and we worry why we're not getting results let's go check ourselves up when we study in and out when we pray enough we'll be coming to church with a wonderful attitude that God's going to meet us here are that we set at home ago ll-look watch him because my big talker so I just I love that I love the Internet and I love that world YouTube but I'll never stay home and watch the service explain something true that will never happen all right stick yes somehow to work like the curtain that he knows he has to work one Sunday but you know what he don't miss three or four he comes do you understand what I'm saying sometimes we have circumvented he said well let's jump you cut and dry it is good and drop so he's working towards something we're all working toward something all right we just start you don't feel good hey I don't feel good either come on you use those circumstances for a long time I come here to learn I come here to teach you did not come anything by this point you know I I come here with the dual purpose and there's no today we'll talking last night we are no greater than nobody else don't you ever think that that me and brother daily the one and he's never and I'll never predict it I don't think they were up here and y'all are down here no no yes because we're no different the body of Christ only we have a gift that where God can speak to me maybe where he couldn't speak to brother on the same way okay well I'm saying the same way because what defender is just an important manner I got a hangnail on that finger it was so short this little hangout took a couple days off work did come to church nobody it hurt because they don't tell my reaching get something I hit that we don't want that thing that's important I'll everybody every person is important in the body of Christ we have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the problem then what is his will his will is his word where you had a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry don't that mean you you say oh my god what words he coming that somebody in now they just shall live by he said yeah now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them they grow back them to perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and then he goes into Hebrews 11 faith is the substance of things hoped for [Music] I'm trying to get out of here instead get the boobs a little good everybody here today or bless your heart and hopefully have a good week and you definitely got a good start of another oh yeah today being the first day of the week okay so now let's turn to we got well you or look Hebrews 10 we're going to we got down to his enemies made a switch to make Ryan from doing them from I one offering he has perfected forehead now this is something we were coming a little bit last night the Bible study for those of you that weren't here that would 51 of us care less 9 so we keep doing this a lot of have enough in the sanctuary but no copier no no no Brioni but not all wait a minute I'll find a quote for the brownie good when Brandis his ticket no now we have a full house and that was great thank you everybody for coming so but but why what I'll bring up perfected forever them that are sanctified all right and then we talked about justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost like what brother doesn't call me about let's just keep going we're out the Holy Ghost also of the witness to us we're after they hear saying that look you got to get to where he says those who he's justified is already glorified because that sanctification is not just the unclean spirit going out because you know Holy Ghost off with the witness to us so he's talking about a daily sanctification it's not just you get sanctified you get the Holy Ghost that's not what he saved because look he has perfected you're not perfected until you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are heading toward perfection but you're not perfect in its sanctification baby born now the iodine daily part yes you are you're already born again you're stealing in they can't get in God can't get out what a wonderful thing alright so he's working in sanctification on the outer outer outer man are the middleman for by one offering yet perfected bringing in their sanctify where the Holy Ghost offer the witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days that the Lord I will put my law in their hearts around their inward being because then the Old Testament remember we've been through this months months months in the Old Testament God can not dwell in their soul he could annoy them okay but now he's talking about that another covenant when Jesus raised the company in Matthew and says this is the New Testament in my blood right so the New Testament in his blood was and he took our sins away and we don't have to go back to the well Paul talking about the period priesthood made sacrifices cry student made one sacrifice you don't make no more right he's done he's then perfected forever of those who are just are sanctified all right this is the covenant I will make with them after those days says the Lord I will put my laws into their heart and into their minds will I write them right and their sins and iniquities where I remember no more thing I want you to remember that God is telling us this this we know one thing this comes from the Old Testament so God's going to do that to Israel - God's going to take the 144,000 through justification sanctification in the baptism and they're going to be preached - just like you are don't think how to receive the holy go right but now remember position-wise they're not bribed so don't don't get that messed up their service because they were divorced or put away by God in the Old Testament and he made us you can't have to live beyond popular belief and some of the people in imagine if you don't need to act you know what a revelation then it has to be and their sins and iniquities where I remember the war right cuz I've been reading I went back like I tell you many Chronicles and kings and now I'm in the book of Esther but Chronicles and Kings man 1 King had come in and he'd tear all the Groves then put them back I mean you know go back to Temple worship he had died his son and raised up and he'd be he praise Him grooms all back up again start sacrificing his kids to Moloch in other words you know what that was they would sacrifice their children to appease done and would literally take their children's dolmen fire to appease the gods were God so you see what I may have their sins and iniquities are out a lot of remember two more there's going to be an Old Testament people that's going to be saved okay so they're God's people God can't forget Israel that's why he's going to save that 144,000 at the end time after we're gone at the end he's going to save them sanctify them filled with the Holy Ghost and they will be servants because they lost the position of bride okay now remember you and I can never be service because we're the life we're the life of Christ so we're not serving where we are his wife I don't want to hit on that maybe later on upstairs on the Seventh Seal we must not see ourselves as bride anymore there was a bride in the church ages God married a bride in the church age but in revelations 19 when we come back into the Millennium after all this is done and over with we are his wife there's a big difference in a bride and a life big difference now you got to be a bride first but now you look at me and tell me that your wife it's the same person you married no she's not right when you first got married you fumble around like you had three left hand I got one and man freedom will when people say you're left-handed was it yeah we did thank left-handed huh but you did come on people when you got married you didn't know exactly what you want once you know exactly what you wanted you're Bob bust and Tim but now you get a little bit of older and maybe cuz you can't hear as well as you used to or remember right 3j brother you don't even know you 40 in yes yes it's a sorry what hey Louise before you do poverty you're in close 39:39 next month this month Oh Lord I'll be married 40 years in October I'll release you to your mom now that Colombian came in so anyway let's get back um but anyway even in life remember a bride it's just like brother Dale's talking about one up that statue of a perfect man you started a ride and you go work your way up that statue a perfect man and when we come to a body change we're gonna be the life of Christ now sure you can keep saying proud people to catch some time you know cross-eyed what you mean we're not bright anymore we're not we started bright the word is life the Bible tells us where is why I'm not telling you anything different over revelation 19 says his wife had made her spouts ready so you do have something to do with it just like more come out Thank You bride right you do that you say well you know when you do come you terminology is well this is my new bride but you know you really do away with that wing when you've got bride and bridegroom that doesn't carry on very far into your marriage it becomes husband and wife and that's correct because the same thing with Christ I mean you've time the whole thing is that you're married to Christ when you become his wife because what I read well I've got the quotes so we can even a later upstairs she has his potential she knows what he wants to do with the word I same way with Jim you know many times and you know it too you'll be thinking the same thing and you'll both worked it out at the same time and you'll go oh I was just she said something the other day and so I'm just thinking the same identical thing well you know what that means then for communion there that's that's really supernatural same thing between Ivany before the fall there was a supernatural connection between Adam and Eve but where like I was telling them up in Kentucky Adam an evil co-equal before the fall people don't like to preach that read your Bible her name was not even till the fall of her name was Adam and she was co-equal with Adam before the fall okay then boning this poem and actually her part of her spirit came out of him and went into her so what what connect well what the world happens between us and Christ part of his spirit come down and go there nice smells I work and there's sands and iniquities will rival remember no more now we're remission of these is there's no more offering percent so you don't have in other words we were talking about last night you got to remember baby form justification is not flight the second form of justification we're brother man talk about a mysterious part now people were talking years and years of justification benefit message in panco well now justification just chucked off you pass in now the next form of justification doesn't just jump off your face then you pay sins are a checkup and you already have the holy ghost room there's nothing that counted against your soul you don't have to go back in and get your soul justify the second time or the third time no you're working on the second room the spirit around with what God's working on right now if you're born again you're not born again he's working on the inside guy to get it cleaned up and give it to holy go and if you have the bath minimal hookup then your soul your sealed person Luther with a sealed person he had smoked drank and dude thinks he did in his soul he did it in his spirit realm that was not enough preaching or background I got all that was looking at last night that's not he didn't have no background all he knew was that he received the Holy Ghost and wanted you to receive the Holy Ghost apart from the works of the Catholic Church that's all he had that's why I was a reformer he brought he reformed him reformed what perform skill dude really that changed the person that just tries to reform you and bring you out you know but he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul so he could you couldn't bother that so Luther never smoked a pipe and drank the beer and installed he stole never you said well well yeah I'm sure he had problems with that I'm sure you have problems with that back and forth he he's still Ward with that because Paul said the same thing to think I wouldn't not I do things I deal with not that's not at all so that's in this spit room that's the problem that we have we have a problem with your soul being God if you realize your soul was God and it does not sin can't sin won't sin never did it in the first place then there's your new birth but now you got to start working on that next guy now so I gotta the memory reason conscious and you do need to be just the fact they're justified it's what justified you're just you got to realize hey Matt about these dirty thoughts and I have in my life I used to have like still have them but I don't dwell on them like they used to so see Luther never had that part Luther never had the teaching to bring him to a true justification that the real he'll never did but I'll promise you one thing you bring Luther in here today and let him listen brother Dale talk about justification or listen to the passport by Sherman to my justification I'm guaranteed you would not keep him in his seat because the Holy Ghost inside of him with Clinton the little bit that he had and it will just be be a complete revelation so didn't brother Brandon say from the bride's realizes they have not realized in you what we're trying to do Ezekiel Supercross need some factor real well that was Christ in the church all down to the seven churches sure so he's they have to have the whole ethos of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost because I think the strikes in the truth for their age believe in Calamba sake globalism you know he was in a very dark age but he had life yes his life was the gospel at the time and Martin Luther's light was to bring a group of people out of the Catholic dogma and doctrine yeah and clicking the word that he had which was just a little small piece of the whole puzzle bait was you know what you go out there in the garden you put the seed in the ground when m2 shoots come up like this she said well that's not corn yet but you know why you cut it down it's got the life of the corn in those to talk to you you got to leave it alone and let it continue to grow and let the Sheep go up because the Lots in there but now these two things die they're very important Lutheran's very important that's the basis of all Christianity modern Christianity you understand when a man coming out of the Catholic Church the basis of all crit and he come from Luther and Wesley and Pentecost amen that's why brother Brennan had to come to tie up the loose ends that were still there because when Wesley came out of the Catholic Church he brought a lot of dogma with him because he didn't have any background Lord he didn't have nobody to teach him all he took what Scott was this you know say 20 Hail Marys and you know do the beat yourself and I love that movie I go back again if you ever want to see a good movie see the one Martin Luther that had clients his last night FBI mes fine Jeremy or one of us to brother pretty Joe the fight huh I need think they anyway being wait look it up because this is a really good movie because what it does it shows from lugar struggling struggling with what's inside of it and then do exactly what brother Brown said he said it wasn't it lugar I was reading it last night Luther it wasn't that he was so much a fanatic it's that he could hold his head above the fanaticism around evil in that movie Luther comes back into a town in there Bernie you see a Catholic Church on fire and they're throwing the priests out them out the door Luther run them is this stop and the guy turns around and said this is what you taught us to do so and in the hitting that what he was doing was is the people were taken to the fleshly emotion and he was trying to get him out of the Catholic Church spiritually and they will get him out physically so that was the terminal ending in C brown brown brain set up in the movie when he made at that time so no brother Graham didn't watch the movie bill and then you see that that he held his head above the fanaticism it was going on well don't you see that having the same thing right now there was fanaticism with everybody in every age okay they didn't have that think about that's what the profits well you got it you got to be careful saying that they had the word yeah they have a word for their day cuz they have the complete Bible the Bible was written by Ken Dayle and all those people about time a blueprint Wesley they compiled what we have well Amanda there's what you have in front of you Luther had parts of that so they were compiling the Bible and he could read the word but the analogy I always use and it works for me is is you take your hand and all I see right now is it's just random Kennard but now that doesn't negate everybody sitting in this building right I can only stay and canard because one I'm shielded but the words here the people there's thirty people in this room but I don't if I do this so that's why I'm done did God didn't literally blind Martin Luther's eyes but he only gave him enough to get out because he wasn't reformer the full word listen you don't want to did that are you sitting right here today because the plan of redemption is a whole plan not just a part plan Luthor could only bring a part wesley brought a part pentecost grown apart and then this message brings the fullness I want nothing to do this it does this and it does this and then see remember the pump boats open mouth so you can only Martin Luther come and crank the book over there looking see the just shall live by faith and you know what that was a revelation because for 1500 years they live by yeah Yeah right Catholic Church are you gonna do is pay you know Venus and all that so good so my name is I just said I'll never watch open let me let me back the tape up you you right God wanted to work in fullness in his church and he can only work in first immortally and was happy with that because it was the stop but the light within that stop we'll see what happened is in the ending when I don't get done with this but in in the first church ages even you know the seat had going to the ground we know that was Christ he had going to ground died so that we could come forth but truly the church had to go in the ground it not co-brother grounds then the true seed went in the ground and you can see it anymore cuz it's buried in the earth during the 59 years of dark ages they but they literally kill people remember when we went to the horse riders and all that you know then you had two shoots come out which is Martin Luther the just shall live by faith you know what that didn't look too promising but you know what that alive anything every seed that was going to be brought forth within them to stop two little shoots coming out of the ground when you plant an apple tree you put a seed in the ground every Apple it's gonna be on that tree is in that seed that's die because I will that one little seed that you can just barely know me like a pea I've got a tree now this about that big around with five hundred Apple only come out of that one seed all right same way with God so the kiss you come up that's Martin Luther the last was in that but that wasn't all he continued to make a stock less swing a tassel Pentecost and then the truth Steve which is me and you because it's the law reproduction you gotta have a seed to make another plan right for us to be proud like we are now we had to have Martin Luther's today but just a little portion well then yes we can yes my hand though here yeah we camera but he could not but he could not but he could not he could handle the phone if he would have got to fill for it you wouldn't be here that's why I said the reason he didn't come to fullness justice your sin here today thanks man yes predestination deed and it had to be the plan of God because remember to shoot is not the see it contains the life of the seat right but it's kind of a little like what went in the ground to shoots didn't go in the ground the Steve went in the ground to shoots come out of the sea then to stop then the tassel then what the Steve hanging at the end is me and you we saw going to Illinois last week we saw a grain I'm in a field full of wheat you know when we tread into harvest you know how the farmer knows that come get bow his head that whole long thing bounces head like this and we saw that going to [Music] like kind of we're still at [Music] but we can his group could not Leslie could not Pentecost good night and part of the first part of brother rounds message good night but you're the last time you're the second one remember it went away from them I rented the closeness six healed it's gone from use not for you while they were in that open a console age of hair and dress and clothes not the revelation of the full open in the book but it listen it's all for you and me I don't think that's the only way I said it's just because he wanted somebody to be the fullness of the work and to be the fullness of the work and I started a little plant that started to shoot you have to go up just like cuz you know what I can't do anything that he hadn't already done before okay he can't he can't change his plan this plan stays the same we have to adhere to that plan Martin Luther adhered to that plan but what happened now when Martin Luther passed away what happened was the people took his doctrine and said this is it and said no more well see God never says that no more that's when they made a Lutheran Church right then what did God do brother I think God just move right on and picked up a man named John Wesley who got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he got a little extra he got the part of sanctification to clean you up but remember what in his soul it was in his spirit realm he was born again just like you are but his potential was sanctification liveth sanctified holy life and everything will be okay and you know what this bride waiting now for us to rust to destroy death through the word and bring them back here and they'll be a very joyous people because Luther's people died under the just shall live by faith okay so they were they were given the Holy Ghost bride because of that part of the word I was reading the quote last night while talking where brother Brown said he'd not only preached justification if you read the star TV in church age about the messenger he'll tell you about Martin Luther Martin Luther he said why he preaches just really of my faith now he didn't just turn on the tape recorders and say all right listen to this just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith to just open only preach the Bible but here's an angle was come out of that Catholic Church doing all that you used to do and come into the Bible and read that the just shall live by the faith of God not the faith like you know where they have their faith for 59 years they had it that kind of attorney they had that Catholic dogma they didn't have it in the Word of God because they didn't have the Word of God met with Catholic kept it away from puffing so let's get back this we got to get the Hebrews 10 living it's got living for I'd like to get to for a way now we're a mission of these is there's no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood Jesus that's the new birth the only a whole is is what it's that middle and if you're warning in that middleman you're saying been remitted and never well standing in and then never send in the first place that's what we got a real life the second realm is where we're having a problem because Satan is going around and around like this right inside that second realm but this message to me the statute perfectman touches on that second realm telling you what you already are Martin Luther probably read those who he's justified he's already glorified and he probably shouted about it but you know what the Holy Ghost in silent helps it that's exactly the trade yeah but he couldn't explain how that happened because even have enough workers planned but like I said he had an arrow listen gentle speck the smallest babe that goes back is done is he turned so whatever Martin lives are having doesn't matter if it looked like a molecule if it was God he's eternal okay so that's what I want to tell you this wasn't want to tell you last night any part of God that's revealed to you and it's a revelation it is eternal can never go away so Martin Luther said to just shall live by faith and God said I'm happy with that part right there let's go to that for a while until the next group comes thank you come even you leavin you baby form justification God can't just dump all the word on you you wouldn't be able to handle it take a baby and a month old start shoving shoving state down straight you kill the baby right you got to feed it that's the same way God big dusty bottle feeds us hand feeds us and then all of a sudden one day says cut your own food oh well the questions are we about why they didn't like that because of that and it come the same way and really it is I mean you you're a baby your spirit born babe in Christ does another a Riblet reveal the seals to you because you you have to process whatever you do in this life I don't care if it's worldly things and I don't mean worldly I mean your job your bills you're in it it's got to go through your brain you have to process that God's not going to just throw it down in here no you got here it first I'm not going to give you a new birth that you've never heard of I've heard the word doctor at all have you gonna
