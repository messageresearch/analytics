all that time we just take a little time and and fellowship together you know we don't get a chance to because we're so scattered out in you know from far away from each other to and do like that we can at least get together have a little fellowship two little girls came in walking in this morning with a thank you note for taking their mom and daddy you know and so that's that was good no but we appreciate it okay like turning these scriptures turn to Jonah to where we've been reading and then we'll go to first Corinthians 12 Jonah to first Corinthians 12 father we thank you for this day in

in their ministering and in coming back home and brother Louise for the bobbin in Lord and just bless each one we love you and we thank you remember the sick ones the different ones father and just touch each one got us now in Jesus name we may move up a notch or two in another message not be reading from this but it's fine to me I like to read what it says you only had a good thought about it verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord I love that Porter saying it don't you let's go to first Corinthians toyo to kind of pick up our thought for today brother Joe and him I gave him 30-something quotes and he said we're gonna try to get through that this morning I said I doubt that I don't know probably won't but we'll we'll see all right now let's read their Scripture and then think about what it's saying now concerning spiritual gifts this is Paul in the Corinthians talking to the Gentiles and talking about you know and they got these just going they got this going and that going and everybody had to have a sign and us song anything and he says now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorant you know that you were Gentiles cleared away with these dumb idols even as you are lay it were led her for I give you to understand and see he's laid down he's talking about the gifts he's talking about the spiritual gifts and the things in other word don't get all build up in it and don't be carried away by dumb idols and think oh that could lead from this type of gifts into that type of gifts to take you into the to the wrong thing and he says now I'll give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God Jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now Paul is emphatically stating did you know no man in other words you you can't say this about him you can't say that about him and then you you can in no way say that Jesus is the Lord except it be by the Holy Ghost okay now to try to back up a little bit to where we were Wednesday and I pray that you would listen to that message I've listened to it twice already and I wish you would I got kind of tickle some of you better be careful about you're shaking your head no because a lot of us on the internet you know you know go when we walk down the aisles it picks up them yes isn't em noses in there okay not kind of that's alright but now what were we talking about Wednesday trying to get settled into something and what we're doing is trying to comprehend why brother Branham would say certain things in a certain way you say well that's you trying to figure it out now if we say what he says and we let it be the point that he says it then you're going to have to argue with him about what it is all right because I'm just trying to to get it to a point that we won't read and say well he said this and he said this and he said this and we just don't know what he's saying because that's that's what I've told you you don't have to worry about preaching the seals and in Daniels 70 weeks and things like that to people that they're already confused anyway but the new birth is the most misunderstood doctrine that there is and that was Jesus's first doctrine which he must be born again all right it's the most misunderstood why because you know he said it I didn't he said it's over 900 different ways of people seeing it out Dyer within how many you got in the message you know that would go along with that of being confused about one little doctrine of you must be born again one little called me I said something one time to a person you know they said well oh I know they're suing so say because they don't cut the higher they don't want they don't wear pants they don't know that has nothing to do with the new birth that is after effects that's after thoughts that's things you should do without the new birth right without even the new birth women or look like women and men or to look like men without the new birth considering nothing about the new birth alright see but we put those things of the attributes instead of talking about the birth not concerning what is the new birth what is the new birth alright see did you say I cry don't know that's that's what happens after the baby gets here that has nothing to do with the birth itself except that it is an outward manifestation and now listen a dead baby is a dead baby and has no manifestation so then the Prophet said it it ain't got no life to it and ain't alive now I believe in manifestation I believe in all kind of signs and wonder that I do I believe in shouting and crying and speaking in tongues and all of the I don't believe that was was took away by anything the Prophet said I think he was a very emotional person at times but then there was times he was very settled and seemingly more into the later part of his ministry he was more settled why because he was so burdened of trying to get across to the people a simple little message of what is the new earth and than that away that's why I believe it and I hold to it that that none of us knew what the new birth was until this prophet comes all right we had this idea right we had that idea like I said brother Branham wasn't against emotionalism he was a very emotional person in that respect honor but he knew how to place it correctly get it correct and shout all you want to Boyd they say he said be careful how high you jump up he said word that you can walk straight when you come down right see in other words the life you live is going to prove what you are all right and see then that would would would put the things into order and don't ever get to point earth out on my brother Dale he was just a good ol here's an old Baptist and he don't believe in signs and wonders i I've told you my life story some of you even told yours and you know compares pretty good I've seen a lot of things in my life and I'm really a very emotional person but I don't let other people I don't use that to try to make you emotional I want you to be what you want to be and that's that's just the point all right now but what was we talking about brother Branham said he says your new birth begins when you believe now see we then we say well we're believing this now he didn't say believing was the new birth he said your new birth begins now what is the new birth we've already or should have established it enough into our hearts and minds to know that the new birth the Prophet will read it worse the revelations Jesus Christ personally use what is it born to gain experience what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's all one in the same that we're reading them in it but now you can start something here now when you start your new birth by believing that don't give you the baptism of the holy God so you can start see than you can say the born-again experience can start the day you believe but now remember what we brought out that you could also if you didn't go on and get sealed into the body of Christ that you could lose your confession lose your faith and wind up the Prophet I gave you one there Wednesday where he said that's the question they did about could it be this you know be the one he said yes said you can be a child of God one day and said be a child of the devil the next day now he's the one who said it see them because you could be a confessor today and walking in Christianity and the Thames and tomorrow out in the world drunk em everything in the book you know and see then you lose your confession and remember a point if your confession is right then your salvation is right see now and we should go back and listen Co in no way did I try to explain eternal life I gave some quotes brother Branham said on it and told you in there that I didn't understand why he used that statement like that other than the fact of knowing that most people talk about eternal life they talk about the new birth they Toma and he said you know he said you believe in to eternal life well I believe that I believe the day you repented of your sins because what is the new birth now justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth all right so a justification you're believing unto but that doesn't complete the birth see then you could use the born-again experience that justification sanctification but remember now the baptism don't come until you're justified and sanctified if it does it could be a just an anointed one we certainly don't want that part see if you stopped short of the correct channel was what I'm trying to bring Wednesday if you stopped short of that channel then your unbelieving I mean you're believing becomes unbelief and you you go right back to where dear really the Bible says that the unclean spirit goes out of a man it goes out of sanctification walketh in dry places all right said it comes back and find it swept and garnished it entered in and the person is worse then there was to start with because why because what is the profit they become religious right that's where you anointed ones falling that they become religious and he said that's was listen another night work on what is it and with it not I believe it we're brought around was describing how this lady was so horrible and think and do it but said this other lady was a Methodist or something and said she was telling her husband to look at her what she's doing over there he said but then she goes out every day puts on her short sometime gets out and cuts the grass he said as far as God is concerned both of the women looked the same but now he said that's why you can't tell her though and sold over in that message because she's anointed with the Holy Spirit and you can't tell her that church is one thing that I've prayed and prayed and I'm pray every day and cry out to God for some way for us to find the truth of what we are and where we are well brother Dale I've shouted I spoke in tongues out crowd I believe the mess hall all that's well and good but if the new birth is not there then what is it anointed ones see we're in the day where it's dangerous right well I know when I was there I know when the Spirit came on me well Elizabeth could say that when Mary said that she was pregnant and going to have a baby in his name with Jesus not just John receiving the holy girl and bow said Mary was filled with older they were people back there filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm not gonna call them anointed one I'm gonna say it's true I believe David was filled with the Holy Ghost when he killed Goliath and the buyer and the Giant and I thought yeah but that's not a new birth that's what we've been through and see so then the new birth until it's completed you do not have eternal life that's what I'm talking about Wednesday night I used some quotes that brother branham even related eternal life into it but it was only the reason fact that I put it out there because I'm not gonna be like these other preachers and just you know Wellington and I better leave that out you know you give me any quote and I'll I'll read it at least I mean I'll read it you know and you know do the best I can you know - on Wednesday night I said Billy Graham and I used it as two witnesses but I wasn't talking about talking about Billy Graham and all Roberts not talking about the two witnesses to Israel I hope everybody was understanding that that it was not talking about the two witnesses to Israel it was talking about those two they were chosen of Oral Roberts and Billy Graham all right but at least it pays you know and that's know you're listening you know but now think about it your new birth begins when you believe and see that would be when you repent of your sins that would be justification and then you could move up and you can top this with that or whatever and brother Brown says your begotten and sanctification so you could talk about the born-again experience because he the way I believe it in this age now than any other ages brother Branham would things alright and he would show that Luther nem just had justification but now I've always taught you I believe Luther's justification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now for Luther to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me say it this way were to be back in your lap if you think Luther didn't get the baptism with the Holy Ghost he only got justifications not in the body of Christ because you can't be in the body of Christ until you're born into the body of Christ by the new world see Luther's justification was the new birth which meant in his life do you think Luther didn't repent come on you think Luther didn't repent you think Luther didn't try to change things wouldn't it be justification sanctification and then when it struck him what was Luther's new birth well he's out there and he felt it and raindrops he didn't see what was Luther's new birth come on the message of the just shall live by faith was Martin Luther's new birth we're gonna get to it in a little while and come back over again right what is the new verse revelation of Jesus Christ person to you so wouldn't it be the revelation to East Church eight now you want to quote we do I can't there's never been I hadn't found a quote where brother Branham would call Luther on having a new birth you know maybe you found one but I hadn't found one related to exactly that but I do have one where he said Wesley in the message of the new birth of sanctification well see then if Wesley got the baptism when the if Wesley got the new birth then what did he get he repented of his sins he was justified he come to the message of sanctification he was cleansed and then he believed and he talked I've got his writings Wesley told that that baptism of the Holy Ghost was the sanctification you know what that's true it is the Holy Ghost that sanctifies you but the problem was there they related it to the blood let's see brother Branham then when you're coming through you said well you don't have a quote for this do I need a quote when a prophet says the new birth is justification same case in the baptism when old ago and he said everybody's born into the body of Christ has to be born in the body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so everybody come in - it doesn't matter what age you would be in hey it wouldn't matter what ages you're in it's the new birth of that age but it's related to where it comes into this age that you come into the three stages which is necessary because Luther had to just shall live by faith Wesley had sanctification but the Pentecostals had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth and brother Branham will call it exactly like the day of Pentecost see then you have to argue with him you're not arguing with me but the point of what I'm trying to say is are we believing the truth see then if we doubt the truth can I quote the Prophet he says that spirit don't agree with the word I thought that was the evidence what do they were do you agree with me or not but if I read the word you got to agree to that I mean you ain't got no choice Dyer well I don't understand why he I don't I just know we'll see now you're doubting him and see by doubting him you'll doubt God which is what I'm trying to say Wednesday night what your new birth starts when you believe but he's not completed even in the new birth of the time enough it's not completed at that time so you're believing on - well then you come to sanctification the unclean spirit going out all of us you're believing on - but then you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the new birth now you got it correct and you got where the Prophet said it's not God in three parts or whatever etc coming down and he said didn't the father give me this and the Holy Ghost getting he said it's Father Son and Holy Ghost coming in you at one time do you remember that Father Son and Holy Ghost coming into you at one time in the new birth well I don't believe that I believe I just got the Holy Ghost see you don't know what the Holy Ghost is it's one of the prophets said it he said if so been so miss miss interpreter or on not correctly taught until the people don't know what it is but I'm at least trying to take what the prophets said and try to get us stirred up in a way of understanding - word that we don't lock down on I've done this now anything you say you done he's got to be outside the new birth now if you're gonna count it I mean even your repentance cause the goodness of God leads you to it sanctification of the Holy Spirit working in you it's not nothing we do or don't do it's what he's already done and he imparts to you and I then we rejoice then we cry then we shout we're in the days of wind that people are just winning hundreds of millions of dollars on the lottery you know what you could have every one of them numbers right I don't know how many of you do what you do in my business I don't care just making a point you can have all the numbers right and you can line them up in front of you one eight ten one eight seven six if I you know line them up they could call you up and say yo well you got what I got for it be to be to be to be to be well you've won the lottery you got the lottery you don't want it you got the balls ladies brother whatever it takes then you start hollering right then you start rejoicing before then you had them in your hand you occurred them around we've for a while but you didn't know what you had but didn't it come to a place if you realize something took place I'm sure that would be the way wouldn't it today I mean this 1 million dollars I never played the lottery don't care about it but if they just walked in here today and handed out papers and said we're gonna give you this lottery ticket for a million dollars any of you take it and you know what they wouldn't be good now I can just see it you know some of you can run up scoop it brother Dale I've got an imported date I gotta go first thing you know the building to be empty all right so you get what I'm talking about evidences and things see the baby's got to be here before it can cry the baby's the birth the crimes not the birth the crime is a sign that life has entered the little fellers won the lottery in holler but see that don't do away because that's what people think see when I try to preach it in fact I'm doing away with your experience well he looked at me when he said that well good that means you're guilty okay saw the problem no problem solve the problem I look out for the congregation I always been in a way I don't never zero in on one you watch preachers and that's that's a pool I know what that is I know what it does you go to some places you preach your heart out and you'll be come on Aaron all right you'll be looking over here you try to go over here you come back over here you try to go over here you come back over here I fly that's the best thing do just lockdown on one side because there's word to pull that now don't do that I deliberately I got sir tickler old brother Don riddle I used to like to watch him over other Don ruddle he he'd back up and he backed off platform down it ladies were one time turned the whole thing over come heat back up and he'd come out since the kleva knows he'd come out and he'd have that Hannah but he'd never looked you now brother homer long over never looked you an eye he looks above the congregation did you see I learned a long time ago I look in the eye then you say brother Dale you look me nice that's good I looked everybody in the church at night so I'm talking about everybody do you think I'm talking about you yeah yeah yeah I'm talking about you come talk about everybody in the building okay solve the problem listen then if we believe that justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth for the age that we're living in time which was the new birth on the Susur Street which we have the same Holy Ghost that came under Zeus history in the new birth or we don't have it but now listen but when you're justify when you're repented and you start believing what do you brother Brown called it we gave it Wednesday night you potentially what's the potential you asked me for an oak tree I'll give you an acre you know how that oak tree but you got the potential of it you've got wanted to take to make it so if you if your justification don't get this and then we'll get on today's man if your justification is believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and it's true if that believe in will continue on following the word it'll go right through sanctification and believe in the work it'll go right into the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now listen what I'm saying so you can't have the baptism the Holy Ghost unless you have a stark there's everybody women you gotta have a start you don't just jump and run in the book and the Holy Ghost just Falls are you out in the yard the Holy Ghost just Falls no you're gonna have to go through justification sanctification baptism one whole girl called how would you describe a woman having a baby well you never know the man but she had two babies other day they used to tell that about a lady in my brother he was talking code he didn't believe in the virgin birth once a Methodist preacher and he's telling me one day he said why they were the neighbor down there he said she had a baby never known a man I see she lied that was all I said - I said she lied solves problem all right but listen believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved now if that believing continues own it will produce the new birth right the C Church I can go all the way one message I may do it some of this afternoon but I want you to think you realized it by believing on - that's the most marvelous thing could happen to an individual do you realize do you realize in a religious Society of what may be 1 billion I'm just saying it for a number maybe 1 billion proclaim Christians I mean you know whatever number you want to put there you may know what is it I'm just giving a number on me and it wouldn't make no difference but they're confessing Christians are you gonna tell them they're not Christians see that's where the people of this man sit on you don't believe this match that you're lost I believe if you have the genuine new birth it will lead you to the Word of God I believe that always believed that it led me there and I didn't even have it as a new birth I just had it at justification and sanctification I believe that because I know what God done for me and I know what happened and see then once you're getting it to the basis that if you believe that it's justification of sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and let me quote right around here said the life's three ages because he brought the ages down and he said the life story ages completed to birth huh see because it went through justification st. Kate's the baptism with old ago let's see if you're like a lot of people say it well say them then people who suits the street didn't how no Holy Ghost the run said he did may I quote you a quote from brother Branham when he was referring to those Pentecostal people in their beginning now if you want this and I'll be glad to find it he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord or rapture and when one word or the other he's one of the two guys either rapture coming to the Lord he said they were closer than we are all they had was gifts and signs of profit ever come on the scene or anything you know why because they were happy about what they had they rejoiced on what they had they were glad to say that they were Christians that Rotten Tomatoes thrown at him but there were Trinitarians but they still got the new birth well the ring called it's a new birth of the age what are we going to realize it's like I told you the the big brother that said there you know that he couldn't preach era he stood right down and goes wool and said that they're Zeus the street Pentecost was false and I brought the quote to him from brother Branham he come right here to the church and preach that Azusa Street was false no problem to me I'm not against him I told him down there I told my co brother Brad said that that this illusive street had the baptism and Holy Ghost just like the day of Pentecost see you think I'm against those fears no I love the people I'd love to to dissin grab somebody like that and just pack it in and enjoy it till at least something got down in them but that's up to them That's not me and you I ain't said he was lost I'm said he was misunderstanding the rental didn't say those nine hundred different beliefs of the new birth was lost he said there was misunderstanding you know the God went through the ignorant Bible says but you know the rest of that scripture has to come in this day he said but then he commanded all to repent see so we have no excuse now to say well if I don't have maybe I'll make this way over to no no I strive for one time if God wants me to be a foolish virgin that's his business I'm like brother branham I settled that a long time ago but around him I believe he meant it he said God wants me to be a happy she had a devil he said I'll be a good one so you better know what word says it's up to you alright but now listen your new birth starts when you believe and continues own will come out to the baptism because you don't get the baptism when you repent so it's not dividing up you get this when you repent the new bars and then you get the born-again experience and then you get the baptism I ain't saying that I'm just saying one thing you got a distance to go through from where you start to where they come to and it's finished by the Holy Spirit because remember now your disciples were justified and sanctified for three and a half years before they receive the baptism so there's growth developments in there where that scripture says being born again I know where it's placed in the pyramid we will get to that but you know what the day you really believe you're being born again because you're in a stage you're just like a baby that's eating and pushing out the more you eat the more you push out huh all of us done that pretty good I think getting away me and dad up I got some life but now listen you don't have eternal life the minute you believe but you have a confession alright now think about it as I was saying our moment ago think about a world think about just a million people in the world as Christians I'm sure we run into at least 1 billion I remember he used to be 500,000 Catholic that was 50 years ago no but now listen are you gonna say all that's lost remember the Bible says to be careful how you judge because remember the rest of that par phrase in the scripture what does it say you'll be judged by once you judge is that plain sense all right we say then people are lost well what about the foolish virgins they're believers unto they just don't get to possession of the Holy Ghost to come and live in them but they're believers untrue I'm gonna say something that's going because I just thought of it it's gonna click on you so listen you know that there no need one it is in a pretty good shape and let them sink a little I don't want to be anointed one why you don't want the Holy Ghost telling you you don't like his presence that's being on you no I walked a new part what I didn't say that I said I won't did Norton I mean oh brother Gary Atkins used to talk a lot you know no brother Gary he said it like this he said brother Dale if me and you and anointed he said we ain't too much anointed I said well I have to agree with you you know what see at least anointed ones are happy in their spirit they have much of dried off in trouble ooh lordy water I don't know I'm wondering what brother Dale trying to say he's been preaching on this for weeks now he's trying to get me to admit I'm lost not gonna admit I'm lost I'm a baby but I ain't gonna admit it well that's up to you that's up to you I'm just preaching the gospel but trying to preach it in the way that'll make you and I think about our experience cause anything you name Satan can personate all right we're trying to get into evening morning evening yeah anything you can bring can be impersonated you agree you agree that's the way the Prophet told it anything that you can think of Urdu or whatever could be impersonating but it's just one thing can't be impersonating and number one time it can't be impersonating now I know the quote sometimes we hold on the point he said he can't be the holy ghost we know that when he could be so close until he can have his own anointing and then you got to deal with the Anointed One falling in line so don't go that way what's the one thing that the devil can't do he can't bring the word word by word now you tell me anything else I just said it now prophet said he can't be the Holy Ghost we know that he can't be God we know that with everything down below though he can do anything he can impersonate any gift and run around and said he can even pass out supernatural gifts he said the devil could well I got this gift it's like I told one brother I said you know what's the problem were you and your girl he said what I said you letting it get in the way I still mean it I love him I still mean it is just getting away because gifts can get in your way because you can say well what do you mean now what do you what do they want me to do he's a dried bone dried ain't got no spirit about him no nothing he want me to act like that no no no I want you to I want you to be whatever God wants you to be I want you to shout when God won't see this guy cry when God wants you to cry the Prophet said a church without the gift without the answer to God I want to give let's see it wound up in do zakat all you got to do the word don't worry about - we're going correct everything he's that rider does the word correct the era and one brother he was you know was here and I'm not throwing off on him but he started speaking in tongues some of the people start saying well is he is he speaking in tongues that's a no he's speaking Spanish well that speaking into okay you know why I said that because I had talked to it and he sets up I said you ain't doing nothing in order look what I was putting myself on I said you ain't doing nothing the world was speaking in Spanish unless you got the people thinking you're speaking in tongues you're speaking in Spanish boy he got so mad he laughed well you know it must have been right what I said but you see we don't want to go with the world as straight as it is by the prophets message there's not a person in this world that does not have some way or thought about them to my Christian world about the salvation and want to have it you tell me you don't have a rule I'm gonna arguing I'm just telling you that you do you got something you relate to and praise God you need an anchor as I said Wednesday Drive it down and tell the devil right there it is but you see we believe unto eternal life all right we stopped it to end of the message by saying that we would get to the basis that we would bring out that the Bible says no man that Scripture we read and I told you you go in the message of the hour in the computer and you run in God is that you run in that scripture where it's talking about oh no man can say the Bible doesn't say no man can call brother Branham the biggest portion of his doing I think it's 24 times I believe it's right now it's more than that because I got that many but he used for that scripture he would say no man can call when the Bible doesn't say that reading I say those things because you go into the computer people to do and they well I can't find before they've like 4 times worth it says then if you can't say no man can say is used about 4 times others you can't it's the same word it's the same tall but I'm giving you that to where you won't run in there and see I do a lot of blocking of demons and there thank God I know how they work like I told you when we've got I first got the computer from from brother or Havilah you know and I bought the computer and the message and he give everything in me and Anna we went sit down for two or three days cause back then you just had these little dish and you put them in had to run them had to run them had to run him out to run it wasn't this one flop it in that's done it took us about two days to run that thing in and when we got through and I said run a search Daddy and let's see what it does I topped in SCR P how do you spell it a into your which one is right yeah into your ent serpent it's the RP a into you exactly spelling I topped ent every which one it was my top didn't come up 0 I said now I spent $3,500 and we got two days running this sucker in and how many times did brother Brown use the word serpent and I looked at me and said daddy it's a change of spelling okay I do the things to try to keep you from running up into something and then you back up and said well I can't find that you may not can find that you have to go some other way because brother branham had like he said no man can say and see that won't come up but then when he says no man can say it and it'll come up like four times or whatever I just give you that to save your time I don't sorry because I'm a human being you know what I'm sitting there in front of the computer thinking God how in the world can I explain this what can I do all right so then we get to the point that of what we ended up saying that we would deal today with the fact of the Bible saying that no man can call Jesus a cross are can say that Jesus is Christ except be by the Holy Ghost all right now all right then what are you saying then bro deal at justification you started your new birth or born again experience come on if born-again experience you know would be we use the new birth but we tell him at the morning any spirit knows what the morning experience what what did brother branham except described of Jesus talking to Nicodemus that you better be born by water and blood and time and he said that's justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the born-again experience all right now before in the early ministry or after brother Branham held one point he would always talk about justification sanctification baptism with Holy Ghost and that would be your new birth or would bring you to the baptism huh and when it does then it leaves us the basis that we've got to say that and believe it and like I said you can spend all day long trying to prove new birth and then this one over here the baptism and you can pull all you want to and study all you want to and sell you want to but when you come back to the point you don't come to one time your new birth begins when you believe you're born again experience begins when you believe but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not your believing the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when he has accepted your believing and gives you the new birth we call them come on what are we talking about Abraham what is this thing abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him and all the Baptist jump onto that you know all Abraham could do was believe these bread run said that's true that's true and that's right he said but God done something to Abraham said he gave him circumcision as a sign see he accepted to believing of Abraham and gave him circumcision all right your justification chopped off you pass in sanctification is the cleansing and setting aside but then the baptism is what God does when he gives you his own life to come and live in you now there's where the problem is actually what I've tried to explain for 40 years because see that sanctification of stage is the most dangerous place to ever be in your Christian experience I spent knowingly knowingly in this message two years Sirkin God for the baptism in the Holy Ghost I didn't come into it so when I'm in the message that's what brother told me one day he said you believe the Prophet don't see that's the other devil did too he believed him what you see you get into that sanctified stage and if the Prophet said it's like a baby be gotten into the wound of her mother he said it's wiggling muscles it's all kind of thing he said but there's no laughter and he was explaining it right no laughter he said then when the baby comes forth and God breathed into his nostrils it becomes a living soul all right in that sanctified state you can move in to an anointed one real easy don't you think Satan's right there when you try to make some commitment and do something don't you think he's right with you didn't he tell him in the upper room come on okay didn't he tell him in the upper room now who was it doing the talking we just say it was one of them cuz we don't want to name who - who right brother Ron didn't say we if it's one of them but what did that one of them motivated by you say oh no the devil wasn't in the upper room come on get out of it somebody said we got it right somebody said we got it one of them had to be smart enough to say wait a minute we ain't got what he said so we better hold off now who was that doing that the devil the devil in the minds of those people but when that Holy Ghost failed Satan just walked out because he knew that he was doing night because he could no longer get back in all right remember you're sealed in he sealed out yeah but today he said no he said do you'd have to go out to him you remember that one you would have to go out to him he said cause he can't come unto you so then I could go out to him in my spirit in my body and do a lot of wrong with that inward part with we've been through things okay listen so then we know for a surety I gave it to you so go ahead we'll use number one then we drop back to one eye okay we'll get a few of these we ain't gonna get nothing like what we need but number one I'll give you this one over and over it's free saving the other questions answered on the Hebrews and What did he say no by one spirit talking about we're all baptized into one body see that isn't when the nuber begins see the baptism and is on over the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus now see that's where we begin at right there alright now you know yourself church come on let's say it a moment ago how many confessed Christians are they in the world you know what most churches teach come out shake hands come up and make a confession come up do this do that read a quote do this believe this do it that's what you know speaking Thai legit told you about seeing him little kids or in Jamaica I'm honest I wanted to go down and pull that fella off of them little kids physically because he was saying come on song say it say it say it say that was in a different country you'll find out if you ever go to countries like them you'll find out you do not walk the way you want to walk no you're going out the door you say oh no that's it no all right now listen so what does he say so let's take one of them jump us away over Co we'll come back to it this evening but I want to read you 2 things 1 in 60 and 1 in 64 to show you that brother Branham can put the new birth the born-again experience and the baptism when the Holy Ghost in one paragraph and he's talking about one time the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost the born-again experience and it is all one in the same come on go ahead to 1a now which is the hidden no wait a minute hearing recognizing and acting anyone knows that the seal of God is the birthright another 1960 anyone knows that the seal of God is the birthright the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the birthright the baptism in the whole fee since 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption when you were born again he's gonna use birthright don't use baptism when you were born again or say excuse me when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the new birth we know that you're begotten of the Spirit I admit that but until you're born now he's missing right in one paragraph the baptism in the Holy Ghost the birth right the new birth the born-again experience just all in the same but brother so-and-so said they was different okay you you need to get up go with brother so-and-so and follow-on cuz I ain't got no problem okay look at the next one 1964 God's provided way for this day go ahead to number one be that's the way man how to do today not be herded in by some denominational coupe but come in the way God said come in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the nuber swarming revival not Church joining solicited from door to door and passing magazines but a birth being born again théo were the Holy Ghost God's Way freeing himself from the world right believing believing God's Word [Music] now brother branham i gave it to you in the church age book where he's talking about the Holy Ghost and the baptism and things let's see wait a minute I mean yeah I've got it that I didn't give him this one now this is the church age book page 144 Smyrna and church age I read this over and over to you but he's coming down explaining what's happening when he gives the services and they're already getting it getting it up so we will have to get or the last part of it come on up okay thank you man what's what he said this has caused a great deal of confusion because he'd given older call and people would come to the DAR and he's wanting them to come to be born again and he'd give an altar call and they've come to get him to speak in tongues and do this at another cause they had already thought is born again or believed it or done that so listen this has caused a great deal of confusion I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for the center to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the Spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one in the same so the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost the morning is written the baptism the Holy Ghost is one in the same now I've went through it over and over I don't you could say and I said it the new birth starts when you believe you're born again experience could start when you believe with the baptism don't start when you believe the baptisms when God accepts your believing gives you his that's the difference in it are they going to the next one 147 excuse okay we'll get that let me read this just leave that up Aaron we'll get to it 147 of the summer in church AIDS he said to understand this is to clear a twice tutors have never found Paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit filled he says never been fine they have inferred it is there and they have put their own meaning to it to make it say it but scripture does not say that Jesus never said it neither now we'll get to this one okay wait a minute number three okay we'll read this one hearing acting recognizing on the Word of God I wish you'd pay close attention to the years as we go along pay close attention to the years as we go along and you'll see that he's not changing his doctrine but he is and he's not correcting it cause he didn't need to correct but he's bringing it into line to word that it shows better it's like I've tried to explain to you the early part I got it in here explain the early part of road runs ministry he would explain the trial and being that's what body soul and spirit he did not use it in every case in a line of it but he was basically using it in 65 he says body spirit and soul he didn't have to correct it because he always gave his senses for the first man outside see taste fields fell in here second man is memory reason conscious affection the third man is the inner our center man we see the faith or doubt he didn't have to change no doctrines or thoughts but they were statements he made that made it look like because that's where you - so people come in and got - so be in the nature of the Spirit and etc etcetera that's where they came in at because they wouldn't put the soul as a sin around they put the spirit as a center in had that soul change remember the Bible doesn't say I'll give you a new soul I will said I'll give you a new spirit right anyone knows that's a seal of God it's a birthright didn't we read down there's a new bird yeah I think we doesn't read that okay we're ready don't matter and anyone knows that the seal of God is the burnt drop the baptism of the Holy Spirit these is 4:30 we ready whereby you sealed until the day of your Redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the new birth we know that all right you're begotten of the spirit of sanctification all right now I want to get about to right here and then we'll just quit till this evening okay hold on to your notes because here we're going to deal with something that and they don't have their they have TNA 10 a something that I've always taught and I still believe it needs more teaching that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a revelation the new birth is a revelation the born-again experience is a revelation if they're all three one in the same I don't care if you want to put one of them over here and one over here and try to work it through that that's your being it I try to work it through nothing I'm just saying they're one in the same then when you receive the new birth you get you get that baptism of the Holy Spirit you have a run around and said yeah I know it I've got to quote but listen to him enable rolled up a rock this is off the message of faith something made him a church or worship when when they will come and watch you he by faith faith is something that's faith isn't something that's imaginary thing I want you to get it faith is a direct revelation now Abel the point I'm sorting is here we start in the garden Abel starts by revelation right he didn't start shouting speaking in tongues and will rattle ouya he started at a revelation then he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood that's why he brought around the Express now watch him because I want you to get it faith is a direct revelation and if you only accept Christ as your Savior about an intellectual you haven't got it yet you cannot say that Jesus is the Christ until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to you now they're in it so we read a lot of what did Peter say when Jesus who said who demands out us on a man he said darting to Christ the Son of the Living God what did he say to Peter he said on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that and Bertrand said your church is built on Revelation right come on see intellectual faith boy if I only get that one point right now to go down home and Everhart I'm thankful for this place position right faith is not something mentally perceived but it is a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by his heart a revelation okay going to the next one we'll pick up a couple mineral quit their words to end be which is the message it is I you find that by digging through the eyes of the frozen thing you know God is a revelation it was a revelation at the beginning who told Abel that he should offer a lamb instead of Cain with the fruit who told drop down to bottom of it there's more than quote it's a spiritual revelation who Jesus Christ is he's nuts first person second person third person he's no person he is the person it's a spiritual revelation who Jesus is upon this rock God revealing not by learning by a word not by some Creed but by a spiritual revelation that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God that's revealed to you by the Holy Spirit can I make a personal point can I remind somebody that told me that they were standing in their kitchen and said a voice spoke and said that's one God you don't mind me say that he sister Gail something spoke and said that's one God now I'd rather have that as an experience than all the shouting screaming hollering signs and wonders dead raised sick healed I'd rather have that one little statement because remember what happened to Abel Cain had an intellectual right come on even I've heard pre-funded message and I rebuked him about trying to say it but that don't do no good they're gonna preciate it anyway the word the Bible said that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice since either Cain's sacrifice was excellent but Abel's was more excellent I said Cain's sacrifice spoke of works his salvation they eat no salvation in works they didn't change the person from saying that what you see Abel it was revealed to him he got a knowledge but not just a head knowledge because Kane's head knowledge was pretty good he was pretty good he worked itself to death he got turned on all they can do to bring in the fruit because he thought it was fruit and he offered the fruit and Abel says okay it's not to add said God spoke to me and said to go offer a lamb maybe God didn't say no more than able offer a lamb the rest of it was in maybe the thoughts of Abel when Abel said look something else got to happen then it wouldn't nothing mom and daddy ate it wouldn't know gifts and signs and wonders are speaking in tongues and shouting and crying he wouldn't none of that something happen instead it's revealed to me now what happened I'd rather have Abel's revelation and all the works of Cain because you know what I've always told you I'll just read it then we'll get back this evening what if I always talk to you we'll review and then start over again yes brother branham a question or the question was asking brother Branham what is the baptism of the holy spirit self cross the mystery of God reveal what is brother Branham the new birth you say well brother Branham what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church you shook a hand are you done something different you said a great you promised to live by a code of rules he is the word that was revealed to you and plenty more in there because you know I've been preaching it for a year this is 40 years ain't there's a hatch up you you'll say that I know the human mind you can comprehend a little bit but a birth of being a revelation and you can talk about being born again coming up through and you can kind of see a growth development by more revelation from God but the hardest part for the human mind to accept is that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a revelation brother branham told you the revelation it was a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not a group personally to you the new birth wasn't you sitting over here and me sitting over yonder and we both got it no we could have al but I'm you know what I'm illustrating the new birth the born-again experience the baptism of the whole to go like I said it's hard for the mind to comprehend the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being a revelation but now let me ask you this question would not it be a wonderful opportunity to be down praying one day or something standing in the kitchen moppet and just God comes down and reveals things to you just reveals it it's not that the way the Prophet talked about that he'd be sitting out under a tree in the woods hunting and he said it started coming in like 2 + 2 4 - but he said it just keeps coming in he said break in divisions he said but then sometimes it didn't break in division he said it broke into the scriptures and he sued scriptures would pour in now watch his point he said I would not know what the scriptures was talking about he said but I go get my book and take it and sit down and he said in other words he wondered why I wrote that he said then here it comes why would you not be wondered why would it not be a wonderful thing to think about living in a world of Revelation how many of you I'm not asking you raise your hand or anything I'm asking you to think how many of you have had a revelation that something just come to you now did somebody out talk to you argued you but something just come to you and said just simply that water baptism is correct in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you ever had it to happen like that just have you ever had an experience of something being revealed to you were up in the garden one day and something had happened years ago in a situation and we were picking stuff out of the gardener doing something and the subject came up about to thought what we're dealing with and I said this will take place she said it will never take place I said if it don't take place I will resign from the church many of you willing to do that it took place the way I said it ain't talking about a good thought you know what I mean no words you come up is sorry about this musicians come up you come up and you get people up Donald four and they come around and pray for somebody and somebody goes walking out we're blessed God it was my prayer that was heard if I hadn't have been up there they wouldn't never got it it was my prayer well you know what I'm gonna tell you up front that wasn't our prior I draw the house son little kid you ever seen this do it and we ever took a prayer cloth and placed it around and let every man woman child a little bitty kids I said little bitty kids you take that and pray over it the movie the kids might be able to touch God you know what it might be theirs but if you come up to the point where there's me I done I done I've done within you know right real quick you didn't do it because that is something different it's not God but why don't you just walk out sometimes and just put it to the basis is saying this is the way it's going to be if it ain't you know I'm just gonna quit you ain't willing to put it your life on the line of what you believe they put the gun against your head you ain't know how time to think it over the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now listen on downy Chrysler mr. what'd he say he said revealed to the most illiterate person now what would be the most illiterate person you know we will try to figure nothing our just making a point but if that person is so illiterate until you just think they're nothing we yet today in their little hearts they may be 90 years old they may be with her little old heart in that little old heart that says Jesus saved me and God drops down and saves that little person would it be a little kid or would it be a 90 year old adult with just a Mon you madam ability to think you know what God can come on the scene and save them now here's the point where zone wins nice Oh hold it I said if you believe and it start believing don't stop cuz it'll come out to the right thing right it'll come out to the baptism with all to go well you know what it can come out to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's right here at faith you know you better not stop believing we got a long journey to
