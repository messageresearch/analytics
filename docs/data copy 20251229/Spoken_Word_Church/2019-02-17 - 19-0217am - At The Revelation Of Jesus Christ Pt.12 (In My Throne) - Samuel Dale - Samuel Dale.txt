appreciated amen remember now the Bible study be the first Saturday 6 o'clock remember that we will discuss the parties if necessary to have that or that or just announce it across pulpit the offices and the things ok we'll meet at 5 o'clock on that first which would be March the 2nd ok and that way we would discuss all the offices and all of the things and and kind of lay out a point of understanding if you're not able to come we'll make a tape of it but it'll be held for our church part not for anybody else because nobody else's business what we do in the the things that we're doing but we appreciate it alright father we thank you for this day in your love and we thank you for your grace and truly you told us your grace is sufficient so we believe you we think you just have you weigh you come on the scene today and speak to our hearts and let your love and grace be with each one forgive our sins and just lead us into thy grace and goddess teach us to wait upon you we love you in Jesus name I mean first Peter 1:13 we've been on this now the Lord willing I said you know how that works out I said the Lord willing we'll try to wind up this series on this and the revelation of Jesus Christ this coming Wednesday night we'll try to bring it to a close so if you have any questions points or thoughts you know write them down and turn them in if you can before Wednesday night because what I want to finally put a final climax on true the point of what we've been talking about and it will be covering the son of man all right so that's where it will be coming down to to see I'm gonna try to if you'll watch the message just one not run through it and I'll tell you what I'm gonna preach Wednesday but then you know we'll go back slower to to do the other thing so just watch what's what's happening I try to do that to make you to work that you'll think about something and then when I say so oh yeah I remember that I remember this you know and that way we won't have to spend so much time trying to emphasize points and thoughts okay father we thank you for your grace and we love you now bless your word in Jesus name we're gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now remember that's our point that's been our thought for 11 messages on the revelation of Jesus Christ okay now we'll go over to this day in the overcomer to this age which is revelation 321 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame him and sat down with my father in his throne either have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you may be seated the Lord have his way with the message we trying to get the point across been driving it all the way through and getting into the church ages and I hope this will bring a thought to you that will help you to understand wage approach to the CEOs and the things like that because now it's not a direct quote but it's it's in there enough to where we will be able to use the point or I'll make it for my own self either either way doesn't matter but you see that lamb has to come forth to take the book right now where does it come forward from so that'll be our point this coming Wednesday to try to mold all of what we've been talking about into a one point message and try to express it to work that we can see hey we've got a visitor with us yeah hey she's the little one with us John and my grandbaby we appreciate her being with us today Amen but we're trying to get the point across because it said the the lamb has to come from some work where does it come and then we said well well that's nothing Jesus is the lamb that's all right but how does it come forth into this day because you know we need to know the hour that we're living and what we're doing okay and that'll bring forth the thought okay now to not spend much background on what we've been talking about but to say this the point that each age we cover to how the each age had an overcomer all right there's an overcomer in each age all right but remember that the overcomer of each age inherits now I hope you listen to what I was saying on that you know because it's not just if we get one thing because we're in this age and this one gets another thing called this in that age it is a characteristic or a thought to that age or a point of understanding of that age and all right there's a you know it deals with each age as an as a the Bride of Christ of that age will remember all of it then comes down to this age that's why they without us cannot be made perfect see it comes to this age and this age then will inherit all things but that doesn't mean that back those back to God don't inherit see we all inherit all things according to Revelation we went over about 21 somewhere in there were he says we in her at all times all right yeah see that away you say yeah but there's no I'm talking about eternal life I'm talking about the basis of Christianity talking about like oh there's one brother brother if it's the 11th hour people remember the 11th hour people they get the full day the full pay just like the others get right so now that's what we're trying to emphasize the word is not going to be one age one people over here well you don't have as much as we do now you're not gonna be there can I say it that away with that attitude that thought you're not going to be there I think if it's all coded wouldn't matter to me harder where I get to sit and we we covered it emphasize it we're brother Brennan said how can I overcome he said it's not on my throne but in my throne yeah it's not going to be because there's just one according to revelations for will read that Lord willing Sunday I mean Wednesday revelations for it comes to throne one on the throne you say yeah but don't you think that would be said now we're not going to sit on the throne like that form of thing like here's a it'd be impossible if you had a king and you had his subjects right you would have a king with a great big throne nobody else is sitting on it his subjects that are entitled to think are off to the side of that sitting around right okay but that's not sitting in that chair that position does never to be no one sit there but the Lord Jesus Christ himself no he's the only one that has any right to sit on that throne okay so then the prophets right when he said it's not all the throne but he said it's in the throne all right in the throne is in the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth the kingdom that Jesus spoke of while he was here and bringing it down and bringing that to show a kingdom a domain a kingdom right alright see then it's to sit in because that way each one of us will be seated in the throne and when you see it in Revelations which we probably drop off from five because five is actually the opening to the seal so I don't want to go that far I just wanted to go into chapter four and pick up the point because that way we can sit in his throne in the baptism of the holy ghost right so that's not sitting on the throne he's emphasizing that because as I said now you just think of it they can't be but one King well where the Queen we've sent with him we're not the Queen never set on the throne she says beside of him that's fine she's got her own place and position that's fine but she don't get on the throne with him because I'm just naturally carnal and stupid I know that would you realize how many millions of the Bride of Christ would be had to be sitting in one room and I'll just make it to where you can think about it is sensible the King has his throne and his subjects are all around him so that way it doesn't matter to me where I said let me have the least in all of the plain but just let me sit in this because listen to sit in is throne you don't have to wait till that day now if you're thinking of sitting on this throne you're waiting for something else then you have to wait till that throne comes into being right but if you're sitting in his throne you realize this already and call this the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you the hope of glory all right now does everybody follow the point so it's not only strong it's in his throne okay now that way the new birth is in every age it was the Holy Ghost in every age the prophet Gil honor ever age had the message every age had the overcoming part sure all right it was in each age it was all the way down so it's the Holy Ghost in every age now all right we have to say this because it's truthful but hard to explain how can you degree the the ghost I mean can you count the ocean and get a spoonful you've got the same ingredients right are you with me you got the same ingredients it's just according to the amount all right now I know and understand that or hope I do that like Luther names who are they there were Trinitarians they were were believing things that were wrong we get they're part of the body of Christ you can't put them out because of that given the new birth to each age alright see then as you've given the new birth then that age will stand forth and be the correct thing because I know I'm Coronel in my expression but there's something about it when I do express it you can't express it no other way because if he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that had put him in more in the middle and it would any horse else that's his carnal as you're thinking so I just think carnal William tell you that don't work it simply means he's a never Church age he's happy to be any he was just as happy to be in Luther's age he is he is in this age are the first age all right is that clear enough to keep our point okay now did you just pick up a little little thought because that's what we want to do because we're talking about in his throne all right now brother Branham says God came in three sons names all right no I know he came in three in four titles you can pick that up but he came in three sons names all right and then that is son of God our rivers technically starting son of man son of God son of David that's the three sons names that he comes in to manifest he came as son of man to fulfill the scriptures because the prophets were called son of man right Jeremiah and all of them son of man okay now they were not the son of man they were a son of man all right because he is the son of man okay now that solves that problem that we don't have to worry about what this and that is we try to know that it's just get the straight story the Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ a son of man is a prophet in the set aside for the brain of the word for the time and the ages and the points to be brought all right now but think about it he came in three sons named because that would be the correct order the son of man prophet come in that form to give his life was more than just a prophet right that's why he never referred to himself as son of God he always referred to himself as son of man because he was fulfilling the office all right according to John what at 1:14 and the Word was made flesh all right now so he was the fulfillment of the word as we'll get to in a minute where the Prophet I wish you I wrote it down I wish you would read this or listened to the message called birth pains then you wouldn't be confused when I make a statement like this to say the prophets gave birth to the word because they were the word of their age they gave birth to the word what was that one day that word stood on earth in human flesh called the Lord Jesus Christ all right now so then watch the point now and listen and as I said I'm going to put it in the message but I'm not going to express it so then would it not be then that the church ages would give birth if the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus Christ the Son of Man would it not be that the church ages would give birth to Jesus Christ again that's one of the things that people this message is not looking at they only look at it as this or that or that point or this point they don't look at it that's the prophet brought it see then that way the church ages will give birth to the Lamb so I said you're you're not listening to try to understand you're listening to refute because now where are you gonna put this on a man because you only have three sons named you have son of man which was the Lord Jesus Christ and on the earth and the thing and may I say this is a point I thought he preached six seals in Matthew 24 I thought he was the Lamb that John says behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I thought that was the way we need to do so then that lamb has got to be the same Lamb that takes the book okay see that's where we got to hold that point and then we'll drop back to it Wednesday to emphasize a lot to go with it all right now three sons name he comes first to redeem the bride he comes second like it's a rapture to take away his bride he comes third with his bride Ken Queens they've caught into the Millennium all right now three sons names now how are you going to fit that how are you going to express that because you got three sons done these son of man down to seven church ages he's son of God now these are laying here if you need them your prophet said it if you know the message then no and then son of David all right now I'll ask this question and I've been at it for 40 years so this is not new how does he go from son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the church ages to the son of David in the Millennium now can you do that well if David is Jesus Christ brother branham said physically a human being sitting on the throne in the Millennium that son of David and it's easy to understand how you can go from Son of Man the Son of God because son of man was God made manifest in the human vessel the Redeemer the The Book of Ruth you know the kinsman redeemer and he had to give his life and He gave His life to be able to release what was within him he didn't have to give his life because they said he gave his life because the that was within him now watch what I'm saying so listen carefully and don't misunderstand me as he was walking on earth he was son of man when he gave His life that release that Holy Ghost that was within him right and that could come back on the day of Pentecost the new birth that's why it goes to son of God the Jesus didn't say was son of God he said he was son of man that was his earthly ministry and what he come to make manifest not to just die that was part of it when he came to release that life life that was within him to be able to come back on the believer to give that believer the new birth and put that believer in in the new birth in the kingdom in the Father's throne he's a human father strong yeah in the father's strong because the Father's throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm reading these if you want to father's strong is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus said there in the revelation sit with me in that's red-letter that's him speaking right sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and sit with my father in his throne all right watch the Father's throne it's the baptism with the Holy Ghost but that's not Jesus is throne that's why he couldn't grant to that woman that wanted one of her sons sitting on one side one the other because it didn't belong to him the kamon listen his throne is the son of David his throne is the son of David which is the promise that he would sit on his Father's throne in the baptism of the Holy Ghost right because he's released the life and that could come and he comes and lives in us what do you have in you by the new birth that's where the Trinitarians really don't like us that way because they don't like me saying it I did see you realized the new birth in you gives you Father Son and Holy Ghost dwelling inside of you know I've just got the holy spirit more your good Trinitarian Father Son and Holy Ghost is the same Lord Jesus Christ so you have within you the new birth Father Son and Holy Ghost Laura because that's what it makes manifest in the you know try unity not Trinity of God all right now see them to come as to be how can he get to the Millennium you know from the son of God and how can you get to the Millennium simple question waves already emphasized this in the seals whatever shows our redemption shows Israel then whatever shows Israel's Redemption shows our Redemption alright so it's a beautiful picture brother branham did this did he make this statement he said the Book of Revelations he said it's acts of a play the Book of Revelations we look at it as symbols and get all blowed out escape and don't understand he said it's the acts of a play now when we get to Revelation 4:1 where brother Adam says the lamb comes forth takes the book climbs up on the throne and sets down what did the father get up he said comes the one on the throne Polly said that he comes forth comes around takes the book climbs up on the throne and sits down and said I'm the one that did is that going to move the father off and shove him off and no it's the acts of a play it's manifestation of those not many beings but the one being in many manifestations so we're looking at the church aging so it's it's easier said to follow then the son of man gave His life he never declared himself to be the Son of God his weight kept emphasizing on the day we see Jesus never saved one person while he was on earth do you go to that man hanging on the cross and only said but just remember he had to go from that to son of God to carry him with him the son of man couldn't cure that thief with him no son of God had to so he had to release the life are you following me then he said brother day well we understand this do you understand so he goes from son of man the Word made flesh the next step is a manifestation of the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will be that down through 7 Church ages and then Jesus goes to his own throne the son of David called his only three sons name then how can we do that well I mean we just go holy he just go yeah you're not you're not listening you can go from son of man to son of god by him releasing his life okay but you can't go from son of God the Son of David the co son of David is a human person sitting on the throne your prophet said in a human body there is no place statement of porn or cult listen to my statement now there's no place though statements or anything from the prophets message and the Bible that brings a physical Lord Jesus Christ I said it to a minute physical listen he's not here in corporal body we meet him in the air he'll be a corporal body in the Millenium we meet him in the air he does not come here physically so there's no scripture point out of the prophets message to try to bring that son of man and wedge it back in some way and be careful how you would even try to do it because if you make brother branham Dee son of man he said you'd make him an antichrist he's a son of man to make known decent of man it has got to be a son of man he's got to come back to son of man in the last days be careful how you bring him back like I've always said you have no writings you have nothing appalled petering them trying to explain you got Matthew Mark Luke and John with the Lord Jesus on earth and him saying I'm the son of man Paul Peter and out of them and their writings nobody mentioned the son of man jumps over to John yeah listen there's John in the Book of Revelations ever talk about the Son of Man he talks about 1-lakh Under the Sun man because there's no corporal there's no physical when he released that life dire on earth that made way for the son of God right brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost into being now how are you going to get the son of David into being you've got to have the Son of Man to come back right it's got to be there there's got to be there are certain way yeah pull it over stop that so what I said I'm taking it to trying my best to get you for one time to think about what said and listen and ask God to reveal it to you because it's too late you remember when we stood here years ago and I asked you about the son of God when did it come into being and all of you answered and said it came into being 2000 years ago on earth and I said you're out of the scriptures you don't even know what you're talking about they defended 99% of the people in domestic I mean in the building here because they thought I was thrown off on them okay take it that's throwing off on you don't worry about it cuz I ain't trying to satisfy you I'm trying to satisfy him I said you talk about son of man because that was right in the 80s when then the message people started talking about son of man called brother so-and-so started preaching son of man I told you I said you're going at it wrong son of god was spirit God son of God is the first part that come out from God the low cost is theophany and even Scofield and him called it the word the low cost the theophany them they called it the son of God that's why Peter when he said who do men say i the son of man am he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Peter asked him I mean Jesus asked about the son of man he answered about the son of God because that was all that could be answered that was all anybody knew but in a nod none of you writers the great Apostle Paul never mentioned son of man come on church here comes a prophet in the last days that about 47 might have been 49 I seem like the first one I found son of man was 49 but it doesn't matter what about 49 here comes an illiterate Mountain hillbilly right no great college education snow degrees no no theological training and he starts talking about son of man and his whole emphasis of his entire message is based on the son of man when he was just trying to tell us who he was he ain't this on a man he never was the son of man he's a son of man making manifest the son of man that's pretty close but it still gotta and still like I said don't get up on the throne and claim your right to say I'm sitting on the throne with him now they but one on that throne they ain't but one D son of man it doesn't say in the scriptures you know a son of management is always decently as the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right through the church ages according to this God changed his mind through the church ages he has been son of God in the Millennium he'd be son of David sitting on the throne but between this time we find out by the scripture he is revealing himself again that son of man look a prophet because it had to come from a prophet we'll get to that Lord within Wednesday the unveiling of God then after the Holy Spirit comes he was then the son of God God is a spirit he was the Holy Spirit son of God he lived through the church ages as son of God now in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David now Goodwin and remember between the son of God in the lady you see in church a they put him out and in Luke he said he would reveal he would be revealed again a sort of LAN the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it of death what does he do now return as son of man then from that son of David see how close we are son of man son of David son of God he's revealed and in the last days as son of man according to Malachi 4 all the rest of the prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church after thee they put him out he he's at the door knocking now we've got a key they said I won't leave this thing because I know what the danger of the point and I'll emphasize it heavily wins did you can't go from son of God the Son of David you said well why not because your prophet just said it now are you gonna believe him they didn't real regardless about me you can say well brother Dale just emphasized inside of there now are you gonna believe him he comes back to wedge in this life days in a specific point of the lady of sin church age showing that he's gonna come back his son of man just for a little while he's gonna be on earth that's none of man sure that had to start with a prophet called his a prophet there would be no way for us to understand it without him a prophet comes to introduce the prophet the Prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham was not the prophet he was a prophet Jeremiah was not deep prophet he was a prophet now you getting it straight did he say we got to keep those things right he said that's where people couldn't understand it and they missed it you can't keep straight son of God son of man son of David you can't keep it straight without a revelation cause you see it's easy to go from Son of Man the Son of God by the releasing of his life made away but down through 7 Church ages and this is where you're gonna have to get away from your ideas that we ain't got nothin ain't nothing going on you're gonna have to get to the basis somebody somebody is going to become the word none just to pick up see if I found out okay let's just go ahead with it the he's sitting now on the father strong spirit that's what the Book of Revelations shows one sitting on the throne that's the father strong that is not his throne that's the father's from his throne is the millennial reign okay you need that go ahead with number five which is the third seal where he seated now but that's not his throne he did overcome us you'll sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and how sit down on my Father's throne that is not his throne that belongs to the Spirit God Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him he's the Incarnate God this is the same God okay are you treating him what is the father's from baptism with the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ came into the world as the son of man the Word made flesh verse 14 he released his life to where it could come back into and prepare the father strong because that's what he come to do he didn't come to reveal himself am i in the scriptures who did he come to reveal who did Jesus come to revealed the father he said I and my father are one he come to make manifest the father in that he would give up his own life to come back on a dead Pentecost and that baptism of the Holy Ghost is so vital until how are you going to the Millenium are you gonna do it trying to find one specific thought we got to hear some more okay we're over on number 19 so you know we're a long ways over and when the son of man this is off of the mighty Garden unveiled before us and when the Son of Man is being revealed the son of man in in the church again in the church again revealed in human beings not son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he's promised that in God's promises what about it Church what about an ability now to do what the theologians no one had any thoughts about how are you going to go from son of God to the Millenium you theologians your people your your teachers your denominational hierarchies they know nothing of son of them sort of man right the best they can do was down in Florida they had a group down there not too many years ago that they claimed was a melech high four right where is any of them teaching anything that can get us anywhere I'm gonna hurt your feelings go ahead where is it in the message that it's ever been talked to you how you can go from son of odd - son of David well I didn't know we had to go well did you know you had to go from Son of Man the Son of God did you know that was the vital thing that was in the scripture that God came to give his own life the word could come and live in you and as I said if it's true that the prophets gave birth to the word then the seven church ages has to give birth to the word I thought she was according to Malachi 4 she was to give a new birth she's to be delivered of a new birth that's why I asked you to read birth my she's be delivered of a new birth from according to Monica forward according to Malachi Force used to give a new birth who the bride what is he gonna do she's gonna birth the word now I hope I don't have to Express over and over unless emphases we place in this church upon the basis that brother Branham was the prophet that God used to bring the message and it's not looking for somebody else brother Dale or brother anybody who or what to bring a message to change us I hope that's settled if it ain't you need to find you another church is that plain enough because you know where I stand without this message there's no hope but without this message reveals there's no hope if you heard anybody just ask you a question how are you gonna go from son of God to son of David well I didn't know I needed to go where you do now it's time to get settled down and believe or either we might as well get up and just throw it up and forget it this is not new for me this was the first thing I preached in 1969 and you don't like for me to say that but that was the first sermon I preached was the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man these notes coming off of this is taken right out of the front of my Bible because I believe then the Prophet was right sure we could look for Malachi 4 remember that's more to Malachi 4 then just brother Branham coming oh there is yeah what about number 22 Christ revealed Christ as the mystery of God revealed the word and God is the same in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last days and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning I didn't say it he said it that the head and body was to you not to bring the message now brother Branham brought the message yeah that's what I'm saying you're not listening you're not studying the message to find Christ what about go 224 the oneness of the unity someday then when the Church of the Living God someday we'll be united under one great head and that will be the head of God God into the unity of the body of Christ will be the governor and King and Lord over the entire church under his control then she will be received up when the head and body you're not do you see why we've been here 50 years since the going of the Prophet because you can't get people to realize what they need what do you mean we study the message we have you've been looking for something ever since I come in this message has never been a goal no a moment to me that's why I tell you that I've been in a revival ever since I come in this message a revival in my heart for the opening of God's Word than to read and believe what your prophet had to say to one someday we'll be united under the great head and that will be the head of God God in the unity of the body of Christ will be the governor in the king what is the lie still morphe of God to the Gentiles you say Jesus was the last in Morphy your oneness because that's what they believe they believe Jesus was the last in morphe I don't agree with that the bride of Jesus Christ is the last in morphe in her the Prophet said masterpiece and me you won't in her will be the fullness of the Godhead bodily in her not in one not in one person in her the church mighty God unveiled before it's number 19 how about deity veiled in human flesh and when the Son of Man is being revealed the Son of Man back in in in the church again revealed in human beings not son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that God's promises what about it down got at least a little hope maybe you don't take what I'm saying I'm saying you gotta have something to be able to wedge in between so no God and son of David your prophet told us what it is it's his message it's not mine it's not yours our brother so and so we're just he's put around them some message but it has to be given birth by bride because that will bring the son of man back in to be because now I'm going to make a few statements another something brother Branham is a son of man he cannot be the son of man now you're gonna make a statement during your mind so be careful you're gonna say nobody can be the son of man I'll agree with you but let me ask you if you're gonna agree with me how about the entire body of Jesus Christ being the son of man because no matter what age you was in your the Word made flesh Martin Luther was the Word made flesh for his day John Wesley was the Word made flesh for his day you and I are the Word made flesh for our day leave out anything and you don't have the fullness of the Godhead bodily and brother Owen said that the Godhead is not complete what without you or me because we're part of it brother Dan we don't we don't hear you we hear your words but we don't understand your language that's what the scripture said they heard his words but couldn't understand his language paraphrasing that so it may flip-flop it's in the scriptures but listen we've got something to do Church this is not just go to church and be good and do this that or the other and we have something to do to become the word to become the word the prophet has brought the message we're not looking for another messenger no but he is not the son of man with the bride as a whole now listen then you know what that makes him part of the bride will you listen you believe read a random words a born-again believer you receive you believe he received the baptism the Holy Ghost then you burn was born into the body of Christ then the Godhead is not complete without him but it's not complete without you when you talk strange you say things that are hard to understand well it's because you don't listen right why can't you believe what you are did the prophets say when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for what do you say that you build an invincible army Satan won't be able to stand against you then you realize where you're at in the work about it recognizing your day in this message what part of this are we to be we can find all the other ages in the times though can we find our own time you see as a whole as the Bride of Christ we are decent of man yeah but wait a minute now you met you wrote on I wrote it up deliberately we are not a son of man the bride of Jesus Christ is not a sauna man she is his body which is him made manifest in another form called the bride she is the son of man what about trying to explain that in 69 she see son of man the Word made flesh because we sit in and is strong not trying to get on his throne not trying to be something like that we're just taking what we are and saying thank you Lord brother though that hasn't made you exalted - thank you preach back there that no it's made me glorify the Lord Jesus Christ because he showed it to me didn't that's why I have no problems with the seals the Daniel 70 weeks the marriage and divorced three destinations why because he's revealed it you remember the other day when I said that I have no fear I have no fear of not being right because I'm following a message that was vindicated and doing the best I can to stay with it yeah but you don't believe this don't believe that come let's talk you know yourself you ain't never faced nobody they put together the thoughts about the tents and all the return ministries and all of that and put it together in one way to say what brother run said was right you believe in return ministry sure do what is dead is gonna be raised and then we've got a 30 40 day period of time that we will have a revival you're gonna set around the end like you do now well I don't know what reaching the truth or no I think God I've never rode so-and-so said that wouldn't it's like I was sitting in a meeting just the other day and I got so tickled then go tonight with water or what I said beside his brother he said here and that's why they're they're teaching that stuff about not angel coming at the end of the age I disagree cuz of you know what I knew where he got that from were from here in the tapes but he didn't listen brother branham is the one that said the angel come or the messenger comes to him today I didn't say that he did he didn't offend me didn't I just grinned god I'm walking off cuz I thought I ain't gonna make no see now you're from nobody and that's not right come on musicians think on these things are you sitting in his throne our own his strong well I got quotes brother brother sit on amen and I got a quote where he said it's not own it's in so when he says on I translate that to N what do you do cuz we don't you got him in direct contradiction well if you translate it to n you ain't got him in contradiction you got it right that's what's so amazing to me is this message is so beautiful but to the people of the message it is mass confusion because brother Ron will say something then you say something you just say this and you say that and they'll say well which one's right and then a dummy like me come along says both of them you just ain't listening to what he said well we know what he was as a human being he made mistakes in his speech sometimes he was a human being it taught things wrong had to correct it right but be real careful how you got him correcting you might find out he was right and yours getting corrected not be the pointless Mustang where we got real let's sing that course Lord willin wins we will try to bring the message to a close but until then think about it some of my years here [Music] he is here holy holy I will bless His name are here and we will only go listen cleaning in his lineage through the Shalom I heard him calling your name you wanted my bra [Music] you can touch him you will never be the safety rules raised here ah [Music] yeah yes here Hey anybody have any [Music] holy holy I will bless his name again he's here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is give you touch him you the city is a little yeah yes mr. hey whatever they hold [Music] that's where he [Music] can touch him we're in the act to the play you remember Nance brought a random a question there in Revelation 5 he answered it wrong he said said that's not the bride little-bitty combined he said there's something wrong something wrong somebody sit and read your question again you read the question he said I was wrong he said that is the bride he said yeah but brother dad we've always heard you talk that throat he goes up and here's the part list he goes up the bride goes up revelation 4:1 and not seen to the 1921 that's the direct quote from the problem but just remember you're not see he's not seen on earth that Christ is not seen on earth that can be seen in heaven because that was the question they asked you know and he answered at wrong because he was just like all the rest of us thinking for one goes up that's it I'm sitting the home that is the bride and glory [Music] see it's the Word of God men alive in their hearts and life father we just tried to lay down a little bit where we talk about it later so you just be with us give us understanding less weight today as he studies the minister unto us and give us the words that you have for us to hear we know that your word is true forever settled in heaven help us to follow therein we love you and we thank you God each one of us in Jesus name you dismissed remember probably one for another [Music] is here Hey yes here [Music] glass is me again he is here listen closely hear him go out your name he is here and you can touch him you will never be the same oh he is [Music]
