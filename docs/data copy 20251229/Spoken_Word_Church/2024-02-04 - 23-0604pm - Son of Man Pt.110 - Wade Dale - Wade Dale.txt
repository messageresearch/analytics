couldn't have it on July 4th so we're having it July 1st and 2nd brother juel forny will be here Saturday we probably going to have it at about 6:00 and then Sunday will be brother Mike altig will'll have one service and we will have have a catered meal afterwards where's my sister Anna did you not yet okay well we've got a few weeks but there'll be a um it'll be a catering truck that'll be outside and usually in July what do we get together and do at hamburgers and hot dogs and stuff like that so we're not going to have steak and potatoes we're going to have hamburgers and hot dogs and and and stuff french fries and all that but you'll get a um a list of what they have you'll place your order for you and your family and then they'll call you your name out and you come and get your stuff and then come back in here and eat because it'll be a trailer out here that way there's nothing inside here they'll be outside in the parking lot so we're going to try that and see how that'll work a little bit more festive for July the 4th and it will take off the sisters too they'll be cleaning all that up out there we'll just have to keep clean what's inside so remember that that'll be July the 1st and second and I know some of you going to be going to byc which is fine we do a lot of things for the kids and we want to make sure the kids get taken care of all right so and then also July 14 15 16 we'll be at brother Andre heads uh there will be church service here also but sign up if you're going for rooms that we can get to accommodate everybody and remember that Wednesday night brother Aaron will be speaking for us so all mind's clear everything good U appreciate you listening this morning I I I that was all said from my heart it it's it's something that I like to do I like to have fellowship and and just to reiterate what I was talking about you know if you take a church that's real small and there are small churches around us they can't afford to have things okay they can't afford to have a special meeting cuz I'm telling you a special meeting cost money I mean when we feed a hundred people and don't charge you anything but it comes from your tithe and offering it comes from from uh you know brother Dell not taking all the tithes like some people do but small churches can't afford to do it so I I I just kind of took it as a burden on myself that we're big enough to where we can absorb some of that and and give a meeting where people don't have to pay and and like the the U the The Father's day trip and all these other trips that we take we try to invite people to Fellowship we want we don't want to be a a commune or a or a cult or or someone you know off on an island by the S we want to Fellowship around the word of God and we need fellowship and even those small churches that can't afford to do that they need Fellowship too so if we can get them to come in here and and give them a you know a place to do something that won't cost a lot of money or cost any money then I think the Lord will bless us he's already blessed us with the finances to be able to do it and brother d always been so just free with letting us do um things for people and um we appreciate that because some places can't do it like I said but I appreciate but we do need to if we're going to be able to do that and we're big enough church we ought to be able to all pitch in and not be everybody one person's responsibility to uh do all the work so we appreciate you you we appreciate every one of you we appreciate the tith that you bring in in the storehouse we appreciate the the the support we get uh all the way through uh deacons and elders and all the way down we really all appreciate the things that you do for this church so um all mind's clear so we're we're good everything's good I sister Cay and I were talking a little bit ago and she's kind of like me she says I say what I say and I'm done I don't hold no grudges and I said I'm exactly the same way you know that I say what I'm going to say and you ain't going to hear me say it no more unless it happens again but you say what you say and then then uh and it's hard for and we're going to talk about this next Sunday because if you bring in brotherly kindness there is one word that you have got to totally get out of your vocabulary selfishness you can't put brotherly kindness and selfishness together selfish has to go to love your brother to love your neighbor as you love yourself all selfishness has to go so we'll talk about that next Sunday about being selfish selfishness or selfies so anyway I may I may go buy a selfie stick and see what it's like no I don't think so I ain't wasting my money on that so let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day you've give us we appreciate the time on this Earth that we have Lord there's millions of people won't see this day end father we pray that you would as we are listening to you Lord I pray that you would give us something that will sustain us in the next Monday Tuesday till we come back Wednesday and get rejuvenated then Thursday and Friday and Saturday and then get rejuvenated father we we have to have that where we're sheep we have to be led we have to be shephered we have to be told where to go and what to do sometimes times but Lord that's all of us from here all the way to the back lord we we want to commit oursel to you and let you have control of what's going on let it not be man's ideas man has not built this church but the Holy Ghost has built this church through men and we appreciate that Lord and we thank you for the guidance that you've give us all these years and I pray that you'll guide us even more now as we head toward the headstone we head toward the coming of the king to his Queen and we'll go into the Millennium or wedding supper and then go into the Millennium father we we we long for that day but Lord we've got work to do between now and then so be with us now Lord during the further of this service be with the ones that are sick be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields and Lord we we spoke yesterday day before yesterday to brother George Quinn through email and Lord bless him comfort him he's lost his he's lost his love of his life and his his wife Lord and I we never got to meet her I didn't but some some did here and she they say she's a sweetheart and Lord I'll get to meet her I won't see the old crinkled and and and gray stooped over and and suffering from dementia I'll see a new girl but brother George Lord comfort him father L just wrap your arms around him and love him CU he's loved you he sure has stood for you all these years Lord I pray you stand for him just be with each one that's lost spouses and loved ones Lord I pray that you'd Comfort them Father and bless us now as the furtherment of this service in Jesus name we pray amen all right yeah brother George most of you know brother George Quinn uh was asking me if he was coming over here in August because you know we have camp meeting and he's usually the first one dad always he was the first soon as we that first Sunday after camp meeting brother George spoke for us well he's not coming this year but brother Keith Reed is so he's going to take this place and he's going to preach the the first Sunday in August after the camp meeting but I wanted to make sure to leave it open for brother George and brother George said he just can't get away right now he just he just can't um leave his kids and leave the church there with sister Jackie gone but um that's one sincere brother right there now I'm going to tell you y'all know that you've know brother George he's he's just a um just a solid individual too we've known him for many years let's just pray for him though that that that God will fill that void that that's left by wife passing so John 1:1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word God took something that stinks rotten sometimes don't look very good sometimes don't act very good hello somebody and he decided that's what he's going to work through I'm going to take flesh and I'm going to work through it and I know many people we all struggle with different things but listen we're all human and if you're born again we're all humans with the new birth all right if you're not you're you're you know I hope you're working toward that but common denominator is we're human okay and we've got human things and we've got human parts that we have to deal with we're all you know if we get older you're falling apart my Heavens I told you the other day I said I can see why the the the older people spend more a lot of times in the doctor's office and I'm just 63 but mom and dad and myself and Jun you know went through the surgery she went through I'm like man but it's because your body is not getting younger it is getting older and it is literally falling apart amen and and and and bless you and but now but God gave us doctors praise the Lord to try to help us prop that thing back up but but it's not going to get rid of I was reading something the other day I was looking at some articles about um different vitamins and I'm a vitamin taker I I take more than I did before but but the disclaimer is is now you take vitamins and I'll tell you now you take vitamins think about you take vitamins all different you know I need K you need potass and you need phosphorus and we all need these different vitamins for these different things vitamins are not a cure vitamins will never cure you of anything it will help you get through your arthritis day it'll help you get through your day of whatever whatever it will help you get through but it will not eliminate or eradicate cancer or eradicate whatever but it vitamins are and the reason that I take vitamins too is because you look where brother Brown said says he said that he said our bodies are falling apart because of what food the food we eat is so perverted so I'm going to try to help myself if if they if they uh through processed food if they suck all this potassium out I'm going to try to eat a banana or I'm going to you know I'm going to try to eat this or do this one just kind of life lessons here today but but remember when you H when you hand somebody a vitamin and say this will cure and I don't believe that and let me tell you mou about vitamins it's not an instant most vitamins you have to take six months before they do you any good start doing you any good so don't be one of these you pop two in your mouth and then tomorrow go man this thing don't work you got to let your body process it but listen God give us that I believe he gave us vitamins amen I believe he gave us vitamins to make it through not to cure everything but to make it through I understand that more now now some of you young people looking at me like you always do like what are you talking about one day you'll need something you'll need an aid hear an aid walking Aid y'all just drink lemonade and that's about it but we I'm telling you uh somebody the other day we were saying something and and they were trying to get up who was that trying was it Josh somebody was trying to get up out of the floor and I said mhm see there mhm you need some help get up out of that floor give me a hand well so anyway God's there to give us a hand but we but God decided that he was going to live in this human body now he wasn't going to eradicate the fall right to a degree he's not going to eradicate the fall this thing's going to be sticking until the time we take a change time we take a change that's when we will revert back to a new body this body made new everybody with me all right so we're not looking for sinless Perfection we're not looking if we go up the statue of a perfect man we can do away with our pills you understand what I mean we're not looking for something like I was saying today we're not looking at uh this morning about godliness everybody says godliness and all of a sudden there's a big I mean it's just like a big push you can't be Godly and I can't be Godly we're just we're full of mistakes and full of and you and who's doing this you are God you're pushing it away cuz I read you scripture after scripture after the scripture where God's telling us we're already blameless we're already Godlike we're already deity sir already not going to be but that's the inside person but it's got to show on the outside it's got to let that outside man do what the inside man says all right so so Peter one of the ones that really needed this statue of perfect man God gave him the inspiration to tell us and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue you virtue knowledge your knowledge Temperance Temperance patience the patience got these are ads and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity 1 Timothy 3:16 look without controversies I'm trying to tell you today there there is a controversy about godliness but it shouldn't be in Bride in the bride there shouldn't be a controversy here the controversy yes let them have that controversy let them be but what they're going to do is though without controversy great is the mystery of godliness in other words we know where it's at we know how to live it you can't tell me you don't know how to live godliness when you got the book right here and it's pretty plain then God because of our ignorance give us 1,00 sermons to a prophet a mouthpiece to take this and to enhance this give us the Love Letter the in between the the in between the lines how much he really loves us not how much he wants to kill us or beat us up he wants to love us but he wants us to love us doing what he said so then if you don't then like I read this morning then you are condemned with the world all right the whole world's going to be condemned except the bride even foolish virgin listen foolish virgin are going to be condemned because they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost brother Ram said they got to go through the tribulation and die right they got to die in the tribulation so they're so they're they're over here still they're not bride bride is born again it goes into Rapture doesn't have to go through this doesn't have to go through the tribulation I was thinking the other day I've told you many times before uh dad had a a friend of ours uh he's friend of all of our family he really helped us out cuz he was a uh he was a solicitor in H County for well all his life his name was Jerry Riley and Dad saved his life when he was a little boy he got he was drowning and dad picked him up out of the water and throw him back up on the shore and he's always worked and done things for us well he didn't make it through heart surgery the other day and he's 79 and he passed well you know you think bad about it but you know I was standing in the funeral home and I looked down and I thought there's another one he will not have to go through the tribulation that's right yeah he safely tucked away somewhere because I'll promise you on the day of judgment he'll come up and he may never knew nothing about I he was a Christian man this far as I know but never accepted the message oo but what about him coming to to and and then dad's like hey this guy's been nice to us the whole family for his whole life he said all right come on in you've done the same to my little ones you've done it to me and and God has now preserved him and put him over into a dimension whether it's whether it's Joy or happiness or whatever at least he's not here to go through this tribulation he has been preserved to a place because God knows in an in his infinite mind he's going to give him eternal life at to I Throne judgment all right so so I just was was praising the lord inside of me I'm like man there's another one like we were talking about there's one that God's preserving and putting him up or her up that waiting for a time that they can be given eternal life and not have to go through the Judgment that's how much God honors me and you he'll take them out of this life for you and you think that's horrible sure it's horrible with for his wife and different ones but but they don't understand they don't understand that that that was a Providence of God to let him uh not survive that uh heart surgery they said he really went through it fine and he had a couple of a couple of blockages and they did all that and put him back together and he was fine actually sent his wife home and said hey everything's good you know come back tomorrow go rest by the time she got home they were keeping him alive so she could get back something happened in his valves or something had a couple of valves replaced and and he didn't make it which is really sad but you know what I was joy in my heart that hey there another one that's been put up just for you just for us just for Dad just for our family he was good to us and he was good to us without a selfish motive that's what the thing we got to look at without a selfish motive he was good to us now those are the people that's going to be given eternal life now those that read the Bible and say I think I'll just be really good to these people because I think we I might no no that don't work thank you brother Dy that don't work simple but profound that don't work so without controversy great is the mystery of godliness where is God God's in us all right as we were talking this morning and you're you're on the basis of free moral agency let's continue through that real quick but he tells Abram to be perfect in other words lacking nothing and and not so much in physical strength but but in Christian strength wholesome sound complete morally innocent having Integrity now does that sound like the world today does that sound like that horse forehead that I told you about this morning no we're over here in that we're not over here that's right be ye therefore perfect lacketh nothing complete in other words able to withstand the devil all right sound wholesome as brother John was talking this morning about finances different things that there's got to be a and we did go through the the Dave Ramsey course several years ago pretty much all of us did um but there's a there's when you see that Financial Peace University those two words really don't go together in the world financial peace because they don't have either but we can have Financial Peace and also have perfect peace because we're here and we listen to what God Said not what these people say all right morally innocent as we were reading this morning morally listen morally we're clean if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're a Christian today you b as clean as you're going to get everybody with me I mean you you say well what do you mean brother way well you're not going to get an extra eternal life okay you're not going to get an extra eternal life now you're going to get extra gifts you're going to get extra ads and you're going to get that Holy Spirit which we'll talk about later on maybe next weekend where it just covers over and it solidifies you and makes you to where you will not fail and not fall all right morally innocent having Integrity one who is morally and ethically pure this world can't be that but what they call Pure though we call unpure they're pure they can marry whoever they want to they can commit adultery they can divorce and they can do just whatever it doesn't really matter over here on this side but not on this side all right everybody with me there's the separation because I don't want to be judged by this right there will be no white Throne judgment for this but they surely will for this group right here all right so God godliness is what reverence and respect and that's the way we're going to get we're going to mold godliness into brotherly kindness next weekend because that's what brotherly kindness is it starts with respect and now remember that's all gone we were talking about a horse forehead they don't respect nothing anymore I mean zero they don't respect you I used to respect my elders I didn't care if I didn't like them I shut my mouth and listen if it was an older person talking I some of y'all are looking at me like you're crazy but I I knew that if I walked up and was talking to somebody or if an old elderly person was talking I didn't say nothing I waited till they was finished all right you said that's silly no it's respect it's teaching it's getting the right kind of teaching that me brother sister C was talking about remember brother Brown never said juvenile delinquency he never said that he said it was parental delinquency you're letting them get back with it well praise the Lord anyway I'm just telling you what he said okay so now fifthly we're adding godliness and we've been talking about it so let's continue on brother Ram talks about what oh brother Ram I can't do that he said oh yes you can amen oh yes you can amen he didn't say oh I can bless God I'm the prophet I I've already done it no no you reading statute of perfect man he said he said teach me Lord so that I can teach others all right teach me Lord so that I can teach others teach me Lord all of you so that you can teach others so that you can show this stature of a perfect man to your neighbor to your fellow co-workers I hope your fellow co-workers know that you're different amen they may not like you but they know you're different all right now look when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord now this is over here that we'd be not condemned with the world which is what we've been talking about over on this side because we've been instructed that's what to me that's what the fivefold ministry does it perfects the Saints it takes you from this condemnation I'm going to read it to you in just a minute we're talking about the seed and and the planting of the seed and all that we'll talk about in just a second because I want to bring a I want to bring an overview that how is it going to help to be Godly to be Godly you can't do it by setting it home listening to the tapes it's good to do that but you've got to have a five-fold Ministry in a in a church setting okay to get you this instruction because I was thinking yesterday morning why do we have questions and answers if we don't need anything why do we have questions if we don't need another man to tell us nothing if we don't need somebody to come and say hey can you clarify that for me you've done it I've done it we've all done it we've all come to a place said God you going to have to tell me what that means cuz I really don't understand amen is everybody all right with that you come to a place you say hey I need some help if you don't then bless your heart but you still got to come to church you can't take that piece of the Bible out and throw it away second Peter 1 says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that what pertain unto life and godliness what we've been talking about through the knowledge of him that's called us to go in virtues so God's called us to some to something he called us to take of this divine nature of God or the new birth and then look see there it is again there's the separate having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust this group over here you've escaped that yes cuz the divine nature of God is not over here it's over here and listen if you're over here the divine nature of God is not over here remember it's over here we conform to His Image we conform to what he tells us to do all right so partaking of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add what so let's look at this just a minute if you want to turn your Bibles you can but Matthew 13:3 I've got it all down here for you and I've kind of got it mapped out cuz you look at the what are we doing today what are we doing today today we have come to a church to just be a member uh did we come here just to see another person uh did we come here to just hear a good uh exhortation or or did we come here to hear the word of God I mean the word of God not a not a a watered down substitute version of the word of God so when Jesus is standing there he explains later on not in Matthew 13 but he explains later on who is this Ser now what is the Ser he's the one that puts all the seed in his pocket and he goes out and he throws it right he's he's he's Distributing seed all right I'm a gardener I it's not going to you can't just set the bag down at the end of the row right and expect to get a line of corn you got to take that seed and put it in ground some kind of ground so let's break it down a little bit right here the so is who the son of man are the ministry everybody with me we are under the ministry of the son of man right now all right the seed is not a little grain of something in this Parable it is that but it's the word of God we know that seed is the word we know that's that's everything all right that's the sermon you're going to hear everybody with me all right if you don't agree just say hey I don't know if that's right or not and the ground that it goes in is you yes sir it's not it's not that carpet it's not the Pew you're sitting in it's what's sitting in the Pew is the ground or your Earth all right so you got the sewer the minister you've got the word going forth and you've got the ground that you control what kind of ground it is I can't they asked brother brand was talking about yesterday they asked brother BR saidh do you keep preaching if if this you know in other words if you they thought they thought he was preaching predestination as just you know well you can nobody else can be saved only this amount of people and that's it he said no he said I still throw the net because I don't know who's fishing who's who's snakes he said but I when I throw the net and I bring the net in he said the snakes automatically go back to the water the fish stand the net all right so he doesn't he didn't know now by deser it I'm sure he did know a lot more than any of us would know about who was listening who was not who was getting it and who wasn't but you know what he preached anyway all right I never heard him stop a sermon and say all right y'all not getting any of this I'm out of here he did saying one sermon y'all not getting it but he kept on preaching all right so he had he was preaching to who me you all of us that weren't born at the time so let's go through this Parable just for a minute I want to help you cultivate your ground if yall will wake up it will help you much more if you listen before falling asleep Matthew 13:3 and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a swer went forth to sow so so so a preacher or a minister is going to throw or broadcast that's what the word so means it means to broadcast seed all right so it's got to be broadcast like I said it can't stay in his bag it can't stay in the little bag that comes in from the from the uh store it's got to be broadcast by somebody and now you got to know where to throw it too all right and you got to know where to put it so you got to be skilled in what you're doing you don't just walk out there now sometimes if you were planting flowers and stuff you might but if you're planting a garden uh you know I map out everything y'all know me I mapping everything out I mean I got six rows of corn cuz see and this is the way I think God does I got six rows of corn but now the the not the almanac but but you know Common Sense will tell you that if you growing something this tall Danny you don't want to grow something this tall beside it off the sun side because it don't grow good in shade so you don't want to plant beans corn and the sun come up over there now if the sun comes up over there you want to plant beans and then corn CU one of them grows higher than the other one all right theyby with me so they see that's almost like a master builder as the Bible tells us that we are if we're Ministers of the Gospel we know where to put the seed all right we know where it needs to go and by the by the Holy Ghost I I hope and pray and and I don't say this frivolously I hope and pray that it's done by the Holy Ghost every service anybody stands up here that the Holy Ghost leads and takes over you get the mind of what's going on somewhere else you don't get it right here a lot of times you get it somewhere else but it always hits your row kind of tough that we're all planted in rows right now hm row by row and when he SED so when he ministered the word some word fell by the wayside and the fouls came and devoured them up there's a lot that's going to happen in this sermon you'll never remember a day in your life from this day forward unless you need it but if you need it we'll keep reading some fell what some some of the some of the ministry some of the some of the word fell upon Stony places you walked in here with an attitude you walked in here with a Stony heart you walked in here with an nod against your brother or sister I'm telling you folks because this this seed planting is planting to the seed of the Kingdom Children of the Kingdom who's the children of the Kingdom Bri so this is not worldly people this is what you bring into this service every Sunday every Wednesday you bring some kind of ground you either bring Stony ground you either bring thorny ground I know haven't we met some of those people some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth you really didn't take it the way you should have and Satan is going to steal your Victory from that and when the sun was up they were scorched have we been scorched a few times in sermons I well I'll raise mine you can raise yours if you want to I was scorched by the Sun the S oom amen we need that a little you know it's kind of it's kind of a fine line you want the sun to come up your plants are not going to survive without sunlight but if they get too much sunlight it'll burn them and kill them all right so when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root because you didn't do the little things cuz remember Roots you can't see everybody with me Roots you can't see they're in the ground but they but what comes up out of the ground is a production of what the life that's in that root same way with us am I getting somewhere same way with us all right when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and died and some fell among Thorns our attitude and the Thorns sprang up and choke them who's them us but other fell in good ground today you may walk out and say I didn't get a thing that wasn't for me he was he was talking uh about me he was you know you can be all the thorny as you want to but you can also say hey man that was good ground that was really good ground cuz me planting a garden I try to find the best ground I can to get the thing cuz you you want the best opportunity to get something to grow well I want the best opportunity here to get something to grow all right so that's why you try to lay out the fertilizer that may not be too well you lay out the fertilizer right you get the best soil you can find and then you water it but look but other fell on good ground and brought forth fruit now wait a minute all these other ones didn't bring for it no fruit never made it to a full stature of a plant yet they had potential Jesus didn't say now I picked up some seed in this bag and then the next people I picked up in he said no the seed is the word of God all right so it's one word that goes out that's right whether you take it or not or you can let it roll off your back I like what one Minister said one time he said he said now if we're sewing seed and said if you're not accepting that said it Just Bounce over on top of you and just bounce over onto your neighbor and maybe he'll get a good blessing out of it and that's the way it is you know cuz you say well that wasn't for me and that other person s beside you said well it was for me well what happened was you had some Stony ground maybe if you throw the I throwing seed yesterday I'm just going to repent I throwing seed yesterday in planting my U uh Ford hook lime of beans and they're big old beans well yeah you know you put like two to a hill while I'm standing here putting two and them things bounce like rubber I'm sorry they just bounced right out of the a couple of them just bounced right out of the why because of hard ground now I had some soft ground over here that was real didn't have any rocks in it at all them little seeds just went plop plop plop two by two but when I started over here I put one and it would literally bounce a foot off out of the out of the furl yeah brother John I was a little bit ill about it cuz I'm like come on I'm dropping them right here well they hit some they'd hit something Stony and guess what out it went so I had to reach and get God has to reach and every once in a while and get us out of our mess and put us back in the row that we need to be in all right but others fell in good ground and brought forth fruit some hundredfold 60 and 30 wow what a what a production rate all right who ha ears to hear Let Him hear the disciples came and said why speaketh you in Parables he said unto them because it is given unto you to you so now who is this given to you to know the mystery of the Kingdom so it's given to who us sitting in the pews us sitting in a rose today it's it it's it's given to us to know the mysteries of what godliness brotherly kindness Faith virtue knowledge not like the world but like God said right but to them it is not given so whatever is going forth how many times I told you I think about this when I when I had got this thought here I thought man just bring a whole group of people with you y'all invite a couple of your friends from work or or you or some of your family that ain't born again or some of your family that's good bring them in here let them sit and listen for about a service they won't know half what we're talking about and the other half they're like no way man no y'all are cult y'all don't know what you're talking about about and you can read it to them right out of black and white out of the Bible absolutely and they're like no that ain't it why cuz they're over here they got a horse forehead you're not going to teach me anything this is the way it is but then you got us over here that's in good ground amen see therefore I speak to you whosoever have to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance these people but whosoever hath not for him shall be taken away even what he's got yes the joy is lifted off to be put on you wow think about that God's going to protect his kids amen God's going to protect his kids he's not going to give a glory or give an honor to somebody don't deserve it God's not that way he's a righteous judge but the Bible tells us we're Kings and Priests amen not this group listen there were worthy to rule their Cosmos they're worthy to rule Satan's Eden praise the Lord but not us we've been called out of that and now we rule as Kings and Priests in the kingdom of God think about that there is nothing on this side that's going to carry into another dimension except number five we have no continuing City this is not continuing over here this over here is a future home this is an eternal City that we're going to therefore speak unto them in Parables and that's what it would be if you and I were preaching today and a group of people comes in from another place they would say what is this great mystery what is this Parable that you're that you're speaking you you speak things that we don't understand and you know why cuz they don't have the Holy Ghost just like at this moment those disciples didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they didn't have anything for the Quicken but it was potential they held all this in their heart and I'll promise you on the day of Pentecost that there after they knew what God was talking about they knew what Jesus was talking about when he's talking about sewing this seed and in them is fullfill the prophecy of Isaiah which says by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and you shall not perceive you can talk to them till they bleue in the face but unless you decide to put yourself in good ground it's just going to be like rocks it's going to just bounce off of you it's going to dry you up it's going to blow you away and you're just going to I don't say be lost but you're just going to have I I want Victory there's too much defeat going on I want some victory all right well don't stay over here right this is all defeated every bit of it there's not even a little bright spot nowhere over here is All Bright all right so let's transfer ourself over to there let it be your choice and in them is fulfilled the prophet talking about hearing they shall not understand seeing they shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they just closed them a you ever seen you start talking to somebody and you talk to them about the true word of God or you talk to them even just about living good they don't literally close their eyes but you know they've just closed it off some of y'all do the same thing here if you don't like what's going on you just close her off well praise the Lord anyhow but the seeds being being sown it's according to what ground you brought not mine yours what according to what ground you brought it was going to get in today right for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they just Clos them lest at any time look lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ear and be in other words converted what it says converted people are afraid of being converted yeah tell me tell me that's a lie it's not people are afraid when you start [Music] tell tell me about the religion stuff I might have to change and then even the ones that are religious that we talked to hor forehead this morning even those that are religious said hey don't talk to me about this cutting hair business God doesn't mind I said well he wrote it in his Bible you don't talk to me about it talk to God about it okay all right if not you'll stay over here and you close your eyes and you close your ears listen and should understand with their heart look at L at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears you know that was the problem with the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler was like Hey I done it all I've done every bit of it Jesus said you lack one little thing and do you know that one thing put him in Hell come on somebody that one thing he couldn't do put him in hell not all the good stuff not all that other 10 Ten Commandments we kept he said I've kept it from my youth Jesus said you lath one thing sell everything you got and follow me oh followed no cuz no now Jesus you got a reputation I I I've got a reputation and you've got a reputation I'm sure not going to give up my reputation to go with your reputation that's what he was saying and Jesus was just like sorry I can't do you no good and then the Bible tells us that we're he ended up he ended up in hell and should understand so people are afraid less than any time they should see with their eyes hear with their ears and should understand with the heart and should be converted and I should what heal them that's spiritual healing not so much natural healing there's people in this message that scared to death of this statue of perfect man if not they would preach it for those of you that are awake there are people that are scared of the Statue of perfect man because they have to live a different life than the normal I'm talking about normal message life there's a higher plane we sing what lead me on to Higher Ground not just a ground that I had to se planted in you know I the seed I planted the other day several weeks from now it's going to come up but you know what I'm going to do I'm not going to walk away from it I'm going to still make sure it's watered and I'm still going to fertilize it I'm still going to take care of it through the whole process till I get some good beans out of it and some good corn I'm going to be with it the whole time all right same way with the Lord he's with it the whole time through the ministry through the fivefold ministry he watches you go from what stock or or shoot to stock corn ear and full maturity all right and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes come on blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things you see and I'm talking about us today 2023 cuz you and I have fulfilled of every prophet in the Bible yes sir they were only looking for the Messiah and he was sitting there and they didn't know who he was okay and rejected him and killed him now you and I are past that if we don't reject him we're past that so we take what Jeremiah says Isaiah says uh Matthew and uh Mark and uh Luke and John and um yes sir Paul and um Peter and uh everybody understand what I'm saying we've got all that they didn't when they were sitting here listening to Jesus they had the Old Testament and that was it which was some of the Major Prophets but he said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sword now he's fixing to break it down a little more for him okay when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one catches away that which was sown in his heart now you say oh now brother wait that you you you said this morning you can't lose your Holy Ghost you can't lose the Holy Ghost but remember you got to look at this heart remember Ezekiel you get two parts of a heart everybody with me he softens up that old Stony heart so he can then birth you if you continue on Amen remember then he puts his Spirit into your heart to make it soft and pliable that's not the this is talking about catches away that which was sown in his heart cuz a lot of people come to sanctification and they can't go any further because of they have a heart condition this is he which reive seed by the wayside but he that receiveth what the word the ministry into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word now here we go he that heareth the message Hearth the minister and Aon with joy receive it wo that was a sermon Hallelujah W that was good praise the Lord Regina Arline was dancing she was whooping and holling but Monday morning Monday morning and yet he hath not root in himself what is root grounded that puts you in there keeps you in the the the roots is is vitally important to keep you upright you lose your roots you fall right come on somebody you lose your roots you fall and yet he have no root in him but endureth for a little while Monday Tuesday Wednesday for those of you that don't come to church it just keeps getting worse for when tribulation and persecution arise because of the word now how are you condemned you're not condemned by the world you're condemned by the word yes sir that's right right by and by He Is offended H happens a lot doesn't it get offended people get offended and out of here I'm just reading what the Bible says he also that receives seed are the word among Thorns is he that heareth the word and the cares of this world well I got to stay home come my cat sick I got to stay home cuz I got friends coming in yeah your friends can go by in that house by your by their yourself on Sunday you coming to church but most y'all don't do that so but you're you're killing your testimony I this whole thing about statue of perfect man to me is testimony it's all about a testimony it's about the world seeing that you live different than they do and the reason you live different is because not you're not better you weren't born in a in a in a in a hospital uh that was totally sanitized no we were all born the exact same way born in sin shapen in iniquity but we have come to a place where we heard the word of God it sparked something in our heart then we said God now now I want to live different yes sir you got to want to live different if you don't you going to be in this group right over here cuz it's easy to be in this group right over here because 99% of the world's in this group right here true you got to be that 1% that's over here that takes trials and tribulations and counts it all joy hallu when you fall into divers diverse many Temptations seems like these people over here they just everything's good yeah everything's good for a moment doesn't the Bible say sin for a season you just got a season a time what are you going to do for that time this time down here is just very short period of your real life amen everybody with me okay let's think about it then how we live our life here he also that receives seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of what does the thorn do number one a thorn does or a weed does it takes and it doesn't actually kill the plant unless you let it get big enough and it'll choke it what does it do though it takes the nutrients that you're supposed to get and it puts it in something that don't produce cuz remember the rainfalls on the just and the unjust that same rain that gives it to the to the plants the same one that gives it that's why we try to weed we weed our garden or you need to weed around your trees if you got some trees that want to grow get all the other little trees out from under it get all the little trees away from it because they're sucking nutrients out of the ground I mean that's just in the natural but same thing in the spiritual are you letting somebody or some suck your life out of you and it's going to be a nonproducer if it's thank you every time it'll be a non-producer there is no time in my life that I've ever had a garden and I look and see that this Thorn comes up and we've got thorns on it and all of a sudden there's corn on it no it is that plant it's not going to change now by the transforming power of God you change but by the transforming power of God you change not you you're still a cuar until he puts that wheat life in you all right and cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches look the deceitfulness of riches chokes the word and he becomes not dead unfruitful that's why I do pluck all that stuff out from around my beans and potatoes cuz listen the more you get away from them that more nut nutrition is going to go into your plant come on somebody it's going to come into your plant instead of getting two pieces of corn off of the stock you get three or four 100 fold 60 fold 30 fold it's because of the nutrition that you get in the roots and don't let somebody beside you suck all that cuz they're not corn seed we love them we cherish people all the time but if they're nonseed as brother Ram said there's nothing to Quicken nonseed is nonseed let God work that out though you want you want them you want them by the transforming power of God you want them to come over here and become corn but if they decide to stay Thorns they're going to be a thorn and they're going to be a thorn in your side the deceitfulness of riches chokes the word and he becomes unfruitful but he that receiveth seed in good ground if you come in this morning and said Lord forgive me of what I done this week if you want a good formula every time you before you walk in that door repent I don't care if you've been asleep for three days you've had a dirty thought in there somewhere and actually if you've been asleep for 3 days and somebody wakes you up you going to have a problem with the person who wake you up so anyway yeah right so there's your problem repent repent before you come through the door just repent then you can receive you know what you've done by the transforming power of God you've took the thorns and killed them you've took all the rocks out of your garden God has and guess what good fural oh I love the good smell of fural ground I love it man you go out there and smell it and it's a smell that it to most people it don't smell worth anything but man I know the difference in the smell of good ground and clay and all that other kind of soil and I know a lot of you do too that that raise uh you know you get that potting soil as soon as you open the bag you go oh man I'm fixing to eat this but I'm not going to eat it in this form I'm going I'm going to eat it when it becomes a PL you know comes up through my plant and becomes a a tomato or whatever you want to say but but but hey that's where that's where you your plant gets your nutrition that's right it's from that but he that receiveth seed in good ground I've come to the Lord furl my life out plant some good seed and then let me work on it Monday and help me work on it Monday so that a thorn don't don't come in there and choke choke me out or or help me that that there's no Stony heart there's no bitterness um I'm telling you brotherly kindness when you take the selfish and all that stuff part out we'll we'll we'll read some of that where um Jesus told him said you know it said of old an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth right and that's what the Bible says I think I got it in here Jesus said now you've heard of old of Old there's a new Administration now you've heard of all that an eyee for an eye and a tooth for a tooth he said but I say unto you now if they smack you on no that cheek reach over there and give them the other one if a man wants your coat give him your cloak in other words your shirt and your coat that's receiving seed into good ground is he that heareth the word look and understandeth it wow which also beareth fruit this is the only time in this Parable that something has grown enough to give fruit but when it brings fruit it doesn't just bring one apple thousands of apples hundredfold 60 and some 30 we've already been I think I've got let me read that scripture I think we've already everybody understand what a horse forehead is okay if you don't then we'll go over it again we'll do it next Sunday but let's let's get down here where Jesus is talking about in brotherly kindness cuz we know what brotherly kindness is right love for brother or sisters right then we'll be dismissed we'll just I want to find this right here a new commandment I give unto you John 13:34 that you love one another H wait a minute that's a new commandment I'm that's what Jesus said and a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you now he puts it a little bit not just well you know shake hand God bless you brother now you got to love them like God loved them that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to the other here it is right here Matthew 5:37 then we'll close but let your communication be yay yay and n nay for whatsoever is more than these look cometh of evil you have heard there's been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but who so shall smite thee on thy right sheep give him the other one also and if any man will sue you in the law take away your coat let him have it also whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go too now does that sound selfish there's nothing selfish about that bless God I ain't you go mile I ain't going too give to him that askest thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not away you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy that's the Old Testament but I say un do you love your enemies yes sir bless this is hard this is hard from here back to there this is hard love your enemies no we like to just absolutely put them under the message bus you know make the little list and throw them under the bus message bus we're in the message okay but I say you love your enemies now wait a minute this is Jesus talking bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them I ain't going to ask for a show of hands embarrass us all pray for them in your list of prayer have you got all the people that despitefully use you on that prayer list no we pray for the people we like y'all either sleep quiet one of the two I'm reading you what the Bible says pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you and don't be praying Lord take this person out of the way please get rid of this person Lord you can do it he might get rid of you you might be the one that's in the way I I'm telling you though I'm not trying to give you but this is a new doctrine this is a new commandment that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you easy to love somebody loves you do not even the publicans do the same if you salute your brethren only have you ever been shunned how' it feel then stop shunning others told y'all this is going to get rough when you get brother kindness brother ran does make a quote and I'll quote it to you next week where he says you get all the way up here and then God requires you to have brotherly kindness and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans do the same thing then he wraps this whole thing up this whole sermon with be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect I'm going to read you one quot come on uh let's stand our feet brother uh bring the musicians with you oh here's brother brandham this is 1956 Divine love and Sovereign Grace we'll back up to all this in a minute now we are faced in a day now this is 1956 all right 1956 I mean people would even would would wave at You in 1956 not with the middle finger either now we are facing a day that is prophesied to us that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts there is in God's Bible if the Lord Jesus this is Brother brandham the prophet of the end time if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel or I'll give you the gift of teaching the word or I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of prop prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them everyone to you but then I will withhold love from you or either give you love and withhold the gift I'd say Lord take all these gifts and let me have the love for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have love must have love we'll read it next Sunday there'll be there's one where brother R said that's the greatest gift and as talk he's saying it right here it's the greatest gift I have give me love unfeigned love for the Brethren that's what Paul said let's sing a song God
