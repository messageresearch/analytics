one scripture Isaiah 60:1 in verse 10 and it says I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom Dickus himself with ornaments and as a bride adorned herself with her jewels a man god bless you tonight you may be seated I won't speak on clothed in righteousness and brother Branham as a message is Oh whereas thou stripped gone sentence in 1959 brother Branham says he said a minister was telling me the other day went to suffer with a person and while they were getting separated this ministers wife had to watch we love Suzy or something like that before they cooked supper for them I said brother I'm telling you when that comes it shows that the home life no wonder we got juvenile delinquency no wonder the spirit the secrets been discovered it takes it's taken the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the people and they and they are going for the things of the world instead of coming back to God stop look listen the coming the Lord is at hand what good is our knowledge do what good will our big buildings do what will our intellect intellectual talks do it'll take nothing will stand that day but the blood of Jesus Christ washed in his blood and clothing his righteousness by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said when the church loses that it's gone and you can see it's smothering down wooing talking the Holy Spirit's been grieved by our Creed's in our denomination or and our sectarian barriers and our class and our fancy things we know all that abomination in the sight of God what we need is a good clean washed church a real clean cut hundred percent out for God out and out with no shame no backwardness we don't care what the world says we got God and he's all we care about and he's in our hearts and we worship Him in spirit and truth that's what God wants in his church you know because we want to be clothed in his righteousness not our own because we know in Isaiah 64 verse 6 I said but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away so you know the scripture here tells us that he says that he was going he is rejoicing I was asked that we were Joy's because we have been clothed with the garments of salvation he said him put on him the robe of righteousness his righteousness because we don't have any righteousness in ourselves because all we have is filthy rags but we take on his righteousness and one of the things I want to look at tonight there's a there's a couple of things I want to look at tonight because I want to emphasize the the garment that they wore in the Middle East because when you look at the words when we talk about apparel when we talk about being Rove and we talked about being clothed we have to go back and look at the idea of what the where the writers are taking this from because in their time they would understand that because reading as brother brems said we're Western people trying to understand an Eastern book so we want to go back and look at what they had when they said when they talk about because today if you talk about a robe a robe ain't much and you know but we want to go back and look at what they talk about when they say being robe and the other thing I want to look at tonight later on I want to look at because in the scripture I would have look because even our day in Revelation Jesus gives God giving the rebuke to the Laodicean Church age he says that he wanted them to because they knew he said they were naked and he said you're naked and you don't know it you're poor blind and miserable and naked and you don't know it but he said I want you to buy raiment of me that you can be clothed that the shame of your nakedness not appear so one of the things I want ho about was being clothed but being naked being without because if we look we want to take this thought and look all the way through the scripture because it comes all the way through but to understand what it means to be clothed in his righteousness but also to understand the point that I want to try to get to later on why do we have standards as far as holiness what is a standard because if our time in and looking at what what is considered modest or anything what does the scripture say and how do you apply that and what does the scripture actually mean because people say well it doesn't matter well then you know if it doesn't matter then that's the part of the Bible we just tear out and throw away because if it's not if it doesn't matter if God did then what then why did the Holy Ghost come upon the writers of the Bible and write these things if it's not important if it wasn't important than God wouldn't erode it but it was came from the mind of God to someone some man to write down for you and I to understand that the Bible brother Branham said that that we understand that he said a Holy Ghost field woman wouldn't put on something that's immoral you don't have you don't if the Holy Ghost is upon a person then you know they don't that's what the Holy Ghost came for is to leading so that you will know what truth is and not only that you will have somebody because honestly if God set things in motion and we have the Holy Spirit inside of us it's the leading and guiding but the other thing is God set in order he said a fivefold ministry in order so so to bring the word to the people because that's the only way that was the channel that God created that he ordained - for it to come in and come through the fivefold ministry to you so if you're confused on something he said he was ordained he was he has to he's obligated to put somebody right here to answer your questions well then you know what we don't have to have any worries we don't have to fret why because we put our confidence in him as brother Bowman somebody we got to have confidence in God in what he said and if it's true then that's where we lay our faith and we hold on to that we don't have to we don't have to worry we don't have to question one because God has the mind that he wants us to understand that if that he has it in his mind then you know what he is going to make sure that you get it you know it's just like going to school when you were in school and you had a teacher and they taught you something and you know and you didn't get it within you know what they went back over it and you know what there's people that you know that they have tutors and they have people that that's that worked one-on-one to understand how you learn how to work through your problems that how you so you can comprehend what's going on and God knows each one of us and he knows each where where were each one of us situation he knows your mindset he knows everything about you so if he knows how to speak to you so that you can receive what you have need of you know because that's the reason he said he said he said a fivefold ministry in position in place that they said they had apostles prophets evangelists teachers and pastors why for further perfecting so but each one of those channels speaks to the people but it speaks through a different way the word doesn't change but it reaches you a different way so you know every every all fivefold ministry it all comes from one spirit it all comes from from one place one person speaking through those five channels so it doesn't so it only comes from God because we don't speak we don't speak of ourselves a true fivefold ministry doesn't speak for itself he's just mute until God gives him something to speak and then and then he speaks what God gives him because we are ordained of God but we're also required to speak as the Oracles of God we're standing here and we're supposed to speak as in God's stead we don't say we don't have our own thought we take what God see it people have no confidence well it shows I have no confidence in God I don't know why well I got down that path but you know what I just it felt good like that like that man said about the no boy said about the watermelon said this is good but there's more of it so so we're gonna eat some more of it but in there but in the Old Testament that the garments that they wore we know that there was two kinds of garments that were worn in in the Old Testament in it in the New Testament in the in the time of the scripture and there was two layers usually to the to the garments that was the undergarment was usually made like a tunic was a short had like a robe went over the shoulders came down usually attached sits with a belt but usually it was above the knees but went down to the knees and covered this part but then so that was the the undergarment but the the over garment that they wore was either usually called either a a mantle or a robe and it was long and flowing and it all went all the way to the floor and went down to the feet now the only time that we see in the scripture that when you study the Old Testament or any any of the scripture the only time that you see anybody being not dressed like that was number one was a slave or number two they were a soldier and usually because soldiers had to dress differently because they were in a battle and they had to they were couldn't be restricted so they had to be prepared to fight so there was less garment that they wore because they were in that they were there to Bible but that was only in a situation where they were going to war you know because you know when they dressed a certain way they were doing certain things but when they came to a different place they didn't dress the same way and so that'll make a little more sense later on but usually the the clothes they had the undergarment and then they had the over garment that they wore and it all went to the went to their feet and usually they were you know usually had belts in and the Cinch and you know different things but that's usually the way they were dressed they had a robe and so when it says that he has clothed us with the garments of salvation see when you talk about that the garment covered the person usually it went down the arms it went to the floor it covered the whole body and then when he says he's giving us the robe of righteousness well if he's put the robe of righteousness when you wear a robe see the robe covered the whole body so when you put this on you're covered but see then when when he comes on and he says you know that you have you're poor and you're wretched and negative when he rebuked this age they said you're naked well that you know when you look in the scripture you have to figure out it because sometimes in the scripture when the word when they use the word naked it doesn't mean like what we think it does now so we're going to look some of that tonight in the scripture but and in Genesis 12 and 25 when God says and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed now that's the only place that I can find in scripture where it says that somebody was naked and they weren't ashamed or though they were naked and they didn't have shame or it didn't call shame because brother Branham said in the message Satan he Satan's Eden when he was talking about them he said what was it he said compare this now how much I like that men and his wife and both in God's eating without one stitch of clothes on them and knew it not for why didn't they know it for they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit they could look right at each other and they didn't know that they were naked they were veiled with the holy spirit of holiness they were veiled gods veiled yet today can look and not lust they turn their head it's a holy veil seat holy veil God had their eyes they were both they were both one was men and the other was woman and they did not know they were naked because of the holiness of God kept their eyes veiled notice God hid their conscience from sin by the holy veil so they were veiled by the Holy Ghost which is the same thing as we were reading here brother Branham was saying you're robed in the righteousness of God by the Holy Ghost it takes the Holy Ghost to value to cover you so we're covered by the Holy Ghost and that's what they had to see they were in a position that they did not were not ashamed of a cause they were available by the Holy Ghost and so that's what it takes today and brother Branham says in the message hear ye him he says speaking of a of the adoption when they were going through the adoption ceremony he says and it was a ceremony of adoption the child that had been born into the family become place by adoption in the family and after that that boy's name was just as good on a check as his daddy's was he was heir of all things he could take out he could put up he could fire he could hire he could do whatever he pleased to do because the ceremony of adoption had been made upon his son and he was clothed and was set in order now there's where the church ought to be today Jesus said these things that I do show you do also ask anything in my name I'll do it why are we scared of that what's the matter if Christ has closed us with the Holy Ghost and had been adopted into the family after being born again and been baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit if it's a true witness of God ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so if we have received that veil and received by the Holy Ghost being born again and been placed and we've received that then he said you should have what you have need of and ask what you have needed because you it is it's available to you so brother branham goes on and just gonna read a couple of quotes here this is from the approach of God and he says let's go down to the scroll down to the next one there brother he says he says and every man that comes that comes that approach dies to self comes to Christ regenerated born-again filled with the Holy Spirit the robe of God's righteousness given upon you and you live for Christ from then on your coming God's provided approach then you got new life in you the old life of sin has passed away the old carnal thoughts of that God wait yonder years ago God is a living being not only out yonder but right here right now all things that he said is the truth and you believe it every bit so we have received the the robe of his righteousness and we have received the new birth then we have received what we have need of then old things have passed away then all things have become new so if all things have been passed away then all of the other things that are in the past have done been done away with so then you know the then if we have a new look because we've become a new creature in Christ and if everything has become new to us then you know what there's no shouldn't be any kind of remembrance of the old things of life or the old way of living why because it's all done away with well because you know if you if you have the life of God inside of you and it becomes to be made manifest then then it has to it has to show on the outside you know because you know what whatever it is it all things any kind of seed that you plant in the ground you know at some point in time it's got to manifest itself because if it's if it's germinated to life and it's going to come forth when it comes up out of the ground you may not be able to tell it when it first comes up you may not know see it but you keep waiting on it and you keep waiting it as the water falls upon it and the Sun shines and time goes on it's going to manifest exactly what it is but see the thing is you and I because if we've received that then you know it has to come to life it has to come to fruition it has to have come to manifestation because you know the thing is is if you have if you say that you're born again and you and you've been received you've received this this life and then you've been robed in His righteousness then you know if nothing comes from your life then you know sometimes you have to start to wonder exactly what happened because you know I mean you know if you say so I'll have a house on fire on the windy day you know I mean there's there's got to be some kind of some kind of a showing of it it's got to be manifested it's got to show you know that's what that's what I want in my life I want I want that you know it's not that they see me I want them to see Jesus Christ I want to die out so much because I don't want anything of the old way I don't nothing of the old life I don't want to be completely gone so the only thing that they see is Jesus Christ when I speak when we'll walk everything because you know if he's called us to be his representatives and you know what then we represent exactly what the scripture says and you know because the devil is going to try you on that that's what his job is but greater is He that's in us than he that's in the world amen no going on yeah in the scripture what it talks about them being clothed and the opposite of being clothed and contrasting these two when you see somebody what was being clothed and then understanding what was being wonder what we call when the scripture says naked when they talk about people being naked well you know they're not always meaning what we think it's because in the scripture when you go back and look what just like job said I believe a job said you know I come in naked I come in this world naked I go way out you because you know you you come in this world no clothes here you come but when you in the scripture when it talks about that because in the Old Testament and even in the scriptural times if you go back and look they had a level of modesty that what they considered being naked and one of the things that they talk about is like and some of the scriptures that when you talk about nakedness and you talked about it being shameful gonna give you a few scriptures here Exodus 30 to 25 says and when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies and then Isaiah Isaiah 20 go just continue right here he says at the same time spake the Lord I of baza Isaiah the son of Emma's saying go and loose the Sackhoff from off thy loins and put off the shoe from my foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot and the Lord said like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wander upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners and the Egyptians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt now one of this when you go back and look say we think as the scripture tells us and some of the passages we say that its nakedness means nude no clothes but what say when we read about Isaiah see they say that Isaiah didn't walk around and like we think he did he walked around in his underwear because he was walking because that in the scriptural times that meant that he was naked and the contrasting here is because when they ride on and they come down here they say that the when they capped when the Egyptians and the Egyptians were taken captive it says that their buttocks were uncovered so it's making a distinction between here and here showing that they there was a difference between the way that Isaiah walked before the people and the reason why the reason why that Egypt and Ethiopia was in this condition was because Egypt and Ethiopia had God made known to them because God had spoke to them and they rejected him because when you reject God then they went into captivity and then all of a sudden then you see the nakedness coming out there shamefulness being made know why because they had turned the word down and so it was a shameful thing that god's prophet walked out there in front of all the people and they thought my goodness here's god's prophet walking around naked well he wasn't he wasn't naked as we think he was but he was improperly clothed but then he told the people he said but it's your shamefulness because you've turned the word down that you're going to walk the same way but the problem is as they walk with no clothes and here they are they went back into captivity with Assyrians because they had turn turn the word down and that's if we go on to the next scripture here John 21 verse 7 speaks the same thing because you know a lot of people a lot of people ask about these questions you know have questions about this and there's Peter says and before they disciple whom Jesus loved Seth under Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he Girt his Fisher's coat upon him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea now when you go back in look see when they were fishing with other men out in the water and there was no women around they didn't have their outer garments on they were fishing basically he was fishing in his underwear he was fishing in his undergarments because that's the way they did because it allowed them to work more but when he realized that Jesus was on the shore and he wanted to go see him see then there would have been women on the shore then that's the reason he gird itself because he didn't want to be seen unclothed because that would have been the modest thing for the time so then he would have grated his coat and put on so when when you say that your are when they talk about Peter being naked and Isiah being naked well it wasn't that they were naked as we think they were it's because they were improperly clothed for their position so when when God sets God sets the standard for what the for what is naked because that's what he carried to the people that said that's where they got their idea what they what was a standard for being naked and being clothed so we understand it these things are what what God has said in the scripture so if you go to Isaiah 47 it says come down and sit in the dust old virgin daughter of Babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter the Chaldeans for thou shall no more be called tender and delicate take the mill stones and grind mill uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers that Nick and this shall be uncovered gave a shame shall be seen I will take vengeance and I will not meet thee as a man now when you go back in look when they're speaking of Babylon the Babylon was going in to captivity because they had turned the word down God had spoke to babble on and babble on rejected so as they were going into captivity now see I want you to see this one thing when lots of times when they speak in the Old Testament when they start talking of this it's captivity because you know brother Branham talks about and lifting him up out of history and he talks about the way the men he was talking about Amram and Jochebed praying because of the bondage and everything going on and trying to raise up Moses and looking for a deliverer and what was going to take place and brother Branham says look at today he said two young men are dressed he said they got their pants down below their hips carrying a pistol and everything he said what is it he said it's slavery to the devil its bondage to Satan so when you're looking at this what you're seeing this it's all has to do with being bondage you cannot be free and dress like this because in the Old Testament a slave dressed immodest well if you're dressing immodest then what does it show you're bound by some of you're bound by spirit so when you when you come to this now look no I want you understand here they are they're coming this says thou shall be no more called tender and delicate because this lady had a position because it's just like a church it's a woman it's an empire that had a position but all of a sudden she decides that she's gonna walk away she's going to become an immoral woman so God is going if you read the if you read the commentaries God is going to shame this woman for what she's done so she's got to cross over the river to go in to tribulation so here says take the mill stones grinding the mill uncover thy locks one of the things that women also wore in the Old Testament excuse me the word in the Old Testament was a veil and they you take so she's taking her veil off so you remember we saw about the holy holy spirit brother em say there's a holy veil so she's thinking so she's she's showing also it's showing that she's doing away with her covering she's doing away with this says make bear the leg uncovered the thigh passed over the rivers so she's got a cross over the river so what is she doing she's pulling up her skirts because she's starting to walk into the water and now she's pulling up so he said make bear the leg uncover the fire Passover the rivers then thy nakedness remember when we talked about the robe the undergarment went down but when you're clothed when you're robed the went to the ankles but here we see this woman so uncover the the lock to make bear the leg uncover the thigh pass over the river so here she is as she starts to walk through the water she's pulling up her garments now she wasn't naked she wasn't bare because they sewing that she's pulling up her garments but but God says you're naked because you're uncovering yourself so here you are pulling up your garments then your make yourself naked whenever brother branham said he said what has happened in our day he said the women have become that kid again and he said they don't understand what people say well I got clothes on I'm not naked well are you following the Bible definition of nakedness are you following your own definition are you are you being robed in God's righteousness by his word are you following your own righteousness which are filthy rags also I didn't tell you the word rags means a filthy garment it's a worn-out garment so you've got a filthy worn-out garment that's what you're robed in you're dressed in your one because it's no good it's worthless that's reason they seem to put on his garment his raiment so when people say what is what its nakedness he said well if the people don't if the women don't realize they're naked he said if an apple caused them to realize they were naked he said it's time to pass the apples again so if you people wonder why there's certain standards one because God's Word said so he said you know we can we can wear certain things well you know every time you you know as brother Donny Reagan said he said they try to stretch poly from Esther trying to cover up their legs trying to cover up their knees well the problem is is why because God said you don't dress this way why because it shows that you're immoral God didn't tell people to dress in modest apparel than just so you know it's just a flip of the coin or just whichever way you think why God set a standard in the scripture a what immoral is what nakedness is so if you go around showing off all your legs pulling up you dirts get shorter and shorter and shorter it shows that you're naked that's what God said that wasn't that's nobody else's standard that's God's standard whether you got whether you believe that or not that's what he said you just have to argue with him I'm just gonna tell you what he said and continuing on let's go to Revelation chapter 16 revelation 16 behold I come as a thief blessed he's that watches and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame so and here's another one speaking of being clothed watching your garments keeping your garments why because if you're not then you're walking without clothes and you're not meeting the standard of what clothing is not being robed and and then continue on there's got a few scriptures here I want to look at 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 here it says for we know that if our earthly house of this.timer Knakal were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon now what so watch what listen to the words reading the words that Paul says and how he describes this he said earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so that being clothed we shall not be found naked he said for we that have the four we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that which we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life now he that hath robbed us for the self same thing is God who also have given unto us the earnest of the spirit now when you go back and read this scripture Paul speaking of this earthly house this tabernacle that we're in and what so what so amazing is the way here what he describes this being a house or a tendons in some translations it translates it as a tent but he says we have one that if this one it's dissolved he said we'd have a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens he said for in this we groan we've grown in this because nobody wants to live in this but listen listen to how he describes us earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven so while we're here were wanting to take on this other one they said if so that we being clothed we shall not be found improperly clothed because you are not in your right to be state so we even if you go beyond here and you put on bow and you're still not in the right to be place but here we don't want to be in this place what because if you're if you're a pilgrim and a stranger if you're a sojourner in this land and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost nobody wants to live in this pest house nobody wants to live in Satan's Eden nobody wants to have to go through this why because we desire to be fulfilled in the Word of God to have the fullness of the word in our lives and so here we are he says that we want to be clothed that we won't be found and properly clothed why because you don't want to stand on that day of judgment and not be found improperly clothes why because if you've not have his righteousness then what are you going to say on the day of judgement when you're standing there not clothed in the righteousness of God what is going to be your answer well because you don't have an answer as in the scripture when Jesus said the man came to in the wedding garment and they came to the wedding and he didn't have the wedding garment on and he stood there and he said friend why have you come to the wedding without the garment one because it was a free gift everyone that came in the proper way was cleaned and greeted and was given a robe you were robed for the wedding he said why did you not come the same with the way that you should have come and he said and he was speechless well because we have to give an account for what we've done and how we dress and how we acted how we conduct ourselves and you know what if we go to that day and stand before God and we have to give it count you know what we don't have an excuse we don't have an excuse of why we don't dress right an act right and we don't fulfill the Word of God says for we and this tabernacle do groan being burden not that we would be unclothed so we don't want to do away with this now want you to Kate I want you to catch the wording that Paul says we don't want to take this off you know brother Branham said he said in Africa and he said in Africa he said those women were naked hanging said they were laying there he said when the Holy Ghost came upon them he said they covered their arms and walked out of the men's presence and when they came back they were clothed but he said today he said the modern people they take more clothes off he said they walk around naked he said and they want to be Christians he said the heathens try to live with a Christian life and will actually put on clothes and he said the Christians are trying to be heathens he said it shows that we got a bunch of idiots but see he said we're not going to take this off he said we want to be clothed upon so we're not going to do away we don't want to do what with this we want to have more clothes put on then how if this is what he's speaking that how nor does anybody think that we're gonna take more clothes off there's no place in the scripture that talks about taking clothes off so the thing is is and just speaking in the natural terms and if I'm wrong on anything then brother Dale can straighten me out but the thing is is this if you if you walk around and you have a question about whether something fits or not or you think it's it's a little bit of a modest story a little bit any moral thing guess what if it hang a little bit longer if it ain't a little bit looser if it ain't got a little more coffee to it you probably need to choose the one that's a little bigger a little bit longer nowhere in the Bible you gonna find it so what we're gonna take this off no Paul says we don't want to be unclothed we're not going to take anything off we want more clothes at at home he says now more telling might be swallowed up of life why because we want something added we wanted to keep putting on the Word of God that this mortal will take on immortality so it's going to be adding home said now he that hath brought us for the self same thing is God who have given unto us the earnest of the Spirit so if we if we received the earnest of the Spirit then you know what this applies to us with just the earnest of the Spirit you know if you're born again and you're just a newborn babe in Christ then you know what you have you have this and you know what we don't want to have to be unclothed but you know we desire to be clothed more upon when no wonder brother Branham said you can't get a board again woman to put on their mortal clothes you can't see how a woman went around in a pair of shorts or a pair of pants some shirt skirts or runs way up above her knees some kind of split and scandal skirts and all kinds of stuff why because there's no place in the scripture why because that the Holy Ghost is there then the Holy Ghost is going to match the word 1 because what what goes on down here and the natural is a type of the spiritual so we want to put on we want to put on Christ we're not taking anything off we won't 1 because when you put it on then guess what he's the one that's obligated to put it off everybody's like well I want to try to get rid of this and try to get rid of that you know the problem is is everybody tries together tries to get rid of everything themselves you know what if you get in the word and let God get in you then you know what he takes care of the business of cleaning you up it's a problem you know because you know like I said our righteousness is filthy rags so you know what you're not going to ever get good enough you're not ever gonna get yourself right it ain't never gonna work right but you've got to put on Christ you got to put on the robe of righteousness his righteousness his law his word if we put if we put on Christ then you know what then he can do the work first Timothy 2:9 it says in like manner that women should adorn themselves in modest apparel so when you look at the word modest so everybody says like well you know I've got my own definition of what modest is well you know what it means one of the definitions is unassuming so you're not going to draw attention to yourself well let me tell you if you put on something that shows every inch and every curve and every little thing on you then you know what it's not unassuming the other definition for this word is adequate brother Branham said women walk around and ain't got enough clothes to water must get shotgun that's not adequate it also means satisfactory well if you can't want a shotgun or he said or fill up an aspirin bottle than our aspirin box the you know I didn't ain't ain't adequate and ain't satisfactory and the other thing it says it also means well arranged well you know if it if it has down here and out this way in that way and it splits here and there you know what it ain't adequate it ain't unassuming in a satisfactory and it ain't well arranged well I may not get a lot of amens tonight but listen it's still the truth where you like it or not and you know what it don't matter if it if it hurts me hurts you hurts whoever you know it's still the truth and you know what because somebody and somebody is and we're obligated to the word to know this and everybody says well why why are we supposed to wear it dressed a certain way why are we supposed to act a certain way why because God put it in his word and you know what he takes the Holy Ghost now if you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will come and and you'll speak to you out of the word on how to dress people think well we're just we just the Holy Ghost will come no God wrote it in his word but not a lot of people don't don't believe that but that's alright you know I just I just choose to believe what what the Bible says and that's what iswhat I see and that's what I that's what I believe and if nobody else agrees with or believes that's okay they're the ones has to answer to God on there but all I have to do is say what I believe and what God tells me to say we need to dress the way God wants us to why because it's a type of being dressed in the Word of God putting on holiness so they get done here in a little bit so just got a few more here's from the message presuming brother Brown says he says I heard someone say as I was saying at the beginning of message back here a few days ago I was in a place some of them now you have to wear Elijah's garment my there's no more more different garments and touching handle and sensations I ever heard in my life now just let it go blank go blank hold your head back good honest people go blank don't think of nothing just let your mind completely blank now see I believe God oh I believe we're going to he's you're going to give me the Elijah's garment he said I don't want Elijah's garment I want the Holy Ghost I want to come upon the basis of this word I want to come on with the knowledge see I come upon God believing that I can't be covered with the largest garment I don't want to be covered with the garment I want to be covered with the garment of the righteousness of God clothing his righteous the garment that we want then continuing on let's go to Jehovah Jireh 1964 and brother Branham after the battle is over the real believer has fought the enemy broke down the lines and tried to capture his brother the real seed of Abraham bringing back that wayward brother male kids that came out served him bread and wine communion giving communion after the battle was over served the communion to him after the battle a very beautiful type when the battle is over here on earth the victories have been won jesus said that they would eat it anew and the father's Kingdom after the way word had been brought back then the first thing we do when we get in after the battle is over is sitting out at the battle in the kingdom of God and those that has fought and sat down and overcome shall be clothed in the righteousness of Christ and then again they take the bread and wine in the father's kingdom on the other side what a real picture of this of Abraham going out and getting a lot and bringing him back in so I'm just going to continue I just got a couple more quotes I'm more finish up and this from Stan's steel in 1957 brother Bram says this is what I was talking about earlier where he says he says those naked women 5 minutes before they didn't know they were naked and as soon as the Holy Spirit struck that bunch then women folded their arms and walked off the ground now you mean to tell me in your modern churches you let the women strip themselves off out here half naked before men and tell me that is Christianity it's worse than heathens heathen can realize and accept Christ they'll cover up their nakedness and you're trying to expose yourself to be modern I don't want to be rude but brother one of these days I've got to stand before the presence of God and give an account for everything I say and I'm not going to hold anything back I'm going to say it instead of becoming civilized we're becoming idiots that's right civilization is broke so we are responsible to say what God said and say exactly what he said then continuing on here perfect strength and perfect weakness he said Paul said I can have I can move mountains with faith I can heal the sick I can have knowledge of the Bible I can go to a seminary and learn all this stuff everything said I'm nothing yet hallelujah oh my talk about the lid coming off the kettle demons going around powers of the devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctoring the commandments of men Theological Seminary doctrines leaving the Bible alone hallelujah who's who strong enough who's wise enough who's powerful enough to tame this Legion of stripping the clothes off of our women in the name of preachers Methodists Baptists and even Pentecostal painting their faces like Jezebel and bobbing their hair and wearing paints just like men our preachers not enough to get up about them to tell them about it devil possessed it was the Legion that tore his clothes off of him who is this roaring devil who's strong enough what kind of denomination able to conquer him walking up and down through these tombs of the denominations crying the days of miracles has passed and we don't need the Holy Ghost and who contain the devil God we can't do it by denomination we can't do it by classical forces but there was a voice one time that did it Amen that tame them Devils that put them in their mind and put clothes on them that same voice gives us a promise the works that I do shall you do also you'll never do it under ecclesiastical gasoline and a carbon struck car you'll never do it in an organization you'll never do it when you you'll do it when you empty up and become weak pour out all yourself and let the Holy Ghost come in and flood over every part of you saturate every lid of your body that's the only way you'll do it we don't need any organization the works that I do show you do all so well because the Holy Ghost has been given to us because if we have if we have a need if the Holy Ghost has been given to us and if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have it then that's what brother Dale has been preaching on one because there is a way mate it's as simple as it can be but the problem is is you've got to come and and and Gibbs before God and pour yourself out as he said and wait on God and allow him to come and move on you because if you will if you will come before him because if he's if he's speaking to your heart then you need to yield to him but the problem is is people don't know how to yield people don't know how to stand still and wait on the Holy Spirit to come to them they want to try to figure it out on their own or some kind of some kind of program or whatever else but the thing is it takes a dying out and the problem is as long as you're crying out to God then you yield yourself than God is morally obligated to come to your position your place and speak to your heart and tell you how to move forward but the problem is like you said people don't stay here long enough stand still long enough why because you know there isn't no old-fashioned altars and you don't have to have an altar up here but you have an altar in your home they all the holder is here but the place is that you need to go find a place somewhere where they're like brother branham said me I'm going to the cave and I'm going to get an answer from God and I'm not coming out and he said if I don't come back tell the boss to hire somebody else you know the problem is is we never cut down to business with God just like that just like that man was out there in that field that time and he said lord if you don't give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't find a bear of bones right here one because people don't come to that and you know what it's just like it doesn't require that all the time but you know what you've got to mean business with God you've got to meet him and men and sell out everything but people don't know how to do that people don't know how to sell out people's are well you know they just want to come up here and have brother Dale lay hands on and you know that's gonna fix their problems it takes more than that you know the whole of the whole world the whole world and the whole theology of the whole wide world is to come up here and we're just gonna believe that's like the whole theology of the whole wide world is just to believe you know God done it all and he does it all and all we got to do is just believe in him and he could do everything else what the thing is is you know what you got to put a little time in a little effort in yourself I mean can you can you imagine how many of you ever went to school and so you know I never cracked the book I never read well you know what how many how many of y'all would like to stick your hand in that panel over there Hemet Hemis ever worked on electricity how many one put your hand in that panel right there how many people won't work on it well you know what the thing is if you've never if you've never had to experience one because it takes a little time you know because you know what everybody thinks well you know you just jump in and everything but you know what there's a time that you got to open a book and you know what when I went to school you know we had books and you know they come out there and they give us things and you know we had to read well you know what if you don't read if you don't study that how the world gods ever gonna speak to you god no said I'll speak to you in the wind why because he ordained a way to speak to you this was this was what the Holy Spirit they said the scripture but they Peter said did the Holy Spirit came upon me and they were moved to write as a Holy Ghost spoke to him they were moved by the Holy Ghost to write and you know what he's kept this all the way down through here all those years and everything and you know what this right here is vindicated and everybody and people people don't pick this up and read it and when we got people well you know we're just gonna we're just gonna listen to what the Prophet had to say we're gonna listen to what they'll have a prophet had to say well you know what brother Branham said the only way that you go get closer to God he didn't say sitting listening to me he said how do we get closer to God he said it more than once he said read your Bible and pray he didn't say just listen to me Mom because he said finally he said faith final resting places in the word he said then you've got to come back to the word you've got to read this one because what he said on those tapes lays right here but it takes but he takes more than just listening to brother Branham and I don't and I don't I don't not listening to brother Branham one bit I think I think we ought to listen to anymore the thing is you've got to get in this word right here why because everything that brother Brent have said come out of here people are trying to find where everything your brother Branham said well this is wrong we can't figure this out whatever what the thing is is you got to go back to the word and the problem is is everybody's trying to figure it out on their own like they got the mentality to do that like they got the mentality to do that you know the old saying that says it's a better to be thought a fool then open your mouth and remove all doubt and the other saying is is there's only one successful substitute for brains and that's silence that's why we need to be but if we can listen to God and allow him to speak then he can speak to us then how do we get robed in His righteousness by the plan that he give us he give us the word and we get in the word and if you're in the word then the word gets in you because you know it takes it takes an experience with God but you know other thing is if you don't get because if you know if you're not in the word and digging in the word and land before God in the word then you know how is he ever gonna speak to you because it's just like it's just like speaking a foreign language because God you know because we're carnal and there's enmity between us but you know what there comes a time when you start to learn the heavenly language why because you become one with him that he can speak to you that he becomes able to speak to you oh through your journey you know sometimes it takes it takes a little while for people to get to the place where they can stop and listen listen to what God wants to say to them to listen to what God is speaking but then you know it takes a little bit time but you know what God will come on the scene and speak to you this is from the message secondhand robe he says speaking of Elijah putting on the robe of Elijah he said no Elijah robe wrapped in the robe of Elijah the Prophet what a conquerors March how he walked reading ahead as a conqueror he had heard the promise he felt the power he was walking like a warrior right down to Jordan praise be to God friends every believer this morning this robed and the righteousness of God is walking towards the Jordan Road that's right let atomic bombs come let it your robe and walking as a conqueror amen fear not I have overcome the world yes sir remember what I have overcome the world Christ said that Elijah was walking with a second-handed robe on but feeling like a conqueror correctly coming through the Jordan brother let's let me say this and respects you don't you put on somebody else's rope that's all moth-eaten with doubts with all these defeats and superstitions and some ups and downs has put holes in it and delete all leaking through it leaking all through you put on the robe of the Conqueror Christ don't trust in your church who once taught salvation by the baptism of the Holy Ghost who once stole divine healing and now deny it all eat up with the moss of doubt and everything else put on the robe of him that never lost the battle for your own your road to Jordan amen amen god bless you tonight let's all stand how the musicians come I want to be robed in his righteousness amen and we sing a little song this afternoon brother Jim slowly it's the only song that comes to mind when I think about a robe or a garment and now and I think it's a perfect time and I don't know what cubes so we're gonna try it it's called put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness lift up your voice to sing [Music] Oh amen because you know what when you're down and depressed then there is a road to put on they said put on the garment of praise because your brother Bram said you know you sit around sometimes and he said next thing you know you start thinking about a song singing a little bit start tapping you food okay saying next thing you know to change your whole atmosphere they said saying in the spirit you know what if you're not in the spirit you just start singing till the spirit moves lot of times people don't want to do nothing but you know they're standing there we get over these and people come to church and they won't clap their hands people are afraid or they don't want to get into them they don't want to get into the service but you know what the first thing you need to do is clap your hands if you don't feel like it then you need to raise your hands you know what then all of a sudden you know then you'll get in the spirit homicide then you know piggles all of a sudden your whole atmosphere will change because if you come out here and you worship you you come you come to a service and I guarantee you if you get in the worship service instead of sitting are like a bump on a pickle if you get into the worship service when the preacher comes forth then you know what it makes it easier on him to preach but it also makes it easier on you to receive because you know we come in we've had to work all day today we've had to deal with a whole bunch of things that we didn't want to deal with today I had to come to about a bunch of people and we didn't want to have to talk to or have to deal with a lot of spirits all around but you know what you come in here and put on that garment of praise and y'all decide you know what your atmosphere will change my pickups no water if you if you're like that no wonder brother Brown said then if the Spirit of God is in you he said no water you come wait for them doors to open up I feel good I'm about y'all we're gonna bless you now we're gonna turn back brother Dean now lies heavenly [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] anybody else anybody open holiday to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] right one for the other the Lord would bless and all right you're dismissed you
