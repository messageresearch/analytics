a lot of work to be done so this morning we're studying just continuing our study on what what is that gen seed and just kind of meditating on this um weighty subject let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word and come together with these precious Believers of this light precious faith and I pray God that you'll be with us today Lord encourage us Lord Jesus we're so coming with expectation of what we're you're going to bring to us today I pray God as you'll help us that you'll settle our minds and prepare our hearts Lord to receive the word be with us today we pray in your name amen so uh we've been meditating on Romans 9:13 it says as as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated which is taken from uh Paul's quoting from Malachi that says I I have loved you sayith the Lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness and uh as we meditate on these things we're thinking about how that even before Jacob and Esau were born that God had them uh had Jacob in his eternal thoughts so much to the point that it was an attribute of God waiting to be expressed and if you lay that out in time the word that's when we're hearing the word is actually expressing the thought that God had before the foundation of the world so we know the seed is the word that's expressing the genetics of God as you hear the word you're actually expressing the genetics but so but even even let's as we're meditating on this let's let's get in our mind that even before you hear your first sermon even before you you hear the first thing about God but you are already in God's mind now that's that's the that's the maybe the the the kicker there is but even before you ever knew anything about God that that you were already in God's mind and so the god predestines based on his forn knowledge so he knew that when you heard it you would want it and so he he can begin to lay things out in place and like brother R would say breed this one to this one breed that one to that one and work things out so that even before you heard your first sermon that things are already working out because God knows that you would believe it and and and uh you can kind of see that it's it's honestly difficult to kind of Artic you that's why I keep stressing you've got to you got to sit under the old apple tree and meditate on these things because we can preach it and teach it and those kind of things but there's this aspect that uh we'll never be able to relay with words over the pulpit that you just got to God God has to speak to you and reveal these things to you and that will give you a real understanding that you can just hang on to something when you you've got to have a personal relationship with God it's got it's got to be God to reveal these things to you and brother R would like in the message communion he would say things that are that are really honestly hard to understand about how he would talk talk about how when he was a little child and I'm going to go to this next slide and let's just think about this when when he was a little child his mother and his father were you know alcoholics they were not they they were not he was not raised in a Christian home at all but and and they would have their parties that would last all night he you you think about how he would say that they're they're having their drunken parties way into the early hours in the morning and him not knowing anything about Christianity but he just couldn't stand it he' he'd go and he'd sit by the river and he' he'd look down at the flowers coming up out of the after the cold winter he'd look at the frost he'd looked down at the flowers coming up and he'd begin to think flower where where are you coming from like I I why was was after the cold Frost has has gone over the Earth and and we just had a ter hard cold winter and and where is this flower coming from and you think about these Stars reflecting from eternity into the river that he's sitting next to and and and he would frame it up like this there was another William brandom another now what does that mean I've got hear this picture it's not like another person standing over to the side but it's him in time that the person that you are in time as a sinner is just a temporal a temporary thing who you're really supposed to be is is is a reflection the expression of God's thought from eternity that's that that that little that little moment in time where you were a sinner is just a blink and and down here in time where it's it's not who you're really supposed to be you're really that little boy sitting there running away from his mom and daddy having their drunken parties all night where he'd say sometimes I'd go home and I'd lay on top of the roof just waiting for the sun to come up because he was trying to get away from all that stuff that wasn't really who he was supposed to be really who he was supposed to be was that evangelist that would go around the world seven times and preach the gospel that when he heard the word it Quicken what did it Quicken it quickened the thought about him that God had before the foundation of the world so now that's that's where we get we get kind of uh confused in our mind there's these two things that are happening one is the seed is the word that you hear but the other is that God thought about you before the foundation of the world and when you hear the word it's quickening that thought so we there's a balance there right down between those two things you and we'll we'll we that's where I'm going in this little lesson we there's a tendency for us to gravitate toward one or the other well and and and we'll look at that in just a moment but let's in in God's mind in his thought his thought it's already finished you think in his thought he already saw all the way down to the end and he knew that brother brandham was not just going to be a little a child of some some some little catholic or whatever you know know that uh didn't know anything just somebody sitting next to the river not not having any purpose in his life but he was going to be called to preach the gospel and he was going to express that thought that God had before the foundation of the world and it was already finished just like in Revelation where it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the found from the foundation of the world so he God already saw that Jesus would die for our sins he already saw that in him were attributes that were going to be expressed he already saw and it was already finished the whole plan was already finished now that's a that's a weighty thing to think that God already knew where you would end up where you'd go to church what you would be in life he already knew you know we're stressing and worrying about things and and uh landslides in Tennessee and and all he already knew it all and he already had it prepared he already had everything situated for you and he already had the word ready for you that knowing that as soon as you heard it you would want it so the view from eternity is that a Christian doesn't become God's child only at the moment of their rebirth but rather the new birth manifest in time what was always true it's it's always true that's why Paul would say Galati in Galatians 4:9 because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father and John chapter 10 he said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand which is why Jesus could go around with knowledge and call each one all of his disciples by name having known them before the foundation of the world not going to to to Matthew the little tax collector by chance well I hope he's going to follow me I hope he's going to want me more than all that money he's getting by being a tax collector and working for the Roman Empire no he he knew that when he as soon as he presented him with the word he was going to want it and so you're brother Brown was saying the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he said before there even was a moon stars or a molecule you are already Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning and then Christ is revealed in his own word he said if we are Sons and Daughters of God then we are attributes of God then we got eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then there you are when that's in there there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever remove it that's the tie poost of the Soul now you begin to realize that that's that's the reason why sometimes at these at at camp meetings and and and youth meetings the these quotes are are are preached even though maybe the young people don't really fully understand all the technicalities and things there's there's a power and understanding that that that God thought about you before the foundation of the world and and when you really catch even begin not fully catch it but just even partly you it begins to open up to you it will bring Liberty in somebody's life to think that there's a plan there's a purpose in your life and that you're that your little sin journey and all the things that you go through you know it it it it it there's something beyond that like brother brandom sitting there next to the river there's there's more there's a greater purpose than just running away from uh you or you start thinking about you know when I was a kid I I didn't like going to the skate we go to the skating ring and and and they'd be playing that rock music and you're just like I I don't like it and and uh there there's but there's something more there's something working there's something working there and that because there's a greater purpose for your life than just that kind of stuff and this morning in church age brother R will say it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thought false thought and decree Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated in other words it's not it's we're nothing without the word when he he sent his word so that it would catch us up into the plan and purpose of our life and you're not going to be there's no purpose in your life if you not if you don't hear the word and respond to it so it's not that that sinful perp person that's predestinated but it's the word that is predestinated eternally so when you hear the word and you respond to it you're caught up into the plan and purpose of God that he thought of before the foundation of the world but he knew he always knew that you would want it so he knew you were going to respond to it so he he was able to predestinate that way he said see it was the thought now that's really the key of the whole thing it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you so God's Eternal purpose and decree predestines the word within specific individuals for certain plans not just a person in isolation the focus that is not on predes ining individuals arbitrarily but on predestin the word that they will ultimately receive and live by so that means that the life that we're living right now is the thought that God had before the foundation of the world Amen and how how is the thought expressed well a word is a thought expressed so the word that we're preaching and the word that you hear when you play a tape just like we were listening to that tape a moment moment ago the thought expressed is the word so the word is expressing the thought so you're the thought now there we're where we're getting to is that that thought is expressed in Matthew 13 we're getting to in a moment that you are part of God you're an attribute of God and that thought of God had to be expressed and on the other side of the equation is the word that you hear which is the seed the seed preached expresses the thought I need to slow down I know this is this is uh this is weighty the voice of the sign brother R said there was a little woman a prostitute up here was black as it could be she was Ill Fame but down in her heart she was predestinated to life and then when Jesus the word came on the scene those Pharisees said this man is be elub what did it do it blackened out what little light they had Jesus said you are of your father the devil and his works you do but when this little foul woman come and she seen the word of God she know it she didn't live it but she knowed it and as soon as it spoke to her she said I perceive your prophet and he she said I know the Messiah will do this and he said I am he what did it do it cleaned out the Blackness and made it all white why there was a seed laying there a predestinated seed that was he he he said he he clearly says what that predestinated seed is it was God's thought before the foundation of the world right if you really start meditating on it's it's almost like a circle that God knew God knew before the foundation of the world what your reaction would be so he could he you were part and an an eternal attribute in his thoughts and then now looking down you you can say where brother R frames it like with the reason she believed because she was a thought why was she a thought cuz he knew she would have want it he's looking at her reaction before the foundational World she's going to want it so he can predestinate her or why'd she want it cuz she's a thought and God's M that's just amazing to me doesn't that get y'all excited that I I love this that this this this is something this I'm telling you this is why it's preached in youth meetings and things because you see this and you start recognizing that you you're part of God before the foundation of the world oh it's it's it's rich now he said and knoweth it not he said I was in Christ you were in Christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him his children that was in him he came the word came to express himself and preach the word so that the word would Express you now now here we got the two extremes let's meditate on this for a few minutes before we close here's the two extremes some people on the one side and I've set across the table from people that that believe this well I come to the world with eternal life already in me this is the left box I I came with eternal life and when I was born again was just like the veil was yanked off of me and I realized oh I already had it to begin with and like there was a speck of life that would put on a PowerPoint slide or something or or you know they want to look under a microscope and say well you already had eternal life in your soul when you come and when you were born again we're they're redefining what it means to be born again to say well you you already had it to begin with and when you were born again you just realized that you already had it there's a truth to that though there's a truth to that but but you can't make it that you already had the life of God like that there's a quote in the message identification that says when you were born in sin shapen in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies and there was nothing in there there was nothing but then you look at the quote in a thinking man's filter and he said down in there down in your soul was eternal life it was always in there hold on now you got to reconcile reconcile those two things so that's what we're trying to do there's there's nothing in there there but there's something there and what that something is it's a Concrete thought of the Living God that that is so concrete that those attributes could shout for Joy before the foundation of the world so it's something but it's nothing now that's why it's difficult to articulate it's something but it's nothing so you on the left hand side you go to the extreme well I come to the world already with eternal life well hold on now what are you talking about then on the other s side there there was nothing there there was nothing there until you heard your first sermon the seed is the word and so uh because the seed is the word I nothing nothing happened at all and there was no nothing going on before I heard my first sermon now hold on then then you wipe away all the predestination you're wiping away all the for knowledge you're wiping away that God could breathe this one to this one and this one to this one that that God was that you had an angel watching over you from your birth because God knew that you would be you would receive it you're wiping away all that because you're looking at it so dogmatically the other side so that's those two extreme there's a balance right there in the middle that is addressed by Matthew 13 so if you look at Matthew 13 it's the parable of the two of the soers and and one when one Parable the parable is the seed is the word and the other Parable the seed is is the children of the Kingdom so in one Parable you've got the attributes of God waiting to be expressed and the other Parable you've got the word that is the seed that's going to express those attributes now these two parables are extremely important to understand this principle and you won't find you won't find these two parables in any other gospel Luke Mark any other all the other ones it's just the parable of the so went forth the soul and all the different the four the parable of the four soils the good ground the seed on the Wayside and so forth and where the good ground is where the seed Falls that's where it's going to come up but only Matthew Matthew 13 is the parable where the seed is the children of the kingdom and so that puts these two extremes together that there's you are a thought you were a thought in God's mind before the foundation of the world and brother Brandon would Express that thought in his sermons as down in your soul there's like another you where where is it what what is it something that you could put under a microscope something some somebody that's like standing like another body or something no it but but that's that's the way that brother brandom expressed it is that there's something else what is it it's something that God knew that you would come to a Target in your life that he was that that that's why this message had to come to bring us to the place that God thought of us before the foundation of the world and see the thought is not just you being born again it's but you coming to an adopted son and and all those things that the word would be so fully expressed in the brides in in in this last day that you would be the living and B the full expression of the son of man revealed in this day would be the expression of the thought the attribute of God so he would say now now now we're going to get into some quotes now if you don't really understand these things then you hear somebody preach it over the pull pit and you'll shy back from it and you're like I think he's saying something that he's not so let's read some of these more difficult quotes The God Who is rich in Mercy he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids now he's talking about before you ever heard anything about the gospel that's now this is what stumbles us here before you you didn't know nothing about the gospel like brother brandham sitting beside that River he didn't know nothing when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that now I I think it's wonderful we were fellowshipping the other other day with some of the some of y'all in here and you get around the the supper table or you start talking about these things and we all had this testimony you start testifying yes I experienced that and the other across the table I did and you go around and and these Believers that are born again I think it's amazing and astounding how you start getting around with Believers and they've all got this testimony and and I can't help it if somebody does all I know is I got this testimony it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then now there hold on a second life in me what kind of life not not eternal life like already expressed but that's why brother preach that sermon the Deep calleth for the Deep it's it's like the story of the duck in the in the barnyard you know you want water but you don't know what water is and one day you sniff the water and you get a sense of the water that's what I've been wanting all my life there's the water you were the duck in the barnyard and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to a church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you be being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from like the duck the duck in the barnyard you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always start don't start choking now now you hadn't heard the word but yet there was a representation the th and youth it was like another William Brandon was waiting to come up there was another Bob black this wasn't the Bob black when I was a sinner it wasn't the Bob black That was supposed to be expressed uh it was but it was in me it was it was in me not in me that I could look like under a microscope or something or put as a little dot on a PowerPoint slide but it was in me something there waiting to be expressed laying there in the thought of God and it was going to be expressed by the word which is the seed because the seed expresses the word the word that was a thought of God before the foundation of the world the word seeing the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it now there's those two parables in Matthew 13 the word that you heard saw the word and expressed it that's right and now like that quote where brother R said God thought it he spoke it and now here you are now here you are Christian sitting on the Pew the expressed word for your day so hear in the word is the realization it expresses a spiritual truth that existed all along from God's Eternal perspective and God from from God's Eternal view looking over the banister of Heaven you always were Eternal you always were a Son of God you always were part of him but it had to be expressed here in time so even before now here's Here's the Clincher that we really want to get even before before someone consciously chooses to accept and follow God there's a Divine component already at work life though not realized at that time is waiting to be expressed s through receiving the word by faith and the message communion and I'll I'll stop right I guess the musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll start winding down with this quote he said I used to remember as a little boy I hope I'm not holding you too long but no one's sitting out in the on the creek Bank and this is the quote that I Illustrated earlier with that picture of brother R sitting next to the creek I'd sit there and look around at night time pop and Mom they're gone on now to their rest and them days they were Sinners there was no Christianity in our homes at all no Christianity in our homes at all I keep stressing that point so we'll get some and all my drinking and parties and carrying on it made me sick I tell take my Lantern and my dog and go to the woods to stay all night in the winter time I'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over i' laid on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then I think of how that times then being out there in the summertime get my sticks and put them down for a little Windbreak where if it rained lay there and have the poles sticking in the water fishing now think about him fishing trying to get away from all that partying that his family was doing all night long couldn't hardly get any peace of mind all that racket and everybody shouting and hollering and laughing and and he's he can't stand it my old dog laying there I'd say look at here you know last winter I camped right here one night I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree and I had a fire here it was froze five inches deep in the ground but Little Flower where did you come from see well and where did you come from Who come out here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of but what about it where did you come from see that little flower I'd say why it was froze and everything and I built a fire on top here besides the freezing element there was a heat element laying here on a big old log where I burned you and yeah here you are and you're alive where did you come from that flower was the expression of something that looked like there wasn't nothing there he burned a fire on top of where that flower come from and now the same thing as you and I where did you come from well what was it there was another William brandom see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working God bless you Saints [Applause] [Music]
