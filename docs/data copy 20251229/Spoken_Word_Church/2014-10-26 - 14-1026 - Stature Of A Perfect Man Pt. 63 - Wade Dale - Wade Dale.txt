========================================

what is of juner I'm sorry Jer we'll have to look that up burn in juniper tree soon you talking about the smell of it for those of you that uh all right turn on here thank you we got we got we cooking with grease now people but uh but if you did bring your book go to paragraph 328 if you want to read along if not you read right here I don't remember that pole being middle it uh it hadn't move mom that go way can you see that now over turn it that way way can y'all see it listen you can see that an angle I'm okay all right now we've been talking about the Statue of perfect man now we're going to read what the prophet says and we're going to read and then we'll make some comments but I want to get to the Blasphemous names part and listen there's this is tricky to understand it's like brother Louise said last Sunday many people in the message many people in the message teach that you get that you got to get all these virtues before you get the Holy Spirit a lot of people yeah okay right M that's right A lot of people do and and that's not true at all that's not according to the Bible it's not according to the prophet's message okay so if it I've got two witnesses there that's enough for me right and the teaching of this church is you must be born again at faith that when you get to this holy spirit that is an anointing not different from the holy spirit that you received but it is to a degree a little bit different because it's anointing that comes on you I'll read it in just a minute watch this but we'll go to if we got enough time we'll go to Blasphemous name cuz brother Bram says the true baptism now this one down here wasn't false that's but now Revelations 3:14 says the faithful and true witness Jesus talking about Jesus that didn't mean he was false at one time and become true that meant he was true all way through I understand that brother Brown explained that in the in the um Church age book he said the faithful and true witness not that everything else was false or that he was false and become true cuz see in our brain we go well this is false but it become true right you can't take something that's false and make it true you can't that's right if it's false it's like Brother D talking about Wednesday night if it's true it's true if it's false it's false okay now remember trly we were false in our birth okay right but the true baptism of the Holy Ghost okay came to us at a new birth all right right to make us positive okay to make us positive but then there's anointing that that comes on because remember there's got to be anointing of this Holy Spirit to take you into a different level that must most people will never see um most all these Church age Messengers will never see past that or have never seen past that they're already gone on they can't attain to that that's why Paul said they without us cannot be made perfect they without us cannot be made perfect all right so that doesn't mean that we're false down here and then we become perfect no we we receive the perfect perfect New Birth in our soul but now remember our spirit still has memory reason reasoning there's no reasoning in the center realm the center realm is either Faith or doubt that's right there's no reasoning in the center realm if you reason on the word of God you're reasoning in your spirit that's right right right that's right you can't reason in your soul that's right that soul is the perfect word of God that never sined a day in his life amen Hebrews 13:8 like Brother D was talking about w not Jesus Christ came yesterday today and forever that Soul that's in you now it's not your soul that came somewhere that's God's Soul right come to you at the new birth right brother R said vulcanize the only time he ever says vulcanize is in this statute perfect man vulcanize that together and you and him become one as person so you're not that's why brother said I don't believe in pre-existence of Soul so we weren't pre-existing in the in the condition that that you had a soul and you were walking around on Earth on up in glory and you had a soul because you were predestinated no you were predestinated in the gene of God the gene seed of God like me um just we're all adults here males have sperm right now I don't have all the sperm I'm going to need for the rest of my life to produce children now you sisters have all the eggs right so you've got all the eggs your egg you're not going to produce any more eggs they're all laying in you somewhere but now ale if you'll if you'll study this a male sperm is produced from the spinal cord yeah the blood is like brother it's highly conal blood the blood is compacted together and by a chemical process goes down into the testicles okay I mean I'm I'm making a point I want you to realize something but remember Josh was not in me in that sperm form when I was in my day because sperm if you don't use it let's be plain it's it's it comes out sometimes during sex and all the things like that well see that's that's all seed that's right but there was one that was predestinated that come Josh Dale but now but Josh Dale couldn't be me couldn't be in me in sperm form that's why brother BR said you were in your great great grandfather you weren't in your great great great grandfather as a that as a as sperm form you were in genetic form your jeans the jeans that you have come on in yeah we I knew they were coming I just didn't know when they going to get here and we have a molecular biologist with us today and she's going to explain DNA I left the spot for you for you no put you on the spot listen you're already standing up tell every by your name Grace okay that's sister Grace and she go she goes to brother Jean Williams Church in uh Anderson okay and then you stand up and tell them your name hi I'm Shan she's a Florida F yeah no and your sister I'm Christina hi you stand up CH she's Christina Christin I'm Dena amen good to meet him good to have you with us today and everybody knows his Chris but as we were talking about it's genetic form it's Gene form that we are in not in a in an act okay so as we're born again we're born again we're we come from the gene of God cuz remember God doesn't have sperm he doesn't he's spoken word but the genetic form that we are comes from the Bible it comes from the strands that was in God that genesis: 126 man let us make man in our own image well now the reason that my son looks like me the reason he was created in my image is because he has my genetic makeup that's why he doesn't look like Bob's kid right he looks like my kids cuz he came from my genetic makeup so we come from the genetic makeup of God now we come human form right become human form babies born just like we were talking about there in the Bible from the fruit of the womb which was the mother all right but when we come to be born again we're born again Jesus said from above Nicodemus said do I need to go back into my mother's womb well see he was thinking natural thoughts but God said no you got to be born from above so the the quickening power of God the gene seed of God had to come to Quicken you bir you into another family remember it's out of and into two right you got to come out of this family right brother said I'm not the son of Charles n Bram I'm a Son of God now he didn't deny where he came from you couldn't cuz his mom say no I know he came from me but when he realized that the one inside of him was so much God till he said no I'm a Son of God so this when we start down here at the bottom of the pyramid you are a son of God you have the genetic makeup of God that's right amen we believe in this church you get born again here and then you go up through this process of growth development all right now here your newborn babies Romans 8 says we won't put it up there but Romans 8 says 8 says what you you receive the spirit of adoption see this is adoption here right this is adoption this is not adoption you come into the family you receive the spirit of adoption in other words I can't adopt Ryan's children sure Naturally I could if something happened to them too and they passed away I'd adopt his kids that's natural but I can't adopt his kids because they're his kids so God can't adopt the devil's kid cuz they're not his they're not part of that Genesis 126 man but if you're part of that Genesis 126 man you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry cry out by father crying as baby right Paul says you can drink milk but you need the sincere meat you need the meat of the word so that Spirit of adoption is the holy spirit we receive that's correct Spirit of adoption right because you in other words you're in line for adoption if you're not born again you're not going to be in line for adoption right just because you're in the message and been in the message 30 years message has no seniority this message has zero seniority somebody could come in the message and be in the message 30 years just use you for an example we grew up together sister Fred and I did and and now things are being quickened to you that may be it was quickened to somebody else that may be only in the message a year right so God he does so he's not a respector of person but when you make yourself available for the word right see you got to make yourselfself available because we're not going to get into this weekend this week but the word is the seed you're looking at see the word this is the genetic makeup of God this is the only thing we got to go by this is the if you want to see my genetic makeup look at my kids if you want to see God's genetic makeup look at his kids but we have to reflect back to here right because the remember the so went out to what so seed right and the disciple says well what are you talking about he said then he broke it down he said okay the so is the son of man what that's God in human flesh a preacher hello a preacher we don't believe God in human flesh is Jesus 2,000 years ago or William brand 50 years ago I believe if you're born again you got your God in human flesh standing here today if you're going to hear like we talking about down in in Mobile that's a little but they got it good if you're going to hear from MDC you're going to hear from him through me right that's right cuz MDC was God in human flesh preaching to Abraham amen amen amen so if you're going to hear it from Brother je forny this morning that's God in human flesh talking to you there's MDC the priest remember he's a high priest MDC is a high priest he's the one that's talking to you he talked to Abraham didn't he right amen amen so this is the gene seed of God right here right it's not some little seed runs around somewhere and it's in your body somewhere this is it here cuz the sewer went out and Seed the seed cast it threw it out some fell on good ground some fell on ground that was hard some fell on ground that didn't get watered very well it's the situation that you put it in it's the situation you put the seed you know I can take seed out there and I go what I found in concrete and say oh dear Lord give me a crop right I'm doing it a miss or I'm doing it I'm doing it by iniquity cuz I know better I know the law the law says you got to put it in the ground it's got to have moisture it's got to have warmth for it to crack that seed and to bring the life out okay that's the same thing with the statute of a perfect man we're born again here at Faith and then add to your faith add to your faith you see what Peter says add to your faith so in other words it's my possession brother say this is my eye God gave it to me right okay it's God's holy ghost but when he give it to me it's mine he's not an Indian giver so he don't want it back he wants me to give it to somebody else okay so you come up through here and we're going to read now we've already come up and for those of you that that are that are new today we've already been through this is number 63 so we've been 63 Sundays on this statute of perfect man starting at faith and going all the way up to brotherly kindness and we're right here where it says Holy Spirit and many people teach that you have to get all these virtues to get the Holy Spirit we do not believe that because the prophet didn't teach it or the Bible doesn't teach it you have to take everything back to the Bible second Peter says having the divine nature of God add to your faith now what's the divine nature of God that's right that's a new birth you can't be divine without having God the devil's not Divine that's right if the Divine divine nature see there's that nature that comes the gene yes right I walk like my grandfather um Mama's daddy of course I can't see behind me thank God but when I walk she says you walk like your grandpa the reason I walk like my grandpa is cuz I have his genetic makeup in me okay you understand what I mean so The Way We Walk it's because we have the genetic makeup of our father that's right that's right because remember New Jer Jalem is your mother the scripture says ain't that pretty girl that's my grandbaby not this one that one easy genetic makeup of God is Faith CU that's what at the bottom these are the traits these are the Hey listen these are family traits okay okay we a't got into that we got to get closer to the family part now but these are family traits right right that's right each family has a different trait that's right each some some family you know like to do this and that and the other and we're all different as far as humanly genetically make up our genetic make up different but when we receive the soul of God that takes us out should takes us out of that human nature right kills the nature not the soul kills the nature that's on that Soul that's right amen man you kill the soul you die that's right so it kills the nature that's attached to that Soul cuz when you were born into this world you received the nature that what that was contrary to God Amen cuz you were born contrary to God why Jesus told nicodem said you must be born again cuz you weren't born right the first time right Jesus but now remember Jesus could say that because he was born right he was born spoken word that's right so he could say You must be born again he didn't say Nicodemus mean you need to be born again he said you need to be born again and then when Nicodemus took the carnal application said well I got to go back in my mother's womb be born again he said no you got to be born from above right so this is being born from above and then we display the attributes are the genetic makeup of God because remember in scripture in the scripture you see all these words right you see all these traits and characteristics all up the statue of perfect man and thank God that that God sent a prophet that could put the thing together for us cuz Peter even Peter couldn't stand there when he wrote it and and put it together like this right that's right that's right he couldn't that's right he had a partial Revelation on what he spoke right right CU Paul had a partial Revelation he said we which are alive and remain that's right well he ain't a we no more that's right he's not a we he's dead he's waiting on WE that's right waiting on us to come to what Perfection right right be therefore perfect or complete this is completeness but let's read we didn't get to it last week hardly going to get to it this week I get to talking too much well you are that clock is fast okay now in building The Virtue building this Monument building this stature not a statue right a statue doesn't move that's right stature is growth development that's right like we were talking about giving the keys of the car to a kid for those of you that are new we did it last week see when you were say Zoe there's Zoe there give her the keys and let her drive your car let her drive your car she got to all that fart you call I told you I was going to pick on well now wait a minute she's got the same ears you have she's a human she's got a nose two eyes she has the capability of having children but in the form she's in baby form yeah she can't produce like an adult right but wait a minute she's a human she's got two legs she can touch the gas metal if you get her down there far enough she touch The Brak well why can't we give her the key cuz she's a baby she has not developed enough mentality to handle the situation of driving a car but yet she can yet she has all the ability to do it same way with God when you're born again you're born into the body of Christ you have all these potentially M right all right I said potentially you have all these right cuz God don't sit there and and you know hand stuff out like cards that's right right but remember the teaspoon of the ocean has the same ingredients of the ocean but it's in a small quantity that's right but see God wants us to step out of that teaspoon and get into the ocean this is the ocean okay okay but you got the same makeup she's got the same makeup as all you sisters in here right but she's not her growth development has not come to a place to where she can be mature enough to handle the situation of driving or being a mother or all these other things you understand what I'm saying so the I what I do is is the natural things I see I can put it in the Bible and I can put it in prophet's message because he said an illiterate person can receive the Holy Ghost that's somebody can't even read so you must have to be able to see to understand see to understand all right so we see that you're given the ability once you move into this family watch now building The Virtue building this Monument building this stature see it starts out with a foundation stone Fai virtue knowledge temp brother kindness and what does it do then they're waiting for The Headstone which is love for God is love and he controls he is the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here see I got in between all these Works in here these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down now in the original drawing like I said I've seen it one time and daddy may have it somewhere but they the original drawing that brother random Drew there's squiggly lines that go down through here from this holy spirit so that's what what he saying right here here these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down through Christ SE Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together what did we talk about last Sunday to weld something you need two pieces you can't weld just one piece where you going to weld it to you got to have two pieces so it's you m and God the Holy Ghost welding all this together and sealing it in so this is this is the holy spirit Christ coming down Christ is what the anointed so he's going to anoint you with these virtues seal you in now listen the holy ghost coming down through Christ the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a what an almost perfect Church wait a second perfect oh perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off because remember that's got to come down here that's that's why Christ has to come here before we go there it's not us coming up here we come to a place it's God coming down Christ came down in 1963 two brother ranom but has he come to you right you got to have an experience like brother Bram had not an experience of a prophetic experience but you got to have an experience if God's going to say and and let me say this one make this one statement even Jesus Christ when he came up to the River Jordan we know he didn't need the Holy Ghost cuz he was born with it or he couldn't tell Nicodemus you must be born again but there was a there was a Dove came down and a voice from Heaven said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell stop right he say hear ye him heop he said this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell well you know what God said the same thing the day you got born again he said this is my beloved Son our daughter in whom I'm pleased to dwell if God give you the new New Birth there's something about you he's pleased to dwell okay but now you go on several years later Jesus had to walk brother B said and even the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge and favor with man and the Bible says being made perfect now Jesus didn't need need to be made perfect in his soul that's right or his Spirit but he had to bring that body under subjection right right that's right so he comes up through here and then he comes up into Matthew 17 up on a mountain and God comes down now and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him in other words I have instilled everything that I need into this man right here and if you're going to get anything from me the father if you're going to get anything from me you're going to get it through that guy right there so they so God takes brother Bram he comes to this position brother Bram comes up to a mountain and God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell here ye him amen go back to Jeffersonville cuz see this is the seals this is not the seals people for those new ones uh Paul had all this Peter had all this he couldn't preach about it right right see we're not coming to brother brand brought us up to a place and if he would have stopped right here there would have had to been somebody come cuz the headstone has got to come amen right so brother Brown said not in the years of preparation this is getting us ready to receive this that's right this is getting the flesh under this is getting the flesh under and the spirit cuz remember see our spirit is not the Holy Spirit that's right right our spirit has memory reason right conscious affection imagination there's none of that in God as far as the your birth right cuzz you can't you can't imagine having the Holy Ghost now you either got it or you don't that's right but that's the filter that we're talking about we several weeks ago we talked about the filter cuz if you got God in here and there's the new birth now that's God Genesis 1:26 man that never sin a day in its life if you're born again that's what you have in your soul right but since we've been born into this Fallen condition our body and spirit and soul needed Redemption right but the soul gets redeemed first right when you're born again your soul is redeemed it's not faith and doubt that's right it's Faith or doubt that's right one of the two doubt or faith then you come out into the second realm which is five senses memory reason conscious F and Imagination now listen it doesn't matter about the first five the first five just giv you to contact this world see taste feel smell and hear and you can abs absolutely fool all five of those senses right right go to a magician or go to some a hypnotist or something they can fool those five senses right so that's just given to you as a filter to contact the world you see through your eyes but God wants you to see that's right not see through your eyes that's right but see through your heart right okay but the memory reason conscious effects and Imagination my problem is in my reasoning my memory of what I did before I got bornn again cuz it didn't go away right but you got to bring it under subjection that's right right conscious M imagination there's no imagination in God that's right so what God has to do is is he has to come down through all that and birth you and then work his way back out through your memory reason conscious faction imagination cuz you're using your memory now and your reasoning to reason out what I'm saying that's true and either it either like brother BR said it either that symbol goes ding or it goes bong one of the two but you're working back out that's right you're working back out through the senses but Satan can still get all the way down into that Spirit realm and that's where the flu are memory reason conscious faction imagination that's the Devil's Playground right but also God has to use them for you to contact him are we reasoning together right now we're reasoning together right now which is not bad if you're if you're doing it from a spiritual aspect but if you're reasoning saying well this man over here said I don't care what that man said if if brother Bram said and the Bible said you got to be born again before you receive these you got to be in a family before you receive these things you can't be the devil's kids and have these virtues and be Godly virtues these are divine nature of God not just nature I mean there are some people that have worldly knowledge that's true but this ain't worldly knowledge this is the knowledge of almighty God to reason right right or wrong because you're going to set up there brother J for is going to be preaching and you're going to reason whether he's preaching the truth or error I mean we've been some of us for sure have been sitting in other churches and hear a false Doctrine I heard and something go off uncertain sound if it didn't right it's an uncertain sound but if something don't go off you're in trouble that's right that's right cuz I've been here I've heard one we were at one place and I tell you this before we leave 600 people were in the crowd and they were up shouting except for about eight of us and I thought God are we so wrong yeah you Tre was there too it was false it was false I wasn't going to amen something that false tell what they said I don't don't matter you got to reason that out yourself but I thought are we that wrong and some spoke and says no fear not little flock that's right but something rang in my heart that said that's not the truth now buddy if that's the holy ghost that ain't the devil cuz the devil will agree with eror before he'll deal before he'll agree with truth that's why they were all shouting I'm not calling them all Devils but they were in a deception right they had their flu had been stopped up cuz you can be in error and have the Holy Ghost okay so you can't be all wrong and just be of the devil no you can have the Holy Ghost and be wrong wrong in your Doctrine for a little while but if truth is ever presented to you like Martin Luther let me finish with this Martin Luther preached a just yah by faith now look if Martin if I was to come and preach Martin Luther's Doctrine today it'd be Antichrist that's right true because he baptized in the name of father son
