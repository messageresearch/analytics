========================================

John three now for those of you that are coming back or been out sick we've got plenty out sick today 20 or so of us out sick brother Dale sick at home and that he's sick at home he's not feeling good so let's just keep him in prayers got a grade fever said he may try to make it this afternoon which I figure he will unless Mama puts a rope around him and makes him not come but we got to quit passing it around everybody's you know passing it around each other but I'm just denied it in the name of the Lord and I don't want it so I don't want it I know sometimes your body has to get rid of these things and that's okay but mine's purging just fine not a problem with that John 3 and what we're going to do is is we're going to call this series a basis of Christianity basis of Christianity um and I don't want to make it to where you think it's aart from the message of the hour but there's a lot of people get can get born again without the message there's going to be Untold millions of people in heaven that's never heard of William Brown right that's going to be a just like me and you Luther Wesley irenius Paul all those Church A's Messengers never heard of William Brown I'm never heard of the message of the hour they had their message of the hour this is the apex of the message of the hour but if we don't get born again we're not going to understand this message you're just going to sit here and you're just going to get a head knowledge when I was 14 years old I was not born again and I can understand the message I understood servant seed I understood things like one God and I could see it and I could read The Prophet's message but I wasn't born again so let's just not let it be something where it's just a reading room where we just over in the message and we believe that William Brandon was a prophet and that's it no Christianity has been around a lot longer than William brandham has been around Christianity is based on Jesus Christ not William brandham right but now without the message you will not fully understand Jesus Christ okay so we're not doing away right but we do have to get a brother brand said we got to get Faith there at the bottom of the pyramid we got to get the new birth first then the Bible says these things will be added to you and I believe that if you are born again you will come to the message of the hour because that is the token in the end time that's right all right A lot of people think that brother R changed his his way of of of preaching salvation that it's just believe the message well the devil believes the message he was right there at every service right but what about the revelation of the message right cuz the Bible tells you the letter kth right the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and it's not what in remember over in Revelations 1 through3 it says what the spirit says to the churches not what the man says what the spirit says to the churches all right so you've got and this is what you got to do if you're a born again Christian you have to somewhere come to the message of the hour and receive that revelation of the message of the hour and then that can be quickened to you right other than that it's just sitting in a Pew and listening into a good preacher and get all this head knowledge I don't want head knowledge Bible says knowledge puff it up right and that's what happens to a lot of to a lot of people we see that now are falling away from the the message goes there they they don't understand it well I thought the Holy Ghost said he was going to be the one that comes and reveals it to you and what Jesus said I'll come back yes and come not with you but in you right be your guide and show you things to come all right now that's a promise of the Holy Ghost so he'll show you a revelation if you'll just ask him go in the right order because let's read chapter 3 we're probably going to wear this out but we're going to read it there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus now Nicodemus was a good what we would call good Christian man right he was he was right up there with the best of the best but yet he could not understand what Jesus was talking about cuz he say he must be born again all right so now let's read There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know we know so he's discussed it with somebody he didn't say I know he says we know we know that thou art a teacher come from God okay so that part was made known to him because they couldn't deny the signs and the Wonders they couldn't deny that he had a Ministry but you're going to find out in a few seconds he didn't understand nothing Jesus was talking about yet he knew he was a great teacher right yet he knew he had something that come from God what he says right here he come from God we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely or listen listen I say to thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God that word see is not see with your eyes that word see is understand if a preacher says do you see what I'm saying that doesn't mean do you physically see what I'm saying that's right he's saying do you understand what I'm saying right see means to understand and Nicodemus did not understand what Jesus was talking about because of his next comment Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old natural carnal conception of the word how can a man be born again when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born now we're talking about a teacher we're talking about a teacher that was right under Gia CIA was the highest and he was like second in command he was the Grown gr man probably in his 40s or 50s maybe and he missed totally what Jesus was talking about because Jesus answered barely barely or listen listen I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit so he's dividing that which is born of the flesh is flesh Nicodemus you're talking about flesh right can I go do I need to go back into my mother's womb something natural all right but thus the born of the spirit is of the spirit okay so we see here that Jesus is still look at verse 7 Marvel not Marvel not he must have looked at Nicodemus and Nicodemus was going cuz he said Marvel not I try to put myself standing there and watching these two Converse like a TV screen like a vision and watch these two men one a great teacher of Israel and one Jesus Christ standing there and he's the very eternal life the word of God and then here walks Nicodemus up void of now he has the word of God in letter but he's void of the spirit of God right right all right now he he'll be given eternal life I believe around said he would for his stand and that's okay but he was never a born again believer so he never really understood what Jesus was talking about neither did the disciples until the day of Pentecost right right they didn't understand what he was saying oh sure there was a few things that when he would explain a parable they go oh well see that's the letter and guess who was in that group The Devil Judas was right there in that group and we were talking about yesterday in ministers meeting well downstairs it wasn't part of the minister meeting well it was last night when we were talking to Faith and him at at the motel our persecution is going to come from within not from outside right because those 12 were sitting around Jesus that night Jesus told them exactly except pointing at him he said the one that Sops in the bowl with me is going to deny me and there was Judas right here is it me Lord all those other 11 did not know cuz remember Jesus said go do what you got to do brother said explaining that and he said they thought he was just going to go pay for the cuz he held the money he was just going to go pay for the food that that AE like there'd be 12 of us here and I'd slip out and go pay the meal and come back well there he was the Devil Himself right son of predition he was sitting there among those 12 but they didn't have the spirit they didn't have the Holy Spirit Jesus knew who he was he said I knew you from the beginning right okay so he knew when he picked it he picked up on his Spirit but see they weren't spiritual enough to pick up on the spirit so they just thought he was going out to pay the you know pay for the food well see they were deceived and there was Jesus the only one that knew what was going on and honestly honestly I don't think Judas knew what he was doing until he did it because when he went down there and they told him what they were going to do to Jesus remember he throwed the money down and the Bible said he went hung himself right cuz that was when and I believe like me and brother Tim was talking about last night Judas wasn't going to the Pharisees to turn Jesus in for something he did wrong that's right I believe what he's doing is like a lot of people nowadays you can take this with a grain of salt or or or whatever that are wanting to go past this message you know past this message and another person's coming or brother Ram's got to come back that's going past the message cuz he said Rapture in faith lays in the books and tapes not in him rting Faith lays in the books and tapes not in William Brown that's right he's dead that's right Moses thy servant is gone he's dead in the body he's dead now we know he's in the sixth Dimension but you know who he's waiting on me and you that's right but Judas when he did what he did I believe he was going he was telling Jesus let's get on with it if you are who you say you are yes see that's what the people are going to do in the message they're going to say hey if you cuz remember brother R said when the bride begins to say I and my father are one the shu's going to pull away right okay because they're religious not born again we're here Born Again of the spirit of God this is a different Spirit than this that's right but we're in the same ranks that's right and this one is going to say if you be who you are let's get on with it well see that's so close and that is blaspheming because that is contributing the act of God to the devil which they're wanting they're wanting see everybody's wanting signs and wonders back to where brother Brown was that was not promised that was promised to him it was not promised to us to have a on man campaign like Willam Bram had that's done that's finished he did that he said that was the bait on the hook to draw them to the message okay to draw them to the message of the hour all right not to uh reform them that's what the problem with Judas was reformed Judas was brought into a religious dis order and reform but Reformation is not restoration that's right he was just reformed that's Alcoholic Anonymous once an alcoholic always an alcoholic that's what they teach you well you can reform from that you can say I'm not going to drink anymore and they teach you how to take this outside man and keep him in control right you know what they do that's right but once you get born again see once born again never an alcoholic again never there's no temptation there's no you can walk by a beer joint and not want to go in it right but they tell you an alcoholic is anonymous just don't go down to the Beer Joint don't get around somebody that drinks don't do this don't do that just do and don'ts but when you get born again and you get a different nature and that's what we're probably not going to get into today but a different nature that nature never wants to drink that's right so you've not been reformed you've been restored but we've got a lot of and I say us have got a lot of reforming that's right where we need some re restoring all right back to the original Faith where it's not going to be where brother R said it's not going to be empty in hospitals it's not going to be like popcorn popping that's right I thought the Bible said it'd be a secret brother R said we'll be gone and nobody ever know it so if we're gone and nobody ever knows it we're not going to make a whole lot of noise right right right now God's going to be so indwelling in me that I believe if I need something he said the third pole lays dormant he said but it will be put in use when it's needed that's right okay that's pretty much a direct quote when it's needed when we The Squeeze comes and if we need a pork chop to eat God will give us a pork chop right God will give us a drink of water that's right he's not going to give us Diet Mountain Dew he's going to give us water of course I would pray that I get a d Mountain Dew CU I like Mountain but he gives us what we need what not what we want that's yeah he gives us what we need not what we want but we've come to this place though to where I want us to see and be able because here is and I didn't bring this quote but I'll bring it next Sunday brother Brown says when we can realize the two spirits in the framework of the church I say in the framework of the message Church okay let's don't to put it out there let's put it right here okay cuz realize one thing if if they have a father son Holy Ghost baptism they're already FAL right they're already FAL God's already moved on from that he wined into ignorance before now he requires us to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a requirement in the end time because he God moved and winked at the ignorance of Luther and Wesley and down Through the Ages and even Pentecost even people like FF Bosworth and people like that great faith healers but really never caught on to the message right you know and I put that in quotations because the message of the hour is Jesus Christ that's right period it's Jesus Christ cuz brother Brandon brought us nothing but Jesus Christ he never pointed us to a man he never pointed us to himself he pointed us to Jesus Christ I think people tend to they don't see Jesus today in the flesh we don't even sometimes realize who we are right you know and and they don't see they see Jesus in the past my mind goes back right to when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here she'll be an invincible Army that brings it right up to here okay sure it was Jesus back there but what about now if we're the last IM morphe of God if we're the last form that God will ever take then there's no other God but us that's strong that's strong hard to swallow but brother Brown said when you say I am my father a one well you know what we're doing we're doing just like Jesus when Jesus walked up to those Pharisees he said I am my father are one and you're of your father the devil right he didn't playay he didn't play no words they thought I was strong yesterday at the ministers meeting and I said I've never got up and called people Hypocrites before Snakes in the Grass Jesus did he said in other words he was pointing at the congregation he said your daddy's different than mine that's right and mine's of God and yours is of the devil uh hadn't seen that yet in the sanctuary but U you never know may come sometime but where we're failing and I'm going to read out of the adoption series and we'll finish reading this I'm going to stop right there because in verse 7 it says Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again brother brand in adoption series 1960 5:15 I'm going to run these off cuz I I'm I'm going to do a little packet so you can read it for yourself and there's where the church is failing today on that wall walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother Bram well that's the truth so he tells the truth that's truth and there's where the church is filing today on that walk not on the seals and the plagues and the vials and the church ages and the and the son of man Min no it's on walk our daily walk that's right there was a question brought up yesterday about the Bible says that the Jews will see the nail prints in Jesus's hand remember they said where'd you get those scars and sit in the house of my friends well somebody was asking well he literally come back and they see the nail prints brother Bram said his feet doesn't hit the earth in his literal Corporal body until the Millennium starts so it has to be those two prophets preaching Christ so much because I want to ask you a question and that's what I posed to the ministers up front yesterday how many of you seen the nail scar how many of you have seen the nail prints in Jesus's hand literally you've never seen it but by Revelation it's so real that's right and I was telling them before Bob's already heard this you know I mean you you take somebody and you say well I see the nail prints in his hands well if your Christ made manifest in another form they should see the they that's right that's good in your they should see your suffering the nail prints the scars that you took he took them all for us right that's right but we're down here in flesh doing the same thing we're taking the brunt of this L of sin age worst age there ever was that's right on the face of the Earth this is the worst a for a Christian to live a Christian Life that's right but he said you can do it that's right so where'd you get those scars in the house of my friends the world we all got scars right we all got scars with past life but that's what Jesus was telling Nicodemus though if you're born again you're born of the spirit not of the flesh so we don't have to be so spiritually minded we're no Heavenly good I mean we're no earthly good we don't have walk around with our you know head in the clouds and and and you know never have a bad thought and just walk around like this you know that's just doing Penance like the Catholic Church they're trying the Catholic church is really trying brother Bob they are trying but they're trying through penants and they're trying through beating the Flesh and you know that's not where it's at they got to start with the inside guy and work the way out all right same way with here where is the church failing on that walk now I want you to listen to this we're going to finish right here and I want you to ponder this in your heart brother bandam was in that prayer line Faith Africa trip report 1952 Battle Creek Michigan said look lady death knocks at your door he's got a lady standing in front of him you believe me to be his Prophet if you'll just listen to God and God will return to you the lady says now I got a question question to ask you and she must whisper brother said yes the lady speaks to brother rown whisper that is true lady what I what I mean is true you listen to what backsliding don't mean didn't don't mean that you've gone somewhere and with a man I'm a little bit of a calvinist see not that radical type but I'm calvinist you was born again but you back slid away from your calling from God is that right and you should have went and done something but you felt like you wasn't able to do it that's right and he goes on and I believe the lady gets her healing but she had to confess something to him and he said I think she might have probably said well I don't believe I'm born again or or I may have done something he said cuz he could feel that Spirit remember the person would walk up he said you have a welcome spirit I see that you're born again I see that you're a Christian cuz the spirits were compared with each other so he must have with this one cuz he said you was born again but you back slid away from your calling from god so let's don't count everybody out um the prodical son everybody thinks the prodical son is somebody that goes out in their Center and they come back to their daddy he was a son when he left right he was part of the family when he went out did things wrong but to show he was a son he came back right remember he got down to the lowest part now there's a fine line and this is what I want you to think about next week for next week my point is when you go out and do I know for a fact when I was 14 years old and when I got up to 17 18 years old when I went out in the world and left home I wasn't born again I knew that but I had the word planted in my heart because I because remember the Bible says train up a child in the way should go and when he's older he won't depart now I wasn't born again go out there doing the things I did right that's the characteristic I want us to start looking at that's right okay but now to backslide brother R we backslide every day right every day we backslide right okay so we backslide every day in other words he said you see what he said you be he said you backslid from your calling from God if you got a calling from God and you don't do that calling you backslid okay brother Bram said the Holy Ghost to go out on the limb and wait on you to call him back right now the Holy Ghost didn't come out of your body and go over there and set on a lamb and he's illustrating that there's something between you and God that you put a wall up you're still born again but you're not letting God your back slid away from your calling from God that's okay find your calling the Bible says make your make your calling and election sure uh if you're going to be a housewife be the best one you can be if you're going to be this or that it be the best one you can be okay I'm going to read one more quote and then we're going to leave God's way that's been made for us 1952 these are way back in the 50s when he was trying to get people born again he was trying to get people to where they could see Jesus Christ not William brandom okay excuse me I followed up another man here not long ago for they talk about a lot of this said he went to one city had 5,000 conversions we followed right behind it not me but a group of ministers and took the cards and followed them back and in 30 days they couldn't find 30 that claimed to be saved you know what I think I think it's conviction instead of conversion when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God what we need today is not a ProTrac of meeting but an oldfashioned God sent Holy Ghost Revival an oldtime sky blue sin killing blood washing religion makes you take them somebody must have stole a tire tool cuz he said make sure you take them tire tools back and do repentance please said make sure you take that tire tool back and repent brother Joe you take a tire to Oh I thought he's raising his hand says that sometimes we don't mean it but sometimes we act like Christians sure sure but it's just like the peacock and the Buzzard the Buzzard can throw all the peacock feathers any he wants but he's still a buzzard or a crow thought what thought what you wanted us to think about you had a question but you know I want you to think about that the where you backslid away from your calling from God I want you to think about your Christian Life and the way you've lived because the way I see it and I see it in churches this one and others the Bible says the more as a day approach we should be in church the more as a day approach we should be in fellowship with God the more is a day approach we should be praying more the more is a day approach we should be doing this it seems like everybody's going in reverse so do not tell me you're progressing in God you're not can we read Bible forsake not assembling yourself together we got people come morning service don't come back second service we got people that lay out for this lay out for that my question is are you going to church more now than you did 6 months ago a year ago and it ain't all going to church but it does this the Bible says for sake not assembling himself together and much more as the day approaches so if you're not then you back s from your calling sorry being sick's different laying out different but Jesus said you must be born again to be born again you got to have the same desire and now was thinking about this standing outside this morning getting ready to come to church does the Holy Ghost want to go to church so if you don't want to go don't think of that but seven days a week oh Lord that's correct churches seven days a week all year that's a communion with God that's right and you at home that's right in your car walking I justify for the fact that my life with God is greater than it ever been and because I have church all the all the that's right when I'm right but I'm in the bathroom I have church right and that's how you that's what you got to do you got to see that okay so but it says forsake not the assembling of yourself together I know you're not contradicting that but but she's right we should have church seven days a week but the Bible says for forsake not the there must be something we've got to do when we assemble that's right except just come here and eat lunch and wait till the preacher gets done preaching and then have lunch and or have breakfast and then wait till the preacher gets done preaching then have lunch and then let the preacher get done preaching then we go get something to eat that's right I mean is that just a social event is that just something we put into a social event uh what I want to do is is I want to be to where we're all prayed up we're all in the mind of God when we get here that's right not wait till we get here and then try to get in the mind of God that's and then say brother they don't take care of all my woes and all my praying for me and my children Bo W you w you will brother Dale take care of my kids no it's not brother Dale's it's not his part to take care of your kids it's your part you had them like Dy said you had fun making them you ought to have fun raising them Hallelujah yes the then then then God can talk to us instead of having to deal with all of our little woes that we have all during the week okay really honestly if nobody gets it but us people in the Sunday school class you going to understand one thing we got to progress in God that's right we got to progress in God if we don't prog God is Progressive he's not regressive okay he's Progressive and if we have a fault and we have a failure God forgive me but don't say God forgive me 25 times in a month for the same identical thing and then then two months later you're still saying forgive me Lord forgive me no I like what brother Jason said at the at the watch KN service he said repentance good old true repentance is you were doing this and now you turn around and you go in a totally different direction than where you've been going that's repentance that's right it's not Lord forgive me Lord forgive me and you're still walking in the same direction it's a total turn around and go in the opposite direction that's if you got problem brother said if you sting you give money away what he said he should do the vice versa I'm making myself you hear this I'm making myself read the Bible every day making myself read the Bible cuz cuz physically you really sometimes don't want to right I'm making myself read the Bible more than I've ever read it before I'm making myself pray and I failed last night cuz I fell asleep without praying but this morning I said God forgive me I'm going to start I'm going to you bring it to my remembrance bring it to my remembrance and we'll take care of we got to go Ponder on these things oh
