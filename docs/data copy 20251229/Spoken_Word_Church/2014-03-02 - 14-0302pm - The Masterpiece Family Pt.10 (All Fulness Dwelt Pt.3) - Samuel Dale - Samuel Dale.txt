before that's true she gets okay she's a visit to her visit her visiting but not a visitor for the first time okay good to see you sis amen you like turning your scriptures turned in Colossians 1 and then we'll go in Colossians 2. oh now remember the announcements that we've made uh the Lord willing Wade will be preaching Wednesday brother Aaron will be preaching next Wednesday so we'll get those two out of the way kind of working these guys a little bit you know because we'd like to hear Faith cometh by hearing it doesn't say faith comes by preaching somebody got to preach but you've got to hear too so I have to hear but we're you know and then Remember The Minister's meeting will be next weekend or this coming Saturday excuse me up at uh brother Bill Johnson Wade will be there for the weekend preaching for him remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in Alabama if you want to go with us make sure you let us know uh brother Vernon from the Philippines will be here with us preaching for us on the 16th so remember that and remember brother Claude weisinger will be here in the first the first Sunday of April to minister Forrest we've got a little special something uh you know we're now don't get excited we're not going to have the baby dedication but we want them to bring the baby up it won't be the dedication that's going to be when the whole family comes you know and they're going to do all that but if brother and sister Anderson would bring the the baby up because you know this is a miracle because there's two things wrong first was a problem in his sperm count was nothing you know it was nothing period all right and it's a miracle all right but then she had a growth in her female things and it was concerned about that so you know you say well there's nothing going on well you know here is a proof that there's something going on because the Church of praying and we just thank God for a little miracle baby you know that they were not supposed to have but they were told they were going to have it and it did and we believe it see we're not going to dedicate it because that'll be later but we just wanted it to be there to show that there is a God still living that can take care of your needs if you ask him and we have not because we ask not so we'll do the dedication later but we just wanted that done because see you say well there's nothing going on well we've had three accounts of the Dead raised how many miracles do we need for somebody to believe you know how many things do we need that's just right here in this little group it's not around the world uh that you know is is proven uh you know we've had all kinds of things to happen right right in here is one of the Miracles the brother that was singing the song dire with the soundtrack he was underwater for over five minutes possibly 10 to 15 minutes in the water you know supposed to not lift but yet God brought him out I think he sounds pretty good for a man been under the water but you see God is real okay so we'll dedicate her later all right we won't do it today okay if I get a hold of her we'll you'll never get her back but uh because give her about six or eight months I'll be getting her because that's I love him little babies you know they're wonderful but that's just you know the Miracles and things that we can say well God has done this God has done that so we believe it I believe in a miracle working God don't you amen father we thank you for this day and for the hour that we've had thank you for you because without you there's nothing in any of us and we're not trying to brag on anything other than speak what is true of you because we know what the doctors have said and we just we don't depend on them we depend on what you say when we believe in the doctors we thank you we're glad to have them we're glad to have all the things of them of the materialistic ideas of the world and things we don't throw it away we believe in it and we thank you Lord but we know who God is and what he's doing so now we pray that you would just come Among Us Lord in a mighty way today and open your word unto us because that's what we've desired to do and then you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe that you will take care of us we thank you for all things we love you and we just commit everything into your hands in Jesus name amen all righty Colossians 1 verse 15. who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of ever creature for by him were all things created that were that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things we know now who this is right who the Lord Jesus Christ the one true and living God and he is before all things and by him all things consists and he is the head of the body of the church who's the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence or it pleased him for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell okay then we look at verse 9 of the second chapter for him in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word you see church I love to brag about him and what he's done don't you I really love it because it's true I've been a part of it I've been healed I've been delivered I've been many many things you know right and we could stand all afternoon and talk about it because I have the medical records to show that my blood type has totally been changed from a positive to a negative and just a wonderful thing amen appreciate little Abby coming and playing that her first little Overture I guess you call it or whatever that would be but we appreciate that it was great amen all right let's get back in to try not to back up too much on this morning but let's think about it what is in the Bible that speaks of God is actually speaking of you and I because we are the ones of mankind all the way down through and we've made ourselves very very clear of what we're talking about I think that to talk about the bride be in the fullness of the godhead bodily shouldn't be any problem because it's what he has made us is what he's made us so it's his choice now I can't have it if he's done it you know I mean I'm the 13th kid of a family that was not supposed to I wasn't supposed to be here because I'm the 13th and my dad was 45 before him and my Mom married that would be enough Miracle you know I mean you calculate the last one out of 13 and he wouldn't they didn't get married at least 45 and uh so I finished up the things I reckon of all and uh but that's a miracle you know as many things we can talk about in life and see that God is real but see God is pointing back towards you and I he's always done that Paul said it's not I his brother dick was was talking about a while ago it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me all right see then Paul said follow me as I follow Christ all right that's the way I follow brother Branham as he followed Christ now where he was wrong on the White Horse Rider you know in the things that coming down through there well we can't follow that now he admitted he was wrong and God corrected him because of the opening of the word so then he was a human being he was not God as I was saying this morning we don't believe in him being infallible but we believe the message he brought amen was invaluable because as ministers we're not infallible but we are trying to bring you what we see at least that's what I try to do of what he's doing and this is no new message to me I've been preaching this for 40 something years to you about God in the fullness and started in 69 in Athens Georgia preaching about the bride being the son of man and we won't get to that today because it's way on down but you know I believe it I believe in a living God why would you serve a dead God come on I just get me a totem pole or give me a little something carried around my pocket and then I can take it out and rub it every once in a while you know you know I said boy my God he's real look at him you know see and and I'm not throwing off on anybody I'm just honest I want something real you know I I don't like uh fake things I don't like you know things that you have to prop up and us talking about the dead Rays three times we know we don't have to prop that up it's on record it's been there for years it's been on record here for 40 something years that my blood type was changed from a positive day negative by their own doctors that took the test I showed as it would that's not bragging that's just bragging on God because I believe in the Living God why serve a dead God why serve some God that can't help you you know like I said I'd just soon have a totem pole but I believe in the reality of a living God and I believe he'll talk to you if you'll talk to him and believe it you know you said well I know I can't talk to me audibly well I don't say they can't do that but he can sure speak inwardly I mean we have proof in the Bible that Prophet I said you know it was a we're still small voice inside of him see that where he was speaking well he can speak to you and I if he desires to but remember what we're trying to say now the point is we're in the end time and we are in the the Bible says the end of all things has come upon us all right so then in being that then we're down here to make manifest the word and things for the hour that we're living all right now in that then we're we're not looking at just going to church and being good and and you know and all like that and trying to to uh do those things we are trying to be what he wants us to be and I'm happy about that I enjoy it myself because I really love to just I love to do things of the world and hunting and fishing and things but then I always do this love to sit around talk about the word the college that's just part of me all right but now think about it if he says we are something you know we we say all things are possible to God well that's why I believe that but you know he said in his word all things were possible to them that believed well I mean why can't we believe it why is there any point of not believing it I would be an unbeliever that's what I was telling I thought it was Zach the other day about when I went to the doctor and I was telling the doctor about my blood pressure and how that it had been running 190 200 over 110 and they've been keeping records of it at General Motors for quite a while so I went to the doctor and they kept telling you need to go I said well I got a physical coming up and you know I came to church and we prayed and Monday I went to the doctor and I was still expecting it to be high too because it'd been high for quite a while and she said this nurse said my water blood pressure well I was thinking 190 maybe over over 200 or something over 110 and uh you know I said oh it's that high huh she said no it's 120 over 80. I said would you believe that it's been running close to 200 over 100 at least and she said no so when the doctor got through you know you go through you can go back and sit down and talk with him he said your blood pressure is in good shape Sam said that's good really good for your age I asked him I said well would you believe it's been running close to 200 over 110. and I've got the things laying here you know what he looked at he says no what well I'm not against him I'm just going out and tell my wife I said you want me to go to the doctor you're going to get me another one I'm not going back to him that's not going to believe because I had to prove to show him well he had some philosophy I guess to figure it all out but that's all right I just believe in a living God and I believe that God is trying to reveal himself in you and I all right he must first reveal himself to us that's the whole catch of the thing is he reveals himself to us all right then he reveals himself in US well I now we don't see him in us first either we see him in Jesus Christ amen all right we see God back there all right but now if the Bible is right you know and we believe it is that Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday yesterday today and forever well then why can't we say okay he is the same today because he said he was all right it's either that way we're we're depending upon him to make manifest what he promised all right so we've been through the corn of wheat the things of the Masterpiece and things that we've been studying on and we've been through those things to show that it's to come back into to the original grain in the end time the original word that went into the ground has to come back that's why the prophet had to come he had to come to work not that it would rewrite the Bible we don't believe that you'd be getting into junk to try to rewrite the scriptures me he didn't come to rewrite him he come to tell us this what it is he come to tell us this is what he says and that's what we ought to believe you know all right then that way we can we can depend on him all right but then if he says I'm something why can't I say them something you know right you know God don't see you and I because if he's seen us see there's no little there's no no great big sin for this one and a little bitty one for this one you know I mean seeing his sins if there's any sitting there that's a problem all right but there's no big and little it's not well I've I've been good all of my life but you you've been bad no all born in sin safer than iniquity it's possible or mother's wound and we're Liars to start with and look down at the little baby there and you know it don't sound good but you know what I look down there and I don't mean it wrong when I look down there and say when that little baby gets about two years old it's gonna lie mama don't lie daddy don't lie they don't teach you to lie it's raised in church everything but you know what the little baby you say you got a cookie dude you got cookie all over his face and you got one in each hand hiding behind him but you don't have no cookie well who taught him to lie right is to inherit nature of the world that we live in that's why the psalmist starts quoting him there about born in sin saving iniquity that's the psalmist David he kind of you kind of things are going on he had a thousand wives and had over 100 kids born in one year so I'm for sure he knows a little bit about kids being born you know and at least he was around sometime during all that time but now listen see the entire body of Christ is down through seven Church ages it takes to hold agency we would look at the pyramid and the things you know and we would see through the the seven Church ages in the Book of Revelations and it takes all of that to bring forth what I'm talking about it's not just nothing was going on but in the end time the great things is happening no it's been God down through each age and time that's why we believe in what the method the Baptist taught to Methodist taught the Presbyterian talk the Pentecostal talk the truth the taught right we believe that that's fine we accept that because it's Truth All right but now watch it won't do any good I want this thought before we start it won't do any good for us to just talk about something but if we can believe it then God Can Make It come alive if we can believe it but if we don't believe it then you know it's not for us there's people that you cannot get them in no way to believe about God and and things why because that they're just the way their mind is set for some reason they don't believe all right well there's no need to be nothing about it you know go on forget it I just I want to be me and be happy about it but we ended up now quoting from the prophet that we believe God sent to our day and we believe what he taught and what I'm doing is reading a lot this series of things and I gave them to you this morning and I I would ask you to keep those and uh to read the things of the Bible read the word of God see what the Bible says you know and if I'm out of that then you come and tell me where did I missed it because I want to be right but we wound up talking about that if we could show through the prophet messenger of the last days that we believe that the the word of God points to you and I and and to see you and I into the word and the way God describes it you know speaking of us is a wonderful thing we will when we get to the son of man talk we will be going over the Book of Revelation where it says one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks standing in the church the midst of the whole seven Church ages one like unto the son of man it doesn't say the son of man was dark it says one like unto the son of man and what does it say gird about the pouch with a golden girdle well now that means a feminist side so it's not that God is feminish but the way he's describing it is in church form did he speaks of you and I as being the Bride of Jesus Christ in this wonderful thing some of them said Brother Don he said he wished I'd preach on the songs of Solomon because I mean that's a beautiful picture once you really begin to to get into it and studying on that and just seeing how that relates to us and what it is all right but now let's just let's just do as we were doing because I want to try to read this afternoon a whole lot and watch the things that we're reading the prophet was speaking as we gave this morning coming down from don't pull this up pull on up to number seven and then we'll start there but he was talking about in the message Source the father that he said I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe the fullness of God is raining down on the church today he's saying I believe that all he all God was he poured into Christ in all Christ is poured into the church and then take her back to the Garden of Eden well that's the hour We're living right but we want to look at something and try to find it in some other form other than what he says about it all right he goes on talks about in the message India trip 57 that the fullness of God is in his church but we have it by measure see none of us claim to be the fullness of God brother random never claimed to be the fullness of God he was just a member of the body of Christ a minister a prophet sent to to bring us the word and that's what we believe all right see Paul was a man brought us the word we believe in that but we believe that it's going to be in the entire fullness why because he's building a body as we went through the Old Testament built a body through the prophets and the things you know and then the lice was John the Baptist come to introduce to the Lord Jesus Christ right and then we went to the church ages to show that the church Ages was building a body and that Delice would come the head to the body well we're already past the manifestation of of the situations or ought to be and we believe that he's coming now to join himself to the entire bride to get her ready for a Rapture get her ready for leaving out of here you know and all of that all right then the last we read the Good Shepherd of the Sheep uh I think I got that far didn't I all right pull up number six we'll start from right there and we'll we'll read as fast as we can this afternoon and let him say this is the the Good Shepherd of the sheep priests in 1957 uh e46. uh he had the spirit without measure you believe that in him never dwelt just a part of God but all of God was in his son Christ Jesus it was the fullness of the godhead bodily all of God was poured into Christ and all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ is he poured out on the church but you keep refusing it no you notice what he said you refused it now remember the time that the pope down through there the god that wanted to be the Pope that wrote to decree that it was better to serve God by force than not serve him at all and I'm not throwing off on them that was their thoughts and their ideas but he wrote that decree coming through well didn't it augustino hippo the Holy Ghost tried to come on him but he refused it and see then he turned away and when he did he he wrote to decrees in the thing all right but see that's nothing to do with me and you another argument with anybody there or what they done this is the age of finishing up but you and I we have a right to accept or to refuse what the Bible says about us see the things that now watch what he said if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not and as the father has sent me how did the father send him the father sent him went with him and in him so send I you all right so then who are we we're Our God made manifest but yet we keep refusing the fact of believing it and he cannot do anything for us if we keep if we keep refusing or just at least mentally say it go to the next one having conferences 1960 608 uh e48 Jesus was the son of God created Son of God God overshadowed Mary and created a blood cell in her that brought forth the son Christ Jesus and God came down and dwelt in him in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily then he goes to Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh singing By Angels and so forth we saved up into Glory not a prophet that Jesus wasn't just a prophet he was a prophet who was he God made flesh and dwelt among us there he was Emmanuel the Holy Spirit called him Emmanuel God With Us and now it's God in us The Same Spirit and watching we receive it by portion or measure why because it takes all of us then to make the godhead you know well if you put all the measures back together what do you got I mean you take a spoonful out of the ocean you've only got to measure but if you could dip enough spoonfuls you could get all the water out of the ocean well taking quite a while to do that but you get it done you understand what's in the ocean so look he received it without portion or measure and him was the fullness of God all that what all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was poured over the church okay amen that day you'll know what the day that that you accept it today you quit refusing the day you accept what he's saying about you then what can that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me and I in you that's what Jesus said and you and me oh my when it comes that day now we're working on God orders just just let's just keep moving all right look the next the Patmos Vision preached in 1960 1205 1204 excuse Union 64 paragraph this morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation of the deity of the revelation God being revealed in Christ and when he believes it God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in his church in in Christ Now where's God to be revealed now if he was in revealed in Christ Now where's God to be revealed in his church with his people in US The Same Spirit the same work the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace mercy and all that was in Christ is what in the church remember keep this in mind all that God was he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that Christ was he poured into the church God above us God With Us God in us the triunity of God God manifested in the three different manners Father Son and Holy Ghost see we don't believe in a trinity we believe in a Triune God yeah father son and all to God there was a time that he was in the Old Testament he was more or less father in the New Testament son now it's Christ all right but see that's where he's dwelling now in us all right go ahead um persevere 62 uh 218. I got 30 31 Christ when he was on Earth was the body of God do you believe that I said he Hebrews 11 5 a body thou Hast prepared me all right God created his body it was a different body yet it was a human body you know Solomon built him a house but Stephen said how be it the most I don't dwell in houses made with hands but embody's eyes prepared me now God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus which was the Christ meaning the anointed one and now all that God was was in Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what the scripture says we just read it in Colossians now all that God was he poured into the into Christ poured out in Christ he was Emmanuel God With Us and all that Christ was he poured out into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly he come over into his church to continue his work there's any problem with that all right then the church would be God living upon the Earth all right he lived by the word of the father you believe that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that precedeth from the mouth of God and the church don't live by bread alone but by the word of Christ and the Holy Spirit comes in and takes the word of Christ and makes it a living action today these signs shall follow them that believe okay now then he moves over into you and I because he took our place as I said this morning and now what's happening we are to take his place God using Humanity to talk to humanity because that's the chosen way to do go ahead for the spoken word is the Original Seed uh okay paragraph 178 going just run it up you read all this and it'll it's on the internet they can read all of it if you want a church start with the word of God if you you want a life of God start with the word of God accept the word of God in his fullness every measure of it and then let now watch if that is the fullness of God in you then the rain that's falling will produce exactly what's in your garden right all right would you say well you just explained that it's by measure as it is by measure but you know every Spoonful is taken out of the ocean is exactly the same chemical that's what's in the ocean it's just measured or ever born again believer in the body of Christ is God made manifest in that person that's what the new birth is about that's that's why it's so wonderful that's the time it's housing you you just get what's in your garden keep on going lean not to your own understanding 1965. 120. um progress 17 18. so you see if you were in the foreknowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God is any problem with that terminology if God is living in you spiritually speaking not physically see spiritually speaking by the new birth he's living in you well then you're part of God that's not a uh that should be an easy part to understand you know God's in here then what's in here of God is a part of God right see that that shouldn't be anything that would be hard to understand so what then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a Son of God or daughter of God you have to be part of God and God is incomplete without you I like that don't you yeah now he chose it to me that way it's not I'm so important if you don't know how important you are get you a glass of water stick your finger down in the glass of water and pull it up and show me the hole right comical but true ain't no hole left that's how important we are but remember he's very important all right the only way you can be a Son of God or daughter or God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you has to be that's right because there's only one only one resource of eternal life and that's God and him alone has eternal life so then when he gives you eternal life see that's eternal life all right now you're a part of him and in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened why they just don't have it that's all just like you put a grain of corn in the ground didn't have ever how pretty it was if it didn't have the germ of life in it it can never be quickened but the German life has to be there first anybody knows planting corn planting anything you you go out and you plant a seed if the germ is not in there that's why you go down there and you pick up your seed and it'll say 99 germatized or 80 or 60 you know what that means that means if it's 80 germatized that means 80 percent of it's going to come up the other 20 ain't gonna come up because it's telling you what's germatized without the German life in you it just won't work okay go to the next one Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 728 paragraph 380 and in there there would be a Time come when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church how the preeminist is in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom that's the purpose of it anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he's done Eve right go to the next paragraph 146 of the Christ of history when I think I just see denominations fights off the scene and everything else just going see when I see God's Great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminances the oversight deleting okay now do we believe that okay go ahead to the next still in Christ Mr God revealed paragraph 150 161. complete godness or you'd look at it in 60. God expressed in Jesus Christ he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily okay now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church now I said when I started most of this morning especially if I can read to you that brother Brown says these things we have no right if we're going to accept him as the messenger to argue with that point no more than we would argue with Paul saying that he was the head of the body right and all of that because we're not making demand deity we're believing the word that's brought is is that deity because you and I by ourselves cannot be God but God can be in each one of us you know there's seven billion people in the world today you know if everybody believed God could be in seven billion people you believe that I do but you know the reason is not going to be because they're not going to believe it now a lot of it hadn't heard but you know what I'm saying so watch what he said now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in this church the preeminances all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church the Believers now so it's not in everybody it's only into Believers go to the next we have seen this star in the east and come to worship 63 12-16 and when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come to King's commandment you remember what happened there when when Jesus was born the king's Commandments was to kill all the babies remember so then as quick as Jesus was born they had to take him Joseph and Mary had to leave and go down into Egypt and that would fulfill the scriptures out of Egypt I call my son see that would would fulfill the scriptures but they had to do that so when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come to King's commandment all you people just as she was now see his thought the Christ was becoming a full baby ready to be delivered right then the great persecution all right that's when they started killing him now now the the babies being formed the baby's been formed for a long time along in the womb now we've been through that that Mary was not the very seed herself the seed was in Mary she gave birth to God that didn't make her God she gave birth to the one that was within her and that's exactly what we're supposed to be doing all right now the baby's been formed for a long time along in the womb but this is coming the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifest among his people he said so he promised it in his word and when that fullness you see there is unusual things begin to happen that he promised now you know what he's talking about anytime God is moving unusual things starts happening they started killing the babies when Christ was fixing to come into the world the lord Jesus and all trying to get him all right so it's the end time it's going to do the same that's the reason our Great Society lives and things can't understand that it's foolishness to them now watch they're forming a council of churches that's not foolishness to them to form a council of churches with his foolishness for us to stay out of that you know that's what they think but look they're forming a council of churches see just the time when the churches begin to get to its feet we're the Supernatural is begin to work now they've all went into a group and they're going to try to stop this stuff just exactly like it was then so you see it now tightening down coming down to the point go ahead who is this Melchizedek notice these are in 64. threes four and five all right paragraph 42 who's this melchized notice like the scripture he hides with a mask over it that's what God has done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hid and it's supposed to be revealed in this age now the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the Bible has been it's been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world in its Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the age of this lady of sin Church which is now see he would take the mask off of the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing God in morphy in morphe means god changes form same God different form dimorphic I'm asking the pillar of fire god amorphic in the Man Called Jesus God in Murphy in his church God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God it's been him the whole time it ain't been me and you we ain't even more fooling with that's what he is go ahead to the next I want to get these reading out of the way we're not a Jehovah Witness reading room but I sure do love the word so the Mighty God unveiled before 64 629 paragraph 1 30. then it was God in them days it was God and a man his son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in the man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man God in a in a man now it's God in men the fullness of the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word okay go to the next God's only provided place of worship uh paragraph 262. Richard 65 11 28 in the morning service the lutherans under justification the feet raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and deeds and so forth had to be colonists had to be Armenian had to be legalistic a legalist but now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried The Headstone crying what Grace Grace passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God that's God's only provided plan for this age right his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to ever promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men are part of God's word seated together manifested the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you see what he's talking about brother Brown no living among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus raise it on up no leaven among you now you can see what's keeping it from being done leaven means something you've added you you know your women are very familiar with leaven you you take your bread especially the old days you didn't have all that self-rising stuff and you had to put a little Evan in to make it rise because it would work even though what he said no leaven among you that brings the end our fullness of the godhead bodily among you okay couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it Wednesdays couldn't do it in Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back to the church together with the entire deity of God among his people join the sign visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God what about that a prophet God Jesus was a prophet but he was God all right now I believe that he so used this end time prophet until it's hard to separate the man from the message he was bringing and that's why people believe it was deity but I don't believe that I believe ever born again believer is God made manifest there's your dear teaches I believe all right Marin Oh Glory promised by the Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures where you worship at the house of God seated in present tense okay now go on to the next the Rapture preached in 1965-12 04. paragraph 116. look back in that little wheat now getting their back to our thought of where we was at when you look at it you know you raise wheat you go out there and it comes up and you say I got a feel for the week well that's true this week it don't change into corn and something else is weak but you can't gather it right all right so then you're seeing why that he's having to wait till the end time to do these things because as it was coming down in the wheat it comes up in the stalk it even comes up into the shuck or like corn with the shuck on it me that's not the wheat you pull the shark back and you look down in there and there's a little bitty spot in there there's your wheat I mean for so you don't gather it as I said about corn I love corn when it gets up good and juicy don't you and you get it man you put it in a pot you know we used to take it and put it in the ground said put a fire on top of it and you know then we'd pull it up and Shake It Off and eat it and uh but you don't dare try to plant that why so you leave the corn or the wheat until it totally dries then you gather it sensible right so that's what he's talking about you got a little bit of wheat back there you have to take a dirty fire Periscope 30 Power Scope to look into it to see the little bud of wheat back there it's way back in dark but it starts growing Now That Shook has to be there to shelter that to give it a chance to get out but then when it begins to grow and the message begins to spread the endless shot pulls away from it and the life goes right out of that shook right into the wheat goes out that's the way each age done it's just it can't beat nature it's God's continuity I already say that word the way he does things all right go ahead identified Masterpiece of Christ now this one's in Yuma Arizona not not the masterpiece 64 1205 and when he made his first Masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second Masterpiece he was the word he made man in the garden he put him behind the word right told him not to fool around but when he made the next Masterpiece was with Jesus Christ he was the word he wasn't just behind the word he was the word not behind the word but he wants the word God never changes his plan that's exactly what started off to do his first church went with the word all right write it on up called it it's covering and getting us to a place that he's explaining it God separates he is trying to separate his church from the world but the church wants to go on with the world but his people is still segregated segregated to him who is he the word now he said I believe in segregation that means to be separated not talking about black white yellow green blue whatever color that doesn't have anything to do with it it's talking about God wants us separated the word that started in the original has got to come back all right going to the next uh the invisible Union the brought across 65 11 25. can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same thing same word but I don't see nothing going on see the word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that went through here picked up his people that's forming you performing up excuse into a head for the Rapture speaking on that tomorrow night the Lord with us well you well you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again are remarried again to the new spiritual union see of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life a germ that was in you at the beginning found you so you're returning back to the original look what he says coming up I have heard but now I see 65 11 27 that's the shut that's on the wheat they come out you go out there and look and you look especially we're familiar with corn more than wheat you go out and you look and you see that ear you say man I've got a feel full of corn it might be good to pull and eat some you know we're not uh we're not like a lot of people our green beans are very small because we we want to get them tender well the corn when it begins to come on and form real good we start eating it a lot of people said don't got to leave it well that's good okay I plan enough to where I can leave some but then I like to gather it and eat it but don't plant it you can't do that so that's what he's explaining our Christian Life is the same way God doesn't expect everything to be the same he didn't expect Martin Luther in the Lutheran age to understand what you and I understand he's waited a long time to bring us to a place right now come on it's like a week but there was no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that they organized they killed themselves the Irish were they die they're stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's begin to form in the bride form the corn of wheat that fell into the ground through the Dark Ages see it it had to die all right look at the next invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 293. look God Elohim standing there in human flesh showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days it'd be God working in human flesh again right as it was in the days of summer so shall it be at that at the coming of the son of man same kind of a thing they see it right there in the scripture read it search the scriptures or in them you think you have eternal life and there they that testify this the scriptures testifier tells you that God was standing there saying that he would come back in the last days right look at the last one I have heard but now I see 65 11 27. everybody knows that we have a promise of the church condition in the last day the church in its present condition can never fulfill the Commandments of God okay the Great Commission could never call the bride out which one would do it what group The Pentecostals I should say not none of the rest of them that's to shuck that's on the wheat they come out look like exactly like the wheat but there was no wheat in it opens up but the grain comes out of that they were nice they die they organized they kill themselves that's where they die they're stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's beginning to form in the bride form the corn of wheat that fell into the ground through the Dark Ages a lot of reading fast reading but just to show you what to profit this message has been telling pointing he said on spoken words reading a seed he'd be pointing to a word born Pride well why can't we believe that we are the people of God is that any problem I mean I thought everybody was supposed to believe that they were the people of God where you'd be Manchester Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal Catholics or anything I thought we all believe we were the people of God that's what the church is about right if not we'd just be anything we won't do what everybody claims to be the people of God well in all of that there is a true people wanting to be the people of God then we're not going off on anybody because they're good people in all churches there's people in those churches there's Catholic people that make us ashamed of ourselves as the humbleness the goodness the people not against them I'm against a system bark that tries to control and that's just as much in the Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals and the people of this message we want to call them Bridal mice that's all right with me blue lights you know because we're not the only group we're not the only ones trying to strive to be the word look I have to say it this way we're the only ones I want I'm involved with right you know and preaching to you and I and trying my best to live but yet in a very poor manner before you as a Christian in a very poor Manner and I mean not honestly because I am a poor very poor example but I I at least have a repentant attitude you know and I want to be right one because I believe God is trying his best to to be in the people in the end time because something's going to happen we've all talked every denomination church or whatever it was um all of them teach of a end of the world but I'm coming to the old Indian he had the Happy Hunting Ground and everybody's got it the Muslims the Buddha the Hindus they got a world to go to and a thing to be done because that's a religious principle of mind what do you see what I'm talking about if God says that I am something why can't I say I'm sorry oh in the book of Acts was quoting this morning Paul said we are God's offspring well is there any problem would being the children of God but to recognize the day that we're living the time we are here wouldn't it been something if and it you know could have positively been done but wouldn't it been something for for uh Moses just said well no avail an art and flowed them out we're down here on the side of the Nile River and we'll just build an ark float the people out it might have been an easier way to got out than what to talk you know but that was not it the ark had done been built that was God's way in the time of Noah but it wasn't not God's way in the time of Moses and the children of Israel he was out through the wilderness that was his way we'll see all of those Asian all of those times has been what they're supposed to be amen that's what I said we're not throwing off on churches and people those people have fulfilled their age their time but don't be looking back to say we are this because we have stood so long prostitutions went way high in the last days that means right because it's been here so long when it was the original in the garden you know you sound silly on but maybe silly if it's the right point all I want us to do church is to just let God live in our hearts in our lives and try our best to serve him and to be conscious of ourselves to not just live haphazardly and and just anything goes but to believe I mean don't you want your children to be good and live and do well that's the way God wants it he wants his church to just be good and be faithful where I hear we're in the world as Jesus said but we're not out of the world what do you see what I'm talking about the prophet emphasized she would be the word made flesh somebody's got to make it manifest he said to bride with vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. in these scriptures why or did I keep referring to Martin Luther when he protested the Catholic Church it didn't bother them for him to protest but when the people begin to Rally around what he taught then they got concerned well see that's the way it is with the Devil they don't care what you blabber about you know well we're all one let's just come together and let's be one that's what I'm trying to do is for us to come together be one in God's word that's all I'm asking is for us to become one in this world for us to believe what God has called us when he says we're his people why can't we say we're his people why can't we say we are his people in the chief of his pastor the word says we are why can't we believe the word we were kind of laughing like not in I believe it was in the songs of Solomon it's the reading and I told sister Monica I said now Sister Monica brother Bob is going to describe you you know in a few minutes it become very comical but remember in the songs of Solomon he was describing how beautiful his little wife was a little girl and he said she had a neck like a swan you know as we call it today legs like a jay bird or something you know and to be describing how beautiful she was but you'd really have to think about it right see she looks like a flock of sheep going across a hill well you're trying to describe your wife like that today and you might get in trouble you know because you see Church we are his people and why can't we confess what he says we are his offspring why can't we say that amen that's all God is asking us to do and let him make the rest of it manifest because when the dead was raised that we've recorded talked about it a while ago when Wade and I were there and the man died we didn't make him die but we didn't know what to do and Wade says daddy the Man's dead and we were trying to call 9-1-1 and we couldn't get no connection because we were out in the country away from the the phone range you know thing that what you call it and he said daddy he's dying he's dead his eyes had rolled back and for no reason whatsoever why would I do it I just called his name but I called it real line I said random Jesus holds his eyes up and look he said what what you said well he wasn't really dead what's all right we just tell what happened and brother Gary Mr Margaret she said his eyes rolled back he was dead nobody didn't think Sister Margaret had a whole lot of God you know she was just a little old sister she didn't understand all the Mysteries and knew all about the great things but yet she called his name and prayed for him and God brought him back to life why can't we believe that let's just say thank you Lord God is nothing it don't make us anything it makes him a great God that's all I'm trying to do is get you to see the God that I try to serve and that God can do all things but you know what he needs somebody to believe him that's what he's always wanted he had to wait until the Moses come along because there were a lot of good people in the days and times Moses was on the Earth but he had to wait until Moses came why because Moses would be the only one who would believe it there were a lot of beautiful clean virgins in the days of Mary but he waited until Isaiah had already said it you know virgins y'all can see and God waited thousands of years until the right person came on Earth and she would say be it unto me according to Thy Word and why because she believed it do we believe God are we going to believe what somebody else has taught us and is it going to the horse and sit your rigamarore for somebody to say I don't agree with you I don't agree with my own self most of the time how about you but I'm believing in God that's real and I believe that's what he's trying to do is to live in you and I is that a hard thing well we got to quit this we got to quit that we got to do it got to do that where's that in the word you don't have to quit nothing you just get born again let God take care of it right there's good morning and let God take her is there any problems with that you know is there any problems with you sisters just being a wife you know did her drudgery well I don't mean this wrong I mean it right and sweet as I can but you know it's the same side on the man on the other side if you women say it's a hard thing to just be a woman it's the same thing to be a man you know we have to put up with y'all right you know all I asked for my wife had to put up with me right just love me but then I don't have to go in there every day you know because most of the time I'll cook her breakfast not no problem I run things around my house the vacuum cleaner the washing machine no problems with it I always go in there and I say hey Sleeping Beauty your breakfast is ready you know kiss her on the cheek tell her breakfast is ready well you know what if I don't get up and cook breakfast she does well I don't have to tell her you got to get up now I call you my wife no she does everything the wife's supposed to do you know and that way we just love each other well why can't we think about carbide and the pride of Christ in his church you know God looks over a lot of our faults and failures you got to agree with that right he certainly looks over our problems to be able to even exist with us you know but you know why can't we just be people and just accept What God Says About Us and be happy amen and believe it then we don't have to try to figure it out we just have to believe what God says and it don't make my wife no more my life if she cooks me my breakfast actually is part of her doing right I just learned years ago to be able to fry an egg you know I don't mind it I don't go in there and bless God you and my wife get out of bed you got to cook some breakfast no I'm just happy about being what we are right I can fry cornbread but that's about as far as I can go you know you see I got my side you know they say the women brain in the man's brain the demand what it the man uses left inside of his brain and the woman she uses the right hand side because she's in a right mind okay said you're in your right mind and we're not all right but see her side of the brain is what build a house I mean clean the house have kids and do what's the man's side hunting and fishing he said no no it's for working and supplying anything and that's the difference in the way you're split well God made us that a way why not be happy I enjoyed today's my wife was able to go with me hunting and it didn't bother me to take her in the woods care up to the deer stand carry her sleeping Back Care up in the put up the sleeping bag let her get up in the tree and sit down and me wrap her up in a sleeping bag give her her gun load it far and everything and then me go off somewhere and lay down because let's give out that didn't bother me that's just a joke but we had a lot of fun doing that a lot of fun being a Christian and being Christian together can be a lot of fun she got to put a deer stand one day and I was going to straighten it up because it would lean in just a little or wouldn't stand up against the trick it wouldn't fasten too good but and I was going to just move it over straighten her out because she said this thing's leaning over well I caught the stand and pulled it well it did it went the other way and she's hanging off the stand this way and she was screaming I said hang on I'll get her and I pull her back and it goes to the other side now she's hanging off the other side of course we finally got it straightened up I said honey I think we might as well go home I don't think there's any deer in these Woods if it was they would over behind the tree going the just being right and doing what we're supposed to be right God doesn't expect anything out of you he just wants us to accept him and he can handle all things right let's stand together we come to the time of communion let's stand together and we'll have the communion and you know and I hope you understand my point the prophet said the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the fullness of the godhead bodily yeah but brother Dale I don't see how that could be well what's that got to do with it I don't understand how did I know a motor can pull a car down the highway and all of them things goes up and down and moves and everything I don't understand that do you it's the old saying is do you understand how did a brown cow eats Green Grass and gives white milk I've never met a chocolate cow yet is always white milk I don't understand that but you know what I don't stop drinking the milk I just believe God's warning is bride to see who she is and what she's here for he'll take care of the rest it'll all be in that part see just to try to be a Christian see we think and I said we think we've got to get rid of this we've got to do that and even brother Brown referred to at that time where the scripture said you know the man said watch him lest we do to be saved he said he asked what to do to be saved he said we tell them what to quit and what to do and what not to do he said that don't save you you quit all you want to do all you want to straighten up all you want to that'll save you it's when you can realize that you're lost realize it hey I have no hope without Jesus Christ I have no hopes whatsoever in this world outside of Christ and then he comes down and speaks to me and I just accept it amen say thank you thank you Lord let's read the scripture we're going into the communion First Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat for this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembers of me after the same manner also we took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood just do years often as you drink it in remembrance of me very as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure the Lord's debt till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup or he doesn't eat us and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body but this caused many a weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world or for my brethren when you come together to eat Tyree one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come amen rest well I said in order when it's all finished and all over with do we come to the time of taking the communion and we don't believe in that being the literal body or a literal blood thank you we believe it's a in representation it's in representation of the body and blood y all right then we take it as believing that we are Christians and thanking God for the word and the truth and loving him forever the thanks not a treachery or a hateful life that we have to do no just let him do it you know you know you find out it's so easy you find out it's just so easy to just be yourself I like for people to be theirself with me I'd rather you just be honest with me than just sneak around and not be true it don't bother me if you tell me I don't like you well I don't like me either and that don't bother me it don't bother me to say I don't agree with you I said well okay let's sit down talk it over and see what the word says then we've got to agree with that in the communion is to that point see that's why Paul was chosen not any of the others to explain the communion from the Old Testament form in bringing it down when they got together and they ate the the calf you know and they were getting ready to leave Egypt and then they did there was just a little thing happened there that kind of set things in order that the Lord Jesus would eventually come and he would say these things to us this is my body which is broken for you just do in remembrance of me all right so then let's think about it and the Bible says it's a tarried For a Moment means just wait a little bit so let's just have a few moments of solid prayer breathing you know and praying and thanking the lord for what he's done for us in praying for one another is the main thing right just have your way with each one of us forgive our sins because we know that we're failures cleanse us Lord and make us worthy of this that we are to protect of in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and he blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today it's unleavened as we were speaking of it has nothing in it to make it any different because we're not supposed to do that but we're to believe and we're to thank you for these things and we just pray that you would sanctify the bread in each partaker in Jesus name you can see the reason that we do the breaking of the bread is because it was a broken body you know Charmed out that's that's their business I'm not argue with nobody I'm just saying that we believe that his body was broken for each one of us amen all right in that then we can look at it and say well thank you Lord you know let us each one now partake and we believe you that you will do as you say it we sent the communion home to a person one time that brother Gibby and I said just take it to his house and give him the communion because he was not able to be here and you know what God healed him right there I believe that you know I believe it happened because it was just what thoughts and ideas that we have or whatever was placed upon believing God and letting him manifest himself in a way that would be and the reason I like to break the bread is it was a broken body as I said a moment ago and it was done for you and I father we thank you for this wine it's been made for this purpose today and we just ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers we know this is not your blood but it represents your blood and that's very close but yet it's not literal blood it's wine hard but it's in symbolics in the things that we do we ask you to just be with each one as we eat this little piece of bread and that's we drink this little cup of wine that even tomorrow it will be building blood cells in our body because that's the thing that you ordain for us to be so we pray that what we little we've heard today will grow tomorrow into a greater understanding a great tree of knowledge in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name come morning oh by the river I'll rest knee the evergreen tree I don't care my cross through the midnight Come Morning the Earth Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father and it gives me the strength by the rivers I'll Rish me I promise you know you think about the children of Israel as they were leaving out of Egypt getting ready and heading towards the Promised Land the last thing they're doing was he got together they killed the lamb the none the ways that they were to do and they had a time together as a family and they are ate certain things and done certain things all of that was to show that they were fixing to make a journey well you know that time there lasted or held him as to be the people of God until they got into the Promised Land and you know then they begin to do different things it's a wonderful thing you know the last thing that they were doing was just honoring God and doing what he said well you know what he just honored them and the Bible says that her she was broke with their feet he said well that's impossible well that's right that's impossible but remember all things are possible to them that believe so that make you an unbeliever to believe that they didn't grow with her feet and didn't wear out you know that would be to you to believe but I believe it I believe that everything was provided they had Manna to eat they had all of the things taken care of and what about a vitamin that you could come up with that man you could just eat one little old vitamin and and be able to live and and they just went out and picked a little up off of the ground because it came overnight you know and they just picked it up took it home and baked it and it had ever nutrition there was no cholesterol there was no high blood pressure you know there was no nothings in all of the whole thing because that was God's Manna they called it but you know what I love about it because it was done because they take some of that then when they got into the promised land and the man of seas to fall and they took some and they put it in the pot and put it into the holy of holies well you know every new priest he was allowed to go in and he was allowed to take a piece of that manner you know of the original and it was never gone out it's always perfect let's just all partake together you can be seated as we get ready reader scripture and finish up John 13. and supper being handed to devil having now put into the heart of Judas this character Simon's son do betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and did he come from God and went to God he rises when supper and laid aside his garments what about the last thing he was doing before his crucifixion Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and light aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord this thou washed my feet you know you're not supposed to do that Jesus answered and said unto him what I do to I know it's not now but thy shalt know you're after you know this last Pope he's kind of got in trouble you know what he washed somebody's individual's feet well see that was taboo as far as the upper-ups are supposed to do you know because he wasn't supposed to mingle with the commoners well he's doing it he's going out and mingling and you know and doing all things you know because he's just a human being Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him of course thee not thus no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him see caught on not but my feet on it but also my hands and my head the two dirtiest things about him that he could figure but what did Jesus say back to him Jesus saith unto him he that is worse needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean everywhere and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them do
