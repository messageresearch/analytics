speak to us tonight by your love and your grace and father we thank you for getting all the people back safely and everything Lord and we know that you're your hand is always with us and we believe it just have your way as we read your word you come on the scene Lord and speak to our hearts and our lives this night that your grace may be sufficient for every need that we have we love you and we thank you in Jesus name man Acts 2 we're going to read verse 1 through 4 then we're jumping over to verse 15 through 21 all right and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and sooner there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and they set up on each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now jump over to the to say reading verse 15. for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing in his but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by Joel the prophet Joel and it came and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions of your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heaven and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall not the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now what we've been doing is looking at a lot of things in the Bible that compare um are in connection to each other happening in stages or or advents as we've read you know and trying to get something in our thoughts to look at it and the main thing is to not look forward for something to come and already be here but to recognize in our day in its message see we've recognized as we say all the time we recognize the prophet thank God for that now but what about you and I see we have a day Martin Luther was a messenger of his day and he brought the message and and the people then received the message and became the message and they were the ones that turned the world upside down because the Catholic churches I've said many times they wasn't upset with Luther that was one person but when a lot of people begin to turn away from them into his Direction they got upset all right and see the devil you know he is going about now in every way he can to try to um conquer whatever the people of this message to try to keep them from seeing who they are and the hour that they're living and to recognize themselves and that's what I've been dealing with for 45 years or more is to try to get you and I to see Who We Are amen no age is ever amounted to anything until the people of that age saw who they were right you know then they went forth and I even said about Jesus even picked up the Scrolls and read it said this day this scripture is fulfilled all right he saw that you know and he saw that was the time then putting it dire to where we can understand now I'll get back to the main reason of reading acts in a little while but oh what I want you to look at is that this writing here in the book of Acts it has a compound meaning to it all right it spoke of the Holy Ghost back there that would fall you know and be on the people and it did all right but then it was also speaking of the end time because it talks about the last days and you know if you need these I'll give them to you if you want them we're right around them would say the last two thousand years I mean and on Azusa Street see the Holy Ghost came down and fulfilling in a second form or for a phase or stage or Advent or whatever the prophecy of Joel because in the prophecy of Joel the first part in relating to Pentecost there was only a true 120 Upper Room people that were Jews all right in that outpouring right but it says it I performed on All Flesh see so that would mean that would be a fulfillment back there for that and Peter said in his message here this is that all right it was spoken of my joy all right that fulfills that but it didn't fulfill all of it because it would come over in the end time and the spirit would be poured out upon All Flesh and then it really would be saying upon my sons and my daughters in other words and then you're handmaids and you're see it would be pour out upon everybody in the end time all right now we should recognize those things and then that way would we we would not be looking for something to come but to realize it's already come all right so then we can stand here today and I looked at a lot of them you can go through the message and you can take it this is that and the prophet you've heard him say it many times if this ain't that let me keep this until that gets here of it so enjoyable where it is now what about what it be when it comes but but I believe he believed it that was it don't you and I I believe that was it but I'm trying to get us to to look and not look forward to something if anything look back and see the things are fulfilled you know in Parts but yet they have a meaning for the hour that you and I are living all right now we have been covering for some time and what we're going to do Sunday morning and Lord willing is try to to kind of finalize what I've been dealing with and then we'll have Sunday afternoon we'll have questions and answers so you write it down you know thoughts comments and we'll get to that we've been covering see how that like the Lord himself second Thessalonians shall you know descend with a shout voice of an archangel and a trumpet and we know that the shout is The Voice or the message of the the end time so we've already received that all right and we're in the stage part not of the uh trumpet to go away we're in the stage part of the uh voice of the Archangel and Christ become invisible put around and said among us and would raise the dead and we'd go in a Rapture all right now and then we went into the coming of the Lord and there's many parts to be related to the coming of the Lord but we're not concerned with what's to Israel that's their part we're not concerned with the end of the world Etc we shouldn't be concerned about those things we ought to be concerned about you know where we're at all right and then that way the prophet said that there's three advents to the coming of the Lord one is that he comes to redeem his right The Second Adventure part you know States would be to catch his bride away and in the third stage would be to come back into millennium with his bride all right now so in our last parts of what we were talking about this past Sunday afternoon especially was to relate that see to not you take scriptures and I was reading it today and it's in here somewhere if I can remember to pull out which one but the prophet said you know we're always looking back we're always looking forward we're doing these things failing to see what's going on now well what's going on now is the important thing there is not a tomorrow it is not here and once we get there it won't be tomorrow it'll be today so why worry about those things of what's to come what's to be uh you know uh see most people when you say the three comings of the Lord in related to the bride and we come to redeem his bride he comes to take it right away and then he'll come back in the millennium I won't know what's going in the millennium I want to know what's going to be there well why not get wait and get there amen amen it's like a little kid with a toy he can't wait to open it you know you tell him at Christmas you know we you just tell him you know well you got well he wants to do everything in the world getting that toy well see that's what we want to do why not let it be a big surprise we know a lot about the Millennium yeah and that's good but why spend our time thinking about that when we should be thinking about the parts related to us now he's already come to redeem all right you come in the Millennium will come back with him physically all right but be concerned with where we are now and you'd be surprised how the world religion thinks of the second coming as it would call it of Christ and and they have it in a physical forms and all kind of relationships and you know instead of it being you know the true way but if he comes as a thief in a night then how can it be a physical and we went through that that Jesus does not put his feet on Earth in a physical form until in the millennial reign all right we meet him in the air Joe then people are saying oh he's coming this he's coming that was doing it what are you talking about yeah but the Bible says ever I'll see him and we're in the day with unit with internets and things and it doesn't make any difference ever I couldn't see him go to a lot of places that don't go but see then the Millennium would have to be the coming of the Lord in relationship with that scripture that then ever I could see you know all right well see then we're trying to place one here and one here and we got it all figured out as our our ways of thinking but is that his way of thinking all right the last message was what had earned first John where it talks about the appearing and the coming all right and the prophet we went through that Sunday afternoon there and he said he's appearing Among Us now sick being healed all kind of signs and wonders taking place in his appearing but he said now the appearing and the coming is two different things all right so now we would um sound a trumpet to the part of him saying well he's here now appearing Among Us and that's what most people preach how that it was Dire in him and and all of that but what about his coming was he his coming well that's what a lot of them try to preach you know and then they take it into the 63 and the coming of the Lord and the different things but why did we wind up talking about if this is not a physical coming and we're not talking about to the world we're not talking on that we're talking about to the bride because when brother Brown said there's three comings he relates it to the bride but we know there is at least two more comings into the world and to the Jews all right so then think about it in the prophet's message and down through time God has been appearing right but then a stage begin to develop in the ministry of the prophet until when the seals begin to be open the things that he began to talk about him being here in a way that was you know beyond all things he would talk of him present you know like and I know I've always just been wondered when I goof up I always admit it and try to get it straight that's the best way we get down to the message where we've always quoted that right around and said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here that's really talking about the Antichrist I mean the direct quote is talking about the enemy I'll give you that in a minute and you know but I still believe one thing if the enemy's here then he comes second he don't come first all right that's right what I've been saying is right but just quoting brother random and you'd say well he didn't throw them I'm talking about the enemy okay you got me Crow but listen to the rest of the message you know I at least to admit it and about what about you okay get over there but see we know that part of his coming and already happened because he's already come to redeem all right so we're not looking for a another Coming For That and we know that the second part of his coming the prophet said is to catch the bride away and for her to get ready during this time amen all right now I want to use a scripture and approach it from you know a point and then we'll get into the main point I want to say so go ahead brother uh and pull up Matthew 24. and let's think about it Matthew 24 1-3 and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them seeing out all these things really I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down now we've been through that oh that read that memorize that right and as you set up on the Mount of Olives now brother run said that was in the morning he said now here he comes in the evening as you set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be now he doesn't put anything up here about that does it that's one stone upon another they know that he's talking about something so they continue the thought all right and what shall be the sign of thy coming they knew he had been talking about his coming and brother random the quote is said he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first all right so then without to relate that all right one shall be the sign of thy coming out of the end of the world all right so the runner says he answered those three questions and he goes straight to Matthew 24 and he takes the seals because that's in the Sixth Seal where he's doing it and in The Sixth Seal he takes Matthew 24. in Revelation 6 and Compares them together right you remember all right and in doing that he shows how this is what this is what this is what and he said he answered all three questions all right so now he put it in the scripture When shall these things be we know that's Titus you know there won't be one stone left on another Titus in 87 he came in and destroyed Jerusalem all right now I'm looking at the quotes if you desire them that's the way the prophet explained it and what shall be the sign of thy coming all right so he puts it in the scripture and he immediately starts talking about the Antichrist I was talking about Matthew 24 of the the things and when he says lo here low there don't go read Matthew 24. all right and when you do you'll find that in answering all three of those questions he's talking to the bride of Christ he's talking to the Natural Jew which they were they will be interrelated unto it but yet we don't need to be concerned about Titus that's already gone and there's no need for us to be concerned with the end of the world don't you want to know when the end of work no but I'd be worried to death and you would too and you've got he's coming in a month he's coming in the Years coming we got to get ready you know they don't ain't worried about her forget it but we ought to be concerned with when he said the sign of thy coming for them no that should be the thing that you and I should be concerned about tonight all right the sign of thy coming okay then if the sign of thy coming we'll read it in a little bit and we've always talked about it it's a secret coming and a secret coming is like a thief in the night the scripture speaks of and it's like in Luke there where it speaks of two in the bed one taken one left two in the field one taken one left you know Etc it covers those things as to being in his coming but what what is the sign of his coming you know what is the sign of his coming see because that's what we need to be concerned about all right jump on over to number six I'm gonna quit writing these things down one of these days and I don't use them go to number six brother recognizing your day in this message and look what he says if they only recognized a promised sign of the Messiah the sign of the son of man he come in the name of the son of man sign of his coming is the Messiah sign now we fall back to Luke 17 30. in a day when the son of man would be revealed right he would go back to the prophet's message it will go through his message and we see that the Lord Jesus had the Messiah sign it was a sign of the Resurrection all right Joy that God had raised they're in him not because he's dead and gone he was Dire all right when it comes over in our day then the sign of the son of man see brother random will stand there and he'd say now here's what Jesus done and he says now let's see if he'll do the same thing all right now anybody with one-eyed or Brother Don ruddle you say that tickle me anybody with one-eyed in high sense I know that's pretty good quote I ought to know that we have had the sign of the Resurrection Among Us in the ministry of the prophet right because that was what all of that was about that's why I said none of the writers Paul or none of them talked about the son of man here come the seventh grade education man walks out there and he starts talking about the son of man when even the scholars wrote very little of him you know in that form of what that would mean it would relate it back to Jesus are coming to the Jews you see so what is the sign of the coming of the Lord that you and I need to be concerned about the prophet's message that was brought to you and I that word that he was doing was the son of man he was a son of man right right he said I'm not the son of man I'm a son of man these son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right but the Lord Jesus Christ came down in a man in our day and done as he said more was done in one service than was even recorded in the Bible and things of the ministry of Jesus Christ now that's something in it we can all look back and see the sign of the son of man we can all look back and talk about those days talk about the the great things that happened and all that's well and good and newcomers coming in must hear that right because remember we don't all come in at once and remember we don't know a whole lot when we come in and I don't care how much you say I knew this and I knew that that's a grain of salt compared to the entire ocean what little bit I saw before I come into the message is that what I compare it to one grain of salt compared with all the salt in the ocean all right but what is now the sign of the son of man It's The Sign of the Messiah showing he is risen all right and brother random we read there the other day said if he let this world go on you know without coming to give the end time sign it'd be unjust you remember because he was back there but then he put us up on Theology and we had to make our decisions about he said that wouldn't be right he said so he'd sinned the sign of the son of man the sound of his coming was that what Jesus said they asked him what would be the sign of thy coming well one day the skies are split and all this will take place I'll let go read Matthew 24. I didn't make the statement not responsible but he is he said he answered all three questions in Matthew 24. I thought about reading that I had something to read about the in The Sixth Seal of the things but you that are sitting here tonight shouldn't have to have these things you ought to know the message what is the sign of die coming what are we to look for to think about the coming that we're talking about not talking about the end of the world not talking about the coming to the Jews we're talking about the coming to the bride what is the sign that the bride is supposed to be dwelling on at this time the sign of the Resurrected Messiah and that's what that Prophet see when he walked out there people had the Holy Ghost right Holy Ghost come on today Azusa Street in the fullness there you know right around call it a great prophet go to 464 the silver and read it but see then here he comes and he begins to speak about the son of man you know what God come behind him and Vindicated it right sick was healed dead was raised but you know it wasn't just in his ministry who wouldn't Smith Wiggles worth I try and think of him the other day when him one of them well what is 17 times or something like that of the Dead raised all right let's see Smith Wigglesworth didn't have the fully revealed word huh as I told you Clarence Larkin before brought around him said the white horse rider was the Antichrist but he wasn't the prophet and didn't have the word even though he was writing what he said there's got to be a message and run around and said these signs and things is to get the attention of the people is that right boy look the Lord's mama look no what was he trying to get the attention to the people for you know that all the times of prophet no signs was taking place everybody loved him right oh they wanted him it was like the Lord Jesus this young Prophet From Galilee we love him he can feed us he can do all the things but then when he began to say I and my father are one right see brother random was popular until he began to preach the word and then what did I tell him you're called to pray for the sick leave the preaching to us you say well there's not a direct quote of that but what do you think they were saying come on get a little sense what do you think they were saying said leave that to the others you just pray for the sick praying for the sick was just a sign it wasn't the voice right see we must be dealing with a voice to be able to relate to Lord himself she'll send him heaven and Shout voice of an archangel what are you following me what is the sign of the son of man all right it's the resurrection sign okay we go with that but is it just it just sounds like that or was there a message to father those signs okay my brother Bosworth said what said brother Reynolds said to bait on the hook it's just a tantalize her you know I mean just get the attention of the fish see the main thing is the message the Lord Jesus had a message right well I'm just Matthew Mark Luke and John is just some little things that he'd done he told about what he'd done now the Irish word you don't read go in the seal book to the six seal and read it where brother random Compares I said a moment ago Matthew 24. to revelation 6. and places the seals right up to the sixth one and in Matthew 24 what is it 30 something when it starts talking about the tribulation and that was so related in his writings until we Baptists taught that Jesus spoke of a tribulation because it's in the Bible I see Jesus brought a message Matthew 24 is his message that's really when he said I and my father are one because when he would say unless you believe that I am healed and you said they pay no attention oh y'all later they said you're a man making yourself God but what really made him upset with him not the signs of the Wonders right it was the message he brought what made brother Branham very unpopular until in the end time preaching in a trailer with 30 or sometime or less in his early Ministry of three or four hundred thousand in a meeting the message brother Branham began to bring was the opening of the word now what part then if we're not to be concerned with a physical coming if we're not to be concerned with a cool 16 element body Etc in our part what are we to be concerned with foreign you see Church the difference in brother Branham and the people in his day was one thing he had a message they had signs and wonders if I misquote this you just put it the old ignorance but he's told one time that he prayed for a man's nose to be restored and it was two or three weeks somebody else he gave in there was at Bosworth three times one one of me said that man prayed for her nose to be restored and it was instantly restored there was a lot of healing going on in the day when the prophet began to go out with his message but there was only one message and he said if you go on with the same simple message or come with it and he said and signs and wonders follow it he said don't do that see is God sending it among us to Thrice what is the sign of thy coming then Jesus we ask you the question he turned right around and answered the question but because he didn't use the words that they thought see mankind turn to get left let's do that let's I know where they are I got a little time I'm ahead tonight so let's just read Matthew 24. I was going to do this and I thought no surely everybody knows it or it went through down to verse three and one shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and brother Brianna says 368 to see a book 408 of the seal for 368 I know for sure said he answered three questions and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for a minute shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many that's the random place is that one and puts it with the first seal the white horse rider read you see a book for a minute shall come in my name saying I am Christ and deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars he places that right in to the second seal for Nations shall rise against nation and kingdoms against Kingdom places in the third seal verse 9 and then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you you shall be hated of all nations from my name and shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many he places that as a force seal remember he answered them all but he that shall endure to the end oh excuse me and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold that he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world or witness that are in places that in the first real then he goes to Matthew 24 28 for where so ever the carcass is shall the Eagles be gathered together we know that's in the bride immediately after the tribulation of those days verse 29 and 30 goes right straight into the Sixth Seal so Jesus spoke of six seals the son of man wrote a message not to just talk about him and the father being one you know them old Jews standing there that's right we want we won with him he's our daddy well how come they got upset with him when they believed it God was their daddy and he just said God wasn't that what he said he said if you get upset with me about it he said all I said was that I'm a son of God you know and that's what you are yeah yeah what separated window signs and the Wonders especially in this relationship to the end time of the outpouring of the spirit as we read want to go upon All Flesh what made the difference the message he brought the message he brought was really the proof of him being one with his father Cody said I do nothing until the father shows me now if he didn't do nothing until he showed him and brother Brown said he'd get a vision you go do it you know raise ladders Etc well now if he'd done nothing until the father showed him then he didn't speak until the father showed him right is that true now so you're getting the message are you relating the message to what I'm talking about what is the sign of thy coming there was to be a message come in the end time a prophet would come and preach six seals and relate it right back into Matthew 24 to show that Jesus had preached six seals and Iran's message didn't begin until the opening of the seals come on how much do you need of that Rapture message he said not in the days of the doing but in the when he begins to sound the other was restoration back to the face of the fathers and then his message those things had already been brought by the apostles and he had to come and preach it back to that part then his message would come and see then that's the the problem with mankind see they're looking for something to come when the Lord had already descended from heaven with a shout and he's already in the second stage of his coming in the bride and what did we read the other day in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church he said why should we be concerned that's the biggest thing that I've said about the people of the message you let anybody go for it well some got a little sign everybody runs for it yeah but he he don't believe that well the Lord's vindicating him he's not vindicating him signs and wonders falling everywhere and it will get more and more so how much deceiving is it but what about the message you know what most people would be and I'm just as honest thing because I said this for 45 years and I'm done against anybody but you let the Baptist Church you let healings and signs and wonders fall in any church Baptist Methodist but Catholics or whatever the biggest force of people this message would run over there let's go check it out I can quote right after brother random passed away there was a man that had signs and wonders some name brands went to check him out he Ard I let this happen God says to try you try you to what to see where you'll try to stir up signs and wonders no right you just see where you'll stay with a word or not right what does it matter about the signs and wonders because what has that got to do with the coming of the Lord when we've just read that in the last days the last two thousand years then what would it be I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters will prophesy my handmaids my people right around said it was poured out upon all people but where's the message where's the message that goes with it well I I didn't know we had to have him actually I thought we had the message well if we've got the message why are we looking for signs hey come on folks don't look at me you know what I am and the way I stand we believe in signs and wonders in little Georgia we send the sick heal the dead Rays storms spoke out of existence rain brought into existence we've seen God move I've seen the angel of the Lord three times so God's standing in a church why would I worry about signs and wonders I saw that when I was 11 years old but you you tell them things like You're exalted I'm exalting Jesus Christ because that's the only one to do it because I didn't have anything to do with it coming but why is it that we're so unpopular it's because of the stand on the message right well I thought that was what it's supposed to be myself because I didn't know I'll give you that one word I can keep my word uh look at number nine brothers taken souls in prison because I used to quote this 1963 11 10 the morning service and I had a lot of other people quoting it because they were quoting me I guess and look what he says as an American one time when the enemy was about to take this country there's a man in the Midnight Hour jumped on a horse and rode down the road screaming the enemy is coming it was Paul Revere I am an American too and I'm writing this Midnight Hour not saying the enemy is coming but he's here he ain't coming he's already here he's done conquered hmm I used to quote that as the Holy Ghost but now like I said not to prop up nothing but remember Jesus comes before the enemy comes the enemy comes as an impersonator he doesn't come first he follows after God all right so now I can say for myself then I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here now we'll get through in a hurry tonight because you wonder maybe why I read in the book of Acts about the outpouring of the holy spirit in the last days we just remember and I'll be glad to give you the quotes they're laying in the office Peter got up and he said this is that it was promised a Joel brother random says this is that talking about the Holy Ghost and coming into life days and pouring out upon All Flesh this is that that was spoken of by the prophet why can't you and I say this is that I'm not looking for his coming now you know what I'm talking about I'm not talking about a physical coming I'm not talking about what will happen to the Jews or whatever happens here or there I'm talking about what your Prophet gave that we've given over and over and even one of them's in the future home where he says he comes three times he said he come one to redeem the bride he comes the second time with his bride he comes the third time in the millennium the Millennium is a physical coming and we come back with him but I'm concerned with that part we're and what is the sign of thy coming a sign of the son of man the resurrection sign not going to go back and say something without you thinking it's all exalted you've heard it over and over and most of you know what I'm fixing to say my heart and I could have you to quote it for me that the first sermon I preached in 1969 was the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man well because you'll be the word made flesh that will be his second coming to take her away if he's not coming physically but we'll become visible Among Us and there is a difference in the appearing in the coming as I said he can appear right over in here in this church right over there and heal the sit and do great things we'll learn to talk to him about to go yeah one day you know Eastern Sky split and we'll hear a trumpet we'll hear the if you don't believe that's right Go Out Among the people of the message and see what they're looking for I told you I talked to a man the other day if he hears this he knows what I said he said you're not looking for him the Rapture is not going that way to you and I said no it ain't Rapture is coming this way he said I never saw that until you know well I wonder how many people are still thinking about a Rapture is going away you got to have the coming of the Lord in his second stage of his coming to take his bride away before you can talk about a rapture so let me say it I've been laying there this morning thinking Lord how did I go with this Where'd I go tonight scripture come into my mind said this is that now I'll say this away if this ain't that leave me alone I'm happy with this and when that gets here I'll be ready but if we're not in what's taking place now we will not be ready the prophet said being in the wrong rights that the Rapture would be no excuse 40 something years ago right in that area I said the biggest portion of the people of this message will die and go by the grave I don't have to say that I'm cruel on that tonight I'll just let the people in the congregation how many of you remember me saying that over 40 years uh would you mind letting raise your hand and let them scan and let's look at you and see how many of you heard me say that the biggest portion of people is going to die and go by the grave amen so you scan it around and see so it's not a statement tonight I'm not degraded nobody with that statement either because I've always explained that if you got the new birth you're going to be there you're going down go by the grave but you're going to be there you're going to be raised you're going to be brought forth not a degrading to nobody but a simple statement of fact why because if I don't have Rapture and faith I can't be standing there at the time is required I would miss what's going away if I don't see what's here I cannot talk about what's there how many years ago was it 10 years ago matching pieces 19 and 95. going on 20 years and I preached the series called matching pieces and I said when we match Revelations 5. remember Revelations 5 there's 24 Elders 12 Apostles Trump patriotic so when we match what those ages and things it showed us dire and we're going to go but if we don't match it we're going by the grave because somebody has got to come to that place you see tonight I can say this is that this is what I've looked forward to for 45 years or more to be able to say he's here not that he's coming he's here because in that it's not a physical coming to say he's here it's a revealing of his word amen is just in case there was on internet don't want to follow that I'd ask you to listen to Sunday morning's message I might read a few quotes that you might not have read or you read over them of what his coming is what if we were looking for his coming and he's already come right what if that could take place see this is that it was spoken of by all the prophets because this is the ending up of all things there's not another age another time to come not another Prophet to be sent and those things so this is that but when we're going to start saying it and like I said if this ain't that leave me alone I'm happy because to me this is that right right that was spoke about not just just well all the prophets spoke of the coming of the Lord and the ending up of all things so this is that not looking for it to take place looking for more of it to come into manifestation yes and one day we will leave the Earth amen because we go meet him in the air wow but I don't think we need to be worried about a spaceship right now because remember if we even talk about a spaceship make sure and I'm out quote to profit that you're pressurized you remember that you're getting a little airplane Ryan I like to ride in them but you get a pair of 500 feet or a thousand feet and look down it looks beautiful you can't go with a propeller driven plane but so high because the oxygen Runs Out and you got a problem well here come a jet for us to be able to just been up 42 000 feet I remember that that day and the guy said it was about 38 000 he said bad weather ahead we're going up little buddy come back on he said we're flying at 42 000 feet I thought that'd be a long ways to walk pretty Cloud down below you look like you can just step out on them I love it look out them windows and see looked like he just stepped from One Cloud to another but after all of that still wouldn't pressurize enough to take an outer space trip so the prophet said interplanetary travel is the top of the rapture them going to the moon was the top of the Rapture because it had to be pressurized and you got to stay pressurized because you turn that pressure off and what would happen I remember brother Tom far Bush he was a deep sea diver and a welder underneath the boats and things and had to be in no suits and uh the pressure and everything had to be just right he said if that pressure cuts off he said you will come up through that round hose they don't have no great big hoses cooked to them guys he said you obese come up just as nothing but blood and because the pressure's gone well that's the way it is without Jesus Christ but if we can get pressurized and get just right there'll be a rapture I believe that there'll be a coming of the Lord to Israel there'll be a coming of the Lord back to the Earth with a bride but I'm concerned with what's taking place right now this is that where you and I are living come on musicians let's stand this is that that was spoken of by all the prophets this is the end of all things and what are we doing well okay maybe I guess in a way member the MU is the one that said in a way remember that but you see I know and realize also one thing because I say tonight this is that some people will say this is that but I also know one thing if it's not revealed to you like it's revealed to me it's not that to you if you don't see where we're at what I say is Vine jangling words of what you think is exalted in you know trying to make something out of yourself but you know somebody's going to say it the prophet said when you begin to say I and my father are one and those other things he said to shook will pull away well let's at least get the other things all right what we got brother man anybody have a need thank you very about Hank and Martha Martin because they're in a lot of trouble I talked to him today and a lot of you don't know she tried Sunday night there's problems it's you know there's a lot of things a lot of trouble but he wants to help her and he's doing the best he can but he can't leave her because you know you just can't leave her I talked to him this morning and I worked with him two days in a row and she came and seemed to be doing better but see she's up and down and she's hindered him and he's hindering her and the whole thing just going wrong so let's believe she was diagnosed as schizophrenic and bipolar and got a lot of problems a lot of medication and just you know me maybe we can't even think about being that away but she can't help being what she is at the time because of that and we don't blame them I told her the other day I said we're going to win the battle over this we're going to win we did a lot of battle you can't take her off the medicine unless totally unless God just come down all at once and totally delivered her you can't do that to the human body just wants to stand for me we're going to send these two prayer claws and let's believe father we put everything we got upon one thing and that's You Are the Healer you're the deliverer you are the one Lord that would come and make manifest your word we send these prayer claws to our brother and sister we just ask you to come on the scene and deliver Lord and just let your love be made manifest we as the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world call for this prayer brother and sister and we believe you in Jesus name thank you anybody else that have a

in you that by your stripes our brothers in Jesus name see this is that that was spoken of this is our benefit you heard our sisters he just needs more faith we believe you we've seen you he'll deliver God and take care so we just ask you to come down touch our sister take away this hurting in the body and these things it's a hindrance to her Lord let her see that she has more faith in than she's thinking all she's got to do is just start saying by it stops I'm Healed and we believe you father in Jesus name anybody else see church this is that if not let me get there this is what was
