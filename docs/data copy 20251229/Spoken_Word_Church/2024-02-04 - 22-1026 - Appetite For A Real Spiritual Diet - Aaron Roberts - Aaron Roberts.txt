something that's uh kind of along those lines something that's been on my heart and uh I don't know how this how this will go and uh maybe more than one part of this but uh we just see just let the let the Lord speak tonight so amen just uh just trust in him and appreciate uh all the brothers like brother Lis he's not here but uh I appreciate brother Lis he always sends you encouraging it text message when you got to preach on Wednesday night and that's always that's always nice to hear something and know somebody's behind you and praying for you and you know it's just I appreciate him and I one of the things I was thinking about today was you know a lots of times when brother Lis has preached he gets up here and the first thing he'll say is this is this is geared toward the young people this is for the young people so uh tonight this is kind of toward the young people but hey we're all walking the same Journey so it's whether you're whether you're young or young at heart it's for every every one of us and so uh just appreciate each one and uh I uh wanted to say that uh I Sunday I I was I got to go to India again and I didn't preach but brother Matthew Bray did and uh it was really really good service and so I just wanted to be there and support him and we got to go and then Lord willing I'm preaching for the church in shenah Christmas morning so y'all pray for me so they're having a they're having a special meeting and and there and they have a dinner where the church gets together so um I I with honor to to do that so it's not too bad you know I would I would much rather get up at 11:30 at night and get ready and preach and then go back to bed then they fly 14 16 20 hours fly around the world have to deal with customs and and all that kind of stuff and uh it works really nice you know you can see them they can see you you can hear them and uh I don't know I don't know what they're saying most of the time they they pray and they sing and I don't know their language but I can tell you what the Holy Ghost is there you can feel the spirit moving and so it's it's it's nice to just be in the presence of them and and so uh y'all just continue to remember them and uh they certainly send their love and prayer prayers and their greetings to you I know they really appreciate and as a body around the world whether you understand their language or you never see them or anything you know what you're still in their prayers and it's really nice to have brothers and sisters around the world because you know what one of these days we're going to have a great family reunion and we're going to get together and we're going to be able to hug people's necks and and shake hands with those that we've just seen on on in pictures and we've just seen through the internet but we're going to be able to put our hands on so and uh just continue to remember you know the fold Ministry the different ones around the world and so um you know God's raising up he's got men raising up men young men that's carrying this message on brother renom said to sweep it on to the coming of the Lord so amen just just wonderful wonderful things and but anyway Let's uh let's just all bow our heads I know each one of us got a a need a desire from God and we're just going to look to the Lord this evening and just speak to him before we read the scripture so let's just all pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord to come to your house again Lord Lord together with those of like Precious Faith Lord Lord that we can come before you Lord and bring our needs and our petitions before you Lord and Lord we've we've set aside this time father to gather with you father that you may have the preeminence in this service Lord just come

continue to remember them Lord hold them up bless them wherever they may be Lord we just ask that your blessing be upon the word as we read it and Upon Us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Genesis chapter 2 we're going to start at verse 15 and uh tonight got a brother Lis always seems to like my my sermon title see I always have good tonight I'm going to preach on an appetite for a real spiritual diet and uh cuz you know what um y'all may not y'all may not know this but if you extracted all of the parts out of the Bible that talked about eating and food and dietary laws and everything like that there wouldn't be a whole lot left in the Bible you know so what was that no we're gonna get on we need to get on the right kind of diet but see you know and that's how you look at it as as somebody was saying Sunday it's the right mental attitude to the any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass amen so this is Genesis 2 verse1 15 and it says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die Matthew 4:4 says but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and John chapter 6 we're going to begin at verse 28 there and the scripture says then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he has sent they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what Dost thou work our fathers did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven see they kept looking back but they they were missing because the day of visitation was the day that they were living in that's right for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord ever more give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out amen God bless you tonight you may be seated and you know like they say diet's a four-letter word and uh you know just like a lot of other four-letter words it's a it's a touchy subject but I just want to you know share a few things with you tonight and like I said this is kind of geared to the to the young people but you know I was I was looking at some things and this is is I was doing I was reading some things and um just some interesting things that stood out to me um I was reading a article that was talking about a study that was done by the University of Washington and they were the in the study that they were talking about your diet has more effect on you than a lot of other things and according to this study that was done a poor diet kills more people globally than tobacco high blood pressure or any other risk that's associated with a person it all goes and they said according to the CDC 45% of all illnesses and problems that we have in the human body is directly related to a subop optimal diet so if you don't have a very good diet then 45% of the health care is being spent trying to take care of people and just looking at uh I was looking at some at some data and according to uh some of the research I was doing the health food industry is it makes up just now this is not Health Care this is just health food healthc care is over $800 billion a year and in three years it's going to be over a trillion dollars they expect just the money that we're spending on healthc care but on just on health food and wellness the industry vitamins and and all that kind of stuff right now that industry is 298 billion a year and it's worth the worth of the health food and wellness industry is $841 billion they spend a lot of money in health care and wellness and selling new vitamins and supplements there's a lot that's tied to that so your diet has in the natural has a lot to do with that your health and your wellness and the condition that your body is in and it I was just looking at some of those things and it just kind of when you start to think about that that's quite of a staggering numbers when you when you look at those things and I was just really amazed at that but you know food and you know food and diets a is a big thing that you know we all have we all have to live and we all we all have to talk about it and you know we always everywhere you go there's advertisements and you can't go anywhere without somebody and uh I was think thinking the other day that you know lots of times when you people get into talking about food you know some of the some of the earliest Jing you know commercials and things like that that's the first thing that people remember is songs that are and Jingles that are associated with food and you know I was I was thinking you know how you little kids you know the first thing you know and and little kids may not even know what they're singing about but you know what they know who Oscar might is they can sing about baloney and they can sing about a hot dog but you know I mean they get why because that I mean those little things like that people get those jingles in their minds why because you feed on that and so it feeds right into food you know there's there's uh young young ladies in in this church tonight and if you go to social media uh some of these some of these these ladies they have really um nice social accounts and they put all these nice little pictures of food and they show you preparing all this food and um I've made some inquiries on some of it I was like you know it's really bad that y'all put all these pictures on there but we never get to see any of it we never get to try any of it I think if you're going to put pictures on there I mean I think it'd be nice for y'all to bring it you know I mean that's just that's just me and brother Wade but you know I mean we'd like to like we think you ought to do that you know that's that's just kind of bad you just put all these pictures on there but uh maybe maybe one of these days they'll they'll think about us and and bring us something but you know I mean everybody everybody deals with food I mean it's in your diet and every time you go to the doctor that's the first thing they want to do they're asking you about you know I don't know about y'all but that's the first thing the doctor looks at me and it's like you know you're you're an you're the ideal weight for somebody that's 7 and 1/2 ft tall or 8T tall or whatever you know but you at least at least I am the ideal weight for somebody that's right but you know I mean everybody deals with with food and and diet and you know all of these things all tieing together about try in the natural we all everybody talks about and so is it the same way in the spiritual to deal with the the body brother and uh Matthew 5 Jesus says blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and so you know we all have to have a a a diet we all have to eat you know I think about sometimes the first thing that happens after Wednesday night service and I'm not mentioning any names but you know who you are the first thing they do when they get out of here and they they hear they got one word on their mind how many it's cookout we're going to cookout cookout cookout cookout that's not a good that's not a bad thing you know I I like cooking but you know I mean that's that's the thing and I know because you know if I get up here and I start mentioning food and diet then you know what some I'm gonna lose some of you I know that because y'all will have your minds on other things because it'll it'll affect your bellies and it'll affect your mind but that's but that's okay okay we'll we'll get through then amen but you know a diet but I I want I'm laying all this as a background because it's important as we see all these things in the natural we got to see these things in the spiritual because you know blessed is he that meditates on the law day and night right and you know he said he said he shall be like as a tree planted by the rivers of water and so all of these things tie into the natural tying in with the spiritual now this is from the message the ement I'm going I going to read a couple of quotes here from from the message and uh just kind of just kind of lay a foundation now brother R says in from the message in tment he said now notice Jesus invested with all the powers of God but when he met Satan he never used any of his powers he only referred to the word he did he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then how can you how can you stay home that you can say you can stay home and be just as good a Christian as you would be at church you can't do it read the word amen the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you water it and every Divine promise will produce just exactly what God said it would do it's got to it's his word and it's life and from the message this is this is coming from the message the water of separations here and brother Rand was speaking of he's speaking of leprosy and you know he talks about the two Turtle does when in the Old Testament you know when they found um leprosy in the house you know when the priest had to shut it up for seven days and then when he went in you know they had to for purification they had to had to take the two turtle doves and and they killed one and they dipped it or sprinkled the blood on it and they released it but you know they had to do all that for the sanctifying of the house and you know they had to get rid of all the you know if there was leprosy that was found in on any of the dwelling of the house the rocks or anything like that they pulled all that out and threw it away they had to be had to be put in an unclean place they had to get rid of it and replace all that and you know the high priest had or the priest had to come in there and he was the one that had to give them the okay to go back in the house they were separated and cut off until the high priest give them the okay to go back in and now this is from the message the water of separation and and brother Bam's speaking of here and he's talking about the um the doves and and he says and one dove was killed and and this and put Cedar and Scarlet and his up and the his up sprinkled the the living bird the living bird was taken out in a field and turned loose and when its Little Wings was fluttering and flying out like that that the blood of its dead mate on it was for a cleansing of leprosy which is a type of sin was a type of the church with the blood of the Savior the the Lord Jesus Christ who died in your stad and the blood cried holy unto the Lord amen the blood sprinkling the ground holy holy unto the Lord a cleansing of leprosy I just learned some from medical research the other day what leprosy caused from the wrong diet that's what causes sin is the wrong spiritual diet it causes an eating leprosy that only God Alone can cure so that that was kind of a thing that you know just looking at some of these things and so we understand that how our diet is is an important thing and what we eat is important but you know one of the things that when we when we look at it it's not just it's not just having the diet but you know a a a the word appetite is the reason I put the word appetite in there is because the word appetite is a desire it's a longing and so you know God gave the children of Israel he gave them the most perfect food brother said the most perfect food that they could have was mana and he he took care of them and he brought them all the way and he and he carried you brought them into the into the journey bringing them into the promised land took care of all their needs but he gave them exactly what they had needed of which was mana and but you know the people began to complain about the Mana here was here's the most perfect food that they had but you know what they didn't have a desire for it right brother R says you when they when they came out and the first thing that they could do was look back to Egypt and complain oh if we didn't have garlic if we didn't have some leaks you know all the great things that we had in Egypt and we loathe this light bread here here we are we're eating what God is the most perfect food the most perfect item that you could eat but the problem was they had no desire for it right and we know that you know God sent quail and you know God killed them because they're they're their unthankfulness for what God done for them I mean you know when when God does everything for you and you know when you when you see in this journey when when they were walking everything that they had need of God took care of and when when when he brought them out and you know because one of the problems that they had was they had to get the mentality of being slaves out of their mind when they when they were being beat by the task Masters and they were under that bondage when all they could see was the the sovereignty of the Egyptians when all they could see was the greatness of the Egyptians you know they were bound but you know there somebody had to come and they had to believe what Moses said he said by a strong hand but he said listen he said he said your father Abraham walked in this land he walked in all this and he said this where you're going to you're going to this land and he said guess what he said he he made a promise to Abraham he said he said that your Offspring your descendants would sojourn in a Strange Land but he said I'll bring them out and all those years that they had been down there and no doubt there was some of them that were still there telling them about the great the great king the great man Joseph who was next to pharaoh and the great things that he had done now they kept rehearsing those words in the ears of the children of Israel the problem was is the Egyptians forgot where they came from when God came on the scene and saved their lives when he fed them when the word came to Joseph in the midst when the when the Pharaoh was troubled with his dream and they came and he gave them the interpretation of how they were going to save themselves and how the Fulfillment of of Joseph's dreams to his brothers how how that he saw them bowing down to him and even his father when when Jacob saw that and and saw he was greatly loved and understood him to be spiritual understood Joseph to be spiritual and a prophet when he understood that and then he said what do you mean that I'm going to bow down to you but it was still the truth it was still the word of God it still came to pass and when all of the when they came over and and what he said what I'm going to raise up one that's going to bring you out by a strong hand and yet when they see all those things it's amazing that they actually went through all 10 of those hit hit Egypt and they saw each one of them here they are in Gan and they're looking over there and seeing darkness when they're in Goan and they're in safety and they see when they see the wrath of God being poured out on the Egyptians and they're looking over there and they're seeing the destruction and they're in safety and they're seeing the they're seeing what God is doing for them and yet when God tells them that it's time to get up and go what's the first thing that he does in the when when the when the death of the firstborn came then what was what was he told him under under the under the uh law under the Commandment that Moses had given them under the time that they were going to leave he said this night he said the the Slayer coming through and he said he'll kill all the firstborn man and beast but he said you must take a lamb a perfect lamb and set it up and he said not only for your family but your neighbors whoever for for the eating the of the Lamb each person must eat their portion there's a portion of this lamb that's and he said when you take this and he said then you have unleavened bread with it he said you come with your shoes on your feet you come with a staff in your hand and you come and you eat it he said you eat it you roast it with the bitter herbs he said you roast the whole thing by itself and you know he said I I couldn't I couldn't imagine taking a whole animal usually we have the we have the decency to take all its inals out but here they put every it had to be completely whole and had to be roasted and then they had to eat that amen why because you you're not going to do away with any portion of it you have to take the whole lamb it must take the whole word so all of it has to be together and when they ate their portion then they were being brought out but see here they they had to get a they had God had to get them accustom to understand it was what was going to take place why because they had a mentality of being a Slave and then when they came out and they began to go on the journey but the first thing they had was complaints as they brought them out and they come to the to the Red Sea and even Moses getting messed up in his own commission when God began to speak to him and tell him what was going to take place he said Don't Cry To Me Speak the word and go forward why because you've been ordained to do this and here they are walking across the dry land two million people 2 and a half million people walking on dry land and passing through the great sea the Red Sea that was you know this great sea that had been opened up to them and here they are walking upon great dry ground but they couldn't get they couldn't get Egypt out of their mind but you know we see all those things that God done he brought them all the way through and he began to deal with them and trying to get but you know what they still had a desire of the things of Egypt they still had to desire the things of the world right why because they never had a never I got an appetite for what God was giv them and see this is this is from the the message from the message thirst brother Bram says he said now there is nothing can satisfy that thirst that sent a human being until God comes in he must have it or die and no person has a right to try to hush and or satisfy that Holy thirst that sent him by the things of the world no sir it's ungodly to do so and if you thirst for God don't shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book if you're thirsting for God there's only one thing to satisfy it that's meet God if you're thirsting for God that's the only way you can meet him is to do that he said then there is a great danger also if you don't watch what you're doing in that time if you're thirsting for God be sure it's God you find see be sure that it's your thirst is satisfied but if Satan has been able to pervert you from these natural appetites that he'll do if he can he'll make you he'll simply make you try to be satisfied so Satan so we must know that we have a must have a desire for these things and only God can give you the desire for those things but you know he said every Man was created with the desire inside of him you got a thirst inside of you're going to find something that's going to satisfy that but it must it only you got to make sure that you find God and and one of the things I I want to I want to speak about tonight and it was just something that's been on me is you know this this time of of the week you know we're getting ready to go to camp and you know so many times I I've I've heard not only here but other other young people and the first thing that they start talking about is you know they start getting ready for camp and it's not just packing a bag and it's not just you know getting ready and and making plane tickets or or getting ready you know however that they're going to travel or all those things but you know the first thing that they start doing is they start getting their mind and it's not just seeing their friends or or looking at boys or looking at girls but you know they start getting their mind on God because you there's lots of times when kids go to Camp the first thing they start talking about is and I one of the one of the reasons why it come to me was I was thinking about brother Andrew Glover you know he was talking about being a young you know going to youth camps and everything and he was talking about being in Louisiana Camp one time and you know he said this was my year he said he went he went to Louisiana camp with a full expression the full intent of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said this was he said it was my year and he said I wasn't leaving until I got it and he said when he went down to that camp in Louisiana and he said they started that prayer line and he went through that prayer line he said the Lord got a hold of him the Lord touched him and he said never been the same and so he had it in his mind to do that and so that's the first thing you got to do you've got to get it in your mind and lots of times when when the young people they start getting ready to start going to Camp the first thing that starts happening is when you start thinking about going to Camp the first thing to do is the devil's going to sit on your shoulder and he's going to start talking to you he's got he's already tonight no doubt he's already been talking to you because when I mentioned going to camp and the Lord's wanting to speak to you the first thing the devil's like he ain't talking about you yes I am the Lord's talking to you if you if you if anybody says well I'm not sure well let me tell you I if if I don't I'm I'm pray for I I'll try to get to it tonight but listen if if I want you to understand if you understand what God is speaking he's speaking to you how many times have have you known young people they start getting ready to go to camp and the first thing they get sick how many of them all of a sudden they start trying to get ready for camp and and the first thing that happens is they get the sniffles or they get some kind of illness or whatever and next thing you know the first thing that pops in their mind is you're not gonna be able to go to Camp well let me tell you something we're g to pray and and not no we're not praying just just for the ones that are here I mean we're praying I've been praying for the whole Camp because you know what we're going we're going we're going to back the devil up we're going to put the devil in his place because you know I want you to understand that because God is God is speaking to you because today is your day of visitation and you know and I you know we're I I'm going because I I see there's a I I really was really honored that brother Jason actually text me and asked me about coming to help and I was like hey I do whatever I can it's an honor but you know everything because every every part every part has to be important whether whether anybody sees you or not that's not that's not the case there's there's so many things that take place behind the scenes that nobody gets any any any glory for any roses or any recognition for but you know what they're still vital to this thing taking place and and just and just like everybody says well what can I do you can pray that's that's the main thing amen whether you got any kids or not any any grandkids anybody going to Camp you can still pray we're going to hold them up and believe that you know because I I believe I believe that God wants to do something for the people and so we're we're going because I I believe I believe we go up there this weekend but I'm and see I I a lot of things out even think today you know let let's not let's not get to the point now where we where we're waiting on tomorrow come on the Lord speaking tonight so if the Lord's speaking tonight then you don't have to wait till tomorrow or Saturday night or whenever it was you know the Lord's speaking tonight the Lord's speaking to your situation right now but but I'm saying that when we get ready to go to Camp it's just like any other any just like coming to church on Sunday morning having the same expectation to God's going to meet you but you know so many times that that the devil he's going to attack you and he's going to start telling well you're not you can't make it and and your life's not going to change and and and you know all those things you know you're not going to get anything and and you're just going to go and you're just going to come back you're just going to feel good and you'll come back and you'll have the same you'll fight the same battles and you'll have the same failures and everything but no amen so what if you go to and the Lord speaks to you be because whatever takes place whatever happens then you know what it's still you still got to face that de that devil you still got to fight that battle you know one of the things I was I was thinking about when when I was looking at this was you know my own personal experience you know I I thought I was doing okay physically every now and then my heart started racing and bouncing around and you know I I didn't sleep very good sometimes but you know I thought hey I'm okay I'm doing pretty good you know I I felt tired but hey you know that happens a lot of times and a lots of times I just started thinking well I'm just getting older and so this is this is one of the things that I I want to look at tonight but you know I started I started feeling like well I'm starting to get a little older maybe may this this is the problems and and all this kind of thing but you know as as it began to progress I was like hey I got to get I got to get looked at just for my own personal peace of mind but you know what the devil said on he kept telling me and I listened to brother Jason Watkins some time back and brother Jason was talking about he would get out and walk get out and walk in in the mornings walk to track everything get out exercise and he said ever so often he said he kept feeling that pain in his chest and he but he said the other time he didn't have it but he said he got walking he started feeling that pain and it would hit him that same pain all the time and he said they finally found that blockage in there and you know just the hand of the Lord they got the stin and took care of everything but you know it was like you've got a heart problem you got a heart problem a lot of people don't know this but my mom's dad passed away at 44 massive heart attack and you know that's the first thing when you when you think about Grand Paul Gray passing you know that's the first thing the devil puts in your mind dad passed away of a stroke you know a complication from a stroke and you know it's like you know all the all the things that run in the family and it's like well you know what you've got a big dose of it buddy but you know what I just had to keep putting that down I just had no no no no you're a liar and the father of it ain't listening to you but you know it kept coming back so I went to the do you know I finally I just like listen I got to got this thing checked out cuz this this drive I didn't sleep one night no so the next day I was going to the doctor and they started looking at me and then this what they they checked me out and said hey ekg's fine we don't see any problems but they wanted me to go to the hospital I had to go to the emergency room they wanted me to get checked out and the first thing they start doing is you know they to run everything and hook you up and I got to stay up all night spent 20 hours in the hospital running them running test and and drawing blood and giving you vitamins and and all you know going through all of that process and then they told me that hey the ne in the morning you're going to have a stress test and I thought I was going to die then they put me on that you know they lay on the machine and they done the echo cardiogram and the and the lady said you know from what she everything looked fine but anyway then they put you on how you hop on this treadmill and we go and then keep walking walking and they just keep speeding it up faster and faster and faster and faster and faster I think they wanted me to get my heart rate up to70 beats per minute and I got there and then as soon as then you got to jump off that thing get back on the table so they can scan your heart again but you know every hey praise the Lord I'm 48 years old I ain't got no heart problems everything come out perfect there was nothing there was nothing that they could find anywhere in in my in my whole body that was wrong for is my heart and praise the Lord but the only thing they found out when they first started drawing blood they said your A1C is elevated which is your blood sugar and so they they you know they started checking that and uh but it was it's so amazing that I didn't I didn't realize that at the time but you know um elevated A1C causes cardiac arhythmia and I didn't know that you know you learn things all the time but you know it I I said all that to say this you know I thought I was fine and I could have just played off my symptoms and I could have just went on about it and I thought I was okay but let me tell you something I I I testified today and and I've told other people people I thought I was okay but I didn't know how bad I felt until I started eating right which they got me on medicine and they and everybody asked me I said no the doctors have said that I'm diabetic I ain't never said I was diabetic now that's what they put on me and that's and that's that's their old that's their test that's not my test but you know cuz I got two I got first first you know second Peter 2:24 and 1 Peter 2:24 he said by his strikes we were healed so you know that's what Dr Jesus said so so uh he trumps any other doctor from any other medical school in the world but um but you know I you know I do what I told like pop always said just do what they tell you to do so they they want me to take medicine I take medicine but you know I just started watching what I ate now sometimes it's hard sometimes it's not too hard because you know what I see a greater goal I see I see something better and like hey you know what it's like you're going to have to cut out carbs and it's like well that's okay because I used to drink a Coke every day or a Sundrop actually was Dr Peppers most of the time but you know I you know I go days and days and days without drinking any soda at all I don't drink any soft drinks at all days and I drink one every now and then but you know I you know because after a while you get to the point where you don't need it right and there's no taste for it and so I don't have I don't desire it now every now and then but you know that's like me you know I don't I got I got two laders at the house but you know I don't have to drink all two liters at once right I drink me like eight ounces and I'm good and I and honestly I and I just just the way that I am I just don't like diet drinks I you know because I know some people and I drink one every now and then I get one down but you know what I would just much rather drink water because you know and and this this is another thing that we have a problem with and and and in the natural and the spiritual is that you know the way we're going to fix a problem is we're going to artificially synthesize something we're going to make something artificial to replace something that God put in the ground and then we're going to make this stuff and then we're going to give it to you and then we're going because well guess what you can drink Coke and we're going to say well it's got no calories in it it's diet it's these but you know what people don't realize that you know I was reading I was reading an article and they said you know one of the worst things that you can do if you get on a diet is drink diet drinks and you know why because people get out there and they want to try to speed up their metabolism to burn calories and you know what when you drink a diet drink it slows your metabolism down and so you know the best thing for me is hey just don't drink them at all cuz you know what then you know what because there's nothing cuz you know what you can't find carbonated water like that in in the ground like like a man who said one time he said if you you know if you find natural things and talking about sugars and and and sweet things like that and he's like you know the best thing you can e is honey get you some honey put it in your coffee put it in your in your oatmeal or whatever that's what that's the why because that comes from nature right and God what God made you can't you can't replicate it and and to be the best as as it was then and all the things that God made are is perfect just like the word of God it's perfect and so if you want something all you got to do is get what God made right you know I I I was reading a reading an article and they were talking about the um the Romans and they said you know the the the Romans when they when they find these these mummies and and they start looking at the these uh bodies from from hundreds of years ago they talking about how how well preserved their teeth are and he said do you know the reason why because their bodies because their diets were so low in sugar it didn't destroy their teeth yeah but you know we got people that that just that consume so much of that and it just tears their body down right and so as it as it begins to tear you down then you then well hey you know what that's all right we've got cosmetic dentistry to fix that problem when the the problem is is you know if you didn't have it in the first place it wouldn't be a problem but see this is this is from the message God being misunderstood and brother Brown says and he's speaking of of the gifts of being in the body and he says maybe maybe I can help you clim the ladder just a little bit higher and get a little closer to God with it and set it more in order in the church he said I've been watching all along it seems wonderful to me and I just love to see it move on and on and on and on and on and as we're coming up he said don't let Satan creep in now he said boy he's smart don't out with him don't try to because you can't you just depend on God and just keep walking humbly God will do it and you'll find out that God will use you more and more and more like that the Lord bless you see when when God gives us something then we use it we yield to it but don't try to as he said you know try to outwit him and as he was speaking you know Satan he's going to try to creep in so these little things that that come your way you know because it's the little foxes that spoil the vine so when the things take place then we need to watch even be more uh open to understanding what's going to what's taking place and keep our eye be more Vigilant on what's going on around us so when you when you see these things and so tonight and and our opening our eyes and and understanding hey the devil's going to come against you no doubt amen because you know what if the Lord has a blessing for you and you say hey I'm expecting a blessing then you know what the devil's going to stop youen right so and this is this is from the message Father the hour has come and brother R speaking and and he's speaking of Jehoshaphat and and Ahab coming together and you know you know joining forces to to fight the Kings and and everything but you know when Ahab wanted wanted Jehoshaphat to come you know Ahab had had his All His prophets and every one of them spoke the same thing oh the Lord's with you the Lord's going it's going to be a great battle and all this kind of stuff but you know what every single one of them no doubt got up and rehearsed everything they were supposed to say so it was just a bunch of cookie cutter words and each one of them got up and said the same thing right and they said to on and on on and you know what there was just something about all that that rung Hollow to to Jehoshaphat something didn't sound right to Jehoshaphat and all of that why because everything that they said was just wrong and that's what he said he said is there is there not another one that in this land is there not another Prophet which you know that just really set Ahab back he's like yeah we got another one but I hate him he ain't never said nothing good about me jehoshaphat's you know he's like hey that's the one I want to hear that's the man I want to hear well let's see let's see what he's got to say and he said so he says brother BR says in other words he went back to the old Landmark so he's speaking about him going back and looking and searching out for the the word of the Lord he said he said Jehoshaphat had purposed in his heart to serve the Lord and to cling to things that his father David did at the beginning he said at the beginning he said in other words he went back to the old landmark and then they cleaned out the rose he said it would be good for Pentecost to go back to the old Landmark it would be good for all of us to go back to the old landmarks and clean out the rose what would happen today I'm talking I suppose mostly to Pentecostal people here in this afternoon he said what would happen if actually the church went back to the old Landmark you talk about a cleaning up there'd really be one around a Pentecostal Church it sure would now how many knows that's the truth why sure it is that certainly would be a certainly a Reformation going on oh how people would be acting different dressing different talking different if we get all just together different church just being altogether different church if we went back to the old Landmark where we started from and then he drops down and he skips talking about the landmarks and by passing our our Theology and he said and that's what the churches need today he said as a Garrison of the old time Apostolic teaching so this lukewarm formal and up and up in and out up and down doesn't get in our church why' I say that's right though that's right we have permitted too many things to creep in Brethren too many things that we have left the old Landmark from from the beginning to creep in he said we never garrisoned the church and now we got everything in it that's right all isms and hism and everything else in the church because we never garrisoned by the word and so I I want to share this with the young people because when I when I saw this you know it struck me because there's so many young people and I'm not just speaking to our young people here but I'm talking about the young people around this message in general I've seen so many of them they've go to camp and the Lord do something for them but they've allowed the devil to steal their Victory why because you did not Garrison Yourself by the word because if the Lord planted something in you then you Garrison yourself behind the word and you stay fortified behind it and then you stand up and then where whether if you did fall back and whether you know whether you did commit something and and everything like that you know what he's faithful and just if we commit if if we go and confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us and cling us from all unrighteousness the problem is is we will allow the things that have happened in the past to hold us back and we won't go any further but you know the thing is is if we if you fall and you fail then guess what God is there to pick you up and dust you off they put you back on the narrow way then guess what get fortified behind the word and then let me tell you something brother sisters if you've got a problem if you've got a failure if you've got a need then that's what the body is for not for you to tote all your problems by yourself not all your burdens by yourself but you know what we work as a body we work as a team and so we work together that's why I pray for you you pray for me why because we we can't be an island all by ourselves and so we've got to carry these things and so so if if God's done something for you in the past and you've gotten a little bit cold or whatever clean out those roads like he said go back to that Foundation go back to that Landmark the place that God LED you from if you know that what God has done for you in the past then guess what that's where you go back to you pick up from that standpoint and you continue on don't worry about what what because we're going to have to put all the things behind us and walk and press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus we're not going to have to worry about all these other things all the peripheral things need to be put aside why because if you if if you you have confidence in in in in me or or brother Wade or brother Dale if you've Got Confidence since if you had if you had belief in me that that I would do whatever I could for you I was thinking about Mercy where' Mercy at oh Mercy's in the back but you know uh I done that down at brother ismail's Church there a little little boy on the front row and I had some money in my pocket and I was like you know this little little brother up here I said he don't know me from anybody he's never seen me I had to get the brother tell me what his name was I can't even remember Elijah or something Jeremiah or something but anyway uh I asked him I said do you I mean would you come up here I mean would do you trust me to come up here do you have confidence you a never seen me before you don't know nothing about me but do you believe that if I told you something you'd believe me I told Mercy that time you know and she come up she come up to the front and it's like you don't like being up here and she's like nope but you know the thing is I wanted Mercy to see something but I wanted everybody to see that I preached a message being Fearless in the world of fear why because the whole world's full of phobias brother BR said the psychiatrist are doctor the psychiatrist that's right but you know the one thing I wanted her to say I was like if you could see now she was looking back at the congregation but I told Mercy I said if you could see that you're looking at and you're nervous and you're scared because you're like but I said if you could see the love that they have for you you would not be in that situation you wouldn't feel that way if you could see the because know the love that everybody in this congregation has for you and that's that's the say have the same have that same mindset and you know I told her I said you know do you believe she come up here and she didn't want to but she did but you know I asked Mercy I said do you believe that that if I had something that I told you I'd give it to you I would give it to you and she said yes that's right and I had money in my pocket and and mercy believed me and you know what then because she believed me and she took me at my word a mortal man but you know what she got that money that I had and that's what I was telling that little boy you know that little brother on the front row I said come up here I don't know 10 11 12 whatever he was you know but he come up there and you know and I asked him I said listen I said you you don't know me from but do you believe me that if I had money and I give would give it to you that you would take me out my word you don't know anything about me and he said yeah I would believe you I said some people probably wouldn't wouldn't trust me but he did and I said how much more would your heavenly father when he's made all of these promises to you how much more is he trying to get you to believe what he's told you if you would walk all the way down here for a $20 bill how much more would you walk from the back down here for eternal life how much more would you walk from the back down here to meet God for healing how much more would you walk down here for God to for deliverance but you know what if you will come down here to get a $20 bill how much more would you come if God spoke to you and wanted to give you the very best if he wanted to give you the greatest desire in your heart whatever you desire he said when you desire When you pray he said if you would hunger and thirst after righteousness he said if you seek ye first the kingdom of God he said all of these things will be added unto you if you could just go that far if you could just raise your hand in the seat that you're sitting in and claim and say this God I claim what's mine what you've promis me I don't have to go anywhere but I can claim it why because you promised it why because brother brandham said he said if he spoke it then he said he said all of Heaven is behind it then he would bankrupt heaven to fulfill his promise and that's what he's given to you and it's the same simple Faith the same childlike faith is all is how you operate it right if we just trust God and believe it and take him at his word you know that's the greatest thing I was thinking about you know brother brother Wade was talking about you know brother Dale was preached all these years and labored in the word and and and done so much and and that had the vision to put the word out to the world and it's went around the world and and you know only only eternity will tell us what what kind of uh impact this has Happ around the world but you know every now you catch people in and and just like brother uh Keith Reed was talking about brothers in Africa who' studied this message and listened to brother Dale and got the tapes have been listening and really uh laboring in the word because of the word that that has come from this church and it's not you know and and it's not just brother just brother Dale you know it's one of the things that really struck me when I preached in in Ohio when I was talking about being led by the spirit you know because there was there was a there was a thirst in somebody there was a hunger in somebody that they desired to find something more than what they already had and they began to search for it and you know and you know there it was in the scripture when he when he when brother R talking about Apollos being a Baptist preacher but you know God sent somebody to show him a more perfect way the word was there but it come to be a more perfect way that aquill and Priscilla come to bring him the word and it's like you know we didn't have we didn't have a Baptist preacher in our day but we had a Baptist Sunday school teacher he was a Baptist Deacon that's right but you know what there was somebody that crossed his path to show him a more perfect way and we've all been beneficiaries of that but you know what he said Paul said Paul said I planted Apollo watered he said but God gave the increase and you know I stand here today to tell you you know what brother brandham came and and planted the word but you know what pop brother Dale's the one Pop's been the one that has stood behind this pulpit and continued to water that word and let me tell you what God has brought the increase and let me tell you something we've seen the Fulfillment of the word in our day we look back and say oh what what took place back then it's a greater it's a greater thing to see what takes place in your own day what takes place in your own church what takes place in your own life why because you can argue things what was took place that was planted in the Bible what took place in history and all those other things but let me tell you something they can't take away what's planted inside of you what God has planted inside of you and has quickened to life you know what you can you can argue about a lot of things but you know what you can't take away my experience you can't take away my revelation you can't take it away why because you didn't give it to me you can't take it away the devil didn't give it to me and the devil can't take it away why because it's planted why because it's an eternal seed of God that's come to life and then guess what that all the devils in hell can't take it away you're not going to be able to pluck it up why because God has planted it and it's going to come to fruition amen amen see I want want y'all to understand why because every per if if we could just see I'm speaking to young people if you could understand the desire that that the people the brothers and sisters in this church have for y'all you know I I I think about the ones that you know that you know they they got to take their long their own Road theyve out doing whatever well you know what hey take you take your road go out you know people people have asked me before and they and they talk about things that have taken place and and things that have happened and I was like you know that in the scripture when the prodigal son come to his father you know his father didn't tie him up and stick him in the closet he didn't hog time you know what he said I want what's doe me and you know what he gave it to him and people's like wow that's amazing well you know what brother Brandon told Rebecca when Rebecca was standing there and she was out visiting her friend out playing Boogie wogie on the piano you know brother brother George Smith said that when when brother Brandon went next door to that girl's house and she was playing playing rock and roll on the piano you know brother ROM didn't bust in the door and and grab her by the hair of the head and jerk her out the door and say what are you doing they said you know brother Bram didn't even say nothing to her said rebecc it's time to go home and he walked her out the door and they went home he didn't say nothing to her about it at that time but you know there was come a time when he began to speak to her about what she was doing and he said Rebecca there's the door if you want to go out you can but he said you're going to step over my prayers and your mother's prayers when you go out that door right and you can and you can you can try to hog time and just like brother R talking about that Turtle he said you know you can try to beat it out of them or beat it in them he said it don't do anything right he said you can try to drown them he said it don't do any good but he said the one thing caus that Turtle to move and he said it took the fire and let me tell you something you you can try to beat it in them out out of them do whatever else but let me tell you what it takes the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the only one that's going to get them to move and if it if it's not the Holy G and that's the reason sometimes you know we try to do things in our own selves and you know I I I I tell people sometimes I'm the son of Dale Roberts and you know what there's Dale Roberts in me and Dale Roberts raises up sometimes you know I still see my dad I sometimes I speak and I hear my dad I was like wow there's daddy why because that's who I am but you know sometimes just like you know I I really appreciate my dad for one thing you know my my my dad may not been the greatest man and he was may not been the smartest man or like that but you know there's one thing that I can think about my dad that I that I wish I could be more like you know my Dad could come to me and apologize for being wrong you know some people they could they couldn't do that for no amount of money in the world but you know my Dad could do that when you're wrong you're wrong and to be able to admit that I and I you know that I really appreciate my dad for that CU you know that's that's hard for people but you know I would much I'd much rather do that than try to hold on something or try to hold something back just go ahead and hey I'm wrong and I can admit that and I just want I just want to get that clear and you know what other people appreciate it too that's right when you're able to take it and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that or said whatever and you know you realize that you know there's other people watching you also that's right amen so you know you don't just live you know preach an example you got to live an example you've got you've got to show people you know brother Ram said you know you can preach a sermon he said but live me a sermon he said it was more better it was greater to live us to live the sermon so I want to try to skip some of this but you know when when you see these things when you talk start talking about um are the diet and and the things that you feed on and and the the things that that consume you and everything and you brother Brown was talking about one of the one of the things he was preaching in message in in spiritual Amnesia and he was talking about one of the things that you see is what causes people to have amnesia he said is the things that they feed on and he said you feed on these things and he said you don't realize who you are because of a poor diet and he said that's what caused it and he said they began to eat on things that were wrong and he said it creates an Aller allg y he said people had an allergy of a seminary diet would give you spiritual Amnesia because people that don't eat right and it's caused them and so feed on the word this is from the message what think you of Christ brother says he said he said but I I got to tell you he said it's just so real he said you see I have a food that I eat that the world knows nothing about and your spirit coming to me in faith believing what I'm telling you is the truth is the food that I live on that's my eternal life if I don't feed this natural man it'll die and if I don't feed this spiritual man it'll die he said now our brother scientist sitting here know would know that anything that doesn't eat very much and just keeps going and dieting and dieting your stomach shrinks but then if you become eating a whole lot your stomach you require more he said I sure am a glutton on this I tell you I really require a whole lot of of it because my capacity just has no limits I often said if I could just get a little bigger maybe I could feel better and so you know that's the that's the way we ought to be is you know because many times when you eat the wrong thing when you're not eating enough then you know what then you you get weak and he said you you begin to strink but you know what God has more for you to eat continue to eat and feed on the word amen this is from the message from the spiritual food in due season he said but thanks be to God we got hidden food spiritual food that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days vindicating himself among his people amen they went in Elijah went in before the drought set in thank God for being in before the Judgment sets in now is a time of coming out and going in getting out of those organizations and getting into Christ are coming out and going in time for all True Believers then he was called and stayed there remember he never left that Brook until God called him and after the drought was O about over he called him out of there went to a Widow's house notice he called to this Widow and this Widow had not associated herself with unbelievers took the mark of the beast during the drought so he called her out called called Elijah to stain this Widow just they just had one little cake one little thing that was holding she was holding on to and Elijah said give that to me first for thus sayith the Lord that Barrel will not go empty neither will The Cruise draun dry until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the Earth God putting God first his word first now you know what always this is I've always loved this story and there's something about this the story about Elijah and that and the widow woman you know because in the in the time of drought when God when God told Elijah to tell him he said he said there won't be any rain till I call for it and because because of the sin and the problems in Israel and Judah they they were under the under the condemnation of God they were under the Judgment of God and Elijah God calls Elijah to go and sit by the Brook cheriff and he set beside the brook of the Cheri and the Ravens come and fed him and he drank by the Brook now the rest now the rest of the country is under judgment and they're all freaking out and they're all wondering what's going to take place because there's no rain they they can see everything becoming dwindling and going away but you know what God had called Elijah to this place to set beside this Brook and something Supernatural taking place now nobody else saw that but it was something that spoke to Elijah it was God dealing with Elijah ministering to Elijah now this whole time that God is dealing with Elijah and ministering to him in the Brook chith at this place you know there was a little widow woman down there and every single day she kept noticing that everything was going away everything was drying up everything is going away and all of a sudden you know she's getting to the place where there's nothing and she can see that her son is just starting to to dwindle away and and then you know she could really see in her mind she really began to see death all around them they because she told Elijah you know listen we're just going to eat this little bit and then we're going to die and this whole time here's Elijah up there and he's in this place and he's being ministered to and he's getting and he's getting this food this Supernatural message is coming to him and he's eating and he's feasting on this all by himself he's separated away and here he is he's eating and he's enjoying himself and then when he walks out and when this Brook dries up and one of the things people people ask me you know why things happen the way that they do and and and when I ain't got no explanation for it and I tell people I say well sometimes when you don't understand why things are going on and it's and and you think well I you know because so much is going on but it's like God has you in a certain place and you're like well I don't understand what's going on it's like well maybe God's got you at the brook cherith maybe this is the brook cherith for you and the God's speaking to you maybe God's speaking to you maybe the Lord's dealing with you and then like well you know what you just stay right there because if that's what God God's got you doing that then you stay right there because when the water dries up God will have you a place to go that's right and so you know there's times that you know I just tell people hey I'm at the brook Sheriff sometimes you don't understand why you're why you're in the situations you are but you know what it it it may look bad around you but it's like well I a I'm not doing too bad yeah but you know here here's Elijah being a minister to and all this is going on but this woman she's in this she's in this place where she's about to die she doesn't see anything that's that's any good around her her situation keeps is getting worse and worse and worse but you know what then when the when the brook dried up then Elijah come and the Lord had sent her to the to her and knew exactly where she was at and he waited till she got to that place for Elijah to come to speak to her and speak into her situation and like well why don't you just give me a little bit first and out of out of your need out of your lack out of your want give me just a little bit because you know I've got a word for you and one of the things one of the things about this this story that always always just it it Thrills me it stir me up because lots of times I've seen people come and it's like well I don't know why I'm here and you know all these all these situations happen in life and everything like that and I was like you know what sometimes we don't realize because brother R said if you had a a question or or a need he said he said he would be you had something that you're dealing with he said he's obligated to put a man behind the pull pit to answer your question and so you know I like you know that's the way this way the ministry is sometimes sometimes the problem is is you know what we're just by the Brook cherith and you know what God's dealing with us because we he's feeding us he's giving us we're we're so you know sometimes like like brother W talking about you know sometimes you know we don't get to do things and we don't go places why because we're studying you know because we've got other things that we have to do because we're before God and we're trying to get the mind of God and you know and here he was you know so that's the same way you come to church and say well I'm I'm looking for this or I I need something and I you know what but you know what sometimes we don't come to church and realize that the preacher the pasture has been has been in the presence of God and you know what sometimes there's a supernatural happening taking place but the problem is is you're looking about your situation all around you and you see everything and not realizing that the supernatural has taken place because if if if the Lord give us these words to speak then you know what it's not my what's not my mind it's not my words but it's his words well then if he's the one that come to speak this then you have that need well then you come well then guess what he come to speak life into your situation he come to speak blessing into your situation but the problem is is we're still looking at the our surroundings and not realizing God has come the word has come to speak to you amen and maybe maybe tonight you you get ready to go to Camp maybe tonight you're looking at things and but just realize God is here to speak to you he's speaking to you tonight that he's wanting you to understand that I'm here and he's speaking to you to give you an answer and you and you go to camp and you know those Brothers brother John brother Josh you know no doubt no doubt they've been seeking the mind of God to find out what he has because it's going to speak to your life he's going to speak something into you and it's not just well we're just coming to hear a good sermon no he's going to speak to you personally amen how many times have you went to church and the Lord just speak something I went many many years ago I preached at brother preached for brother Lee Garland years ago on on a Thursday night and just decided to go didn't didn't have any you know just just something was laid on my heart like well I'm going just follow the leading of the Lord just went I had a little thought like well brother Lee calls on me to preach I'll preach if not I'll just go and fellowship and I got there brother Lee asked me to preach and so I just got up and I just preached on a little thought that I had and after church there was a brother come up to me and he said brother he said the next time you're at the house he said come knock on the door and I was like what he said what you preached on tonight he said answered the questions we're sitting at the house at the table talking he said what you preached on is exactly what we talking about today am he said how'd you know that I said because that was God and he said you answered my question and just just following that little nudge amen just take that little thought that's right you know maybe that won't happen one time in your life but you know what i' speaks volumes amen so it it may not be a whole lot that's all right you know you you may not be well known but you know what I just want to be found faithful to speak what God has for us am now so I just want to share a few other things and then we'll then we'll we'll get ready to close but you know speaking here brother BR speaking he tells the vision and this this is from the message Christ the mystery and he you know he's began talk in 1962 when they had the tax case and everything was going on you know he began to look about going overseas and going different places and he was there with brother uh I think brother Banks brother sophan them and and you know he was going and he saw that little white boat and and all that and he was like I'm not going because it just wasn't right but he said the angel of the Lord began to speak to him he said store up the food he said store up the food and he said you know he said I had the vision he said I was carrying all those great big vegetables in Rolling them in the church and know storing them up and he said I kept storing them and then you know then he was he was praying there and and the message Christ the mystery and he said Lord he said I've been Faith you know Faithfully doing this when you give me the vision to store up the food and and there he was storing up the food and I I want you to understand something because you know if if if you have a desire if you have an appetite for the word let me tell you something the word's been stored up it's been it's been stored up and so this is what God's done for you it's not for anybody else this is personally to you God stored up this food for you right and so when when we look at you know all 1100 sermons all all were from us and it's a personal it's a personal thing to you it's it's mine God sent God sent Elijah the prophet to me he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet I told I told him when I was down brother ismael's church I told him I said that's personal to me I don't know about the rest of you but I know Elijah come to me he was sent for me I don't know about the rest of you that's what and that's what I was telling them in in India I was tell you know it was Elijah the prophet for my that's me Malachi 4 was mine that was that was personal to me I don't know about the rest of you but this is from the message speak to the mountain brother BR says the word of God Is So infallible he said that not one jot or tit can ever fail and just on that much scripture we could base an eternity knowing that it would never fail and because it is part of God God is in his word and he said now we are now notice that how it that it always happens no matter how strange it may seem but in God's Own good time he makes every word testify Jesus said when he was here on Earth the scriptures cannot bro be broken he said you destroy the body he said I'll raise it up in three days because it was based on scripture and then drop down and and so he begins to speak about David the prophet and because Jesus understood that what David had said in the scripture was what he was standing on and he said you he said you say if I knew there was a scripture that pertained to me like that I believe I could have the same Faith well my beloved friends every Divine promise in the Bible belongs to you and it's just as essential to you as it was to him you find One Promise here that God has made and all the heavens and earth will pass away before that promise would ever fail to act in your stad because it's to the believer whosoever may come and be partakers of these blessings he said and and so he said we miss the blessings he said Faith come he said and the reason we miss it is because we don't feed on it enough Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God man shall have his Daily Bread by the word of God but we try to make it more and Le more or less off some far off promise way away in some other age but the Bible says now we are the sons of God not we will be but we are now now listen this he said and God has not made it complicated and many people try try to think it's that way that it's complicated therefore they miss the real blessing of the word by trying to make it some hard thing and my purpose in these next 10 or 15 minutes is to reveal to you the best that I that I can by his blessed word that God is not complicated in any way the believer makes it complicated God makes it simple so when you when you say that I I wanted to read that because I what because I I want you to see that it pertains to you you said oh if like you said oh if I could just find this one part that belongs to me all of it pertains to you amen and you may and he said it's so simple God's made it so simple but we make make it complicated brother and this is from the from the from the message the power of decision and brother BR speaking of the Mana and he said and he said they went and got some of this Mana he said you know David must have tasted a little that did you ever taste any of this sweet Mana he said I've seen people get so much of it till they just lick their lips I have just a real gastronomical Jubilee spiritual spiritually speaking oh my it feels you out do you know when you get real weak and eat a great big Square meal how you feel and he says you know a little fellow went to the doctor he says Doctor I'm sick I'm weak he said what's the matter he said you know B going to ask him a little him a little physical things he said yes well that's all right he said when did you eat last I ate a half a cracker before yet day before yesterday he said brother you're just hungry and he said he said that's what's WR wrong with the church what's the matter with the church today it's anemia because they're not getting enough spiritual food if they got the Bible brother it would just put the blood of Christ in the veins of the believer new life life comes from the blood amen the anemia condition of the church pitiful pale cheek my my we need a transfusion to start us off and they began to speak about David and he's talk about David said my cup runneth over and he says you know was a sheep herder and he used to carry a little script bag along with him there at his side and he had he packed some honey and the and the Sheep would get sick and it put the honey on the Rock because they wanted the Sheep not so much to lick the honey but it likes things sweet so they wanted to get the lime off the rock because the lime had a healing element in it so they'd pour the honey on the Rock and the sick sick sheep would go to licking that honey and licking the honey why they got the rock and it always cures the sick sheep well brother we got a whole script bag full of it here tonight of Honey amen and we put it on Christ Jesus not some denomination we put it on Christ Jesus where it belongs and you you six sheep go to licking right here right quick Now find out if you don't get well it tastes like Honey in the Rock Amen you open up your heart and get to rejoicing before God you'll get a little Limestone once in a while a little Stone of what off the Rock of Ages hallelujah oh how I love it you say Rock of Ages yes sir will I walk brother them like them people yes sir walk in the light he will pack you around you know God said the Bible he packed them away on Eagle wings the Bible said well then Israel must have been setting on Eagles Wings Crossing no wonder they didn't walk in any mud did you ever get on eagles wings and walk why because God made a promise to them so they you know what they didn't have to walk in mud because they were walking on what God provided for them and so God had made a way and you know what it's the same thing with you and I he's made a way for us that if if we get to walking on it then God has a way for us to go and this is from from the message fellowship and he begins talking about he said and while we're walk talking this afternoon May the holy spirit of God take the word of God and feed every hung hungry soul in here eating accompanies fellowship and man shall not live by bread alone sayith the Lord but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the Holy Spirit then likes to eat and fellowship with the believer what a time we're all gathered around a great table now where the good things of God is just piled up high God's got in his bounties of blessings everything that we have need of all the
