ministering wednesday so remember those two you'll be gone next weekend all right we'll see on that okay all right i want to take up where we were that last weekend because i want to make sure that you follow me in what i'm trying to teach on this thought and we had just like questions and answer part of it but i want us to make sure we understand and get everything in the right order because i don't want us to misunderstand and say well i don't i just didn't believe that i didn't didn't understand that well the best thing to do is just for just to take a thought about it and we'll try to consider it okay all right revelations 20 verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and compassed the camp with the saints about and the beloved city and the fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open books plural now and another book was opened which is the book of life and the deeds and the dead were judged of those things which were written in the books according to their works all right now keep in mind what we're covering and we'll get to thought in a minute now and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works now judged watch now and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whoso ever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire all right let's go to romans now because what we're going to do is try to pick up our thought from last week so we'll get it romans 14. let's start with verse 10. but why does thou why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at naught thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ all right you believe that for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block of our on our an occasion to fall in his brother's way you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we had a question about this last week and i just want to make sure now the main point i want to make sure that that you understand uh what is being said and that way we can follow it through it and it won't be any trouble with with something come up say well what is this and what is that now we've read here in revelations 20 that there is a great white throne a judgment seat all right and there'll be people there the thousands of thousands are sitting there and all all right it's a judgment seat white throne judgment okay then we read in romans 14 that we were all going to sit before the judgment seat of christ or stand before it all right now let's get that straight because see if we don't we've got a vast confusion in our minds because it's talking about a white throne it's there in the scripture you know revelation a great white throne is placed in order of showing that it has to be after the uh millennium it has to be after the thing and you know we read that and we'll give brother random in a minute to to show why so then you'll understand more about it but now to think about it a great white throne judgment then we read that paul is talking about a judgment a judgment seat of christ all right now are we going to stand before the white throne judgment are we going to stand before the judgment seat of christ it's it's hard to comprehend the two different thoughts because one of them is a great white throne judgment and it's picked up as we'll get back to it in a minute but it's picked up to be the same judgment that is in daniel 7 9 through 10 there daniel is speaking of the white throne judgment all right revelation is speaking of the whites on judgment that people will be standing before the judgments all right now but at the same time we have paul speaking in romans of a judgment seat of christ that we'll all have to set before or stand before and that's picked up in second corinthians 5 there's another account to where paul is covering the judgment seat of christ all right so now let's get that straight because that was the question that was asked and i don't want you to be confused about uh what is it uh you know i want you to have an understand if you don't then ask me a question about it and we'll try to speak some more about it or clear it up but i want you to be clear uh does the bride of jesus christ stand before the white throne judgment no no amen all right thank you lord the bride of christ does not stand before the white throne judgment amen all right so then what daniel was speaking of and what john was speaking of in revelation of a white throne judgment or a judgment seat it cannot be applied to the bride of jesus christ to be sitting and to watch on judgment because if it would be then that would put us in a pitiful situation the white throne judgment is a judgment not only of the deeds in the body you know the things we do but it's a judgment of whether or not that you can go into eternal life are you following me the white throne judgment is a judgment of a decision to find out whether or not you can enter into eternal life all right so then we see that that cannot be the bride of jesus christ because she has she does not stand before the judgment seat she sits on the judgment seat all right we understand that she sits on the judgment seat with him judging the people all right so it's not the fact that we have the separation of it and fully in control of the scriptures even though it looks like you well you've got this one there's a judgment seat you've got this one as a judgment seat but get to get it to correct into which is what and what's going on all right at the great white throne judgment which is placed after the millennium after thing and winding up you know in the finishing of all things all right now the bride of jesus christ does not stand before that white throne she sits on that throne with him judging the people all right amen amen are you following me is that clear now you understand what i'm saying that i want that point drove in to work that you'll understand the bride does not stand before the whites on judgment why because she's born again she receives eternal life here the white throne judgment will will be a judgment seat of a decision whether or not to go into eternal life right amen now in doing that then the white throne will will not be to the bride it'll be to those that she's sitting there to judge all right now do we understand that is that clear we don't we don't stand before the white throne judgment we'll give you these in a minute from the prophet we don't go before the whites on judgment because why would you go before the white throne judgment if you're a born-again christian like brother branham says a good illustration he said you're going to put your wife through a test you remember that you know said you're going to put your wife through a test to decide whether or not you know she's worthy but why are you going to wait and do that i thought you picked her for your wife to to be your helpmate so then it goes to show that that white throne judgment is not a decision or the bride of christ will not be sitting there she'll be sitting with him on that judgment judging others all right now that fulfills the scriptures then all right but i want to make sure you understand that and don't have no no parts in your mind to say but why would we sit before the judgment seat of christ i've confessed all of my sins here why would there be a judgment seat of christ and what is that judgment seat but get it clear now where there won't be any problem the bride does not go before the whites on judgment because that is owned after that she's done lived a thousand years in the millennial rhyme she's done went through that part of it she went through the the parts of going up in a rapture and being with god and it's already determined that she's has eternal life that's right well why would she be judged what is there to be judged about a born-again believer right it cannot be a decision of eternal life because that's what you receive we receive jesus christ as our savior giving us eternal life and that way we don't have to worry about standing before the white throne judgment let alone to think about that there's people sitting on that judgment seat with him that will be judging those that are outside of that that's right and to know that that bride of christ that wife will sit with him in judgment because it said about the 17th or in our 18th chapter where it said and his wife hath made herself ready well that's that's a way back you've already get it have gotten eternal life by the new birth and if you die it doesn't make no difference you go by the grave and you'll come up in the resurrection and you don't have to worry about the judgment all right but if you're alive then you remain you know and you can go up in a rapture you don't have to be concerned about but but i want to make sure you get that now i mean you know don't come up later and say well brother dale uh do you think that right now the bride is not going to go before and you know how to stand before the white zone judgment what for that's a decision of eternal life all right you say but then what about this other part that you've read what about standing before the judgment seat of christ see then let's make sure to get it right now and so we we we won't place this one over here and this one over here see then there is two judgments one of them is called the bema judgment i don't know what the other one is but anyhow it doesn't matter to me because i just know what the big greek word ain't gonna spell nothing it's a revelation from god to realize that we do not have to go before the white room what a wonderful opportunity amen what about a new birth and what it it does for you and i mean it gives us eternal life right here now we don't have to wait and go somewhere to be judged to finally decide whether we can go to heaven or not amen because the born-again experience new birth gives you eternal life now and see you become the christ the same as he's the christ all right and sit with him amen you've become the anointed he's anointed we've anointed him we're the bride of christ what a wonderful opportunity to be able to think about eternal life and the fact of that eternal life being to you and i that we don't have to go before any judgment to receive it it's already set here when you accept jesus christ all right i keep saying that i want you to hear that because i don't want no question to that point i don't mean i don't you know i'm glad i always try to answer a question but i'm just saying if we get it right then we won't be thinking about it but get what goes with what all right there is according to the bible the book of revelations in the book of daniel a great white throne judgment all right that is according to the bible and that is sitting there to be determined whether or not and it's got books books plural right you've gotten books at each one of those the you know revelations and daniel books plural why because there's deeds there that's done in the body and those books will show what we are all right but then there's a book there that is called the book of life right i mean that's a great white throne judgment now there will be a book of life and if your name is in that book then you have an opportunity to receive eternal life at that judgment but if your name's not in the book amen then there is no chance of judgment for you it's all finished it's done you don't have no court of appeal it won't be that we could go before the great white throne and say yeah but lord look what i've done look what i've done look what happened here look how i've done this i've done that if you're to watch on judgment there's no mercy it is turned from um the fact of you being totally lost and god then can take your place so don't think i don't know the message don't think i don't know that i can you know i can read i i know where brother branham said it probably about 35 or 40 times of that man that uh stands out there you know and and and jesus has to come and stand in his place and he took my place and but that's not the white throne that's the reason i want you to see it and dwell on it heavily to where you can see it paul what was his name paul ryan or anyhow it was it was the guy you know about the riding the log and going into camp and things but just remember that's not though that's not the white throne right because you don't go to the white throne as bride of christ [Music] you can't do that you can't put the bride at the white throne we see you say well we've got all of these quotes here about it that this one man well that's good but be careful how you're placing that because it does say that jesus comes up and stands there somebody took my place well if somebody took my place then that meant i was a born-again believer right that's what he's doing taking my place all right but not just because if you can read that and see that this story is told over and over by the prophet of a judgment seat and having to be standing there and you have a court of appeal that you can appeal to the white throne but remember it's not a court of appeal to the white throne what are you going to appeal to who are you going to appeal to so then it's not the prophet explaining it to where he's doing that was he's explaining the other one i want you to get that don't make make sure you keep it in your mind he's explaining the judgment seat of christ not to watch on because there's no record of the white throne to where he to where that he stands in place with somebody now i know the difference in the goats and the sheep and i know what i'm talking about in that all right so we can read that they will be at the white throne judgment goats and sheep but remember goats are sinners that are lost sheep at the white throne are not the bride that's your foolish virgin that can be given eternal life that's those that will receive eternal life at the white throne judgment because of their deeds done in the body all right so we're covering it each one each one each one each one all right now so do you understand what i'm saying at that white throne it will not be a a uh just a regular judgment it will be a judgment seat that we sit on that judgment seat with him judging others according to the bible where he says fear not you you know what are you thinking about it you're judging this you're judging it he said we judge angels the bible says we judge angels and why should we try to judge each other what right do we have to judge each other what thoughts are or things could come into our mind it would consider the fact of trying to judge each other are you trying to be something that you're thinking somebody done something against you and boy you're gonna get even with them at the white throne better be careful there's two two sides at that white drum one side is sitting out there and the other side is sitting up on the throne so you better be careful which one don't get on the wrong side you understand what i'm saying so let's don't start judging each other see we're not to judge each other the bible says don't take a brother to law well no no no no brother today we what we need to keep this clear with w what the bible said i didn't say it why does it say it that way because brothers should were sisters whatever just saying it always you should be able to work out your problems without having to go to court that's right now i'm i'm preaching so if you think i'm talking about you that's who i'm talking about okay now come on didn't get it straight let's don't play games he said well what we're going to do somebody owes us this out of the other well are you going to try to figure out whether that's a brother or not you know are you going to de-christianize everybody that goes against you are you going to put them at the white throne and you sitting in front of them that's not the christian attitude the christian attitude should be of the bride of christ to be able to stand there and say come on i can quote brother branham he said do you remember that helped you do this they have you know something something once and something went wrong you've done this you know but my point is this to try to get you to lay it down in our thoughts what is the judgment seat of christ what is the judgment seat of christ when we know it's not the white throne judgment that we know for sure right that's all we spend all this time trying to define that point and then we'll read some into what the prophet said to where it won't be what i've said but then what is the judgment seat of christ i had a brother here one time trying to preach on marriage and divorce and he said your marriage and divorce problem was gone by the new birth and i come right back to this pulpit and said that's wrong you don't you don't put your your your problems like that you know but i thought the new birth cleared me the new birth clears us make sure we don't go to hell it sets us free yes but just remember as we get down to the scripture some men's sins go before some follow after if they go before they're wiped away if they follow after what is left to follow after yeah but that's just where you don't believe in grace i believe in grace but not disgrace i don't believe it's all right for me to live like the devil but i'm a claim to everybody to be a christian but see that's why to me i have to be straight and blunt okay maybe you've had trouble maybe you've had problems that's for you to figure out and to do and to get straight and do yours but just make sure you don't have nothing left over because there is a judgment seat of christ and the prophet says it and the bible says that we'll all have to stand before the judgment seat of christ brother you just don't understand the new birth takes care of everything does it may i quote the prophet when the woman said but i was confessed that sin to god right what did the prophet say but you didn't sin against god in that adulterous act you sinned against your husband you've got to go to him first see we got it right we got to understand and we know where we're standing so don't play with it but you see we think we can do this and we can do that but brother dale my lord you've been so hateful lately you've just brought out every bit of the things and and just stomped our feet and and just you know well one of these days you'll pat me on the back and say thank you amen you'll do it you see i don't have to worry about it because the truth is the truth i have to say it like it is like the other day when i was preaching so hard about tithing i have to say it like it is you see everybody thinks that i say things because it helps me no no probably hinder me more than anything else because you know some people will get up and walk out eventually because they can't stand it see if you think that your new birth took care of your marital problems you're in trouble all sin is without the body except fornication which is of the body what does that mean that's what the bible says all right it means in simple plain language all sin can be forgiven but there's ways that are withholding for us to be able to get rid of those problems and that's why it's so serious if you sinned against your wife or sinned against your husband you've got to go to them first yeah but i went to god god won't listen to you now that's what your prophet said you see that way i'm trying to save your soul and like i was talking about even like tithing we've run around said that little girl or that person took some money and said god held it against him see we're serving a just god we're not serving to just play around haphazardly the little bitty things the little foxes is what's spoiling our vines right but you understand that you see what i'm talking about the bride does not go before the white throne judgment she sits on the white throne judgment judging others so things have got to be made right by then now i'm as serious as i can be about it i want somebody to show me i want to know whether this judgment seat of christ comes in that and where it takes place because i can't place it i know that it would have to be before the white throne maybe somebody can help me with it to understand it all right but i know it's got to be the judgment seat of christ has got to be before the white throne because there would be no way for you to sit at the white throne on the seat next to christ with sin in your life something that you didn't get right here so it'll have to be before the white throne i do know that much now i'm going to say this and i know i'm i ain't going to get through but i'm going to say this plane this right here is more valuable than you ever thought of is the stature of a perfect man that message is more valuable than you ever thought of in your life you ought to wire the book out or the tape because you see that's exactly what's taking place right now that's doing away with my sins that's doing away with what sins i've got yeah but a christian don't say christians is the only one that can sin come on i know the prophet i've got it laying right here before but one one quote he says directly sins christians do not sin you cannot sin as a christian then he turns around and says a christian is the only one that can sin now what are you going to do that's right well i you know i just don't i don't understand you say one thing then another i say what the prophet said i'm saying what the bible says there are two judgments in the bible one of them is the great white throne judgment the other one is a judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad at the judgment seat of christ right but i want to make sure my sins go before me amen right because if it go before me whether it be my marriage and divorce whether it be my line cheating stealing whatever it be if it goes before and it's done away by the blood of jesus christ then god is swipe to clean this yet slate clean and there won't be no great white throne judgment for you to set out that's why brother branham said it this way he said make sure let's see all right i'll get to it in a second he said make sure you don't mess up the rapture with the judgment seat because you see if you go in a rapture that's over a thousand years before the judgment seat of christ i mean before the the white throne judgment comes into being if you're going in the rapture all things will be made right or we're not going do you understand do you understand what i'm getting at if we don't get everything right here there will be a seat somewhere that we have to to stand there and be judged of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad they'll be rewards or are taking away of rewards you see that's why it's so hard for me to to drive it i've got to drive it down to where it can't be the the devil can come in and pick it apart but drive it so hard but yet not try to drive the center i'm not against anything you've done in your life or what you're doing that ain't to me that's between you and god but if i can do anything i can to try to help you to get you to the point i want to get rid of all of my sin yeah but i didn't know a christian could sin there's a difference in sin there is a sin that is under death you don't even pray for that one so there's a difference in the word sin so the prophet says in one place the bride cannot sin he didn't say she won't and then pro now he says she cannot but in another place he says she is the only one that can sin because a sinner is condemned on a higher level right so then we got to define sin sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around with him and adultery uh uh you know all kind of things that's not sin but what is sin unbelief there is no unbelief in the bride of jesus christ because she cannot disbelieve because christ in her cannot do it but when it turns the other way what does it do we all have problems in the flesh galatians 5 tells you the works of the flesh is adultery this that or the other names it all all kind of fun right envy strife galatians 5 but the works no works is no good but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace good news he puts them right there and the same chapter talks about the the fruit of the spirit being loved joy peace statue of a perfect man but the works of the flesh a christian has works of the flesh their fruits of the spirit covers the inward part of them and keeps them from being lost but it still doesn't cover all of the works well i'll tell you what i ask god every day to forgive me i do too but what about all them things you forgot about now don't tell me that don't let's don't play pretty badly you know a little bit with me i don't let's be straight you realize if you think something wrong today that can be placed under the category of sin have you asked god to forgive you for thinking wrong beside the point of doing wrong right yeah right you know what i mean you say well brother dale i don't do wrong you just did you lied that solves that problem see because we're human mortal beings that's why we must have an advocate according the scripture says which is jesus christ the righteous to stand in place for you and i well if we're so white slate clean what do we need an advocate well you making it like that the blood of jesus christ don't do about well everything it don't do away with unconfessed sin unconfessed unbelief unconfessed unbelief don't have to be answered for here or there one works of the flesh but fruits of the spirit the christians have fruits of the spirit love joy but we don't want to have work for the spirit did you get that one we better not have works of the spirit that's crossing it up and messing it up we can have works of the flesh we can do things wrong in the flesh but still not be lost in our spirit but somewhere that has to be accounted for well if i got something to be accounted for i thought the blood of jesus christ counted for everything i thought she was listening while ago when the prophet said don't mix up the rapture with the great white throne what's his meaning the rapture is on this side of the white throne there's not going to be any judgment of the bride at jesus right sitting at the white throne the sins the things that we we we don't count as sin but have you ever just really read that have you ever really read it i ain't going to get that way but i'll i'll get part of it let's go over to galatians if they want to get that way if they don't we'll we'll read it galatians 5. listen to what paul has to say about it um verse 13 we'll start from there for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh now he's stating it right but by love serve one another for all the law was fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself if thou bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another now watching for the flesh lusts us against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh huh now follow it and these are contrary to one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if we be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now watch now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these now follow these but don't get your mind in so dead set of a hard thing because take these and bring them down to our everyday life i mean we're not supposed to be talking about people that's doing dealing in adultery or witchcraft or bad hatred or heresies or but take and break these words down in simple language right now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery well i don't commit adultery you want to get it down low enough you want to get it down girls wear your clothes and things like that you call somebody to commit adultery with you that's right ladies oh but see that's where you're going but but i'm not i'm breaking words down to plain language adultery fornication oh i don't commit no fornication go look that up go run it through the scripture and see what fornication really is it's not going out in adulterous acts and things paul is talking to christians forgive me for being smart paul is speaking to christians not to sinners in galatians 5. so listen uncleanness just break that word all night all the way down lasciviousness which is simply just dispute envyings oh i don't have no envies murderer i'm not a murderer brother dale if you do you destroy somebody's name you've murdered them that's how simple the word can be down to you make fun make light you've murdered come on drunkenness i don't drink brother tail no i take a little nip every once in a while wouldn't it revealings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time times that they which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of god that's pretty serious [Music] but the fruit of the spirit see not works of the spirit fruit of the spirit love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness temperance against such there is no law and what's not and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust sometimes just take a few minutes and sit down and take the dictionary and look up and just read these look up what these things mean and see if there's any of them in our lives right now see if we have any works we all want fruits of the spirit right it's not works of the spirit it's works of the flesh all right now let's define what the prophet is saying a born-again christian cannot sin from the soul done right a born-again christian cannot sin from the soul so where does the rest of it start off at go back up and read the first sign where did we have it uh or brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion in the flesh but by love serve one another but if you bite into devour take heed that you be not consumed one of another see church our lives are very vital now let me put it on this end of the scale where you want lose me paul was talking there about eating or drinking basically eating things that was sacrificed to idols you remember that all right now he says if it offend my brother for me to eat meat he said i won't eat no more meat but yet he turned around and said he said now listen the idol is nothing and all these other things he said in other words the one person who eats he eats when faith and no problem the other one eats in doubt so what is it it's not wrong to eat something that was offered to an idol because we know the idol is nothing but who it is you don't want to offend your brother or sister that's standing by and then you say well bless god it don't bother me to eat these things anybody that eats that that that it thinks it's a bother to them they they need to be getting straight no you're the one that needs to be getting straight because no matter what it is the attitude's wrong come on right the simple attitude of the heart the words of the mouth is from the attitude of the heart brother dale you you talk like that that there's no grace grace is unmerited favor we agree but grace is not disgrace remember when you say well well what right that brother he ought to get saved he ought to get straightened out because bless god it don't bother me with him things but what kind of an attitude have you got you shouldn't be doing that that's why paul said it if it offend my brother for me to eat meat he also won't eat no more meat what do you have he had a christian attitude right a christian part of his life that he was concerned with others i thought we were to be living a christian was to be living for others i thought that was the point of christianity was to be living for others and see then that way you can understand how that we can have works of the flesh we have wrong thoughts i ain't going to wait a second want to go don't raise your hand don't raise your hand if for me to ask you said if you had a that bad thought today i'm not going to we don't need to go that way because we know we had because we just all of us just we just stick our hands up and say forget it because but you see that's what we're looking at most people are thinking christianity is giving you a right to do and and whatever you want to do and just whatever takes place it doesn't matter because you're a christian now where's that in the bible what kind of a attitude is that which one of those words would it fit under the works of the flesh fornications or adulteries or whatever i remember one time i was talking to brother molten brother george canada one day about something and we were talking i said well the bible said if you're not having to do with idolatry and they said that's right i said that that means idolatry it don't mean i doubt it means my eyes is dollar turned all over the place idolatry idol idol you ever noticed that the way it's spelled idolatry i-d-o-l that's idols that's images that's things you make that's idolatry or the idolatry either way these churches we should be so concerned about each other until our lives are based upon trying to not be a hindrance to anybody but to be a help to one another but yeah we want to as i said about our unit the other day we want to blame the other person somebody do something wrong to us we ought to go get that straight in a hurry because if you don't a few days later you're going to start thinking well you know i wasn't too bad give you about two weeks later you're gonna find out that that other guy or the other lady or sister or whatever you're going to find out that other person was the one that was guilty and you didn't have nothing to do with it use a sweet darling little old thing right we start blaming everybody else for our own problems where's that fit in the line of christianity do you understand what i'm saying then a judgment seat to give an account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad where's that taking place at it's got to be before the white throne we can go over that away but you know what i kind of believe it's right now you know i kind of believe that this is why god has given us this time that we should have been i've been out here a long time ago we should have been in a rapture 20 30 years ago i was proving that in 1974. we should have been getting out of here a long time ago but could it be that we won't get our we won't get straight could it be that our works of the flesh is overriding our christian life what about it let's just read these now though go ahead brother to number number one we'll just read down through on these all right because what number one is covered is the white throne judgment the book of daniel which is the same as revelations 20. now you understand me we've started with that scripture that there'll be a white throne judgment all right and that is for the deeds done in the body of white throne judgment okay daniel covers it said i beheld till the drones were cast down and the anointed and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his strong was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and then ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened the same thing that that john covers on the isle of patmos so that's a white tron judgment we've covered that we don't sit at the white throne judge i mean don't stand before the whites on judgment we sit on the white throne with him but we also know that we say well what's wrong did the prophet preach a lot of messages about our sin but yet are we so smart are we so uh you know whatever but brother dale i don't sin i don't commit adultery and writes cheating still but take that word and just break it down just a little bit and find out about the works of the flesh all right then when we do we might find out we've all got a lot of problems you had it lately where you somebody run you off the road and they call it road rage you get mad just a little thing like that or some little dirty word i had to get onto people here one time because they was using some words that i don't agree with being used as christian language i don't even like the word dam oh that's a water right now but we don't the way it's used is not a body of water with a wall holding it up right little simple words that we use and our children use them then we get onto the children for using them well you know what they're just talking like mom and daddy right see it might be it's good for us to just take a couple of months and study on the works of the flesh of course our problem would be is it would wind up being no works no flesh because everybody'd be leaving because they'd be saying brotherdale's picking on me all the time well like i said one day you'll pat me on the back today you might want a knife in your hand to stab it and to do it but i'm a christian i've never done anything wrong brother dale now you have never done nothing right either because you're just lying like crazy what about it okay romans picks up now so let's go to that to number two romans 14 10. well why dost thou judge thy brother or why doest thou set at naught thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ now that is not the white throne judgment that's right if you want my idea about it i think right now is the greatest judgment time that's ever been because what does the bible say judgment begins work at the house of the lord so where does it start behind the pulpit right look for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god you mean brother dale we're going to have to bow down before god we're going to have to uh oh you ghosted up do you mean if jesus christ walked in here right now and you knew it was him that you wouldn't bow before him you knew it was him now we don't bow before devils and demons and things but if jesus christ walks here we bow before him we'd be glad to vow right so get it right so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way don't do something to make your brother or a christian don't do something to make your children don't do things before your children just remember the languages they they use is the language you taught them right and if you use words that are vulgar words your children use those words who do you blame them well i just i just this little bitty words brother their ladies don't mean nothing i don't mean anything by it so is that sinner when he hollers every time he hollers jesus christ of course you know what i'm talking about he puts a lot of other things in it do you think he's he's oh he ain't being bad well what's he been what about all of us go ahead number four now don't get the rapture of the church and the white throne judgment mixed up now why would he say that well what do you mean i know the difference in the rapture and the white throne do you watch him what's he covered don't get the rapture of the church and the white throne judgment mixed up because the rapture of the church there is no judgment why have we been here so long and not gone in a rapture could it be that we have a lot of works for the flesh well you know the statue of a perfect man is supposed to be working from the inside soul out through the spirit over into the body and bring out a different person right that statue of a perfect man there is no judgment see you don't meet it right down here don't listen to it you've done meat met in other words it right down here that's right for they which are in the or in christ are free from judgment jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come into the judgment but it's passed from death unto life well brother dale that that means it just covers it means it's covered with what we think but what about what he thinks how do you do that we come into christ and are baptized into one body first corinthians 12 one body we're baptized into the body of jesus christ and god has already judged that body he could not stand stand us in judgment again because he's already judged that body well that's wonderful but are you listening to what he's saying why did he say don't mix up the rapture with the white throne if you're in the rapture there ain't going to be no white throne that's right do you understand amen you understand what he's saying if you're in the rapture there ain't going to be no what's wrong for you to have to stand be you know there ain't going to be a white throne for a born-again believer we sit on the throne with him but just remember that maybe while we're still here maybe when the rapture hasn't taken place maybe it's because we don't follow the line to walk in the light of the word but brother dale i i i've always been a good person praise god but what about the little things i thought the statue of a perfect man was to take care of our our uh outward beings by the inward working is that the best way to say it by an inward working of salvation from the soul out through the spirit into the body is supposed to produce a christian but what if we don't let it but brother dale i don't like the way you talk well would you mind explaining it to me who are we blaming for us being here 50 years after the going of a prophet are we blaming him who are we to blame oh it's quiet don't it you see why he's making an emphasis don't mix up that white throne and the rapture because if you go in the rapture there's not going to be any amen amen so maybe right now is the time we ought to be considering to think about the judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad maybe we want to consider right now as the time that we have an opportunity to get rid of our works of the flesh and to get down to a sweet humble spirit that loves one another and tries to pray for one another and to help each other then it won't be any of the works of the flesh because that's what we need to get rid of but it'll be the fruits of the spirit of love joy and you see what i'm talking about works fruits if we go in a rapture we'll have to close it off because i can't go much further if we go in a rapture now you're gonna play hayward with words but i can't do nothing but talk and preach whatever our problems are we'll be dealing with works of the flesh right so read the works of the flesh and see if you have any of them but read it with a sensible human thinking fornication well i i've never committed fornication according to the book of revelations the old catholic church is covered with fornication and that we are part of that until we get out of that that's fornication ain't unclean living out here of adulteries and things in our life it's unclean living in ourselves it's thoughts and ideas what's wrong with you and me what's wrong with me thoughts you don't ever repent of your thoughts amen well that was a devil that made me do that i don't have to repent where'd you get that from what about it works could that be what's causing us to have to go by the grave so you see what the prophet is talking about don't mix up the white throne with the rapture keep them in place rapture got to come before the white throne because we're going to sit on the white throne with him and the rapture is not a bunch of group of people that are just living like the devil but yet they claimed like i said well brother dale uh brother so-and-so said it and i believe it i believe that that when i got born again i've done away with my marriage and divorce problems i want the scripture i want the prophet repentance is what does away with them things i want you to get that in the next few minutes then we'll quit repentance but it's so hard like a man said down at work one day he was lying about he said to say i'm sorry he said that's cheap talk he said of course you got problems because chief talk means you're tied up with a lawyer and the lawyers are many very expensive and i just died alive and i thought that's a pretty good point you know but just study these things then we'll take this up next week works see if you have any of them check it out in your life and see if you have any of them do you ever get a little bit mad because somebody said something about you or to you well i'd tell them off if i wasn't a christian now what kind of an attitude is that you might as well go ahead and tell them all because you just did right you might as well just go ahead and say it because you just did but church i'm trying to get me and you to look at one time there is a judgment seat of christ that we will all have to stand before now i've got the prophet here he said all all of us will stand before he said i'll have to stand get it just run that in judgment seat of christ and see how many times he talked to and see how that he would say now i'm standing here in this congregation today i said now this brother or this sister standing here beside me he said i don't know him or whatever i don't don't you know what said now if if he can take over then something else can work and first thing you know he'd be just talking about well yeah i see you're a christian why because he could pick that up but did he say it covered everything do you think being a christian gives you a right to go out and do anything well i didn't know it was so simple i thought it was big things that we done the little foxes spoil the vine so what is it we'll read these others next week and feel more with it because but the main thing to talk about is one thing if i have a wrong attitude towards you then i've always been one thing please forgive me and don't bother me for you to come tell me i don't like you brother dale you got problems say well i know that now let's get down how to get rid of them you know but you see don't never try to hide nothing just be what you are because at least that way you have an opportunity then you can start dealing with things and think about what do you think about what i've said today that there's two judgments there's a judgment of the white throne but there's a judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad now we don't all mankind don't stand before the white throne right all of them don't have to stand before the white throne in some time you say well yeah they do this what sure they do because they're sinners what you see church we don't have to go to the white throne but why do we not want our lives right in our doings today you'll read what brother brown is saying he said if i offend or if i say this or that or the other thing he said i want to make that right he was sincere wasn't he he said i want it to be right i don't want no trouble it comes down to the river i want everything to be clear come on musician i want everything to be clear i want it all to be right right here so maybe now i'm ending it with this thought we'll pick it back up maybe right now is the judgment seat of christ because we know it's not a white throne or no thing but what it is about now if we judge ourselves that's why i like the communion i like to read that in the community if we judge ourselves then we'll not be judged well see we think well i want to keep that head you're not hiding nothing not hiding nothing it's going to come out somewhere the best thing to do is get out now the bride of jesus christ is the most wonderful position could ever be thought of and i have in no way made any reflection today in my thinking of trying to minister it unto you as to think of anything other than a born-again believer as being a born-again believer being a christian but god is not going to put us in a white throne but there is things in our lives that we need straight the lives we live before others is our most important thing and to find out that that rapture comes before the white throne judgment is a marvelous thing that means you don't have to go there because if you're going into rapture you're clear go ahead brother what we got let's stand just sing a verse and we beat [Music] just remember what we're talking about it's our little baby attitude our little bitty thoughts i could never [Music] day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] let's pray one for another keep our thoughts and ideas on one time we love god because he loved us he ain't gonna throw us away that's what i loved it doesn't matter if there is a judgment of the deeds done in the flesh and matter if i do have to stand there and say lord i've done something wrong with my brother i didn't get that right let me get it right now but i know that there's something within my heart that wants to be right i just want everything right here i want failure yeah born one [Music] father we just commit everything into your hands now and guide us and keep us give us thy love and understanding forgive us of our sins and guide us in jesus name amen you're the dismissed he wants me to live and i want to give until there's just no more [Music] for i can never ever
