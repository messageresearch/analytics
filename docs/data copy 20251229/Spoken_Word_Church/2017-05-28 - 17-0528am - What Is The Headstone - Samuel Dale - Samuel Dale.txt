and amen amen did you see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to acts 4 1st Peter - I think these are the ones we use last Sunday we want to stay with that and carry that all over remember the announcements we know tomorrow is Memorial Day and we thank God for the fact that we can have our freedom until this time and a lot of people gave their lives so that we could be able to keep that freedom on and it's fast going away but yet their their lives sustained for a long time the ability of you and I to be free and we really thank God for those thing I remember Aaron will be preaching for Ash Wednesday I had to chase him down he was up in North Carolina somewhere to let him know he had to preach but you're doing and there was somebody he told me through there Jean Williams Jean Martin had passed away and I don't know what he's going that away or what but he's from up in the Hickory North Carolina area and all of brother Martin so remember the family there all right now the Bible study will be this coming Saturday 6 o'clock brother Prakash will be with us on Sunday to minister unto us the Lord willing brother Daugherty has been to the doctor and they have diagnosed him with stage 2 cancer of the prostate but yet you know we're still praying they're going to tell him Thursday kind of the procedure of what to do it not like that but we just pray and believe that it'll be all right we're not sure we thank God for the healing and no matter how it would come and what science would use to bring it to pace that's fine too we thank God for his healing because shines cannot heal us they can't take care of it so if God wants to use any way fine he wants to deliver it that's fine we believe in a delivery factor right because that's what we're supposed to believe okay all right remember those as anything else I think that's all of the announcements on anyhow but Acts for in first Peter - Lord Jesus we thank you for this day and thank you for an opportunity to be able to come together into worship you we thank you for all of those that have given their lives and things that we can be able to be free at this time of life to where we can worship you and not be under the problems and things of dictatorships and all kind of things that we can worship and freedom and love for you and we thank you for all of those who gave their lives for us to be able to have it and we pray that you would Lord then be with all of the families and everyone to loved ones who've lost them and the ones that were wounded in different things that are happening and we pray that you just bless each one have you away with us today and Lord forgive our sins leaders by that understanding we commit all to you in Jesus name Amen x4 verse 9 if we just Dave the examined of the good deed done to this impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised up from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you hold now who is he this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner and once neither is there salvation in any other there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved first Peter two six and eight wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion the chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded under you therefore which believe is precious but under them which be disobedient the stone which the builders just allowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word the one so you've got to tie together and make sure you get the person and the word to be the same so there's not you're going to having turn him down just a person but now the emphasis is laid upon what they stumbled at the word being disobedient wording to they were appointed you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now tried a couple of messages trying to get everything in line and I hope we can finish this this morning kind of on these things but I want to make sure we keep the point like I said we know when we've been through that the Old Testament spoke of a coming stone a messiah the whole Old Testament was prophecy of the coming of the Lord Jesus and he came exactly the way the Bible said he would come but mankind had he had it all figured out in their ways and their thoughts of you know their concepts of how it was to be they were looking for the Messiah but what about now even like a prophet would say you know and they were there singing the hymns right there as they were out there crucifying him and those very hymns they were singing was talking about they pierced my hands and my feet the things how blind can we be if you ask them was there a god oh yes I like the way the Prophet emphasizes saying he said Eve never doubted that God was real he said it was just his word then he wouldn't keep it which he believed that Israel was looking for the coming Messiah but mankind had interpreted to them what it was to be when he would come they had him as a warrior or deliver all kind of things you know and and they had put into the minds of the people until actually when when Jesus Christ came exactly according to the Scriptures they rejected him you said well some of the people believed in we they believed him but did they believe him enough to be able to continue on with him and that's been the thought that I've been trying to bring to us for a couple of services could we reject the corner the corner stone Curtis Nodine talking about a headstone until you get the stronger corner stone correctly and places in order there is no need is talking about we would reject a headstone with the on you know there's no need of even dealing with that until we get it in line but could we reject Jesus Christ claiming - believing now remember you say but but it's just accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior that's what I emphasized last week from Romans 10 and we need people have confessed with their mouth and believed in their heart that Jesus Christ died for them does that make them saved we said well yeah what else can you do that's true all of the Abraham could do was believe God but what did God due to Abraham he gave him the sign of circumcision right to prove his believing was correct what all we got to do is believe but we emphasize it over and over our Sunday at the end of the message you say I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior that's wonderful but has he accepted you run well you're making it something that's you know beside the point for me what can I do about it you can make sure you're accepting him correctly you can make sure your understanding of accepting him is correct what we've done what Roman said okay why didn't God come to the fact of saving people there must be something wrong with the approach right it's just like I've always emphasized to you I don't believe everybody in the Old Testament they brought a lamb and laid it down and they killed it I don't believe every one of them went home free of their sin because it was just a act or a work or a thought it was not a sincerity of the heart and see God what about a God who ordained all of the offerings and the sin offerings and all thing but then one day he said my nostrils they're stinking of your sacrifices of your offerings he said I would just an honest in the contrite heart and I've always emphasized what about David it didn't matter about him being King because they didn't kill him for his action is doing I didn't have anything to do with it the high priests do something wrong they kill him but David always had a sincerity in his heart that no matter what he done he getting this fall back on a crutch oh Lord I couldn't help it now you know that that you just made me like this and I couldn't help being the way that I've been he didn't take that route that's not a sincere route he was apologetic he was crying out always searching returning to me and Scofield even verifies it Brennan says it David was on his way home from the bed of Bathsheba when he began to cry out Lord return unto me the joy of thy salvation so couldn't we today turn down the very opportunity whatever you want to call it to be a Christian by believing we already are well I've done everything God told me to do well don't you think the high priest could say that now come on remember what we emphasize it any word that Jesus ever said anything about the high priest and them of the things they were doing come on bring me the scripture he never got up the front accomplished accomplish your dirty dog you've seen you've done this not the other you never said it why because he didn't do it well he just didn't want to bring it out philosophies get you in trouble vain jangling gives you to worry exactly what I'm talking about they buy philosophies and vain jangling and ideas of mankind we can turn down the very word of God claiming to believe it look at those Pharisees where could he touch their lives of what were doing nobody he never told him is wrong why because they kept the law to the letter but he said you've rejected me and thereby be rejected me said the kingdom is going to be taken from you so they rejected him as the Messiah they also rejected him as their king he come riding in to them probably even calls it well not donkey that day the very king they were looking for and Pilate wound up being better than rest of them he did at least nail to sign up and said the king of Israel he must have thought more about it and understood it better than they did we had he come exactly according to the word but was rejected could we reject it again one of these days you'll realize why I make the statement constantly never stop seeking God no matter what you do never get to a state that you think when I Lord I've done enough in seeking you never get that foolish trying to get away from him words stupid sometimes I've been known to be kind of rough about that part a kind of life in this morning I said go brother lluís back there we got a email from India and Irish brother Louisa's name in there and brother Bob's in it wages in it you know talking more about the words and it was about she was and what I would bring yeah well I thank God for that that's what a tow brother Louie censored Ceaser if you hadn't come to Lulu your name wouldn't been on the internet going around her world you would have never been recognized as being all over so there is some good about coming to right but listen could we turn down the word it explained to me the difference in the situation of Israel of old and they're following the word to the letter and walking in the law then what you would say we have done well with a brother della I've done all they can do I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and he'll tried to be a Christian all my life and I've done this I've done that I've done all these things well which one was justified the one standing it said Lord I've done all of these things or the one that said Lord just forgive me which went home justified well David was a shyster a crook or dirty God words or anything you could bring up about David to be good yet the Bible said he was a man after God's own heart you mean the dirty guy with the garden I mean that's the kind of God you're serving no no no no it's he had an honest in the country heart he had a forgiving attitude he was always crying out for forgiveness he'll never stop seeking God cuz my what is my statement has always been to you I'd rather go all of my life seeking after God you know every day crying out unto Him and get to that final day and come to find out I had it all along then did not seek after God and believe in my great philosophies of the great justification for reasons that I know my salvation is real and get down to the end of it and find out it wasn't real which one of you we seek to reject him then was to reject now listen dear woman try to pick up the point one to reject Jesus Christ as the Messiah as the king and all the Old Testament speaking to reject him as being though saying you realize you are rejecting the unto our Old Testament and what did your prophet say he said word rejecters what word rejecters he said goes to hell then we can try to appease God or whatever by saying what Lord we didn't know well that's a good excuse maybe a lot on that day that God will deal with at the watch on judgment of the Old Testament you or whatever wherever people are you'll be dealing with people that have that confession and a lot of it is right you know and what and a lot would be giving eternal life and all of the great goodie doodoos and you know the guys is always right everything is going to miss it because they rejected me yes but you don't understand from the tale I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and if he don't save me he's a liar be careful be careful now what's the issue you say but it's just to accept Jesus Christ then he's going to have to accept every religion there is every religious person or whatever you want to call it am i right no matter what you put it or what they do or all of the great rituals are doing but still all the religious world is saying Jesus Christ as their Savior am i right well why is he not accepting that and by what justification our signs or wonders are you going to put it on that's all I'm trying to ask you and I to to verify that after 50 years of studying this message brother Dale I don't look at those what do you want me to does I want you to keep on seeking God but Renison stay there until you're certain he has accepted you that was remember was in the last quotes we were giving it is not whether or not you accepted him it's whether he accepts you now as I said then if it's just upon accepting him because he said it and we can quote Romans 10 confess with your mouth and believe in your heart well then why is it that all religions all religious realm religious people why is it that everybody that says they're saved it or not let's don't go into philosophies we know there's people who make concessions and they're going on and they're going to be judged according to those like at the white throne right and some will be given eternal life now leave that out of it just get down to honest and straightness to think about it why is it that God does not accept all the religious world of this nut according to my Bible and according to the Prophet messenger that we try to believe it comes to a day that in the lady you see an age that he's put outside of the church right outside of the church that's inside the church singing about him right yes Patricia she's not that bad well well now according to the Bible now he's standing at the door knocking trying to get back in now that's according to the scriptures he said well it's really God is not there when you go ahead and argue with him all you want to that's what he put in his word what has been rejected by the religious world that would make him be on the outside knocking at the door trying to get back in not God is a savior right they want that and confess that not God is a healer or deliverer a comfort of whatever in a time of need what is it that had that the religious world has turned down that would put him at outside the door knocking that's a simple question all I asked everybody said brother they are so deep is that tea and that's really something it's so deep I just asked a simple question yes would you confuse this card we don't know what you tell me I just said what I'm talking about how come your prophet would start out in an early ministry preaching to 500,000 lined up in his life ministry preaching to a dozen he was just stubborn he just he had all them invitations to go we've listened to him last night he said had thousands of invitations laying back there people inviting him for a we are not just one day he said for two weeks and for this that in the other but did they really want him for the words that he was bringing or did they want him for the gifts that would be innate manifest they would draw the crowds and bring the money which one is it he said we'll pray to see where God sends us you know where God was going to send him the place the door wasn't closed is that plain enough he went to a lot of places the doors were already closed will you agree with that because they certainly didn't open the doors and invite him in for the word and he was ran what did the prophets say about Jesus he said oh they loved him because it he was a healer he was a feeder of the people who's doing it but said when he begin to say I and my father won he said then they turned away from him in other words when he begin to say I am the fulfillment of the Old Testament Scriptures was that what he was saying I am the one that has come according to the word Regis Thomas and Rita it is if we go through it that he he talked about the stone which is don't you know there's a he talked about the bread in the wilderness and did he say I'm that bread all the Old Testament was fulfilled in Jesus Christ right I'm not the part of the coming Messiah in the rulership but you have to turned him down yes but it's a brother we're good on behavior something I don't walk home bad not to walk home meeting you I just come from there no result Jesus I accepted Jesus as my savior but what else would you want me to do come on come on now you've been there you've been on both sides of the fence all right you've been there and set it to people right they were trying to help you and now what do you hear what else what you offered them I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior what a Christian shouldn't women shouldn't cut to her now that's according to we we don't believe that that's some Old Testament thing you're rejecting the word how much wood could we stay on that that's why I don't preach on that life if you got to be preached to about your hair and you dress in your clothes by now forget it you've already rejected Jesus Christ turn on any tape come on get rock walk right over there in that church and listen to them talk about Jesus Christ and the love that he has and the things in the forgiving what about it but I've done everything I can do what do you want me to do oh I won't you get don't you repent what I've done that praise the Lord okay now once you be baptized like brother Mike Kennedy said when dumb is listening to radio broadcasting the man was coming across like that you know he was going through the scripture and he told us had read you know how the black people read one for the other he said read he's feller said repent he said repent you know the preacher reader read it the preacher Semih and he got that and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said Oh you know you didn't agree with that you understand what I'm getting at simple a little matter in it you know yourself where you stood and you know where you came from and you know what you faced my baptism don't mean nothing rejecting the word well that's not rejected I don't know number one you don't know you've got an excuse number two now you know you have no excuse okay solve the problem you know what I'm talking about the truth you talk to people and try to get them to see Jesus Christ and you know where they came from because you came from die right but yet why won't they accept it it's just simple a matter they try to get you to see what they turn down Jesus said my word have no part in you you can't hear my word he said I'm a quoting scripture who was he according to the Bible he was the Word made flesh John 1:14 is it run he was the Word made flesh they were looking for a God and believing their God would be the word they had heard and studied made flesh right I mean am i right now see what we think those Jews all they do is you sit around ruler dogs everybody read way too easily we know they're studying that word you know what I loved when Reuben that Israeli God said to me he said Sam he said y'all took the Bible out of the school he said our children in school have the Koran the scriptures to thank layer1 and said the Bible laying on the other side and said it's mandatory that you study that Bible and here we took them out of school but we're nation we're a great thing anyway oh yeah go to Russia right now and say I'm a homosexual and you ain't gonna live long go to America and say I'm a homosexual and make you ruler of imitation I won't say president because they ain't nobody said that about him yet so we just you know we just we forget all of that but listen what you're talking about really do Jesus Christ according to the Bible was to become first the Cornerstone right which would be God Almighty in human flesh dwelling on the earth is that - is that a summation of the Old Testament Bible speaking of the coming Messiah it is not that right with a Jew that brother Adam talked to and he asked him said who will the Messiah be he said oh you be God in human flesh well he's summing up the teachings of all of Israel right they no matter how it come who it came or when it come it would still be the Word made flesh it would be their God now this son and you'll see where you're going to trap your own sale they was not believing in three guards coming right because when Jesus said I and my father woman they said you're making yourself God because they was not looking for a trinity to come the word Trinity was not even it into being they were not looking for something like that to come and they knew that the Messiah would be God in human flesh when he stood there what happened they crucified since he was caught simply because he said he was God and yet he had ever signed to prove that he was until even they had to admit it the greatest were leaders Nicodemus Khmer etc no man can do these things Nicodemus to Lord you unless God be with you but yet because of their society they would not stand up for him as to being the Messiah tool even a heathen King would say were you this editor he sent unto this on in without board he just wrote him out a little decree put it on it said knighted overhead that he's a king of the Jews he didn't do that as a sarcastic matter but he didn't want to cause interaction he done it because it that was what the man was saying were they not looking for a king he was taken from being the king of Israel the Messiah anything you want to call him and made a common criminal but they hung him on a tree that's what they thought of him you get the emphasis they would try maybe to stone him at times but they decided that was maybe not a good idea it will hang him up before the world and let the world see what we think about him and they crucified him they had to because the word said it would be that way well why didn't they read the word to find out what to do you know what they could have read the word and found out how many nails in needed they could have read the word and found out how the man died and he would be piercing the side not a bone was broken they could they could say well a lot of trouble of having to go through living the things if it had just read the word before he sure is dumb are you with me but in final analysis what he wind up doing he wound up being the word made flesh and they turned it down the very thing they were looking for he said my word hath no part in you why don't you keep my saying code you can understand my words he would say is that Scripture what did it mean I didn't understand his speech no they didn't understand what he was saying because they knew he was saying things different from what they had heard before what about it did he not himself say you've rejected me and set up on this rock revelation of who I am not on Peter not on the other with Revelation who is Jesus Christ yet he said I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that did that stop them from crucifying no that made for sure that he was going to he said the kingdom will be taken from you and given to a people that are not a people in other words are dogs or Gentiles you know when that took place he wound up being as I was emphasizing throughout the message you know when you say the headstone hasn't come yet now say people say well he don't believe it a good bit of the headstone Israel had a headstone he walked on the shores of Galilee he offered his life but he could not be their king their head had to become the cornerstone right but he became the head of the church around even said he's the head of the center he said God he created him he's ahead of all times right but listen what is it church to be built upon what was Israel and we went to what did they reject they reject the sonship they rejected all of the things we went through that Sunday and by rejecting all of those things see the revelation of God's Word was removed from them by the leaders is that right you stand in the doors there what Jesus said about and said you won't go in and said you won't let them win what percent of the hell you don't understand all I gotta do is just accept Jesus and just just tell if it has he accepted you what if he ain't is his fault you can good should take time go ahead you're playing the new devil's territory so go ahead because you're trying to make vain philosophies an answer to a serious question you're a talk to people you ever talk to people you know about the Word of God and like I said they always say against the Lord's coming real quick and then all at once you start saying with this and isn't this about to come and look we don't want we're not talking about him coming right now see it you talk to them about the word as I said about to hire the dress the clothes and when it's old you're just in that Old Testament stuff we're in the new testament well I guess New Testament means you can strip off the kind of written thing yesterday talking about this news commentator I won't call them names or nothing but you know you can make your vain philosophies as trying to conquer somebody by your words your superiority of your words that you use and that was what he was made known popular about doing back in the 30s 40s and it and it was real quick so that's what we think a quick answer you know when we're not in the New Testament we're I mean the olds had win the New Testament to see that person go back to the church well I straighten them out in people talking about that stuff and I told him we wouldn't in the Old Testament well I straighten them out did not and this news commentator he happened to have a wooden leg and so he said to a man that was in a group of singers they were sitting in front of him one day he was interviewing him and one of them had long hair and he looked over at him and he said well I guess sir the end you've got long hire so he was being sarcastic he said I guess being you got long hard makes you a woman being sarcastic nicely he was interviewing these people can even being real nice you know what the guy said back to he said sir said you've got a wooden leg I guess it makes you a table see he didn't want that I'm sure main philosophies will get us no work quick answers slow to thinking is the right way thank over what somebody says to you they've always Illustrated to you about brother Moe when he put me up against the wall about one God oh I had all of those answers I could have said all these things about God in three persons Blessed Trinity and nobody knows all about that stuff we were not able to know and he said your Trinity just like the rest of them I knew I was standing nailed to a wall and not in one hope to whatever my vain philosophy was doing no good I could scream and holler about all of my doings and what I've been told but you know what I said I said sure I don't believe that no more I had a little sense I knew where I stood but are you understanding what I'm getting at they rejected the person of the word that was standing before them the very hopes of anything now let's divide it just a little bit they were not looking for a new testament to come the old testament people wasn't because they couldn't understand the writings of david and all of the Psalms in the difference they didn't understand that that was why they rejected him when he came they didn't understand those things they were not looking for a kingdom to come that would be meek and on bullying and you know they were looking for somebody to be a David or AG lot you know a killer of Saul you know anybody that they could think of they thought that's who the Messiah was going to be he was going to get rid of them Romans he's gonna take over they wasn't looking for a new Testament because they had no way of understanding about it but yet we say we're in the New Testament it's one of jabber jabber words and I said I want to go that we just spout out to try to conquer somebody else with it you know but listen see the word spoke of him coming and the word spoke that he would be the word made flesh was that right read your Old Testament get in especially the Psalms and then especially Isaiah or something and get to that and try to follow it we'll get to one in a minute and let's see if we can if we don't we'll take it up later on the word because this is on my mind and this is what it's going to get off of my mind he he was the fulfillment of the word you agree with that then why would they stumble as Peter says at the word that we read now back up in your mind just a little bit and think of sensible things and be a human being for a minute and let's go away from the Prophet said one time we're so people are so spiritual until they're not worth nothing and then he says they're so natural that I not worth nothing spiritual something to that degree is my way of saying it anyway back up to where you came from and when you begin to hear the word and how you fought against the word but yet the word was being presented to you Ron you remember that back up in your life where you come from this be sensible I'm not backing up our code I'm come up here when you oh you're wonderful can you remember when you used to fight the truth then what would be if you had to face God at that time now come on we all the great philosophies you want your great words will do no good I'm asking you a simple question you were a Trinitarian right mostly everybody someone that's because we wasn't into the one that's line of that that much probably but we were back in the Trinitarian idea how would it be if you had to face God with that concept and he says I'm not that concept I'm trying to present a truth to you by person it's bringing the word to your understanding and why are you turning me down yeah but I cannot get away from that so you're making your super was it word super visual in other words you're making something great thing to try to conquer with it it ain't conquering me whatsoever that don't bother me whatsoever for you to run your vain mouth about what we believe this we I was just out of the other I can talk to I can say that I was probably more oneness when I was in back during I was Trinitarian but didn't make no difference are wrong on either side what I'm trying to get you to look at is one time what if God had demanded that you face him then where would we be well he understands come on are you philosophy see floating so you're trying to answer instead of being truthful you're not getting what I'm talking about what if God required for you to answer him with what you believe when you were a Baptist Methodist Presbyterian clinic long story etc what about the old ones that we don't like to state but you ever noticed you there most all of us make this one when mama said I was born to Baptists and I'm going down bad dish and you were sitting right there not saying what about mama she's a little off the wall but she's right time to get a point if you look at those Old Testament people were keeping the letter word to the letter we can't say we were keeping the word to the letter when we were back there where we came from no we've keeping what we thought was the word and God winked at her ignorance and brought us in that's good amen he brought us in but what if he's are required of it back then mm-hmm well what about now we won't go into it but what about in this message in the end time when there's so many doctrinal issues and so many things I have one message you so many people believe in this and so many people believe in that and all around the world it's just scattered everywhere and everybody's got their philosophies about what this is and what the Prophet told and all of it out of one message and your prophet would say I doubted dozen out of this generation to make a change well you know what that means oh you say but he didn't really mean it that way why don't say yeah yes oh okay what was he getting out a small number right seven billion people in the world if it would one be and believe the truth right now that'd be a small number right that'd be an equivalent of an eight people in the days of the flood compared to maybe eight million or whatever you'd want to run your days your taient you know what are you listening they stumbled at the Word made flesh he said show me were that I'm contrary to the word condemn me see they turn down the word that was standing before them what about now they failed to accept the word that would have been the Messiah now listen are you understanding what I'm talking about they were not looking for the Messiah to come as a baby right that was not their philosophies even though Isaiah had spoken anybody have had a few that was looking in searching but it wasn't looking for a baby to come they certainly weren't looking for a king to come riding in on a donkey and then beating the daylights out of everything stricken with his clothes took everything from him and hung him on a cross you remember the Prophet emphasizing those two on the road to Emmaus as they were going along because they said well this is what we thought we thought he was going to be king he said with we thought this going out and said look at her did they beat you and killed him and said now what are we even now they said well we don't need no said the body has been gone so we don't know what's going on you realize they turn down the right a rejecting him as the Messiah as the king they turned down the right of sonship is that where we've that Sunday Israel turned down the right of sonship right thinking they were the children of God you know until Jesus came they were come on let's go to our profit let's get him in the right order until Israel until Jesus come before Israel they were great everything's okay but when he came to them then they rejected him see they don't know what they turned down Jesus told him said now the kingdom that you've been doing and looking for it come he's standing here among you since you've rejected it said it's going to be taken from you remember and they said god forbid no no no he's going to be taken from you and given to a people that are even not of a name which the Gentile dog boy they really didn't like that did what are we done you see one Jesus never had confront a Shinra what you want to call them with the ferret that hi Frank in fire season too much he said well they would know how old he had dude what right in the info and you better believe they wouldn't nobody gonna stop him from walking by their words the high priest was that right you said they were tried yeah they were tried would you think they could have stopped him cuz remember Hey he was Almighty God you think they were going to do no and he never went before Caiaphas that's or any high priest that's what I'm trying to get you to see there was no need of going to them they had already turned him down he said yeah but what about us what is the new birth remember they don't want we talk about Sunday they rejected sunshield they rejected the new burro see because they had no way had it figured out that he was going to come a baby and he was going to grow up and he was going to die for their sins and then he was going to come back and live within them in a new birth right none of that Old Testament people had it figured out even if the great religious leaders even after you come on into the church ology of thinking about Jesus Christ with the disciples and they get over and acts one after Jesus's resurrection and they are still saying are you going to return the kingdom to Israel at this time they were not looking for him to come back and live in their lives to give them an uber that's why I've always preached is where I am what is the new birth brother branham Christ mystery of God reveal wonder decide paragraph 3 333 and 334 Christ the mystery of God revealed what is the new birth right around him it's revelation Jesus Christ personally to you not you said of creed not you read a book not you done to this aren't you done of these things it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you was that not the rock that he was talking about when he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it do you think those Old Testament people was looking for anything like that okay simple questions for a few minutes what are we looking for what are you looking for I'll give it to you all the time and it's just simple way of saying it we think he's coming in the bush and we go down to the airport wait on the bus now you know what that means don't you that means we're not following the prescription we were going over to see brother Jeffrey's one time two years ago the only time they ever had anybody hardly even run something up because I don't trust all that stuff and to show you it didn't work they told us I told him I said you run it up for me to be able to go and one of the kids run it up for us to go to to be able to find brother Jeff researcher at the nursing home we see I knew where the road went into Covington and 11 and how it turned and which you go in and turn that go back this way and come back around we followed that thing to the letter Maracana ever turn ever screw tree every one of them was perfect we wound up sitting in the middle of a subdivision looking for a nursing home and we kept riding around and around I said well maybe it's your someone and he said we might we'll forget it a take down here what happened to be a guy on the side of the road work and stop and ask him we're sewing so nursing home I said according to the directions it supposed to be right here and I mean street numbers Road numbers everything when the coordinates piece of paper a wife can verify that guy said you are you familiar with coming out yesterday around a little bit he said you know where you come in to Covington and said it makes a left turn and it goes down in a swing kind of round little I said yes sir he said the nursing home said you go back to where you spoke when you turn left he said turn right right iris of Nursing I followed every direction according to the piece of paper with the numbers and everything and didn't get to the right place he said well what are you talking about I'm talking about some body goofed up in installing the software for that thing it wasn't their fault for looking it up it was right he just showed you mechanics don't work too good unless you're right all right and it might wind up to be like this we're coming out from brother Henry's one time and illustrate we've come driving out and I started to turn right and I said you got to go lay out I said we gotta go ride she said you got to go lay out and now we got to go ride it she said we got to go left to get back home I said okay okay I agree with you 2,500 miles around the world I said we were left she decided about the end I knew or that you know so sometimes it's better just old-fashioned murder trails you know knowing where you're at is better is my point than it is to read all the books about everything but somebody didn't get in right place my point is what the religious world of the Old Testament had man set mind set to mankind of all forms and every one of them missed even though they call him Messiah even though they call him King even though they call him ruler they miss how he was coming but yet he put it in earth to the letter he was gonna come as a baby he was gonna come up and out to be killed he was going to come up and have to give his life and come and live in the people and they rejected it that was the word I'm talking about they rejected so what about you and I Jesus said to those he said in John 8 and 37 I know that you're Abraham's seed we said you're trying to kill me because my word had no place in you you cannot hear my word well you can't understand my speech John 1843 okay so you've been hammering this for three services and it looks like I'm a hammer mower so it's alright you're not following maybe my point if you backed up 20 30 40 years ago to where you come from him denominational churches all of us would come down to that we had our origin there and we can preach the great philosophies of how great and wonderful God letters in that's true he did he brought us to the right he brought us to the truth but remember why we was there what is he required of that day for us to answer him according to his word would we be an idiot written in Israel what about now just go follow some of these ideas you know why all these ideas come up because people come up with the idea that they got some way to get us out of here and you know in a way I appreciate them for being that way I hate lazy people that just shift it so long we don't need to understand the word oh we got to just stay real simple and do nothing hey you ain't gonna get nowhere with me like that we don't need them deep things we need to stay with a simplicity saying this to the person on the internet that actually the question about it they stand for the truth on all the message stand for the truth no matter where you're at stand for the truth it's the only answer I give to somebody that asks me a question about fit because we were wondering about ideas and doctrines and salts stand with the truth because then when you do your stand alone don't worry about it she truly then the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ and by that new birth coming into the disciples we come to Ephesians 2 in 20 now that we're built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone right you notice that it's not emphasized that much but notice it said we're built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets why would he emphasized and prophets be all the Old Testament prophets this statue of a perfect man is built on the foundation apostles and prophets it's built on the Jesus Christ of the Old Testament those disciples were bringing that's why Paul went to the backside of the desert to read the scrolls to bring his messengers Jesus Christ he went back and studied the prophets right so when it says apostles that's New Testament people because they're called apostles you remember that they're called disciples when they were just believers right so your scripture and go through it and read them Matthew Mark Luke and John and watch them be disciples then watch it when it comes on over there changed to apostles you know what it is apostle is just like a person but I mean a disciple but an apostle is one sent all right so we're built on not just the foundation to what Peter Paul James John and those men of the New Testament bro we're built on the foundation of the entire Old Testament that said Jesus Christ would come as the chief Cornerstone he would be head of the church as Paul would bring him you can go through the husband and the wife that he would be or all of your studies would see down through times in in other words they had what we would call the faith of the father you agree there's a shopper trying to move into the message now what questions we have should be answered by the Apostles you agree admit that we still took that and interpreted what we want to do out of it to mean what it meant but you can still can't change what we said because the New Testament brought Jesus Christ not looking for him to come in flesh of being but we meet him in the air right pleased to come in our flesh you not to come back here as a person standing on the earth in human flesh he's not made to be that way we meet him in the air see the word made flesh he's dealing with you and I now now listen what is the faith of the father's as I said the other day illustrate we say faith for the father and by the say faith no this entire period where you come to not the headstone but all of this is the faith of the father's that's what Peter was explaining in second Peter add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance godliness president kind of that is the faith of the fathers now the age is down through time never received that they only received a partial realization for the time and they came forth after the dark ages with the just shall live by faith but that was the faith you we've been through that over and over volition the Bible had already spoken in the New Testament trying to run fights to get you just a little bit the New Testament had already spoken the Old Testament showed that he would be crucified but what about in the New Testament showing where he would be crucified again and put to an open shame by who who's there going to hang on a tree now he's not here in flesh they hung the people in the dark ages on the tree but that's not the point right what he's being rejected in the last days that he's outside the church and I don't mind saying it forget it do what you want to the biggest portion of people is this message has already put him outside why because the word is not read not accepted in those churches where the words not accepted God's not dark right where do you think you're that I'm being forget it come and show me where I'm wrong that's open the internet been open ever since we turned it on come and show me where I'm wrong don't you worry about it I'll come back and tell the people and name you that told the people that I was wrong but you see cause when you stand like that you don't have to worry because I'm not I'm not trying to make anything to try to make a kingdom I told you in that message I was looking at it again yesterday or twice I listened to like Sunday's message I was crying in my heart to go to these old far in fields and hear them people talk about this message and how perverted the people had made it yet they're quoting them as Peter Paul and John then they turn around and quote brother so-and-so and brother so-and-so and brother so-and-so I set my heart then to one time I appreciate straight hair I won't preach I said that one time the brother said when you tried to quit it lula said come on where I'm at I said you don't understand that's a brother you don't understand I said the day I can't preach in Lula what God gives me I will preach no more anywhere you mean I can't preach in my own church what I would believe I don't agree William trouble come and tell me that's all I've ever asked and people leave and go off and say all a lot of that's that enough but why don't they come and tell me that's all I've ever happens it makes you sarcastic so what makes me what I am - but listen the church started out on the Deaf Pentecost on the faith of the father's right the upper room there was 120 we see the baptism of the Holy Ghost that put them up where you call brotherly kindness on your pyramid bringing down all of them ain't going to argue with you I am going to say that least the Apostles that walk with the Lord Jesus receive those things as their new birth but on the outside they was because they'd heard the word and then with it three and a half-year but outside there was a group of people 3,000 received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost that only heard one sermon now don't tell me they got to faith through the father's but here in one sermon if they did why was peter wanting to teach us how to get to the faith of the father the sea it was talked to the early church and it like stood for for ages I'm quoting brother Branham if you want these for ages and he said the word went into the ground that Nicaea under Columba ever how you pronounce it crumble the fourth church age the pure and unadulterated word he said went into the ground beseech all said you can't confirm palm or locust and the caterpillar would eat the church down and it started eating on it heavily right after the disciples are and by the fourth church age annotated into the ground but God said I will restore the years of the cankerworm pouring locals to caterpillar I'll bring it back and he started in Martin Luther to bring it back he started in John Wesley to bring it back and the people of this message of preachers don't even want to believe what Martin Luther told of the truths that is just shall live by faith oh we're beyond all that I had we're up here with a headstone there like I asked a brother of my house one day I said would you mind telling me what the headstone is you say you're going to go beyond brother Branham yeah that's what we believe he swept off the foundation when you'll get to it in Zechariah but I do ask you to read zechariah and listen to a message called what is it message of grace if you listen to that and read zechariah 4 we'll get to it but that brother he said when we go beyond brother random he just swept off the foundation I said well okay tell me beyond the future huh I know I'm sarcastic sorry hateful right glory at least you know where I'm at I said tell me something beyond the future home because Road around free sister the future home I said why don't you get in the message or get out the man's wife looked at me and said brother Dale you're right II or to get in or get out of the message that was his choice it wasn't against a man I was just telling the God's honest truth I'm not against anybody in their thoughts and ideas I love the Brethren but there's one thing about it when it comes to the word we're gonna stand on the word but joe said i will restore the years of the cankerworm locust a caterpillar i will restore luther started a restoration but it really turned to be a reformation am i quoting the prophet west become was more of restoration but it turned to be reformation he said the Pentecostals came with more bringing restoration he said but it turned to be reformation even to the holy ghost onizuka street he's calling it reformation why because his carnal reforms this message was to come to bring restoration i preached it to you for years and years in your Melancon floor Malachi fuller says what if during the hearts of the children to the father's and the father's to the children right John the Baptist came to turn them one way they got to be an endtime message come turn them back don't go into your scriptures with John and say well he done this out of the other color I'm gonna quote dirt around them you couldn't have John turning them to the New Testament and then turn them back to the Old Testament that's what you're saying we see you don't listen to that your smart-aleck lis you won't listen to a simple terminology then what would ever happen what you see Lutheran Wesleyan em didn't have the restored word back to the faith of the Father but according to the Prophet on 327 with a lady OC in church age what is it this prophet in the end time is to do contain one turned the hearts of the children back to the face of the father to reveal the seven thunders which is revelation containing the seventh seal and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally Turney I'm quoting him word for word turn the church back see there was no way for the church to be turned back that you could understand what it would be to mean to reject the word god winked at ignorance of Luther and Wesley a.m. in Azusa Street but no longer after this message has come in 50 years that we've had to study it there's no point of saying God is winking at her ignorance no he's commanded all men to repent it's not your ideas or my ideas that's why I say come on I'm not sarcastic and hateful you show me the truth I'll be glad to receive it and come right here and tell you who told it but until that day comes don't call me or Susie 5 peti 8 little ideas I stand for one thing the Word of God this message has the answer to every question I just quoted you the point who's going to restore the faith of the father that's why we're going to get into it I'm right down to it now Zachariah for when we say just a word Zechariah was a great Prince that restored the temple he laid the foundation he built the building Zacharias to bring forth the headstone Zechariah was to bring forth the edge strong brother Branham says notice the scripture it does not say he will restore the cornerstone he said he'll praying that hitch tongue even though Zachariah rebuilt the temple he still put the thorn the stones right were probably some of them were left around the edges and he put her right down where it was this message church has to be the headstone to the church or what are you looking for I end with that tape statement because I don't have time this message if this message is not the headstone of the church tell me where it's coming from tell me words to be and what it is no they turn down the word back there so does the people at this end time turn down the message or the hour by making it whatever they want it to be come on musician making it what they want it to be I think is this I think is that that's why I like to read I like to ask for the rental questions so yeah but we can ask them questions now haha that's where you're wrong right about them what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost when we've got all of these problems and things about everybody saying it he said evidential the Holy Ghost where the spirit in you agrees word enough he just answered your question right and what is the new verb well it's the interest added these other pieces visitor right around and what is an uber he says revelation Jesus Christ personally run around him what is the Seventh Seal wrote around said it was the coming of the Lord but I thought it was even I thought that's what you're thinking you ain't asked the question you didn't ask the question get an answer you asked a question to get what you think is an answer he said it's the coming of the Lord and we believe the report that has been made to us I got it pictures I got just got notes laying on my desk and believe believe the report it has been made to us I believe that word the Prophet says okay where ya at today the Bible says forsake not just sending that yourselves together the Prophet said that we're yeah you see what I mean folk we all we don't reject the message well the message tells you all the answers you agree well that fearfully show me what he said it was give me a definition of the new bird from the Prophet that does not identically fit this revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he just making it simple I think you're showing so I think you do could it be that we've rejected the stone I have stood here for three services proving one time the religious world and I'm talking about they're believers of this message the religious world has turned down the word of odd just exactly in the same way that Israel of old turned it down just exactly like the denomination's has turned it down could we turn it down be careful when you say you believe everything the word says remember what I said about the guy that was a smart aleck told that guy said you got long liar so I guess it makes you a woman I think I look back at him and said you got a wooden leg I guess that makes you a table just remember you quote all you want to but you're going to come back to face the Word of God what is the new birth right around the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now what if you ain't heard the revelation of Jesus Christ and I end it by quoting one man a man run into people that had walk with the word studied the word been with the word been later the man that introduced them men on the river and yet one day he said you're great believers and you're doing this and you're doing that and you are declaring cause there was who was it was his name he was preaching that Jesus was the Christ right acts and then was preaching that Jesus was the Christ but not knowing that he'd been crucified he said let me ask you a question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed me ask you another same question have you receive the Holy Ghost since you come into message what is your holy ghost grip surely it has to be the Lord Jesus Christ why would we need a prophet because you got to deal with restoration then when the church can come back to the faith of the fathers I'll quote you one quote that we're going to in the message that'll be next Sunday what about the head and body is going to unite in the last days to bring the message you want to cook that hidden body is to unite in the last days to bring the next siege but yeah we know all about it don't we the Stan be we can turn down the cornerstone and reject a headstone there's no need to talk about headstone until we see the cornerstone you said well brother Dale I know what the cornerstone it's a revelation of Jesus Christ amen but where would that fit in with a two sold seven Thunder peru's is River Jordan the people of this message where would it fit when even like river jordan says he wasn't even God until the River Jordan came and then God Vacanti became caught and then God left him in the garden and he died a man now you show me that in the face of the father's a good Baptist ain't gonna bring it anyway oh my god [Music] to follow anybody having a diol little [Music] too far I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back Oh don't among gold anybody have an e do you know Jesus Christ as your Savior and he accepted you [Music] as accepted you [Music] if he accepted a Baptist doctrine he'd be the head of the bad disturb if the accepted imagine of doctrine he'd be the head of the nest of church and he accepted all these to sold seven Thunderbirds peruvians prove Jordans ideas didn't he'd be the head of that [Music] what do you believe about [Music] I believe that he's the same yesterday today forever turning back now he can be the head of that time I believe that the new birth is revelation of Jesus Christ you can be the head of that I believe the internist or the holy goat it wasn't a spirit in you agrees of the word even be the head of that I've asked them we might report my report you made [Music] to me no turning back [Music] what about it remember the service just after noon break away everybody's others father in Jesus name we
