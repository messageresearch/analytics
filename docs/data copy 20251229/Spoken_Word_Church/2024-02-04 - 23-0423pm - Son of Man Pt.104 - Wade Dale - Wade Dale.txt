========================================

sorry to put you on the spot but your best friend brother Joe told me to it on is on okay so good to be back I really enjoyed the service this morning and uh learned something new he said patience was not mentioned in the Old Testament and now it kind of shows you that you need the holy spirit in your life to have patience patience with God patience with your family patience with your job patience with different things and that's such a revelation because you know you think in the Old Testament there's so much killing maybe people didn't have much patience with each other but the Holy Spirit really tempers all of that so let him come into your heart tonight you know there's just a song here we're going to sing and then I'll probably sing a Praise Chorus after but it's just in everything give thanks whatever is going on in your life just give [Music] thanks okay you can sing the chorus with us any sing when you're up again the wall and your mountains seems so tall and you realize

All I Need Lord You're All I Need you're everything to me and he'll take the pain [Music] away when it seems you're all alone praise His name when you feel you can go on raise your hands raise your

you baseball football stars uh rock stars country stars everybody like to speak to all those and them speak to us but Lord today let the Eternal one speak to us and speak to a group of people that this world does not understand this world Lord when you were walking here they did not understand you either they ridiculed you they reviled you they called you every name in the book except their savior well father today let us magnify you in front of the people we call you our savior our healer Our Redeemer our husband Our Father Lord all the great attributes winds up into one person and that person has been made flesh and now because of that according to St John 17 you said father that we may be one as you and I are one Lord I pray that we'll come closer today that we'll be more into this perfect image that you've already seen Lord by forn knowledge that somebody did come to it and Lord it's our choice to decide whether we want to do that or not father give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our trespasses be with us Lord it being the first day of the week we've got Monday coming up Tuesday all the different things Lord I pray that you'd be with each one be with the ones that are here that need to travel back home I pray that you be with them give them traveling mercies be with the ones that are sick to Lord be with the bride around the world especially Lord be with the missionaries that are in the Foreign Fields doing their work Lord and we we we thank you Father that we're able to be acquainted with them and be able to support some father we'll never know until we get to the other side what an impact this church has had to the world and Lord thank you for a group of young men and young sisters and older men and older sisters that have taken the Reigns of the church Lord and and and been able to use techn ology and all the different things to get this message out from this little building here father I pray that you'd strengthen them and give them Supernatural knowledge Lord to help each one father we're a needy people we need you Lord we need you to come and speak to us today so father I pray that you'd do that and we honor Your Great Name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen part 104 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the world didn't see that did they the world saw him as Bel above the world saw him as a instigator and a and all these different things but today by our faith we see he's our savior he's our healer he's Our Redeemer and now he does reside somewhere else he resides inside of you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost an intimate relationship a Divine Romance that we're coming to more and more that we're not going to be separated from him ever again when we go to our future home what a great thing that we just have a little time down here that he give us to learn more about him and then we go there and we've got an eternity to learn more about him we'll never ever quit learning about our Lord second Peter 1 besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity you may be seated in the Lord as his blessing we'll continue a little bit as we were this morning the Bible says in 1 Timothy 3:16 Says when without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on the world received up into Glory that just pretty much took his whole life that every every bit of that so without controversy we know or without dispute we know as we were talking this morning we know the mystery of God one mystery and what is that great mystery though it's not Jesus 2,000 years ago it's not Jesus in the last Church age it's Christ in you the hope of glory and what we want to do is we've got a theme here at our church and what we've been saying since the first of the uh of the Year whatever you got inside of you let it out if it's good Let it out and show others if it's bad get it out so God can get in but we need to let out and listen raise your hands more shout more that's what you need to let out right cuz this great Plan of Redemption listen there's no greater plan there's plans there's all kinds of things that of you know you got um uh the Zuckerberg and all those that started with Facebook and just a little something on his computer now he's a multi-billionaire and everybody's on Facebook except for my mom and daddy and brother Donnie and some of us troll we look over our wife's shoulder don't we secret cers just be careful I'm one but you know what we like information though we're just just as an Information Age everybody likes information you know it kind of borderlines on gossip but pretty close but but we see that Zuckerberg though had a plan though and I don't think though his plan was to go Global or to go worldwide and it for it just to be a multi-billion dollar company I just can't understand in the end time let me tell you how fooled we are now this ain't got nothing to do with I'm going in this direction right now but you take somebody like Henry Ford now Henry Ford in the early 1900s put together a Model A or Model T what' you do first a or t t t CU cuz the frame look like a t well what happened was he could put all that together like we do a puzzle and he could sell it to the masses of people all right well that was a good and service right there was a hard uh there was a plant my dad used to work at General Motors 100 acres underneath the roof it took you forever to get from one end to the other cuz we'd have open houses and we get to go see them but Henry Ford built a he bought a piece of property and he put a plant there and he put people to work there and he produced a good and sold it to the people and you can see that with your eye you tell me how Facebook got sold for over a billion dollars and it ain't nothing but something on your computer have you not thought about that Google all these different things there is no hard something that you're going to take and sell a service to somebody get some money for it take it back and have this you know this Factory you see how the mind is now you how Satan's got in the mind of people you're buying something you can't even see you're buying something you can't even see show me where Facebook produces all this no same way with the devil that's what he's doing he's throwing all these things in and we have it has no substance remember hell has no Foundation hell has no bottom to I mean it's just keeps going so that's what Facebook and all that is based on the world is based on something they're selling you something you can't see you can't it's not tangible you can't get in it and drive it that's right it's just out here in the air somewhere and if y'all didn't know it the government sells air time did y'all know that since I worked for the federal government I know that they sell airtime what is that is it like this much going through the building like this I mean what so you're you're selling something you don't even you can't it's not tangible but you and I folks let me tell you something when you get to baptism of the Holy Ghost you might not be able to have a hard copy but you got a copy inside of you and that copy inside of you does what it's a good and a service that you give to somebody else they say oh you're full yeah some of you we're all full of it sometimes but I want to be full of God so full of God that he bursts out and it gets on somebody else and it gets on your neighbor and it gets on your co-workers and it gets on the people driving down the road even let's look at this real quick because we're going to talk about this for a minute and and this comes from a question that that came up maybe a couple weeks ago and uh where that somebody online said that um you know that that free moral agency and the message other words without we just don't believe in free moral agency uh you were this predestinated uh you you always were an eagle I believe that but what are you going to do about where brother Brown says you always were wheat but I've got about 16 quotes back there that brother Ram said you were a cuckle bar is that Prophet that confused we are confused if there's any confusion it's us cuz I believe he he believed in oldfashioned Repentance he believed in oldfashioned snots slinging repentance at the altar amen get an experience with God not just come and sit in the church and say well I must be all right cuz I believe that brother brandham was a prophet the devil believes that remember the Bible says the devil believes in one God and trembles that's right the world believes in three Romans 8:28 I kind of broke this down a little bit let's look at this just for a second you may think it has nothing to do with this but it really does cuz listen there's a group of people that he saw come to a stature amen or he' never put it in the Bible to come to the perfecting of the Saints all right by the fivefold ministry by alive God in human flesh speaking to you all right for whom he did what number one for no all right for no means to have knowledge before it happens only God can do that he can see all down your life in just a split second he can see actually several billion people's lives in just a split second because we don't understand God that's right but those he did who he did w for no what did he do then then he did predestinate them everybody with me there to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did what number two go back to number two the ones he did predestinate in other words the ones he fornew that he saw then he predetermined a place for us to be I don't mean a place Lula I'm talking about your place where you're at them also he what called number three and whom he called he justified number four and whom he justified he glorified yes sir all thank God for GR a CE thank God for those five moves of God in your life he fornew you he predestinated you he called you he justified you and if he justified you remember he can't change his mind he's already glorified you what Grace Grace Amazing Grace So for knowledge brother Bram now explains it looks back and says that he foresaw this and knows that the reason he could tell what was the end from the beginning everybody with me and therefore knowing that all these marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness like I said before to be pressurized to be able to stand this to be able to overcome this L outa this the darkest age that ever was he put you in it for a purpose am to make it not to fail God's never failed you and I fail all the time but God doesn't now listen what we need to do like brother Ernie said plug oursel into that plug yourself into that amen we're plugged into the Eternal if we're born again today now let's plug oursel into these virtues and let's start letting God live through our life all these marvelous days that we're living in to stand and witness see we're witnessing what brother randam for for for from 1930 something 40 something till till 1965 when God took him off the scene he prophesied he was a prophet he said this is coming this is coming that's coming this is going to show up that's going to show up this is where the anti do you have a problem knowing where the Antichrist is the world is guessing they think it's the number 666 they think it's Zuckerberg or they think it's it's always rich people it's always rich people either Bill Gates or his wife or somebody's a you know or bezo he's the he's the Antichrist cuz he's got your money and he's a multibillionaire they ain't got one thing to do with it the Antichrist is unbelieving God's word not believing the word of God but it's all going to head into a person though but praise God you and I are not going to be here according to what the prophet tells us all right so see we can praise God for that that we don't have to go looking for an antichrist we don't have to know when he's going to show up he's already here amen everybody with me so now look he w these things and God had to make a preparation for it so he made a way for all of us to get right here where we're at tonight but now let me ask you a question as some are saying in the message of the hour that we came here with this eternal seed and there was no way we could we we just never s I'm with you to a degree but watch this right here let's listen to what a prophet said impersonation of Christianity that's a good one to listen to now how can that come about if God made us look if God made us what we are without us having any knowledge of what was going on talk about this morning what listen to his verbiage listen to what he's saying if God made me a man and put me up at my right age before our death set in for knowledge at about 23 years old I was strong and healthy and if Satan didn't interfere didn't interfere he tried to me remember shot his legs off and all that stuff and shoot me down many things but God seen so in you when you were young and when you were prettyy you women just got old and you men who were young and strong and healthy how you enjoyed being a man and your little companion if God did that without you having any say into it you said make me thus who' take any thought could add one cubic to a stature but if he made you thus without you having anything to say now if you stopped right there you could see where brother Brown would or people would say that God pulled you through a tube because he saw that was it and it the way it's was going to be but watch continue on let's listen without you having anything to say how much more can he through his Beauty brooding give you a choice and you're on the basis of free moral agency you can turn this down yes sir or you can accept it everybody believe brother R was a prophet some of you don't you there's a church over there if you need to go to it I believe that Prophet folks I'm telling you people have lambasted him and shot him down I believe brother R was a prophet of God Amen and I believe his voice is what's going to either take us in the Rapture or condemn us at the day of judgment you got to choose which one to turn it down is to be lost oh choice and remain podt ass calcium petroleum but to accept it and have a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit part of the logos in you controlling your emotions and when he CS to his word look you coupo back and answer to him I got one down here I want you to hold on to your britches you you'll you you just wait way back before there was a light on the earth our bodies laid in the dust amen sure we are made from the dust out of the potass calcium petroleum and Cosmic light God sent forth the great Holy Spirit to brood over the Earth and as he Brew the little flowers began to come up and the birds flew out animals came from the earth and didn't come a man but look and he sinned and separated himself from the fellowship of his God so whatever that God had right here man broke the Covenant so now it's down here that's why God couldn't swear by no greater he swore by himself I'm going to do this plan I made this plan I'm going to see it through I can't depend on this guy to do it everybody with me but where do we put our dependency brother R said back on this guy the one that said I'll do it now look and because of this horrible thing he was commanded by God to return back to the dust of the earth oh Lord God we are so glad that before he returns you have a pro you have promised a redeemer and today since he has come and sent forth the Holy Spirit again and now he's still brooding over the dust our bodies and if he raised me and brought me to what I am now without having a choice now you go whoa wait a minut brother we know what he's bringing the human guy here human guy dust your soul is not dust that's right it's your body and if he raised me and brought me to what I am now without having a choice how much more will he raise us from the dust of the earth after we've made a choice after we've made a choice and he has brewed to us and we brewed back to him that Divine Romance I was talking about this morning we love him now this one right here I want you to hold on to your britches you ready am oh not this one then oh yes it is here we go you ready 1959 brother Brown was still coherent he's Shing you what he was talking about okie dokie it's before the seals but we're good Lord Jesus just as elzar watched that sign on the girl you'll have to watch the sign of the church because Jesus did said I don't care what man said I know men say those days and miracles has passed all this stuff is all passed and gone by no more now you've got to make a choice Jesus said let every word man's word be a lie and mind be the truth now you've got to make up your mind I'm holding that bottom part you've got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a choice tomorrow may be too late watch this God might have chose you to eternal life but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place yeah but I was just great yeah in the mind of God we we have never been not great in the mind of God the Genesis 126 man never fail cuz that's our TI POS that's what the Holy Ghost is it's it's our theophany it's the it's God in us by the Holy Ghost all right but God might have chose you to eternal life let me read that one more time I want you to make sure I'm going to leave it up there so it'll burn but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place I didn't make that up if you want to read it go back to 1959 4:18 a time of decision Los Angeles California that's what the prophet of God said to me when I saw that man that just that just m just nailed put the nail in the coffin as the old saying says you have a choice if you don't want eternal life God's going to give it to somebody who does but remember go back to for knowledge he forew who would and who wouldn't therefore he could predetermined and put it in your path put it in your path to make a decision now back part of God's mind let's go back into there now we got to go back into back part of God's mind that was something he was trying and going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let him be expressed and we remember this morning who is he expressed through he's expressed through us all right he's expressed through US 1 Corinthians 1 17 so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of Our Lord who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 Corinthians 6:9 know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolators we're going to read about this same group in just a minute that's why I'm reading it now we're going to read another scripture talks about this same group of people neither fornicators idolators adulterers of feminite abusers of themselves with mankind if you want look all them up that's not your Sunday school teachers and preachers nor thieves nor Covetous it is now once you get born again nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you are washed you are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit amen of our God Philippians 2:15 that you may be blameless now wait a minute there's a lot of blame right there in verse 9 and 10 lot of blame in verse 9 and 10 but he washes it all way in verse 11 everybody with me thank God for Grace amen amen I claim Grace I told y'all the other day and I will tell you again for some of our friends that are here that had heard listen if you have not had grace extended to you you can't extend Grace to somebody else you'll be a law bider you'll be somebody that looks and and condemns until you get Grace you get Grace in your heart it'll soften you up it'll make you realize what brother Bram say when we get to brotherly kindness one of my favorite quotes he said put yourself in that brother's place put yourself in that brother's shoes or that sister's shoes that's why I told you here we go with A Life Lesson again this may be for the ones in making so if you go to a restaurant don't give the waitress a hard time you just not know you don't know what she's going through you don't know what he's going through be kind to people well they got to be kind that's not what the Bible says the Bible didn't say because I'm kind to you you got to be kind to me or vice versa uh-uh brotherly kindness is loving somebody that hates you hates you it's easy to love somebody that loves you but somebody that totally despises you you love them and you love them with the love of the Lord why cuz you want to see them saved I want to see those people saved and I give them all a 20% tip you can do whatever you want to but I tip them because that's their wages and you know what if they're not having a good day guess what if you were living off of that and you had a bad day would you want somebody to take your wages away from you just go yeah one bad day just a bad day all right that's life lesson number 345 so patience it's not in the Old Testament Moses didn't have patience sure he might had a little bit but patience lack of it's what got him in trouble remember he smoked the rock instead of speaking to the Rock he said you what bunch of rebels you can see the fire in his eyes but in the New Testament through the filter of the Holy Ghost it gives you patience the Bible says in your patience possess ye your soul we'll read that in just a minute we get to it all right statute perfect man let's just keep going you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ in other words we're getting on up here a little bit further we're getting up to patience so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in US listen we always see that we always see people that like Dad always says somebody burn the candle at both ends you know house on the fire and windy day they come up here and they sit on the front row and all they do is they're doing this the whole service where are they 6 months later they're out the door yeah well what did they get they just got happy I wish some of you might try that it might work but don't leave but brother R look we find those things happen you know I know we see these stumbles along the road we find scrap heaps of ministers I mean these are true people this is not just the scum of the earth ministers Christians piled along the road is because they don't go into it right in other words what they got ahead of what the point man all right and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself what a humble man there stood a prophet trying to teach the people knowing he already had these virtues CU he didn't couldn't have them and not teach them to the people and he said and myself and I believe he believed that too all right statute of perfect man patience with what patience with god let's continue on let's try I want to try to get to Godliness if we can we should have patience with one another like I'm tried to get this message over at the tabern acle see that each member of the Tabernacle become this and that's capital th so it's got to be he's pointing at the Statue of perfect man it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this 33 years see have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on it down here have patience Matthew 10 verse 22 he shall be you shall be hated of all men but he that endureth to the patience wins the race tauris in the hair who always wins The Tortoise every book I've read the tortoise always wins doesn't matter if it come out 12 different volumes and in another language the tortoise always wins all right slow and steady wins the race but he that endureth to the end shall be saved endureth is what to remain abide not flee when first thing happens or first thing doesn't go right and and you know we talk about the um in in Matthew where Jesus talks about the sord of the seed some seed they're all they're just in good ground and it's growing up really good and all of a sudden what the cares of the world chokes them out sunshines they have a hard day at work or they have a hard week at work or they're having trouble at home or they're having trouble with their parents are having trou I'm talking about kids too first thing we do is what fle F what is it figh or flee fight or flight let's fight don't fight who you're trying to let's fight the devil the devil's the one that's doing it not your parents or your mom or your daddy or or your brother or sister or your husband or wife it's the devil that we don't like I like what brother uh we always were at Youth Camp there in Alabama with brother um Homer Lor where brother Gary was always the one that he'd stand up and he'd tell us on Friday night he said look he said said you guys we trust the devil we don't all right so that's the same way but look remain abide listen sit still look right there on that beam right above right there you can see it and I can't what's it say be still be still and know that I am God and the word end is the end which all things relay the aim or the purpose in other words this plan has an end into it oh yeah it does we don't need Redemption when we get to heaven we need it to get there yes sir that's the race that's the Run that's the patience that's the virtue knowledge Temperance and all that so let's talk about godliness here for a me for a minute godliness is reverence respect piety towards God godliness for people shall be lovers second Timothy now there's a form of godliness we'll talk about in just a minute men shall be lovers of their own selves this is that same group that I was talking about that he was talking over in Corinthians this is basically the same group pretty much the same words lovers of their own selves selfie sticks wow that guy made a fortune off of that stupid selfie stick go oh whatever men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient the parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection boy we see that now truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hey high- minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness form of godliness everybody with me but denying the power thereof remember power without character is what satanic from such turn away for of this sword are they which creep into houses lead silly women churches Laden with sins lead them away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth let's go back read first Timothy again trying to hurry through this and then we'll get to our thought and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seing of angels preaching un the Gentiles Believing on the world received up into Glory look what brother rown says look so you're moving right on up now we're way on up the line fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godl this mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't find what it meant finally I was down to brother Jeff there we found an in dictionary godliness means to be like God brother Brown what's a change just a change he's pretty much telling yeah he don't he don't elaborate a lot to be like God after you've got but look you got to be like God after you get Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience then be like God you can't be like God like you need to be down that virtue cuz that's trying to figure out what's going on strengthwise and then you got knowledge and all those it's exactly where it's supposed to be brother brandom I can't do that oh yes you can let me read you a few scriptures Matthew 548 what does it say you are Gods why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you do we believe that Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes be therefore p r f e c what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you get way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first and then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things I could say along that that line then he goes to Ephesians 4 and tells us how to get perfect here's part of the plan I kind of took it out of that it was in this morning but you know what Ephesians 4 is he gave some Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for the what for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the body till we all come what to the unity of the faith invisible Union brother Brown says a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God so this is a have to this is required curriculum all right to graduate you got to have this and we'll get into that maybe the next service I want to break down and you say well why are they so important without these number one you can't come to adoption all right without these you can't come to adoption I'm sorry okay and then you see up there where it says holy spirit that brings in an anointing that that's a little bit different than the one you got at the new birth stronger you might say all right God can use you better he can't use you when you're a Babylon baby that's right no you're just trying to figure out how to walk you're trying to figure out how to talk now we've grown up supposed to he has to be like God he honors God he's part of the word of God and in this last days of this bride taking form just exactly look just exactly the same power that he was at the beginning do you believe that have we come to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints 2,000 years ago they had these virtues working in their life that little tug little no has come up through these organizations for so forth and come out for the bride he can't can't be nothing else but that 1 Timothy 6:3 said If any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus and to the doctrine there is a doctrine of godliness listen folks without the message of the hour can't have it you tell me how they going to teach us godliness when they believe in three and once saved always saved and it's all right to do this it's all right to do that you ain't perfect how many of you have witnessed to people and you start telling them about your hair and your dress and you start telling them how I don't smoke anymore I don't curse anymore they say well you ain't perfect and I ain't perfect so they just keep going on smoking their cigarettes thinking that they're born again all right is everybody with me so there's a Doctrine according to godlin and it was a doctrine that the prophet of God brought us he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strife of words thereof whereof cometh Envy Strife railing evil surmising here's these same people again perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds and the destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness oh Prosperity man if you can get a Escalade you got the Holy Ghost if you get the Escalade with all the package you adopt it yeah no you just in a lot of debt and it don't drive no different than a regular car does until you maybe take it to the parts store and have to buy parts for it everybody with me say Amen okay some of y'all that are asleep look look from such withdraw yourself withdraw yourself from that but godliness with contentment wow is great game for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain Zuckerberg is not going to carry anything out and if he ain't born again you know where he's going if you ain't got the new birth guess where you're going okay for we brought nothing in a certain we carry nothing out that word contentment have you ever seen a baby I saw I got a a customer that she just had a newborn and uh she's got two other kids and and man them two kids are just I mean they're a riot they come out to the mailbox and they're just you know I mean they're 90 M an hour but she just had a new baby and she's got one of them things that the baby you know stays right here you put them down in the bag kind of like a kangaroo sack and you know what she's talking to me and that baby you know every time she moves that baby's like this I said is that baby okay she said oh he just ate he's content cuz he's got his mama well that to me listen we can be that in God can you have that much contentment with your personal experience with the Lord that you can lay yourself on his chest and say feed me hold me when I need hold it come on somebody feed me give me something you are my sustainer at this time I'm a baby I need you Lord pile it on give me the Gerbers but give me some of that good milk and man it's okay to drink milk it's all right don't get all upset we do eat meat but that kid if you fed that three-month old baby meat what would happen choke it to death and kill it amen same thing with the gospel you don't shove meat down a baby's throat but now when you get older Texas roadh house here we come h Longhorn well I don't like Longhorns much I'm content at Texas Roadhouse y'all know where I'm not content at but contentment is sufficiency a look a perfect condition of life you say how can I be perfect listen who causes most of our problems would you take your hand and do this right here and do this right here don't point at me point at yourself some of y'all get by with that but I'm my worst enemy I don't know about y'all but a perfect condition of life in which no Aid or support is needed we were just talking about needing support and needing now he's talking about you can get to a place to where you can be content godliness with contentment is great gain a perfect condition of life in which no Aid or support is needed sufficiency of the necessities of life a mind contented with its lot can we do that what did John tell those soldiers I told you about last Sunday what John tell those soldiers he said be content with your wages don't be sitting over squabbling and arguing about stuff I hear some of y'all you you'll quit a job for $10 a week difference in pay you better weigh the cost the whole cost life lesson 375 second Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come they're here they're here we have arrived for men shall be lovers of their own self now this is them same people that we talked about here a few minutes ago let's go on down here cuz I don't want to read them again having a form of godliness so here's the form let's look at this real quick because you know what I was thinking about yesterday Satan has his own perfect statute of a perfect man come on there's twins in every Revival if if you've got if if God's got a place for us to come to Satan's working on his too does he not want power does he not want knowledge he's part he is the knowledge of the tree of good of Good and Evil yeah he's got a temper he just don't want to get rid of it now watch let's see this people though that having a form of godliness brother R said anointed once at the end time other words if he wanted to break it down so we would be more or less understand it better he would say in the last days there shall rise false anointed ones he's talking about false Christ now that seems almost impossible see the terms of anointed but notice the very next words and false prophets p r o p h e TS plural now anointed one is one with a message and the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed makes sense and that would be a prophet anointed now watch him as he carries on down he an anointed ones there shall arise false anointed teachers a form of godliness able to preach this message maybe 20 30 years and then all of a sudden say it's worthless a prophet teaches what his message is you want me read that one more time a prophet teaches what his message is Anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural and if there is such a thing as a Christ singular then these would have to be anointed ones that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because they are anointed ones they're anointed and I'm fixing to read you one that I know you've read it before and you've heard it before that anointing is the true Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost you got in your soul they get it on their Spirit now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they're false that's why it flips some people's lid when when you quote them that quote where brother Brown said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth one day of your life and go to hell you can be anointed by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit realm and your soul be as black as Judith is carried ano once at the end time let's continue on let's get this real quick but remember that Pentecostal Church in the last days was a Leota and Christ was turned out the colonel the itself when he tried remember when he tried to manifest himself in the church now the reason I'm bringing this is the parallel because that's what we're doing now we're manifesting what's inside of us and listen let me tell you something you may fool somebody for years but you hang around this message long enough you going to pop up like a what they call him whacka things you going to pop up like this you got to you're going to manifest what's inside of you that's why I said let it out either good or let it out cuz it's going to show and it's going to embarrass a lot of people when he tried to manifest himself in the church he was took out brother Dale brother Bob brother Aaron Brother Louise myself there's places in this message we can't go preach and they all said thank you oh wait a minute same message really there's places won't let us in because of their Doctrine H anointed it was still a church claimed to be an anointed church but here is the word Christ himself it's what we're trying to get to the son of man yes the son of man can't be deceived that's God in human flesh Jesus was not deceived one day on the face of this Earth he wasn't deceived one second he knew who Judas was he knew who cus was he knew who the ones that were perverting the word of God that's why he would he'd look into the heart was talking to somebody a few minutes ago God God listen God sees your heart not your emotion he fights through all that to get to your heart and he knows what you want God knows in my heart if I die and go to hell I want you to make it and I want to try to help you get in the right path that's the way we all ought to be I'm not here to help myself I'm here to help you I get help seeing you get help but here's the word of God Christ himself that's the anointed word which shall come for the rest of his body the bride so he's not talking about anointed ones now he's talking about me and you the anointed of the same water that watered the wheat as we talked about also Waters the tears I wish that wasn't true because I have a garden most of my weeds look really good and you can't eat them but they get the same fertilizer and they get the same water that I give my corn and my potatoes and my beans Adam Adam sold us out Jesus God said thorns and thistles but we're heading back to where I want a Garden of Eden again look only the elected are predestinated now let's go back to what we were talking about way back will be able to detect the difference between them so you got to have that kind of godliness to tell what the opposite is are you going to be deceived well don't get quiet you will but you don't have to you have a choice we'll be able to detect the difference between them now Ephesians 51 tells you so and about how it was notice the anointed ones only the word will separate them not an emotion they can cry speak in tongues and preach like a house on fire in a windy day but if they ain't got the Holy Ghost in their soul they're lost and you know what has happening the people like the Humes and all these people that are that are turning against the message it's preached for 30 40 years they didn't have it to start with not saying they can't get get it not saying that they might be deceived but if they continue on like they are lambasting the church and lambasting the Bride of Jesus Christ they didn't get the New Birth when they thought they did cuz word won't fight word bride won't fight bride bride sorry about that didn't need to M name names but you know what they name ours so look only the word will separate them not the signs you watch these people that left the message they going to have more signs and wonders than we do cuz they're anointed they're anointed they're the anointed with the same anointing we're we're Anointed with the difference is down inside that TI poost says that ain't nothing but the truth or that's not the truth sure they all prophesied they all done this that and the other sure just the same Jesus said they'd do the same thing thing but the word is what separates them notice not the signs signs follow believers they don't go in front they follow them and knowth it not 1965 why you say these are good people what makes them because one thing they're TI poost is on a church and in here you remember last Sunday a week ago how many was here and heard the sermon on anointed ones he go refers back to that see they are anointed their Spirits are anointed in this second realm he didn't say the b the inside he said the second realm which is what we're talking about memory reason conscious effect and Imagination everybody with me all right wake up Christ mystery got Christ revealed in his own word I'm sorry today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost still today and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God's got but he cannot bring the word word by word he's going to come off somewhere you've got to be able to deser when he does come off but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on false anointed ones or anointed ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel still be a devil you think about that I want you to take that home I want you to mull around in your head God am I deceived is this it is this the message of the hour you better find out whether it is or not cuz you know what the devil had just heard what I said and he's going to be on all of us that's okay that's his job Psalms 4:2 you know what our job is resist the devil and he'll flee from you you don't have to make up no potion you don't have to go do this that and the other say 25 hell marries resis him our worst problem is we don't oh I'm the only one sorry oh ye sons of men how long will you turn my glory into shame well what at this how long will you love vanity and seek after leasing that word leasing means something totally different than what we think it is and I'm going to go get into it but know that the Lord has set apart him that is Godly for himself separated God separated us for him the Lord will hear when I call unto him stand in awe and sin not commune with your own Hearts upon your bed and be still say offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord Psalms 32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin say la this is under bulls and goats for this very for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance let me read that one more time thou are my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble he's given you a promise if you'll just take hold of it Thou shalt Compass me about with song of Deliverance say la let's look at the word Godly now that's a it's a little bit different than godliness because what he going to do it's going to bring it a little more intimate it's going to say if you live Godly now godliness is a word all right but Godly is something you do all right all who live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution so that's kind of Brant now watch the word Godly in the Greek means Theos is that right we have a Greek girl sitting in the back my sweet little daughter-in-law she corrects me when I don't say the Greek words right cuz she's a Greek Theos well see that's God the whatever can in any respect be likened unto God or resembling in any way a stature of a perfect man that's the image of God right and by these virtues and by being Godly we should resemble him abely no I resemble my Mom and Daddy yeah but you don't have to act like them preach brother I believe it will whatever can in any respect be likeing under God or resemble him in any way God's representative look God's representative he's not ashamed to call us Brethren the Bible says he's not ashamed to put you on display he will put this bride on display whether you like it or not somebody will stand and say I've had enough yes sir amen resemble him brother Brown said I won't say what in other words pull yourself so far away from the devil he don't know what to do with you now listen there's a lot of times he knows what to do with us and that's our problem but what about a time when you confuse that rascal you confuse the devil okay how you going to do it refuse him say 20 hell marries and Beads and no refuse him so this is what we're doing we're to be Godly so we're going to read scripture now to be Godly is to resemble God God's representative are Vice Regent of magistrates and judges 2 Corinthians 7:9 says now I re we'll close here in just a second Shake Yourself just for a minute I know it's hot I know we've already ate and I know that uh have trouble staying awake you wouldn't have trouble staying awake if your favorite football team was on TV oh I'm sorry now I Rejoice not that you were made were made sorry but you you sorrowed to repentance for for you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing now watch the now Paul what are you trying to get watch for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of right but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this self-same thing that you sorrowed after a Godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yay what clearing of yourself what indignation yay What Fear what vem vem desire what Zeal yeah what revenge and all things you have approved yourself to be clear in this matter you know what he's saying let me just give you a real short version some of those Corinthians have come to a little bit of perfection and he's seeing that in them and he's telling them right here and all things you have approved yourself to be clear in this matter second Timothy 3:11 persecutions afflictions which came unto me in Antioch ionian Lyra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ shall sit on on a bed of ease shall sit with chicken feathers under their rear end and oh I'm sorry and everything's going to go right all that will live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived second Peter 2:6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into Ash condemning condemning them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with a filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing Vex his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation not to keep from getting into temptation but when you get into temptation he's got a way to get you out of it that's what it saying right here and to reserve the unjust until the day of judgment to be punished Psalms 1:1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit bringeth forth these virtues in due season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment you say whoa now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa they're already judged by being ungodly you're already judged but they have to go to the white Throne judgment right so that's not saying that they're not going to be judged everybody with me you know what that means you your Bible readers look nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish ungodly means Wicked criminal guilty one one guilty of crime Wicked hostile to God Wicked guilty of sin against God or man that's not a good group to be around Romans 55 says the Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the Godly so listen he died for you amen cuz at one time you was in that ungodly group oh no I always was no you were dead you were a sinner on your way to Hell brother brandham said he was a sinner on his way to Hell amen none good no not one only one perfect man that was Jesus Christ everybody else is lost and with without God you didn't come to this world with a silver tape player in your mouth I didn't want to say that but I did where you just pop it in and I believe the message I know I know where that quote is I know what's going on out of this now you were dead the Bible said you were dead and trespassing Sins Not excluding anyone cuz see I like to believe it that way therefore I know that my Redemption comes from me being lost totally lost dead on my way to hell but God who is rich in Mercy he looked down and saw me that one day he would call and I would answer I'd forget that former life Paul said the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God he must have lived a different life why was he persecuting Christians if he had eternal life in his his old I don't understand that when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die remember that's why he told the Pharisees they said why are you hanging around Sinners and prostitutes and people that are sick he said well people don't need a physician he said sick people need a physician that's why I come yet pre- adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die but God commandeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies oh I never was an enemy of God when you was born from your mama you was an enemy from god let's just get hey level the playing field for if when you were enemies yet when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son Much More Much More being reconciled we shall be saved by his life not mine amen everybody with me godliness to be like God Godly is your acting like him all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution but oh listen folks everybody wants in this world everybody wants their one moment of Fame right everybody wants their one moment that the whole world just stops cuz I'm the best looking guy I got the biggest muscles I got the tightest dress I'm talking about men ain't that right they going to have to quit doing gender reveals they can't do that no more you got to wait till the kid gets five or six to decide what he is a boy or a girl or it is a boy or girl see how stupid this is see how dumb see how Satan has just barely just put a little bit in all down through time and then all of a sudden here we are we've got this genetics and we've got this and we know that this person H whatever but anyway all that live Godly in Christ will suffer persecution you can have your one moment of Fame everybody likes to be important that's what it's telling the brothers and sisters it's brother Brown said the greatest thing what is to have your name called so that's why I like to call names of people when they come to church here that we don't know I like to call their names because they're important and it's not just doing it for show I'm doing it because God brother through brother brandham said call their name that's what they like to hear oh no you know you get all these people that are oh oh no I don't liar liar remember they told Brother Brown said oh no brother Brown you you know don't brag on me he said he said no he said I like to be bragged on all right so let's just get rid of all that junk and you do like your little moment of somebody acknowledging that you're in the congregation or that you're a pastor or that you're some or got some title and um and I like to do that because God's going to call you he's called your name already amen and if you responded to that name that's all you need to worry about if you responded when he called your name yes sir that's the only thing you need to worry about but the world is looking for their one moment of Fame they'll get it just for about that much then they'll going to hell but you and I we've slid down into this Earth we're not going to be somebody that we we're not going to the White House and and and well today we've got a message Believers and they're going to be taking over the capital uh they're going to be sitting with the president I hope not and uh no we're not going to do that sitting right here today greatest honor you'll ever have not in front of me I'm going back in in a church with the Holy Ghost anointing people and having a church service give me that above anything the Lord knows my heart above anything that's going on in this world yeah there's favorite places we like to go as human beings but why wouldn't you'd rather want to go to church than anywhere else anywhere else pick me a place that a Christian would rather go than church I said a Christian I was talking to brother Ronnie long yesterday you know I've always said brother Claude told me and I don't mean to hurt your feelings but I know some of you can't get here on Wednesday night but it is true I want you to listen to what I'm saying you know I always said that uh um everybody comes to church on Sunday morning everybody and afternoon service it kind of thins out a little bit then Wednesday night it's real thin brother Ronney long he said a preacher told him one time he said okay he said the people that come to your church on Sunday morning and fill the pews up they like church the people that fill the pews up on Sunday afternoon love the pastor the people that come on Wednesday night love the Lord well I throw your Tomatoes at me then I don't care Wednesday night to me the overcoming night and I know listen I know brother K brother you know that y'all

who said that my wife oh okay Regina what did you point out her for all right kind of get you awake a little bit but listen where'd you'd rather be you can put every excuse in the world you want it's the Devil he's trying to stop you from getting here to get something from God I'm not the prophet told us he didn't say just well you know come when you want to he said when them doors open he said there's something in your heart that you can't wait to get in here brotherly kindness gets quiet when we start talking about church and tie dresses and on men brotherly kindness let's read this just for a minute then we'll then we'll close God bless you I love you know I love you I want us to make it I want us to be a super Church not church building I want us to be a super Church brother ra called us a super Church us the bride a super church with a super sign with a super God we don't need a Superman yes sir you know what Superman got killed by cryp tonight one time I got killed by your

knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity read this real quick get ready for musicians to come we know that word means Philadelphia the word Philadelphia means brotherly love love of the Brethren look love of brothers or sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren H also means there's Philadelphia in the Greek love as Brethren loving brother or sister in a broader sense loving one like a brother loving one's fellow countrymen of an Israelite of a Christian loving a Christian here's what the prophet said about this after you've done come from here to here to here to here to here I believe he's pointing up the statue perfect man now you're coming into the full stature now of a Son of God but you got to have this plus all this and you can't even start unless you get this all right now remember the black bird with the peacock feathers don't forget him see don't try to add it till you're actually born again cuz see it won't work and you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine Born Again Dove he's talking about right down there at Faith not up there down here this down here is the new birth this is an anointing everybody with me this is a special anointing this is the new birth then all that is ADD too all right real quick but when you get down here a genuine Born Again Dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you see comes on up all right come into Perfection now all right then sixthly sixthly let's add the Bible said add Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the sixth seven all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me Peter said shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Jesus said no 70 times 7 which for those of us that that that graduated from Banks County that's 490 that's right 4 90 kind of interesting that it took four taking 490 years for Israel to be restored does it kind of interesting 70 * seven brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him go anyway somebody said not long ago said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assembly of God Wess all the rest then put see brotherly kindness what was what was the his son said brother Billy Paul said the greatest thing he about now everything he saw about his dad he was with him since he was a kid he saw healings he saw eyeballs being made feet be straightened out the word of God being preached and the manifestation of the of the uh you know the M read not reading the minds but the thoughts and intents of the heart he said the greatest thing about my dad was he said he said I never knew who dad's enemies or his friends were he said he treated them all the same I ain't there yet you ain't either but we're getting there if he can do it yes I can do it cuz I got the same Holy Ghost it's just what the desire I have to want it remember is still a choice hoping someday see patient with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what is virtue and yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in see brotherly kindness the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 seven things look then now you're coming let's stand our feet come on musicians now you're coming what you're coming to something we're going to read a bunch about what Jesus said about brotherly kindness he said love your brother and love your neighbor as you love yourself okay as you love yourself like I said before I've got two neighbors that are gay love the sinner hate the sin that's right and you know what they've asked us more about the message that we believe believe than our other neighbors have that are supposed to be good Baptist or good Methodist people are searching for things and let me report to you something being gay don't mean you're going to hell if you stay that way yes if you repent and baptize in the name of Jesus Christ with remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and you won't do that no more the things I used to do I do them no more why I got something else motivating me amen I used to love the things of the world I love to go to other places I love to go to sports places and and do stuff like that loved it passionate about it didn't miss a game that's why I don't miss a church service I'm changed let's sing a song God

like to drive a new car not one smell no miles don't have to worry about it breaking down sister Barber everybody likes new I like new revelation if my car gets me here that's okay but we all like new so when we say new that ought to spark something in your heart I want to be a new creation I want God to show me something new remember you can't eat off of the off of the Mana from yesterday you got to eat off of the Mana from today and then tomorrow you got to eat off the Mana for tomorrow or for that day that you're at not for back here that's the same way with me and you to go up this statue of perfect man you've got to realize that he's making you new he's putting a new something you put whatever you want to and he's doing a new work that you've never had done in your life cuz a revelation is something new it wouldn't be a revelation if it wasn't it' just be whatever you are I mean like today you had to believe Sister Barbara was having trouble this morning with her battering still having a little bit I hope that's all fixed no we're going to pray that it does but you had faith that your car get you to church you had faith that your wife picked out the right color clothes

grayhead he's not going to have to have shots that's right he's in God's hands now and he'll be in heaven cuz all babies go to heaven amen see you look at it that way and you think man that always said he said many people think a it was a cruel God that in the Old Testament he would tell Joshua and them kill them all kill the babies kill the women kill the men God commanded them to do that right right God said Joshua you go you all the can kill them all kill them all well if you look at it that way he's a cruel God if you look at it another way he saved all them millions of babies they'll be in heaven if they' grown up to be big am malachit God had already cursed him malachit and he would have sent them all to hell but he let that happen like I said before think of the people that's been good to you that's been tragic Ally killed or or or something happened to them God's going to give them eternal life because of you so why let them hang around here why make them go through a tribulation folks you ain't seen nothing yet it's going to be hard you talk about shooting this nation when God leaves this nation with us out of here they going to be killing each other right and left uh that thing in Louis in Louisville is um not even blip on the radar compared to what's coming but if you'll make a choice today you will not have to be there we might see a little bit
