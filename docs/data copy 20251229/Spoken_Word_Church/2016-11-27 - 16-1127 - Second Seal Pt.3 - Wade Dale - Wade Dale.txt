========================================

that in push that chair in brother um Luis is on his way back you know his U mother law passed so they didn't got the funeral done and the Dad's doing okay so they're coming on back but they're in Pennsylvania um on the way back home so uh and Bob is in Mobile because their family had Chris uh Thanksgiving down there so and then brother Boyd sick remember him this morning Ryan's in there doing Sunday school so we got about got everybody but brother Joe my my old oak tree back there he's here with me so if I fall out he can take over see God always got somebody that can take over old oak tree and not saying old because the old I just mean the old oak tree right but you are a little bit older than most so that's okay you living on bar time too yeah about two years worth but that's good the Lord's good to us you know I was think back in the back in the 50s that a man didn't live till like 47 or 48 years old I mean I'm living a b time then 47 48 years old I mean that's that's horrible really but now we got people living in their into their 80s and and doing well so that's good so let's talk about this though so we can get out of this time element thing and get into eternity where the uh where we don't have to worry about age and time won't matter anymore we listening to view the way up here kind of reminded me that that uh we're so much a creature of time to we everything is on a time right everything everything's on time time we got to have time this time we got to make time for this when time won't matter anymore it's going to have to be a revelation because this thing here's got to be changed if it's not changed then we're still looking at time but boy when this thing changed we have no time no time element to look at so Revelation 6 now we went through the first seal now do everybody really I want everybody to really understand that first seal has several points that we want to look at and we're not looking at the negative part the reason we're not looking at the negative part is that I was reading in some of my notes that this Revelation this one God Revelation destroys any Antichrist Spirit you listening to me yeah any and every Antichrist spirit is annihilated when you get a true revelation of one God not that Jesus is a second person of a trinity not that he's two Lords me and Daddy was talking about yesterday you know we um the same brother that preached to two Lords came out with a son of man Ministry but he didn't take it to the bride he only took it to brother brandham and Jesus and look where it led to it led to his two Lord Revelation I'm I'm telling you if you have if you have a if you have a a Ministry or if you have um a thought process and it goes in a certain direction and it takes you into something of error then that's that Antichrist Spirit cu the Antichrist spirit is not cursing drinking smoking running around and doing the things of the world no Antichrist spirit is is one word off you shall not surely die he was quoting God verb him except for one word cuz God said Thou shalt surely die he just put the word not in there Satan did so that Antichrist Spirit was so close and look I I want to be so dogmatic but look how close it was it deceived Adam and Eve in a better condition than we're in right right yeah yeah Adam and Eve were were Sons and Daughters of God Adam was a ruler of the earth he moved trees he moved Tre he he did whatever he wanted to do he was the god this earth now remember he wasn't deceived but Eve was and he went with Eve deception showing that that thing so close that it'll May deceive the very elect then the prophet of God tells us in the church age book that frankly that God's going to have to really cut this thing short cuz as Dad and I were talking about yesterday you look at how much more you say well there's more people coming in the message well how much are coming in under a false how many's coming under a false Ministry well that's false yes I don't care if you fill up a message church with 5,000 people if it's a false message what good is it it's just like a Baptist and a Methodist and Pentecostal right right that's why it that one revelation of one true and living God the true revelation of one true and living God will destroy the Antichrist Spirit that's in you I said that's in you because it motivates you all the time that's right right you look at it motivating a whole world of people that believe uh trinitarian Doctrine and would fight you over and they're going to they're going to kill us or put us out of business not business but put us out of church saw a thing yesterday where and I don't know how this came up I don't know but I was I was on one of my beef forums with on Facebook and this thing pops up and this this man is now trying now watch how this is this man is he put a picture of Joel Olstein everybody know who Joel Olin is multi-millionaire yes got a a multi-million dollar Church yes 15,000 people go to his church and he lives in a like a 32,000 ft mansion that's right he don't pay any taxes that's right wow the church don't pay any taxes that's right that's what the whole move is now is to all these people with all these billions and millions of dollars in organized religion they're going to start taxing them mhm they're going to start making them pay taxes or they're not going to let you pay tith on it I mean let you take take your tithe off of your off of your they're going to TI that money you tithe with they're going to tax it that's exactly what it's coming to so you see now watch that's what that Antichrist spirit is doing he's bringing it right in and look he's he's working in secular I mean not secular he's working in Independence he's not working in Baptist Methodist Pentecost and all that he's working in Independence old's an independent he's not a Baptist or Methodist whatever that's true um Jensen Franklin he's he's a um we call he's he's independent he has no Baptist Methodist Pentecostal affiliation he's you watch him go after those Independents first cuz all the Baptist is going to do is like that guy up in gainville said the other day uh Bill coat I'll call his name because he shouldn't be preaching in the Baptist Church he shouldn't be preaching in any church he said oh if the Baptist Church tells me I have to marry a gay person then I'll marry them he said I'll do what the church well you know what you know what he should have said I'll do what the mother Church tells me to do yeah but now thank God there's another one there in Gainesville he's Dr Tom Smiley and he's at Lakewood Baptist and he said I'll never marry gay I don't care he said God didn't God told you not to do it right I don't care who tells you to do it so see that man may make a stand he may make a stand and he may have to give his life for that St that's right right but somebody that says well I'll just do what the mother church or what the you know the Baptist Church tells me to do they tell me to marry gays I'll marry gay and he said that on radio wow so you know he made his he made his public outcry so brother you know Tom Smiley comes in says well I'm making mine I'll never marry cuz he said it's against the Bible not what man says it's against the Bible it's not what rulership says it's against the Bible right so that's what we're coming down to and you know what it's coming from it's coming from these seals it's coming from a revelation of what's going on with the bride of Jesus Christ is what it's affecting everything in the world yes everything in the world is affected by me and you because you know what bomb can't fall that's what I talking about t you you got to take I'm going talk to you today okay fear take fear away there's one thing for sure everybody's talking about well Trump's got his finger on the nuclear thing and Putin can drop a bomb any minute the prophet of God prophesied told us not one bomb will hit this Earth nuclear bomb will hit this Earth while the bride's here so you know what I take that and when somebody ever says anything about that I just move it over and put it in trash can cuz I got to believe I'm a prophet I got to believe that God through a prophet spoke says don't worry about the atomic bomb okay I ain't worried about that going off not while I'm here it may be coming and it may be fired when we get out of here but it won't hit this in other words what am I saying I'm not going to be affected by it you're not going to be affect if you're bride in Jesus Christ you're not going to be affected by an atomic bomb so don't worry about these dirty bombs and all that stuff because you got to remember what a prophet said and that's why God sent a prophet like brother Dale was saying the other day you have to realize one thing God God sends prophets for three three things remember when he was talking about in church ages what he comes he brings a message he absolutely has a message if you turn it down well let's look he got a message if he turns it down what judgment that's right right but now if you receive it it's what Mercy right it's Mercy right it's judgment to one and mercy to the other remember I preached about the the spirit of Elijah that's why God had to bring that Spirit of Elijah because he could handle two sets of of women our churches the widow woman says I'll make the last cake and give it to Elijah Jezebel said I ain't have nothing to do with him he's a thorn in my side I'm going to have him killed well which one ended up it was Mercy to the widow woman that's it was judgment to Jezebel okay so you see what we're looking at here is the same with the prophet of God when he come in the end time to preach as we were kind of discussing yesterday or day before yesterday if this is the apex of the message of the hour then this is the the realm that brother randam said he wor had never worked in a spiritual realm as this realm before now you go back to John the Baptist John the Baptist was the greatest Prophet right of the Old Testament coming down Jesus said that's right there's no greater than John but the least in the Kingdom now we know that but he let's stop it right there he said there's no greater Prophet than John John preached for 6 months and had zero healing C campaign mhm zero brother BR said he did no Miracle that's right the Bible never records him doing one Miracle no that's right all he done was what he do he preached the gospel he was that John he was that Elijah the come that what gave Mercy to the people that accepted Jesus Christ and judgment to herodia and all the other ones of course he got his head cut off for that but that was still his message right he walked right up and said her you ain't supposed to have that woman married and divorce is that why it's called a double-edged sword because it's one word that's correct two things that's correct it produces judgment it does it produces judgment but it produces Grace that's right see because the Judgment of this United States of America is because they turned down the prophet's message he came from this country he was from here American right he was one of ours right but they're going to receive judgment before anybody else because they took the the um condemnation or rejected him but the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to come out from all over the world and we're going to accept him and we're going to be harbored in sure we may have a tough time but we're going to be harbored by what that Prophet said not one bomb will fall till the bride's gone so see now that don't mean we might miss a meal or two or we might have to you know be put in the C so what big deal that's right we won't be eaten by lions do what we won't we won't be eaten by lines right that's good you never know he say it says here in Luke no Prophet is accepted in his own country that's right that's right that's what Dad and I were talking about the other day you take and we're kind of off the subject but still we got to we got to expound on what the prophet brought he came and and you can take Jesus's life and his life and parallel it right to the te cuz Jesus said I've come to my own and my own has received me not what he come to the house of Israel right brother random came to the what the Pentecostal that's right that's right and what did they do they rejected him what did the Pharisees and the and the Israelites do they rejected Jesus you can bring it right down and you see but look at Jesus Jesus spoke and said my words are are eternal life and all these things well one group turned him down one group on the day of Pentecost rose up and that's why we have Christianity around the world because of that 120 in the upper room it's kind of hard to to realize that but that's where the that's where Christianity came from no one knew there wasn't no internet or telephone or TV or whatever there was 120 people in that upper room that got the Holy Ghost the 3,000 outside okay so you got 3120 people they got the holy ghost in a day there and they went out and spread whatever we see of Christianity that's exactly where it came from all right so we must we we've took the foundation brother Brown took us back to the foundation but he act he built that thing up and remember that Capstone this love that's the main point of the seal is that the love of God brought this to us to get us out of here amen it was sealed up people would probe at it and look at it and some of them would hit parts of it but missed most of it well see that's the devil you can't miss the word of God and be God you can't you cannot miss all of God's word and and and be of be of the devil if you get all the word right but if you just get you can preach hey man they people in this message I've heard them preach and preach like a house on fire and a windy day really enjoyed it two month two months later brother was sleeping with a 14-year-old girl in his church well that happened 10 years ago he's done been in prison out and everything so wow but he was good he was a good preacher just right up here in South Carolina heard him myself a couple of times did a real good job wonderful job gifts and callings are without repentance that's right gifts and callings are without repentance so we have to watch and see that not all Israel is Israel but when we come down to these seals there's only one group of people going to get it all one group of people's going to get all of it and it can't be those that hadn't heard any of it that's true right it can't be that this is not going to come to you just sitting in a swing in your front on your front porch That's right right it's got to come through a through Ministry because the Bible says the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints to me this is for the perfecting of the Saints so we get this first seal finished true justification now not to say the other one's false now remember brother ROM explains that because the Bible says the faithful and true witness not that he was a false witness but remember you and we use the we use the slang and it's not really but we say well you know well that just that just Rings true to my heart well not that it was false it was so true it had a it just had an Essence about it that was more than anything you'd ever heard it wasn't that it was false and become true because Jesus Christ the faithful and true witness there was no time he wasn't true that's right it was always true but brother R explains that and uh in the seal but the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God that's Revelation 3:14 all right so that's same way with this this is this is the true revelation of God coming to you and I and we should um reverence it and try to study it because it's it's not it's not something that we need to lightly go over but true true justification is the real you didn't do it right the real you never did it okay and I want to try to get into that one day about the the dividing of the Soul and Spirit but we'll do that long time from now justification one God Revelation see if we don't get that one God Revelation right that's your foundation right see they had it right why they were the foundation they had it right they didn't have a trinitarian Doctrine they didn't have a two Lord they didn't have a Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan well we you saw people had ideas of that but when they built that Foundation to this church on the revelation of one true and living God the Son of God on this rock I'll build my church that's what he built it on what happened is is down through the church ages man man got in and started putting little ideas and little this and well maybe he wasn't or it looks like he was a second person or it looks like this looks like that that was man's idea but what's got to happen is is that that is got to come back the faith of the fathers has to be restored by a profit then bring the seals it's very true for from 47 to 1963 brother R was just building the church back up right just like Elijah when the prophet prophets of baale he called him on Mount carel and said call on you God I give you all day I give you all week you got all and what happened they jumped on top of the altar so much so if you'll watch the Bible says when they got finished Elijah put the altar back together he had to restore the foundation before God could come down and take that sacrifice read your Bible it's a perfect perfect perfect perfect that Ministry of Elijah had to be used because that's the perfect way that the same thing happened with brother Brandon the prophets of baale mhm denominational ideas the prophets of Baal tore the tore the true worship down altar pour the altar down but somebody had to come back and build it back up put it back together so that Ministry of Elijah is a Ministry of what restoration restore the faith of the fathers okay then bring his message which is this okay okay he was he says I'm making a way for someone to come he just didn't know he was the one at that time God had probably hid it from him and I'm sure he did God don't tell you prophets everything remember that's right right right he has it has to be revealed to him and then when he comes up to that first seal and he's getting ready to make a mistake and we already ready that where he said I'm going to I was going to make a horrible mistake when God took that what he had preached and said no that's not right but this is it well he knew right then that he was working in a realm that he never worked before cuz God himself was directing him where to go all right so there was another horse now we got he's got off a white horse now he's got on a red horse cuz he's got these people believing what he say all right he's getting off that white righteous church and letting them ride on that white righteous Church is still here today right right they think they're right that's right right all right so then he gets on another horse that was red and power was giv him that set on to take peace from the earth now you can say that's natural and spiritual peace because you know what if you have peace with God it's when you have a revelation when you know where you're at you have peace with God when you don't know where you're at you can't have peace with God that's right all right oh sure we got things that fight us and get us on the outside man or the spirit of us but that inside Soul once that thing's locked in this right here once that thing's locked in that lion l i o n lion of the tribe of Judah no fear a lion has no fear right so you got to get that Fear Factor out of them so power was giv him to take peace from the earth what he do he starts in a Doctrine yes right and that they should kill one another now we know that that physically happened because remember the first three ages typed the first seal right right we went through that already the second seal types this age right here that long Church age where 68 million Protestants were killed by the Catholic Church on their own records so what is killing killing one another right right and there was given unto him a great sword what a word right that's so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible right all right excuse me so now let's take our symbols when we come up to this second seal what Beast is this Beast here the second beast says come and see it's the ox cuz you got lion ox man and Eagle now you say what is that that is the Holy Ghost what Brother D and I were talking about the other day the only reason that we can be the fullness of the godhead B is we have everything that's right that's right Paul couldn't be the fullness of the godhead B he was in the lion age lion age right okay cuz it's promised that we have an needle age that's right brother Bob asked me something other day he said well why so I said Bob the Bible says he can't do that God can't do things that he wants to do because he the words already said he can't do that okay don't you think Jesus wanted to come back okay brother R said he he said he could have raised as soon as he died that what he said that's right Jesus could have raised as soon as he died but he was barred by scripture that he had to be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights right that's right so he was barred by that scripture it wasn't that that that he was well I got to wait well no he had a job to do that's right there's other scripture to be fulfilled it's not like that God well see now God's not one up the son of man left the Earth right right that's right in the Ascension the son of man left the Earth the flesh God left the Earth that's right now he's not coming back as son of man his listen to me his flesh till the Millennium but he's got to come back in your flesh to take us to his flesh CU we'll have a body like unto his glorious body Brother Ray that's what connects us together see all right but the Son of God never left the Earth right son of God's a spirit God Son of God is from the foundation before the foundation of the world right that's right when you say son of God it's not Jesus that's right the flesh man that's right that's son of man but the Son of God that's why I I really enjoy what brother Dale was bringing out because that's no one has ever understood the son of man Revelation until this end time why because we have the lion ox man and Eagle we have everything that we need the word has been open once these seals were open there's no other word to be open right none zero cuz if this takes us to the change of the body all the rest of it is commentary what's going to happen after we get body change that's right you hear me commentary not Revelation cuz we know one thing for sure when we get leave this earth and go over into another dimension see that's why that's why brother Brown couldn't take his body to the sixth Dimension that's why we're here that's why we're barred here by this remember brother BR had went to the sixth dimension but he looked back in his but why why did he have to say that God had to show me and you one things for sure that's what's holding us here that body he said I turned around looked he said I was moving on the bed that was his flesh his flesh didn't go in the sixth Dimension no cuz he has not reached immortality there's only one man the son of man is the only one that could go in and come back out right cuz remember he died Rose ascended come back remember he said don't touch me yet I have not ascended he went up and come back live for 30 40 days on the earth and then went out of here now he's working in me and you but we have everything now that we need to be the fullness of the godhead by true Paul's a part of it right but Paul didn't have a revelation that you got that's right John even John saw all this but he's just writing he's writing a commentary exactly all right and I want you to understand thing it's not that we're not trying to do away with the Bible but we understand once our B's changed what's going to happen we're going to a wedding supper it's real plain what I'm saying is we're going to wedding supper and we don't have to know the details that's right we're going to live a thousand years the Bible says in the Millennium where the son of David is going to rule and Reign all right that's common to us right that's right so what are we waiting on we're we're waiting on number one Resurrection first we're not waiting on body change first we got to get them people out of the ground first then we take a body chain that's right we what you're alive and remain that's right shall be caught up together with them so the resurrection is next the body change is not next we don't get a body change till later on the Bible we got to get them out of the ground first once we get them out of the ground see then then then like said cendy the fear goes the fear goes away when I can see somebody that's walked with me walking in a glorified body I'm going to know real quick uhuh brother r that that old arthritis is fixing the leave and that gray hair is fixing to leave and that that we've lost is fixing to leave all right so see we now what fear would you have bring a gun bring an atomic bomb throw something at me I don't care it ain't going to bother me I think C is going to give us the faith I think that's where where yeah I think that's going to trigger now we going to have it and be waiting right but that's going to trigger that one last little right well Hey listen if we can stand and say dead from Paul to today come out of the Grave okay right don't you think you can't stand there and say all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me yes whatever I say that's what will happen that's right cuz it says what you say it don't put a stipulation on it says what you say that's right so that's what's bringing that's what's keeping them in the grave now is is we haven't come to that we haven't got rid of that fear factor of walking out in the graveyard we don't have to walk out in the graveyard we'd be preaching here and just a Revelation strike a group of people and the dead will come Among Us that sixth Dimension will open up and they'll just walk right straight in here right see how glorious this is I mean that's why I said about these seals that you can sit here for years and just preach on one seal right here what does red mean in in most of our terms that means killing and something bad but in our spiritual walk it's the greatest thing that could ever happen that's right amen amen red on red is what white we take the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from what all sin all sin all right so we see that red now is we have the one of the four beasts says come and see that's the ox that was the longest Church age the ox is a labor he's not real fast but what he's steady a word was given to the people not just one man say gives it to the people the people's one that take the the message to take peace from the earth and look at the termoil I mean not just naturally there's there's natural turmoil on the earth anyway but look at the spiritual turmoil everybody's got spiritual turmoil we don't know whether we're going to do this one we you know this one's going to do this and this one's going to do that we don't know about this one I'm talking about in the message I a't worried about them people out there no I'm worried about the turmoil of the of the um Pharisees that are standing in the door and not letting their people go in their people want more and the Pharisees standing at the door not letting them and they won't go in now I'm quoting your scripture okay and guess what that happened in Jesus's time and I want you to give you one little key while brother Dale was preaching if the son of man Ministries to come back on the earth I said if I'm asking you a question if the son of man Ministry is supposed to be here on Earth at the end time all you got to do is that's why he's telling us to read Matthew Le and John right that's what happened while the son of man was here acts is the Son of God through Corinthians not that's the Son of God Revelation that's what they built the church on but Matthew Mark Luke and John is what happens when the son of man's on the earth now if he's got to come back again in the end time the same identical thing got to happen now we saw it in part with brother Brown he fulfilled a lot of that but the bride has got to fulfill all of that three and a half year Ministry okay that's why I said we've got three and a half years or now we've only got three years to 2019 so we're I think we're in that Ministry that we need to get something out of that three and A2 years or 3 years now since October be 3 years I still believe something's going to out in 2019 I don't know what it is but I just um It's Kind kind of funny it is funny it really is but um we have a church credit card we have a credit card for us and then we have two debit cards they all run out in 2019 every one of them does every one of them Runs Out in 2019 so do they run out in 2019 told you that's just that's to me that's people people preach about stuff like that I'm not going to preach about something like that but but it is kind of odd when you look down and go what's going happen here 2019 they figure out something going to happen in 2019 by that time we should know what's going on you'll have the word in this word yeah that's correct mine is 2020 what that mean let's continue on you ain't going to make it s there went out another see what I mean you can start doctrines like that and people get you'll get a complex I wasn't worry a thing about it I was just looking the other day and I was thinking about 2019 and I just looked down at one and I bought something online the other day for Daddy from church and I looked down at it and it said 2019 and then I looked down and I said the debit card says 2019 and I looked at the credit card it says 2019 I just praise God that we don't have no debts when we get out of here right the debt was paid at Calvary amen that's what that was amen so you see the symbolism that Satan's using he's using the same symbol to kill you with mhm Jesus is using the same symbol to kill you with hello cuz all you got to die R and this tells you that the U Is Dead Redemption starts with the three letters that's right Redemption starts with three letters r e d so it's Redemption pretty good yeah that's Prett good wow woo here finish that was good no that's really good cuz you look at words like that and you see that's why Redemption starts with red you're not going to ever be redeemed Until you realize that the blood of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago that fell on this Earth not just a literal blood no no no no no no that literal blood was washed away and the Roman um soldiers just washed it down the the drain like every other blood that was there it was the life that was in that man that's right and we know that he gave that red blood that had the life in it for me and you well he didn't do it for you he did it for me excuse me did it for me well you got yeah well you say excuse me he did it for me I don't know about you he did it for me so there was another horse that was red so now we're going to we need to change our um thought process a little bit to where a white righteous church has now turned into a killing Church a church that kills kills by what surely kills by the regular sword but also kills by sword is always a word in the Bible right excuse me sword is always the word in the Bible all right so but look what was given to him who give it to it the people the power of the people in that age gave the Roman Catholic Church the ability to go out and kill 68 million people I mean you just can't just do that on your own you just can't I mean my heaven 68 million that's a third of the United States of America wiped out in a thousand years 68 million I mean wow that's to me that's staggering that they could go out no Authority stepped in and stopped that's what I'm that's what I'm trying to say that was so much ingrain that the people just said well okay yeah well I killed 50,000 people today well okay it was all in the name of religion it was all in the name of mother the mother Church you know mother church is what is what killed them spiritually all right so they should kill one another now let's go to Matthew and read what it said in Matthew and uh 24 verse 6 and you'll hear the same thing cuz remember the four and five was the first seal Jesus preaching the seals he's preaching the seals that John is going to write about Jesus is telling you what's going to happen before it even happens for nation you you shall hear I'm sorry verse six and you shall hear wars and rumors of wars now what does a war do a war kills I've never seen a war anybody have a war that somebody didn't die and something red didn't come out of their body you understand what I'm saying so war is red killing and rumors of Wars in other words war and War to come all right see that you be not troubled remember if you're not troubled that means you don't fear that right okay you know what our problem is we fear that boy called death and I say boy cuz it's not a man that Boy Called Death we fear that something's going to happen and it's going to take us out of here why why why you should never fear death that's right well you going to be separated from my loved ones you got more over there than you do here that's right that's right you got more family members over there they had a big Thanksgiving feast the other day we just have a little small one with our family but that's the family you're going to live eternity with right and I'm poting like that but they're just right there in another faster place right beside of us that's why you got to listen to what the prophet say I'm still working on Dimensions but I haven't got it right where I can bring it where I can prove a lot of things cuz I don't want to just throw stuff out I don't want it to be circumstantial evidence we know how that we know how that worked out so I don't want to have circumstantial evidence sometimes you have to use it every once in a while but you never can win a case with circumstantial evidence but brother randam said that they're just 20 ft away at a slant now when he went across the curtain of time he was in the sixth Dimension right right now watch what he asked the angel he said I want to see Jesus what did the angel say you can't see him because he's higher in other words he's 20 more feet away from you at a slant but he's in a faster Dimension he's right there you don't know I mean my Heavens Jesus was watching over the whole thing amen so you see you you watch what brother Brown says and you and you show it shows he definitely knew about Dimensions he knew what was going on all right be not troubled for all these things must come to pass that's right so they got to happen that's right we can't stop what's going to happen that's right it's going to happen that's true these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against Nation kingdoms against Kingdom that should be famines pestilence earthquakes and D places now we know for sure that these seals are going to literally open during the tribulation period right we know that right those two prophets are going to have control of a lot of these things but you going to have Nation Rising against Nation read read Revelations thought I read it the other day Revelations where is it where the um Babylon is bombed and killed you know they're going to they're going to drop a bomb on the Vatican in one day it's going to be destroyed so the Bible tells you that nations are going to rise up against Nation well you see that happening now right yes did you see the other day where that we I'm talking about we the United States found the largest deposit of oil in Texas 50 something billion barrels that would last us for hundreds of years if we just got it all out oursel and used it well you don't think the Middle East people watching that stuff we start pulling away from their oil guess what's going to happen they're going to get mad they going to start what a war to put us right back over there watch everything happens when we start pulling thing out everything out the war you got to go back to the Middle East everything's got to go back to the Middle East everything that's right cuz that's where it's all going to happen that's right earthquakes there happen so many earthquakes in Oklahoma now and in Arkansas they're having them almost daily you know why they figured that out the other day I read it on the Internet it's got to be true it was on the news it's got to be true it was on Clinton News Network I mean CNN all that fracking they're doing all that digging see now they don't go straight down but they're Drilling and I'm I'm going to end right there cuz we'll talk about second next Sunday but they're drill they don't drill down anymore they drill at an angle and when they get to a spot they can't that they need to loosen it up they put a bomb down there and they Frack it that's why they call fracturing that's why it's called fracking it's fracturing the ground well hey if you fracture the ground that's been there for millions of years right and it's sitting there and then all of a sudden you start busting it up underneath then you start sucking listen the life blow out all of you that have been in science know the law of displacement you have to put when you put something in and you take it out there's a hole if you don't put something back in there there's a hole and guess what's going to happen going to collapse so that's what it's going to be you watch we're having earthquakes now in many places not just California everywhere they're have Oklahoma like I said they're having them once every two three weeks they're having a and they're not having the little bitty ones 5.1 5.6 and all that so and really Listen People we're destroying ourselves man has always destroyed your we we're destroying ourselves I don't see how the Middle East hadn't done sunk down with as much oil since the 20s they've started pulling oil out from underneath all that Sandy stuff right cuz see when the earthquak start it's like me and Dad we're talking about other day it's not just going to be earthquakes going destroy California the whole world's going to be impacted that's right we don't realize the thing that brother B said he said he saw Florida underwater mhm Florida's only 200 100 ft above sea level Florida California goes so when California goes down there's law of displacement when you when goes out something got to come back and when it does it's going to raise do you know that I was reading this the other day 10 million people on the East Coast live at or below sea level wow wow at or below not above cuz remember all in New Orleans is below sea level yes it is they keep it pumped out by them big old pump that's right well they ain't going to be a look they and Katrina what happened when Katrina just a little hurricane well it was a big one but watch what happened the whole town was flooded why the PPKs were so overwhelmed well hey when California sinks you better be right because you won't be able to travel everything's going to be where you can't go anywhere Communications um electrical all that stuff's going to be gone going to be shot and you and I are going to have to what trust in that third pull but that's what they're doing in Jamaica you remember when we first went over there they get that uh what is it they get out boite box aluminum box box okay they get it and dig big holes I mean just huge ho now they're realizing that that's going to so they're making them fill that back up but those was just cold bigger than well there was nobody telling them they can't so they just s over there and just took half of Jamaica away yeah cuz box site is not really aluminum but it's the ore that you make aluminum out of so you got to have boxit so you can have aluminum so Alco or Al Alcoa went over there and they just leveled mountains they just took that stuff out like brother Keith said they stealing our Island one shovel load at a time yeah so but finally they decided that they better make them they're reclaiming it so but you see what this these seals take us into eternity every seal we talk about the first seal what's one true Living God that come from eternity it didn't come from a man right one God came from eternity that's right that's what I'm telling you when we start when I try to bring this about Dimensions you don't get a revelation in this in this Dimension this Dimension is like brother Harris he many times he preached on this being not so and I understand now this is not so this is not so right if God saw listen if God saw us right here today even born again he have destroy your flesh okay that's what brother Brown said but what covers Us that red blood covers everybody why don't he destroy the sinner the red blood's covering the Earth right remember brother Brown said he don't even see you he hears your voice calling up through the blood you see what I'm talking about so we truly are in a Time trap Dimension that's right that we can't get out of in human flesh but we're fixing to amen we're fixing to break that law you know man says laws are made to be broken I think they are some of them that are made to be broken my um we'll go right here my mayor we were sitting down talking the other day and he was talking about um people dying and he he quoted that scripture good old Baptist man he said you know the Bible says it's appointed under man wants to die I said you know what I said that's an appointment I said if you go to the doctor you have a why you have an appointment he makes you an appointment says you got to come at 9:00 right do you have to go no no no you don't so I just looked at him and I said I'm going to miss my appointment all right let's go I going to mess my point he said you know I never thought of it that way my boy that blood yeah man I got to do my own job got do my own job
