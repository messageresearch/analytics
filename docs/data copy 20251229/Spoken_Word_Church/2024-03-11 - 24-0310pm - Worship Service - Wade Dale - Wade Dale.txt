blessing my heart to see what God's doing in our midst and you can never go wrong with a testimony it's only uh to just tell others what God is doing even if it's behind closed doors and we don't don't see it it's just giving him all the glory amen if you want to M okay um it's actually really good news last Sunday I remember um I'm going to try and make it really fast um I came to be yall realiz I don't know if yall remember I was prayed for by Brother Wade this man can perform Miracles and I asked him I said brother Wade can you pray for me to get the Holy Ghost please cuz I don't know how to get it I just know I'm struggling I was struggling with BTSD and it's gone and um I remember he asked me he said are you sure you're ready and um I said yeah cuz somehow cuz I'm the type of person I guess because of military I can't do hypocrisy it's either one way or another you know what I'm saying so I either have to choose to be a believer or be a Christian I cannot do that I can't I I just can't um so for a very long time I blamed myself for my car I don't know if you remember my BM I got a car I was in a car with my BMW so I was so angry with God cuz I'm like that's my BMW you took away from me I worked so hard for that you know I was the probably the first one to drive a BMW in my family and it was not cheap and I was so angry and I'm like God you took my BMW that's my BMW you took and I would be so angry and God knows like brother a w said sometimes God has to get you off of your high horse right and let me tell you he got me off of my high horse real quick cuz I was doing too much so Something Told me um I paid all my fines and stuff like that so something told me to uh look up apparently there was a post sign involved that my BMW heit also and um as you all know everything was paid for because it was to and um something told me to look up the owner of that post sign because when I went to court apparently he's wanted them you know he wanted to be paid for the Post sign or something I don't know and um something told me to just write him and just look for him and write him and just apologize for his post sign you know because I felt so bad cuz that's you know that's his business and I wrote him and uh my caregiver just told me um so anyway I was going through his Facebook post and I could see how he was making fun of my BMW how he got wrecked and um calling it just making fun of it and I got so mad CU I'm like y you don't understand the story behind this BMW so he was like oh they're not a powerful machine like you think it is they are a powerful machine cuz guess what somehow through that BMW all the airbags deployed that's how I survived and here I am telling him sorry well guess what my caregiver who just happens to replace my other caregiver who usually comes with me and she's Catholic by the way so thanks wait um so the coin and um she struggles with um she has she's dead in one ear so when I tell you it's been coincidence after coincidence anyway I was telling her my story and she told me you can sue that man for slander and get Millions cuz her sister is a lawyer so here I am we're going to get saway and I'm like well another thing this church we don't believe in suing taking somebody to court so she's like if I were you I would do it so y'all pleas pray for me because I'm not going to I have a lot of debt okay I have a lot of debt and I want another BMW oh man so and my little sister would tell me you need to find a lawyer and sue somebody and I just couldn't do it well y'all give me the grace because if that's the case I don't know how much I can get for slander but she's like just find a lawyer and Sue that man cuz I have screenshots of how he was making fun of my BMW I mean I even have a screenshot of how I wrote him a message on Facebook apologizing and apparently my case had not been settled in court so regardless of how it happened that's apparent that slander in Georgia and plus I'm a veteran so y'all can't tell me God doesn't exist because he really really does believe me he does when I tell you he can change me and I've done it all everything I mean I even join the military and War pants who does that I caught myself I caught myself throwing away uh um my makeup in my car she can tell you I was literally throwing them away if that's not God I don't know who it is because I want to leave an example to the young people God knows especially when I come to church thank you all so much Josh is telling me to hurry up my bad thank you [Applause] guys keep in pray Lord he knows how to get our attention but he also knows how to guide us through all these situations so just continue to pray for the situation amen Let's uh let's sing that chorus I will praise the Lord F amen I think sister Nala if you can get prepared for your song Oh I will praise the Lord I I will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow brings no matter what tomorrow brings what it has in [Music] store I will praise the Lord oh what a security that is oh oh why I will praise the [Music] Lord oh I will praise the Lord for no matter what tomorrow brings what he has in store [Music] for I will praise the Lord oh sing it to him once more oh yes I I will praise the Lord oh I will praise him like I will praise the Lord and no matter what tomorrow brings and what it has in store for I I will praise the [Music] Lord [Music] I was a WR I remember who I was I was Bloss I was blind I was running out of time and sin separated the breach was far too wide but From The Far Side of the CM you held me in your side so you made a way across the Great Divide Left Behind Heaven's throne to build it here inside and there at the cross you paid the debt I owed broke my chains freed my soul for the first time I had hope thank you Jesus for the blood app and thank you Jesus it has was me white thank you Jesus you have saved my life brought me from the darkness into glorious light and you took my place laid inside my tomb of sin you were buried for 3 days but then you walked right out again and now death has no sting and life has no end for I have been transformed by the blood of the Lamb thank you Jesus for the blood applied and thank you Jesus it has washed me white thank you Jesus you have saved my life brought me from the darkness into glorious and there is nothing stronger than the one working power of the blood the blood that calls your sons and daughters we are Ransom by Our Father through the the and there is nothing stronger than the Wonder working power of the blood the blood that calls us Sons and Daughters we are Ransom by a father the the [Music] and thank you Jesus for the blood app and thank you Jesus it has wased me thank you Jesus you have saved my life brought me from the darkness into [Music] glorious and glory to his name glory to his name and there to my heart was the blood applied glory to to his name praise the Lord you know I was thinking I heard that song recently and it's such a powerful song I Believe each of us as Christians get to a point in our lives where somewhere along the path you're walking with the Lord you you kind of stop asking him for things and you start thanking him you thank him for the things that has been you thank him for the things that are happening and then the things you need that you don't have you start thinking for them and you start start to see that manifest there's such a power and such a reality and just thank him for it you need healing start thanking him for it whatever you need whatever you've had need of and um it's such a lesson if you start to look at that that area of gratitude you start thinking the Lord um is such a powerful thing and then you start to notice not the things you don't have but what God has already blessed you with and how you can be a blessing to others amen amen Let's uh let's sing uh one more song before our brother comes um uh God on the mountain in the Kia Se amen oh life is easy and when you're upon the [Music] mountain and You' got peace of mine like you've never known but it's when things change but when things [Music] change and you're down in

with us as we're going to uh to um go about a little bit different this afternoon and and put a little bit on the worship uh part of the service and if you're uh if you got your Bibles let's turn to Psalms 100 but we'll read it on the screen here in just a second I want to thank all the musicians song leaders all the uh anyone that has anything to do with the worship service even taking up the offering is part of the worship service amen because you Worship in tithes and offerings and you get a blessing for it amen so we appreciate all of you the announcements now brother I will be speaking for us Wednesday night Lord willing next Sun next Saturday at 3:00 brother andw Glover will be with us and we'll have a youth service and U um I think brother Tim Calhoun's going to bring several from his he's got some new young people that they're coming to church so he's going to bring them and uh pray for my contact it's lost over here somewhere but um but remember that and then the we'll have hot dogs and then the in and trimmings and uh Sister junor Sister Esther so been been so gracious to to coordinate all that so just see them if you need any if any questions if you've already paid don't worry about bringing something unless you want to bring a dessert and uh then the Sunday we'll have just one service too and then couple of weeks after that we'll have our Easter meetings and um brother Tim cross there he's coming his brother-in-law is coming and brother Solomon Huffman so they're going to bring a pretty good little group with them and we'll have a good time then we'll also we're going to have the meat catered and then we'll um sister asra will make casserole and then we'll go on the Raptor so I wish I hope but uh she made some mean casserole but let's go to Psalms 1001 and um you know when we look at worship we um know that in the Bible that the children of Israel when they would go to battle kind of outstanding when when when the the children of Israel got ready to go to battle what's the first thing they did they didn't start sharpening their swords they got all that prepared back in the camp but when they got ready to move the song service started song service started they had the singers and they had the Sultry and they had the the string instruments and all that cuz David during the whole time of writing the Psalms they were going to war they were battling everywhere you know so he was quite familiar with singing and you know he could um he could play there and play a harp and remember the evil spirits went away from Saul and quit tormenting him just by David playing um a beautiful note on a u on a harp so we know that music is part of worship service it's not the main part we don't worship for 2 hours and then preach for 30 minutes no we it has its time it has its place and I believe we do it correct I just want to as the old saying is sharpen our pencil a little bit and um fill in some gaps and and learn some new songs and learn some chords and and see what the Lord has for us so thank you all for coming and be patient with us this first time we've ever done it so just be patient patient as we start through this so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for this evening that you gave us wouldn't be one be anywhere else Lord but right here serving you father and and the spirit and truth and Lord now I pray that that you'd be with us in this worship part that that we even know that that lifting up of holy hands is in the Bible and it tells us to to lift our hands in praise to you Lord and there's things that you look down and and look through time and you're in eternity Lord and you look down into time and you see us worshiping and and Lord You're pleased with that and father I pray that we'll we'll do it more often and we'll do it with fervor we'll do it Lord with with Thanksgiving in our heart as we're going to read the scripture here we know that David you gave him a song in his heart to write all these hundreds of Psalms Lord and I pray Lord that you'd bring that same Spirit today Father that it will anoint each one of us Lord for our job to the battle we've been put on the Forefront to uh defeat Satan in the end time father and I pray Lord that this will be pleasing to your to your ears Lord and to your sight and that your people will feel refreshed Lord when we're finished and and and that we have been Lord not just a a church service but Lord a church worship Lord we worship you in in in song but we also we know we worship ship you in the word of the Lord and you're pleased with that Lord and I pray that you'd be with each one that has a part in the service songs and and instruments and taking up offerings and exhortation and and um testimonies and and all that is included in the worship service and I pray that you just be with each one Lord that has a part in that refresh them and give them strength Lord be with a little bride around the world father and Lord I I pray a special prayer for for this problem that we have Lord for this internet that's going on Lord that we can't get service sometimes in the morning we know it's the devil he'll let everything else go through the internet but he tries to stop us but boo devil we are going to get this out to the people and father we pray that you'd bless the ones that are watching in that can't get here Lord that's that's mainly why we have this and you know that and you're mindful of those ones that can't get out Lord and that that can't get to church service Lord that are older and have afflictions father we know that it's important that they worship just as much as we do and they are a part of the service and Lord so I pray that you just open that thing up Lord and let us have wisdom to get the equipment we need maybe to get something else to to work with and and Lord You've give us absolute the greatest group of young men and brother Anderson and Brother Joseph and brother Richard brother uh Bob and all the different ones and excuse me brother um Louise and all the ones that know anything about this computer system Josh and different ones Lord that's put this thing together Lord I pray that You' give them Supernatural strength and effort and into putting all this together Lord so that it'll go out to your people father just bless us now in further in this service in Jesus name amen let's give them a big hand to we appreciate there there's some there's some brothers that I'm acquainted with that that that that ask me all the time said could you just send me one you've got so many could you just send me one brother Claude I was talking to him yesterday he said could you just send me one I said nah got to keep them all they decide to come here so you know yeah we we'll keep them here and and if you need them you can call them but you can't have them so you can pick their brain but you can't take them with you you know they stay here so uh he was very envious about u u he was an old computer guy back when they were doing the punch card that's how old he is you know when the computers went you know and all that had rooms full of these things going around and around that's how he first got started in it so he's very um appreciative of of of what we do and and what is what's produced what's produced online I you know I don't know if y'all look at it but but look at the website sometime look at some of the archive sermons and the quality and the things that uh that these brothers have put together and crawled up in this ceiling um and to there's not much in this ceiling we didn't ask brother Aaron to do that amen that's right we asked somebody skinny to to get up here and do Brother Anderson he's long enough to reach up through here but we had to run all these if you you can't see the wires they've hit them all and um but you can see them from right here but they put it together just so that you can have a church service and the people that can't come that are sick that they can have something to watch and be able to worship online and we sure appreciate that so let's go to Psalms 100 and let's talk about just for a few minutes and then we'll turn it over to brother Joe when we get finished with um with the exhortation here then you can make maybe take about a f minute break and go to the restroom or or you know loosen your fingers up and get ready to play so brother Joe's got the U everything set up so we'll just let him go and and I don't know if y'all know it or not but brother joose our first regular song leader was his father here at this church in 1970 some odd one two three somewhere in there he was our song leader uh dad lead singing for a while brother Mo because they didn't have anybody and then brother George Canada comes along and and he leads singing for several years and uh he was actually here before Joe was even born and uh I told him we've known your dad I've known your dad longer than you have and uh we have because we all kind of grew up together brother John and and so it's just wonderful to see the cycle that we see the young that we see the young Joseph come and pick up where brother George is that and uh and we appreciate brother Joe he's got many many hats that he wears and and he wears them well so we appreciate that so Psalms 100 verse verse one here's a that knows how to worship David said a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourself we are his people and the Sheep of his Pastor enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name you know that word Thanksgiving is is is is something that you you come and you honor um when we have Thanksgiving Day we honor the pilgrims that came and and um and gave us uh the new land here and we give we give Thanksgiving to the Lord for giving us a new land he gave us the Holy Ghost he gave us a new land to walk in and he's going to give us what this land amen cuz we're inheritors of this Earth we're not going to heaven Heaven's coming here amen that's what we see the new city was coming down out of heaven here on the earth God's not going to destroy this Earth he made it for us to inhabit so he's not going to destroy it we're going to live on it and have dominion over it that's what we should have been for the Lord is good and his Mercy is Everlasting his truth endureth through all generations all right you may be seated I'll read the rest of these but Psalm 68:3 says I will praise the name of God with a song and I will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving our confession our praise I'll get through some of these and I'll make some comments Psalms 33:1 says rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright you know you look at at different um Arenas and venues and you see um you have your contemporary artist now and you've got your old southern baptist you know that that sings the sing like what we always say out of the red book and then you've got your contemporary singers that sing a little bit a little bit different with a little bit more upbeat or or a little bit different uh sound to it but if it's done by somebody with the Holy Ghost see that makes the difference that's why you want to have a congregation that's full of the Holy Ghost that every person that walks up here brings that little lick of fire with them all right and then takes that little lick of fire and then what extends it to you the people they're not up here singing for their s uh they're not up here for their self they're here to do what give that gift to you all right they don't want we don't want you to give it to the world young adults kids don't give it to the world the world's going to just destroy you give it to God give it to the greatest people ever walked on the face of the Earth and they're not out there they're in here right so rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright listen in other words we enjoy we should enjoy good worship right we we should enjoy when the spirit of the Lord comes in and the presence just comes over and it's like a breath of fresh air and we can feel the presence of the Lord and we can see I want to be able to see the effects of that all right I want to see the effects of that the effects of that is worship with holy hands and and and say Amen every once in a while and and say thank you Lord for air conditioning and I'm sorry wait a minute thank you Lord for brother Aaron that knows to come up here and do something with the air conditioner and he plays the guitar and he the minister and he's song leader so he wears many hats too so we appreciate him or was that oh praise the Lord with harp sing unto him with Sultry and an instrument of 10 string sing unto him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise I I like it when Richard plays skillfully with a loud noise I like to hear that Bas every and everybody's smiling and saying amen so he that we like we like Brother Richard playing that Bas today we're going to brag on the musicians all right we'll brag on the preachers and other time whenever we get good enough to get bragged on we'll just brag on y'all amen what Rich so Richard Richard does good on the base we all of you do a good job every one of you and the ones that are that are practi iing for other uh playing other um U instruments we got our sisters up here in front of the piano I sure wish we had it spread out a little more where you didn't have to be in front of that piano but maybe we can try to do that later on Psalms 107 verse 20 now look the Bible says he sent his word and healed him now we quote this a lot but it is also included with worship he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing because that's what you do when you come in here is it just repetition or is it just repetition for you I'm asking you that question do we sing Amazing Grace because that's a song that everybody knows that's a song Everybody's comfortable with and everybody knows words without putting them on the screen no I I sing Amazing Grace because I'm a recipient of that I can relate to every verse in that song every verse I can relate to that and that's what you need to do make it personal when you come in here and and and and somebody sings a special it ought to be special that's why it's called a special CU it's special you're you're instead of including everybody in the in the worship you you got one person with one piece of talent that God's given them and you got that one person and that person's either practiced or or or got with one of the brothers and sisters and they've took that little extra effort to make it sound good right so what had they done they have took they took their worship to a different level listen this ain't like singing in the shower this ain't like singing in the shower y'all don't do that okay yeah pray for me and sister June she has to hear it but when you get down when you get down the the reason I sing in the shower cuz it feels good I mean that's the time I'm getting clean and that ought to be the time when you come here when you're getting cleaned up when the scales are coming off of you cuz you've been out in the world for you know days at a time and you got all that scaly feeling on to me it's like it's oily it's oily it's like you walk through you know you go through somewhere and you you just feel dirty but when you come here you ought to feel clean or if you're not clean you ought to come here and get clean one of the two all right because you're going to leave one way or the other you're going to leave the same you going to keep that oily and go out or you going to get rid of that oily and go out you again cuz listen we all need a renewing the Bible talks about a renewing of our mind well the renewing of your mind is is is the Bible says put a song in your heart all right well that's where you're singing from you're singing from your heart not trying to like brother brandham said he's he said they'll sing these great you know notes up here and these great notes down here and he said and commit adultery the day after right he was talking about Pat Boon and some of them that was playing at The Honky Tonks at night and then playing at the church service I didn't know if y'all knew that or not but different ones was doing that they come from The Honky Tonks and then walks in and sits down and starts playing I know one time we were at a church one time and this brother he's it's a message church and he like music but he brought this guy in that was like a country music he wasn't a famous guy but he came in to to play and he played so loud and it was just so it wasn't his atmosphere to be in he needed to be sorry he needed to be in the bar you know playing his instrument but they brought him in to play for some silly reason and I'm just not going to do that yeah well Have We Become hirelings where we have to be hired to come in and play the music or are we get somebody off the street because we can't play good you think about that you start practicing and you practice for the Lord and forget about what the world says but we don't need somebody outside playing our music for us come on somebody we need somebody filled with the Holy Ghost to sing the songs for us you when you open your book if you got the Holy Ghost That Fire ought to go right down into those words words and they ought to come and burn off that page and and we all have our favorite songs right everybody everybody has a favorite song that you sing in your and when and then you have a situational song right right you have a situational song when you get in some kind of situation you start singing that song right and it ain't something to do with the world it's it's a Christian song I hope I know sometimes you know and that's how uh just stopped for a minute I was going to say this later on but I say it now you see how music influences the world though I mean brother Donnie I mean he's 70 and and I'm 64 so he's 70 plus but a little but the era of music what I'm saying is the era of music was beetles and first one thing and another like that and you go into uh you know you don't want to have nothing to do with that right we don't want we don't have no Beetle music in the in the house I hope not I hope you ain't got no beetles in your house but but if if you do there's an exterminator it's called Jesus and he'll come anytime too you ain't got to wait on him but where was I going with this no you go into Walmart and you hear that one song a song and it might be just like real soft it may not be like blaring it may be like and you start singing it in your head and you can't get it out of your head especially one that you've heard back in the world and that well what is that that Satan anointing I'm sorry but that's Satan anointing the praise is supposed to go to god let's just be honest it's it's the anointing that's supposed to go to God Satan has brought in something that we listen to out in the world and we can't get out of our head when they can't do that but when I start hearing that and I start tapping my foot at something like that that you know played and uh um I start singing Amazing Grace I Know It real well so and you know what that does it kind of it moves that thing out of the way but now what's the difference in Us in the world though because the world will take that and they will use that music and then listen every piece of a of music has an anointing with it every piece of music it doesn't matter worldly music Christian music it all has an anointing to it because listen some of these people can't write these songs without an anointing even though you're out in the world and you hear these songs you know that that come from somewhere that had an anointing to it they're just not sitting there going I think this will rhyme with this you know cuz Psalms are supposed to rhyme I think that's will rhyme with this and no they're anointed like Claud brother Claude was preaching here about the The Fifth Dimension you know singing The Age of Aquarius well that's that's us now see most of you that's heard it it's going to be it's going to be in your head for the rest of the sermon mine too but um but it was an anointed for the time all right and then brother brandham said you know like Elvis Presley he sold his soul for a fleet of Cadillacs he sold his talent to the world where God wanted him to use the talent for the Lord because he come from a a Pentecostal background Pentecostal church but he turned around and gave it to Satan instead of giving it to the Lord but you know you you it's kind of funny have you heard Elvis saying how great thou art oh wow oh wow I mean that was an anointing but that man if he didn't get born again before he died he's going to find out how great that man is sadly to say but there's an anointing there for every one of them every one of them so so same with me and you when we come to church service we want to be anointed by the Holy Ghost with what we have that listen I say what we have that we have what that you have may different from what I have not the different Holy Ghost but a different anointing like and I know y'all I know I know some of you like this certain strip of songs or pages of songs Just a marry shaking her head she there's we got our favorites but we got to break out over here because because you know brother over here may like this group of favorites all right but we mold them together and and it's kind of uh trying to formulate this I'm trying to think like David here's David he doesn't have a recorder he doesn't have even sound you know like an amplifier he's playing these Psalms and he's he's singing these songs and he's playing this instrument and really he's playing to himself he doesn't have an audience except when he did that with with Saul but there really wasn't an audience there in other words David wasn't a concert pianist you understand what I mean he was pretty much well who was he playing for he's playing for us that's right he was playing for someone with the Holy Ghost that had an anointing that could cuz listen if you can't identify with the Bible then you're not a Christian you got to identify yourself you've heard it a thousand times you got to find yourself in the Bible sir you got to find who you are and you've got to find out David look all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness well who's he talking about he's not talking about himself he's talking about us oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men why do you like songs that are different sometimes or or a song that's special to you something in that lyrics or something in in That Song speaks to what you've went through During the period of your life or what you're going through right now there's something going on that God will allow that and to me that's God helping us don't have to have a minister there every five minutes but you can have a song in your heart every five minutes and God can give you a song that will help you through your situation but when you come in this door we know that the words more important but when you come through this door though we have got to be washed as I said before we've got to be we've got to be washed off that's why I said you know if you have a fight with your wife or your husband or your kids get it done before you get come in that door if not you going to bring that thing in here hello somebody that's why I said it and I'm going to say it one more time you need to be here 20 to 30 minutes before the service starts now I'm not trying to make it a law but you could hinder the service by walking in here with an attitude two minutes before the service starts hello somebody amen you know why cuz I [Applause] have I have done it I know that's why I feel safe saying that cuz we've all done it but we should not see that's one thing you can control nobody else can control that can't control your attitude coming through that door you're the only one that can control it if you have to stop and pray before you go in that door stop and pray before you go in that door or come in and see into this cuz I want us to see too and I'll I'll read this what brother rown says um about this being a in other words this is a place of safety this is a place that that you can come to and you ought to be able to feel safe you ought to be able to be able to to speak to the Lord in worship and in the preaching coming forth but also in the worship you should feel comfortable in this building if you're not maybe you're not a Christian maybe you're not a sheep yet I said yet I didn't say you I'm not throwing people out but but uh we have we do believe in conversion from a goat to a sheep we believe that we're all bunch of goats but we do by the transforming power of the Lord become comfortable with sheep because we become a Sheep amen and let them sacrifice the sacrifice of Thanksgiving I was thinking this morning I mainly thinking of brother Michael and the job they do with with driving an hour and a half and I know some of you drive close to that anyway but they drive from Atlanta an hour and a half one way to get here and he gets here on time uh before time so that's a sacrifice and God won't let that go he'll give you something something he'll give you you say well I you know I'm I don't know where it's that well he will you make a move to God he's going to have to make a move to you the problem is that sometimes we don't make that move but if you'll make that move to God and step out and say God I'm going to sacrifice my time just like coming up here for Bible study and coming to the different thing functions that we have it's a sacrifice but it should be a sacrifice of Thanksgiving that we can come not that it's a drudgery or if I don't show up you know I'm brother Way's got this secret calendar in the in the office I hope they don't find it a secret calendar in the office that marks you when you don't come in I told a brother that one time he said oh I come to church all the time I said I got a calendar I want you to see these xes on it but I was just kidding I don't keep up with it I do I do know that you're not here but that's your business not mine but let them sacrifice the sacrifice of Thanksgiving look and declare his works with what with rejoicing right amen not with a solemn sad face no declare his words with rejoicing listen when you come in here listen this this is what we do you come in here we try to get all the world out of you I I we pray in the in the back brother Joe brother Louise brother Aaron whoever brother John the different ones that lead singing brother Michael we pray y'all we pray what do we what do I pray that the anointing that will be on you will go from here to there right not just come out here with an anointing and you just got a big old bubble and and and you know you're inside that thing and and nobody's going to bother you and I'm going to be up here no a true song leader listen to me a true song leader gets a song started and then let it flow this way let the people sing louder than the song leader right it's not a show you're not trying to show how many cords I mean or how much how many octaves you can carry it's getting the people involved in the worship service and involved in what we're doing because listen you've made a sacrifice if you made a sacrifice to get here let's worship let's praise the Lord let's praise the one that saved your soul cuz I'll promise you I'll promise you on Monday the one that wants your soul back is going to come early Monday morning the devil gets up I don't think he sleeps yeah he will you ain't kidding but we're going to declare it here and then let that flow out into the congregation Psalms 111 verse1 says praise ye the Lord I will praise the Lord look with my whole heart put everything you got into it in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation Psalms 150:1 praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts thank you for what he did for you thank him for what he did for you during the week amen right have you ever thanked him for the job you got oh bless God not my job well I guess God didn't give you that one and you probably going to find have to get another one pretty quick because um you need to give God praise for everything you got everything you got give him praise that's right cuz you know what God may have you in that place and you think this is Hell on Earth and it may be but he put you in there to shine a light he put you there to shine a light and listen he put every one of you that are born again in your place when you go out in that world you are showing an A Witness of at the day of judgment God's going to say I sent the sister right by you and you turn me down remember what the Bible says right the Bible says no they're not turning you down God said they're turning me down and as we were talking about the cup of water in my name and all the different things that comes from us that that emanates from us eternal life listen eternal life has to come through the body cuz that's the only place there is eternal life it's the body of Christ that's why we lay hands on for the healing we lay hands on for the Holy Ghost but we're going to be able though to speak as God speaks oh don't get quiet on me brother brand I read you that quote about 10 sermons in a row he said it'll come to a time where you don't have to lay hands on the sick you'll speak the word and it'll happen amen well listen you're not going to get to it as brother Bob said we're not going to get to it and we come the prescribed way everybody come together everybody listen it's like brother random said he said look if if John's got the football why are you tackling John he's on your team all right block for him right as my old high school coach said either lead follow or get out of the way that's right all right praise him for his Mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the Sultry and the harp praise him with timberl and dance praise him with string instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that has breath praise the Lord Praise ye the Lord Jeremiah 33:11 says the voice of joy the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord bring it into the house of the Lord for I will cause to return the Captivity of the land as at the first sayeth the Lord Psalms 1471 says praise ye the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God everybody believes the Bible's right right you know it's not just out there for for just whatever no it has a it has a meaning all right Praise You the Lord for it's good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant and praise is comely listen God enjoys the worship of his Saints cuz listen nobody else knows how to worship nobody else knows how to worship the true God except the bride amen all right so let's read this real quick and then we'll be done brother R tells us in 1954 he said we sing those songs and it lights up our countenances to think after 10,000 years we'll have no less time but you know now is the time we got to work for the Lord isn't it the only time that we have is in this little span of mortal life while we're here and I believe that it behooves us to put every minute that we can in the Lord's service doing something no matter what it is if it's singing testifying doing something for the glory of the Lord for just think we're just going to sing 10,000 years after we get there that's just a song service it's just it's not quite over that you know 10,000 years so it's going to be a wonderful time he continues on in in the sixth um paragraph now same sermon now don't want to take too much of your time for I know tomorrow's Monday work day during the time of the Revival if God willing we just want to find a good hour and a half or two hours of a Night song service and they go right into the teaching of the word and I think that songs are marvelous but we can ruin a meeting by songs all right well here we go on the other side all right we can sing too long okay too many of them see we can sing but what the house of God is is for correction for the word for understanding and instruction that we know how to behave oursel and I think we got I think you got your songs just fine now just like it was tonight he's talking about the worship service that's very fine now here's 1959 they asked him a question about conducting a service he said after a while they begin to hear the bell ring you remember the old church bell we used to have them at at gills they all them church bells would start ringing well you knew that was a call to service all right church has begun to take up then they bring these messages he's talking about tongues and interpretation should not be in a congregation while the service is going on see that's where they missed it where they would jump up brother Brown be preaching or somebody be preaching they jump up and give a a tongu an interpretation and it'd be the Lord they just couldn't control their s right but he said the way to do it is is to take those people with gift put them in a room before the service starts let them prophesy or speak in tongues and interpret and write it down the piece of paper and then you put it up here on the platform and then then the minister reads that interpretation that's the correct way of doing it then they bring these messages lay them right here on the desk right here is where they're supposed to be laying I'm off somewhere studying praying after a while I walk out after the songs are being sung the church is all in order people coming sitting meditating praying that's what you're supposed to do not come to church and talk to one another not come you come to church to talk to God that's why we don't talk in sanctuary unless we absolutely have to this is not a place this is not a lodge not a place to bring food and we not going to sit here and you know we not going to have cappuccino in in the seats I'll promise you that long as I'm here this is a place to worship you got hours to do that out there hours you got about 2 hours in here please give God those two hours and be solemn be correct do it in worship do it in worship to him not anybody else then go have your cappuccino if you want to if you want to pay $17.95 for a Starbucks 2 oce coffee go right ahead Devils have your have your fellowship out there see we're fellow fell shipping with God now and we come here talking now he don't mean talking he's talking about talking to the Lord all right we come here talking everything quietly reverent the spirit's moving The Pianist comes to piano about 5 minutes before the service starts starts real sweet down at the cross where my savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried or some good sweet song real quietly it brings the presence of the Holy Ghost into the meeting see all right the people sitting there there some of them are start weeping and come to the Altar and repent before the service ever starts I preached at several places that U that even before the I mean during the the preliminaries people would come up and pray you know if they if you had a fight with your wife and it was a good when you better come up here cuz you might not be able to get rid of it back there before the preacher comes out but I'm I'm being I'm trying to make it funny but it's not really not I mean some were really they needed they needed Deliverance before the preacher came out right and some of the deacons or some of the sisters will come up and help them lay hands I've seen that several times not not here cuz we've just not done that but in some Services they are welcome to come up and pray around the altar before the service starts and you sure are welcome to do that and we'll pray with you if you need it listen we want to get everything right cuz we know one thing for sure the devil's here before you get here he's right here before you get here he like I said before he comes to church when you don't the church is in travail Christians are praying they got their positions they're not sitting around chewing chewing gum saying hey ly give me some of your lipstick I want you know you know I need you know the other day when I was down there shopping I tell you I almost stepped on your toes that I ever seen such what do you think about that oh mercy and call this the house of God why it's a disgrace the body of Christ coming together there we set amen all right the men sitting by say you know when we went over there there're so so and so and so that's all right outside but in here it's the house of God we didn't come to talk to nobody but God when you come in this room all right come in praying take your positions I'm talking now not to your churches Brethren I don't know what you do I'm talking to this Tabernacle cuz this is and I'm talking to you today I'm talking to my own back door see that's right now when you come in like that then the first thing you know the pastor walks out he's freshly he don't have to be answering this that or the other he he's coming right out at the doe of his ministry he's been under the power of the Holy Spirit he walks right into where more tongues of fire are gathered together that makes a song that makes a service to go from singing To Worship into the ministry and then if you need something afterwards there's always an altar call the altar is always open and uh and I have during some of the youth meetings I've seen when brother Ron and different ones were preaching and the power of the Lord strike the the uh the people and and he'd be preaching away and still be preaching had been preaching 30 minutes and and three or four people come to the altar well praise God one of you deacons or one of you preachers you get up and you come over here now I don't can't leave here you don't leave them your post of Duty this is the the the spirit of the Prophet subject to the prophet so we continue preaching somebody comes up prays with them that ain't going to bother me none that actually is going to help cuz if they something they got cloudy in their brain or in their body and they come up here and get rid of it going to make it easier for for the service to go I want our services to be worship that's my last thought I want it to be a worship and worship God not be a formality not be a let's open and and you know brother Brown does tell us now he does he does tell us in in certain places in Condor and Doctrine he'll tell you he'll say um open a service a couple of congregational maybe a he calls it an outstanding special take up the offering bring the pre preacher out that's okay he's trying to set parameters for us not to get away from all right not 30 songs 10 testimonies and and then the preacher comes out and you're wore out but we do it right here I mean we do as as we as we all have done before if you if you hear feel the spirit sing one more song if something's not right please sing another song then when you feel like led to bring the preacher out you bring the preacher out doesn't matter if it's me or anybody else you do that you song leaders and different things I don't want you just go now we just going to sing these two songs and then we going to take up an offering and then we're going to and that's okay but let's let the spirit lead us not a piece of paper but I also agree with brother Joe though you need to at least give us a give them a format you're doing that so the musicians are not fumbling through looking for you know this worse than anything is this you know 10 minutes try everybody trying to find the that's why I like that's why that's why I lobbied with my father several years ago to have these cuz I'll promise you most of you is too lazy to open the book cuz you mumbles the verses but we all pretty much know the course so the voices everybody goes up when the when the course then it goes down if they don't put that up on the screen y'all are mumbling right yeah hello somebody am I at home or not y'all are mumbling you going till you get to the course then you pretty much know the course but you don't know the you don't know the verses but now that they have the verses up here for us you can sing and sing without looking for the book listen you can don't have to thumb through your Bible to find scriptures I got them all right there for you I got the quotes there for you we are lay out of sea folks lazy no but there's a there's a balance to that right there really is a balance to it I Want You To Worship that's why I want the song leaders to have a lapel mic if you can if you can stand it cuz you can do this you can do this you can point you can do all but if you got a it's like I always say I can't preach with an ice cream comb in my hand I just can't do that some can I can't all right last time I did it I hit a guy in the head with it so an interpreter I told him not to follow me I he was interpreting in French and I turned around said something when I did I had it in my left hand and I turned around to motion to point and I forgot to put it in his hand point I did like that and hit him right between KN it woke most of the church up they had a shouting time after that they were all Haitians they wow but don't come in here 5 minutes before service starts okay you ought to know better you ought to you ought to come you ought to know you got to come in if you don't then you got a problem with pride and we need to pray for that oh I don't need that listen there's nothing in Christianity that I don't need nothing there is nothing that I don't need especially I need him but there's not a part of it and I am am Leary about people that says oh we don't have to do that anymore we don't have to take communion we're above that we don't have to take this ordinance we're above that well now who made you God who made you God I'm like brother brandom I'll tell you I'll read it where God put it in the Bible you read it to tell me where he took it out okay you read in the Bible and tell me how he took out all this worship he took out um communion he took out foot washing he tell me where he took it out we'll just quit and we'll just quit doing anything no he never took it out these are things we do as Christians we do them because we love God I don't take communion on first Sunday every mon just because I have to I want to I want god listen it's like brother Brown said and this closing here I is even if you're a Christian you got some doors you don't want God to play in well pray for me I do okay I got some doors I ain't ready for God to play in yet cuz he might find something that he don't like and I know one thing's for sure he's going to find something he don't like cuz I don't even like me myself and I'm standing inside the door you clapping for me for me oh okay I praise the Lord but let's be honest but worship should never be a drudgery though it should never be a drudgery you should never come to church and say I just really don't want to be here it's like at brother where brother Bob said they is the message Church well it's the last of the month I think I'll just come to church find me that in the b in the Bible the Bible says forsake not the assembling yourself together and much more as the day approaches all right I didn't write that God did so but we come here to worship I come here to get clean I am just dirty when I get here well bro you're the preacher you ought know how I got mine and y'all on my mind now I do and I appreciate that listen I I'm here for you guys you know I'm here for y'all so so um but take some of the to take some of the burden off get rid of it before you walk in the door okay get get rid of it before you walk in the door and we'll have a lot better service I don't want us to be sadf faed bunch of people I want us to be happy I want us to walk out of church service and say man not that not that I'm a good preacher but I want to say God spoke to me something to help me have you ever heard God speak to you that it didn't help you no I've never heard God speak to me and go well I didn't really need that no I need every word cuz he's the one that knows what I need when I need it and who it comes through for me to get it can you swallow that can you swallow that and who it comes through cuz listen we got a prophet that left us 1100 sermons we listen to it we Revere him but he's gone but his message is still here and we take that message and it molds into the Bible actually listen it is the Bible it's the Bible made manifest it's the B listen God has never lived in a group of people like he's living in them now never has he lived the way he wanted to in a group of people down through the church ages cuz they've had Scruples they've had this they've had dark times they've had they've had this kind of Doctrine and this kind of issue and this kind of denomination to fight which we do anyway but we know how listen brother rown said we have Satan's answer if you have Satan's answer use it use it and let's start by worship let's start by getting everything done before you walk in that door back there L on the Lord he said put your cares and your burdens on me and why did why did he say that he said cuz I care for you he said lay your burdens on me because I care for you I want you to have a good time listen this world is not going to get any better not going to get any better there's not going to be this great religion come up there's not going to be listen brother R said if Jesus came himself he not going to change what he's already said right this world's condemned it's done it's finished but you and I have a protection it's called Christianity it's called God in your soul and if God's in your soul then guess what it's got to come out amen Lord a fire not shut up in my bones we going to let it out and we're going to manifest it let's stand at our feet am brother Joe we we'll uh uh anybody have a need then we'll pray with you if not then brother joke and we like I said we'll give you about five minutes to yes sir yes we're going to do that just right here in just a second yes we are going to do that brother Aon brought it to our attention the other day and I believe it's a wonderful thing we'll do that very last thing before we dismiss is we'll have all the musicians and the song leaders come up to the front even though you're not playing anything right now I want you to come up here now uh and stand around the Altar and uh ministers um come on up and we're going to pray over our group um yeah just stay right there for now you pray the prayer of faith over these musicians song leaders listen without them it'd be hard to worship right that's why God loves his people to worship him because they worship Him in spirit and truth and you set the tone for us either struggling when we come out here and we do sometimes we struggle but it's it's really better if we don't struggle and let the Lord get to somebody didn't brother Brown say one unconfessed sin stop the whole congregation from getting something well one even though you're not involved what's it doing it's hindering this person standing here and he can't go in that direction because of a sin that's unconfessed or whatever you want to call it all right but I it would be let's get it confessed get it out you say well do I no there's no ritual list listen talk to go I talk to God I don't talk to God like thee thou and and all that I know you some of you giggling but that and that's right you hear people they pray and that's okay but when I talk to God it's like me calling Donnie up on the phone I talk to God like that he's my friend he's my buddy he's right here who do you talk to you talk to the one inside of you you don't have to you know you don't have to get up and H listen you don't even have to close your eyes please don't pray while you're going down the road and close your eyes okay but don't you talk to God with your eyes open it listen it's reverent to close your eyes we know that I'm not I'm not trying to be silly but let's don't if the Bible tells us to pray without ceasing you can't go through through your daily work with your eyes closed but you talk to God I talk to God just like he's standing right here and a lot of times he don't like to be standing right here he don't like me and what the stuff I do but he's still my friend he's still my listen he's my lover he's not going to move he's not move away he's my bridegroom I'm his bride you got to think of it like that he does not want to go away from he wants to stay right here and the intimate relationship is between you and him and nobody else right nobody else you and him and you can talk just like you talk to your brother and sister and different ones don't argue with him okay don't argue with him but talk to him say Lord It's been a bad day I need some help do we understand God like that we should as the Bride of Jesus Christ understand that God is Not somewhere you got to go through a telephone line you got to go through a satellite then you got to get to an angel then the Angel takes a piece of paper to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost takes a pie piece of paper to Jesus now what did he tell us he said he's na thee even in thy mouth the word of faith that you preach he's right here you talk to him like that talk to him as he's your friend you buty you young people talk to him as your friend as your buddy you said well I'm a girl God understands that okay listen he's all knowing so he knows your problems he knew it before he even had them but he wants you to confess he wants you to talk to him listen why do he make us he didn't need us did God need us uhuh he's self-sufficient he's Elohim he's self-existing he don't need air to breathe he don't need us to stand around this pull pit to be God but he does love worship and we were inside of him worshiping not his people but in his his DNA and now here we are we're out here now giving praise back to the one that we love so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord as we embark on this new Journey Lord we pray that you would bless each one that's here under the sound of our voice the ministers here and the song leaders and and the musicians Lord were praying in Earnest Lord that that nothing would standing the way for us to be able to worship you in spirit and truth and father if anything does come in Lord may we strike that thing out and and know to get rid of it Lord before we even come here Lord to do the right thing and play the right instrument Lord and and if we don't even know know how to play an instrument Lord clap our hands you gave us a 10 string in instrument called two hands Lord that we can clap our hands and worship and praise you Lord we do not want this to be a Christianity of drudgery Lord but Christianity of of life and life more abundant and to be as David Just Praise you everywhere we go let everything that has breath praise the Lord father just be with each one Lord just brewed over them by the Holy Spirit Lord that you've sent each and every one of us and Lord may we speak to you as we said as a friend and Lord that you not weigh out somewhere that you can't be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Lord I pray that you'd bless each one under the sound of my voice as we head forward Lord I pray that you'd bless the song leaders the ministers and anyone that has anything to do the musicians in the service Lord I pray that they'll come prayed up that they'll come Lord under this umbrella of the of the Holy Ghost in the Tabernacle Lord and and that we'll do what you say and that you'll have the preeminence Lord that's what the prophet told us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said God wants to have the preeminence and that means to be the preeminent one the one that stands in front of everything the one that we get out of the way and let you take over lord I pray that we all will do that Lord know when to move over and let you take over Lord because you're perfect and Lord you love worship and you appreciate your people you put us here Lord to worship you and father now I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that as we continue this and and the further ones on down the road in a few months I pray that you would anoint each one of us Lord to play the best we can play sing the best we can sing that we can preach the best we've ever preached in our life Lord all the ministers and different song leaders and all the ones Lord that has a part in this service I pray Lord that you anoint us fresh and that Lord we go forward from here Lord singing the psalms of praise as David and and even as you said unclean spirits would leave Saul they can't stand good worship Lord but you do so we invite you Lord to help us and bless each one that's here under the sound of our voice and around this Pulpit Lord and the ones in the congregation all the way to the back we pray that you'd anoint us Lord if we want to if we want to raise our hands Lord raise our hands shout Lord whatever gift that we have that we have in the Bible we know that it's ours and that we can use it any time that you allow us to use them and Lord I pray that we be recipients that we be ready when you do come to give us a gift that we be ready when you come to give us a word of exhortation that we be ready when you come to give us a prophecy or give us a scripture or give us a a a a message Lord to the
