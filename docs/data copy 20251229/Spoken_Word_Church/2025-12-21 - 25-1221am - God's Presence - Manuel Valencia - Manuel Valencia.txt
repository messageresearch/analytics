========================================

God bless you all. That was mighty, wonderful preaching there. &gt;&gt; I was enjoying it so much. Praise the Lord. All righty. Get this going. God, that's good. Let's bow our heads and um and pray. Dear heavenly father, we're so grateful, Lord, to be alive one more day, to be um to have God's revelation this day, to have your rest, your priest, to have your presence with us. Lord, we're so grateful, Lord, that we can call upon your name. We're so grateful that we can come with anticipation and believe for all things and that we can, Father God, uh, still receive revelation of your word that we can know that we're called in this last age, Father, as your bride, Father, to accomplish your will on this earth, Father, and to believe your word and to rest in your word, to let rest in your promises. And we're so thankful we have thus, say the Lord, that we have a sure word of promise and that we have, Father, such a sure sound of trumpet, that we have just such a sure word of prophecy that we have such a a true message this age, Father, that you brought through your prophet prophet, Father, we believe it, and we just ask um that you enlighten to us this day or your precious words and that you would teach us, Father, more in the revelation of your truth and in your message in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good. Praise the Lord. So today on topic of u God's presence, God's presence and I think it'd be uh wonderful to uh to share the scriptures here. I've been God has shown me and it's um it's just a beautiful topic to me. Um I was going to teach on the topic of of believe and um just surely last night the Lord um guided me to to this precious topic. It's I think it's so beautiful, right? It's just God's God's presence in his presence. So his presence is an expression of his attributes. It we're talking about the sa selfsame presence of the divine being of God. Think about it like when you have a a little child or someone coming near to you and you just you're in that presence of someone. They're you're perceiving you're expressing that the the attributes the August presence the warmth and and the comfort that comes with being personally with someone. And in Psalm 16:11, I love I love that it says, "Thou wilt show me." It's something that gets demonstrated, revealed that the paths of life, the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy. That's a joy that is complete, that is full. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures forever more. And I think it's special that we have a God that just doesn't just give a word, doesn't just give a manual and instructions, but he actually comes and indwells the person. He comes and he carries out the the the same power, the same um his his being, his presence, right? &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the for his comforter. And in first uh Chronicles 16:27, it actually gives four precious words here uh associating with God's presence. So it's talking about his presence. Glory and honor are in his presence. Strength and gladness are in his place. &gt;&gt; I think about just I I had a little struggle yesterday and all I did is just I yielded to the Lord and affliction of pain and and just instantly um God's presence came by &gt;&gt; and it it just changes everything. It does give you a strength. It does put a gladness in you and and you experience God's honor and glory, something that's divine and something that no medicine can do in you. &gt;&gt; And to me, it's precious, right? when you're spiritually delivered from your afflictions, when his presence comes, uh fullness of joy comes healing and brings about uh the restitution, the restoration of what we need. I think first as as a spirit being, you know, and we're going to do a study uh and get to the good part of his presence, but I just want to touch upon what it is to be away for his pre presence a bit about the also how his enemies, you know, tremble at his presence and are melt at his presence and what that does and also how there's a there's really a reverence and a respect, a trembless and people that are troubled at his presence that comes by and then there's an approach to his presence, you know, and then by God's grace, we have been able to experience the the goodness of his pre presence. &gt;&gt; So, you know, it does it doesn't come by just like that. Of course, there's an approach. And we see in Genesis 3:8 when it first talks about the presence or God's presence and and in this case it says and they heard the voice of the Lord and of God walking in the garness in in the gu garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; See amongst the tree of the garden. to see his presence is something to to be sought out for, but it is also something to that kind that can come with the tremble, with the with the with the fear. &gt;&gt; So, in Genesis 4:16, we also see Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden. So, see, he's he went out of the presence. It's interesting to know that at some point he he was actually in or about or around his presence, right? &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the presence of the Lord. The Lord spoke to him at some point too, right? And brother Brandham speaks in 62 in the message in his presence. It says, "May the Lord bless his word." I think that's the most striking scripture. We find that in the presence of God, men recognize themselves to be sinners. &gt;&gt; See, it's a it's a miracle for us to be able to even uh recognize. I remember when when um I actually for the first time, this kind of sounds like an oxymoron, but believe that I was a sinner, you know, because I was a sinner back then, living in sin. And I remember I had an uncle of mine who would testify and said, you know, um you're living in sin and all that. And and after a while, you know, you the first things you say is like, I'm not a bad person. I don't go robbing banks. I don't go doing that. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people say the same thing. And I said that I said that right. I justified myself. So I didn't believe I was a sinner. But when I first believed that I was a sinner or or or kneel or recognize like I say recognize that you're a sinner, that's a miracle. &gt;&gt; And I think that's when you're God's getting closer to you. You're getting closer to the Lord because that's got to come with his presence. It's got to be a miracle. &gt;&gt; We pray that over our children, right? of our youth that um when they're gone astray that may may God's presence go start working on them and then just bring that conviction &gt;&gt; that's we may feel pretty good when we're um out different places and feel like that we're pretty good people but whenever come into the presence of God then we see how little we are &gt;&gt; then we recognize right that we're sinners so enemies do perish at his presence we know um when my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. So picture this. It says, "As smoke is driven away, so dry them away. As wax melteth before the fire, they have no they stand no chance, right? Wax stands no chance before the fire. So let the wicked perish at the presence of God, &gt;&gt; you know, and that that's also your your enemies, your foes, you know, the the bad influences, the spirits that battle us." And I just think that God does that sometimes. He does that um to and I'm thankful that he does, right? Because our enemies are are are not flesh and blood. They're spiritual principalities. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that he can do that to our enemies. In Isaiah 64, it says, "As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causes the waters to boil to make thy name known to thy adversaries." &gt;&gt; Makes the name known to them. Can you imagine just them devils and then all of a sudden says I am the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They must flee. &gt;&gt; Says that the nations may tremble at thy presence. Tremble at this presence. So and here we have this is a pretty interesting question the Lord poses in Jeremiah 5 as a prophecy. He says fear ye not me say the Lord. Will you not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the mound of the sea by perpetual decree that cannot pass it. You know the the waves cannot actually go over that. And though the waves thereof to toss themselves, they yet they cannot prevail. Can they not prevail? Though they roar, they cannot they can. It says yet they yet can they not pass over it. So I just think the Lord um the Lord's presence is something to be uh you know reverence about because it it's a itself being coming near and manifesting. I I think Job u describes it here well. This is Job speaking for he perforth the the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him. It says therefore I am troubled at his presence. &gt;&gt; Right? See, when there's affliction, when there's such, you know, we we recognize when I consider, I'm afraid of him, for God maketh mine heart soft &gt;&gt; and the Almighty troubleth me. &gt;&gt; So, see, take don't take for granted, you know, now that you're a mature Christian and you can come into God's presence, you know, it came because of all of this. &gt;&gt; It came because of the Job experience. It came because, you know, his presence allowed us to recognize that we were sinners. came with that with with that growth and that progression and his self same presence is him right but the same god will come and separate divide and cause these uh these things to be moved away from our lives you know these costs of battle you know cause the nations to tremble against you know the god of Israel and such the god of Jacob it says in the bible as well but for you they know it starts then to realize you know but this is who I am think about like god coming in the presence and defending a little child of in front of a bully or something or big brother and you know he basically first comes and and he you know he strikes fear at the and mel like fire burns away you know at his presence and then the little boy goes like now he's afraid of the one that defended him and you basically says like I didn't know you can do that and then now he you know after your heart is soft and and you're troubled at him then then you're in a position to come approach his presence right in respect and reverence &gt;&gt; and then you can experience his sweet fellowship, his august presence, his comfort, all the the good the good benefits of his presence that come with the selfexisting one. Right? Psalm 68:8, the earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God. Even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, at the God of Israel. So this is in the natural, right? Tremble earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. See that no flesh should glory in his presence. Right. &gt;&gt; I I I can attest to that, right? It's not our flesh, of course, but that glory is in his presence. But boy, our soul, you know, that's been redeemed, regenerated from God. It does. It did say that his presence comes with a glory and an honor and strength and gladness and say uh I like this little section here about just one verse about so fleeing from the presence of a foolish man. So see the fresh the foolish man can also comes with the presence and it says go from the presence of the foolish man when thou perceiveth not in his lips um of it says when thou perceiveth not in his the lips of knowledge &gt;&gt; so that he there's no knowledge in his le lips the presence of god brings a conviction so that's that's uh one of the message quotes I have here is in his presence the same message in 62 but the random says then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in of his of coming to his presence. Somehow or another, it's always throwed a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God. I've seen the time in my ministry when you would see the presence of God come into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them, &gt;&gt; right? and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts. And it brings such a holy hush &gt;&gt; amongst the people till they drop out of the prayer line. Look at this illustration. Before they ever come out to be prayed for and run to the altar and get right with God, before they come unto his presence. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? And God's presence was so perfectly there &gt;&gt; next to the prophet when he was um in the uh discernment that the people just feared at his presence. You know, as they came close in the prayer line, can you picture that? They would just go to the they would just go to the altar and make it right first &gt;&gt; before they came in any much closer to that presence. See, there's something about coming into the presence of God. It causes things to happen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, either to the enemy or to the devils or, you know, to ourselves the believer as as we surrender to his presence. &gt;&gt; In Psalm 140 and 13, it says, "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name, the upright." So, this is not talking about the believer, right? Shall dwell in his presence. I love that word dwell because that word dwell is is it's um it's like a such a a um trusting word where you can be with someone but dwell means like you're sitting back taking off your shoes like in your house in your living room &gt;&gt; and and you're dwelling and when you're you're just at ease you're you're you're comforting and trusting the in whose presence you're in. &gt;&gt; I love dwelling you know. I love like a dwelling your home, right? It's it's it's a dwelling and and that is how we should abide or dwell in in God's presence. And this is the verse that we read uh just just a reminder, glory, honor in his are in his presence. Strength and gladness are in his place. Another of the opening scriptures. So, thou shalt show me. And we'll find here with Mary is that when the angel of the Lord um came from the presence of God, he says, "And I will show you things." I just love the revelation of God because it says here, "Thou will show me the path of life." &gt;&gt; He shows us the way that we should go where the life is in. In thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy right hand there are pleasures forever more. &gt;&gt; In this Psalm 17, he says, "Let my sentence or my vindication come from thy presence. Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. whether shall I go from thy from thy spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence? You know, if I go here, you're there. If you go up there, you're there. I just think that once you've been impregnated, right, once you've been um entrusted with God's presence and and experience God's presence, I believe it we're in there for the long haul because, you know, like I said, God's presence does bring a separation of division or it does bring a a fight. It does bring a burning that melts the enemies away and it does bring a trembling. It does bring an approach but you know once you go through all that it does bring that that that rest and that peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So rest in his presence here I have and he said my presence shall go with thee. This is to to Moses and I will give thee rest. &gt;&gt; So this a rest as a company as we talked about couple month a month ago on God's rest. So I just love that his presence comes with a rest something that you can again lay back dwell trust. See look I this verse is very dear because it says in Psalm 31:20, "Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence." So isn't that amazing? Is thy his presence being a secret place, right? In the secrets of thy presence from the pride of man, thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Isn't that a a a comfort comfortable place to be with to know that God hides them in the secret of his presence and from the pride of man and thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. I say, you know, sometimes I don't take that for granted what it's like just to be um covered, to be shielded uh from uh from a strife of man, from the strife of tongues, from the pride of man. You know, it's don't take it for granted, right? All the things you're that you've been um protected from that you all the comforts in knowing his presence. Cast me not away. Since I'm 51, you know, it's um created in me a new heart, oh Lord. Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me. &gt;&gt; That's everybody's prayer here. &gt;&gt; The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. See, in all their affliction, he was afflicted. Look at this. And the angel of his presence saved them. &gt;&gt; In his love, in his pity, he redeemed them. Isaiah. and he bar them and carried them all the days of old. &gt;&gt; All the good things God's presence does for them. You try it one time. It's it's wonderful when you just surrender and um it does take a it does take an effort, right? He had to go set aside and but boy, when you enter into God's presence through prayer, hearing the the preaching of his word, hearing a message, singing a song, &gt;&gt; hearing a song. That's that's what it's about is just being in contact with your heavenly father. The burden of Egypt. See, this is talking about the burden of Egypt. Behold, the the Lord writeth upon a swift cloud. We have a message. And shall come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be rem removed at his presence. &gt;&gt; This is what his presence does. And the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. I'm thankful that we have a word and a presence of God that the Lord can ride in a swift cloud and and that can melt away just move all the idols in our life, &gt;&gt; right? and that he can um he can melt the the presence of with our heart the heart of Egypt the heart of the world right get is melted in the in the the midst of it 2 Chronicles we have and all the kings of the earth sought the the presence of Solomon so this is the God's presence in a believer now you know someone that who trust in him to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart &gt;&gt; right So remember, we knew about God's wisdom. I mean, Solomon's wisdom, but God's presence was with him, with him. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful we have God's presence in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And greater than Solomon was here, said Jesus. Isn't that amazing? So approaching his presence as we wrap up here in 2 Chronicles, it it says, "And they dwelt therein and have built the sanctuary therein for thy name." So think about the word thy name saying if if when evil cometh. So this is the approach. If when evil cometh upon us as a sword or judgment or pestilence or famine or really bad things we stand before his this house and in thy presence and it says for thy name is thy in thy house in thy presence and cry out unto thee in our affliction then thou will hear and help. Isn't that amazing? The approach is it's repentance. It don't it does come through through that approach. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms with singing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. That's God's approach. And &gt;&gt; and here's the account on Mary. And the angel answering said unto excuse me, not Mary. Uh and the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel. that stand in the presence of God, and I'm sent to speak unto thee and to show thee glad tidings. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is just amazing how there's there's an angel that stand at his presence. And what it does is it reveals to show glad tidings in in Jude 24 uh to 25, we have now unto him, this is the last scripture here. So unto him that is able to keep thee from falling. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; And to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. &gt;&gt; To the only God our savior. He says to you only God our savior be glory and majesty, dominion and power both for now and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just as we wrap up here, God's presence um to the believer is something that it really comes with the with the goods. It comes with uh it it's where we're healed. It's where we're strengthened. It's where we're equipped. &gt;&gt; It's where we um God's word comes alive. It's when the uh you know, it's the it's the evidence that God is is near and with us, that he's he's still along the way encouraging us. And it's a visitation, right? It's a self it's self being ever present. And just to know that the God that created us all, created everything is is able to come and manifest in the believer and is able to come. And I love the word August presence because in Spanish, the word August means or austo means that you're very well comfortable. It actually means like you're comfortable, but you're like it's like expressing the the feeling that you get when you're comfortable. It's a it's like think about when you put that nice sweater or the nice coat on and it's just this August. It's uh it's amazing how brother Bon talk a lot about the August presence of the Lord and just really um comforting his people, you know, and uh we go through a lot. So, I'm thankful that we have God's presence to um make all things right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you, brothers. Have a wonderful service. Praise the Lord.
