========================================

[Music] love you bud I want to see you I to save you to see you high and lifted shining in the light of your glory for out your power and love we sing Oh Holy Holy high and lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as I sing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see you amen amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord you can turn to your uh Bible in your Bible if you have it the Joel chapter 1 verse one and then when you're going to read out of Joel chapter 2 verses 25 and 26 um it's good to be back with you we had a real good time in Ohio at the at the camp up the true word Tabernacle Camp I I felt like um you know brother Brandon when he went when he went to that Pentecostal meeting that first time he was like I I want to be identified with these people um you know there's some people that you know they represent the what you believe in a in a strange way and you just don't really want to be identified with them but there's some people that you do want to be identified and uh when you get around people that are are are wonderful and you see the spirit of God being manifested just uh sure does make you uh make you proud to believe what you believe amen and uh so this morning this afternoon I want to read from Joel chapter 1 let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word so grateful for that to know that your your spirit is still alive and moving Among Us Lord to make your word manifest and take it up off the page and make it a living reality and we believe Lord God that we're here to Manifest this word Lord in our lives we thank you God for the for your grace to us now and we just ask Lord that you'll show your grace to us tonight Lord be with us Lord Jesus to make these words real to us we ask in your name amen so Joel 1 ver1 says the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pethel hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the pommer worm hath l left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust Locust hath left hath a cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left ha the caterpillar eaten and then if we turn over in Joel chapter 2 he said I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that ha dealt wondrously with you and my peace shall never be ashamed my people shall never be ashamed God bless you can take your seats I I as I was meditating on this I was just just thinking about um you know how the power of God is still alive and well and his people and and how that this this tree that's being prophesied spoken of here in this story The Bride tree that uh you know God's got a promise here that it's supposed to be uh it it it God saw that it would be in in fullness and uh grown up with all the bark and all the leaves and all the different parts of it that's spoken of here that these four four bugs ate down and he's got a promise here that he'll restore to us he'll restore to you all those things all those years that the cankerworm and so forth ate down but you know if you take a picture of what that tree really looks like it's got It's got all the the the the leaves and the bark and everything all up and and then you've got fruit coming out and so that's the picture that God wants us to have in our mind that God wants to see a church with fruit he wants to see a bride with fruit where the power of God is actually so visible in her that you can benefit not just from leaves and not just from the doctrine but it's actually God manifesting and pushing up like like a tree drinking uh from the rivers of water drinking up pushing up until it's just pushing out putting out pushing out a manifestation of the word and the power of God in their day and so that's what this is really speaking of that in this day is prophesied that he will restore where where all these demonic bugs ate down down through the seven Church ages that God is going to restore all that back restore all not not just the doctrine not just some little bits and pieces but fully restore it fully restore it back to the way it was supposed to be in the beginning and and you think about you know what's going to take for us to said take a Rapture full restoration means that restoring the bride back to her position full restoration means taking the bride back to where and the the the position that God thought of her in the from the beginning that if she hadn't Fallen that if all of this this sin curse hadn't have been existed and everything that that that that she would be uh walking in power with dominion over the over the Earth dominion over the uh the uh dominion over the weather dominion over uh sickness dominion over every full power and so that's that's the position that God wants the the bride to be restored back to and you know that's that's what we're looking for because we've got to come to that and when we come to that that's when the Rapture will take place you want to you want to know well what what is the secret of taking a Rapture and brother Ram said oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is and see we even you know we preach about what we know what we're trying to come to to to a place where we know what our position is where where we know these things we know on the on paper the place that we're trying to come to what we're supposed to understand but when we really come to that place and when we really the word being built up built up in our lives until until this fruit tree this this tree is built up to a place where it's actually bearing forth fruit and it recognizes its position and you can see is position and it's visible I'm talking about the power of God moving in the church then we will go in a Rapture and and it's it's kind of uh we got to be careful though when we're preaching these things that we push it we it's we have a tendency to push it off way off in the future but I don't believe it's far off in the future I believe that down Through the Ages God has been building us up building us up and even over the last decades and so forth until we're coming to a place and we are now I believe where the son of man is actually being revealed and we you you know last time we were talking about speaking about restoration that Martin Luther had a part to play in restoration and and his understanding of what justification was that John Wesley had the part to play when he preached sanctification isza Street on up until we get to Elijah the Capstone message to bring what is it it's that brid tree being being restored back to its fullness again and we know the pattern of restoration is there in 1 Thessalonians 416 where it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now that's the message that brother random brought the message that went out and with the voice of the Archangel and that's when the bride begins to realize what she begins to realize what the message is talking about that's the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and there's your body change so you've got that pattern with the Trump of God and the dead and Christ shall rise first so it's restoring God give us a message to restore our faith to to restore our faith and as our faith is restored it restores our character it restores the power of God in our life it restores the spirit working in the church again so that you've got like nine River nine nine fountains pumping out from the spirit of God to Bear forth nine spiritual fruits nine spiritual gifts all being displayed in the church now that's what God wants to see he wants to see the power of God being made manifest in you and I and that's what restoration is restore means to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place oh don't you love those strong words that brother random uses if a claim is made on something then you can enforce it now now you see that's the role of a minister in the church that when you can look into the word and see what your claim is and if there's somebody that's that's got a devil on them or somebody that's B in under the influence of a spirit or somebody that's in a sin condition you got a right to enforce that you've got a right as a mother or father when you get on your knees to enforce the claim you've got a right to enforce it and how do you have that right if you've got the token you've got the right to every promise of God if you got the token you think about brother R told this story about um you know ailec there in the Bible that that Abraham told his little phib and and gave his gave his wife over to ailec and there is Sarah in AMC's house and and God gave aimc that dream in the middle of the night and he came to him and said because of the Integrity of thy heart I will hope withheld thee from sinning against me and he said now therefore restore the man his wife and brother Ram uses that as an example of he he's he he he kept he kept Sarah he kept Sarah away from aimc he and He restored him back to him and restore means take back to the original he took Sarah and he took her back to where where she was supposed to be and that's what God is doing Us in this age he's restoring us back to the right mind to our right he's taking away our spiritual Amnesia he's restoring us back to the to so that we're looking at the scripture the right way he's restoring us back to where the spirit and power of God can actually move through Us in the right way now you you think so many stories in scripture of where the people were restored back to to a place where they were you know they left when they went down into Babylon they were restored back when the children of Israel went down into Egypt they were restored back they were brought back to their Promised Land oh you think about now that the state of my this is a lesson and state of mind when they got back Joshua placed them where they were supposed to be and that's a type of exactly what's happened in today the Holy Ghost is putting us exactly where we're supposed to be in God's word and you see we're all moved by The Same Spirit it's the same Spirit manifesting himself in different ways in us but one might be have a gift of wisdom and one might have a gift of tongues and one might have a gift of interpretations and on and on one might have a gift of helps and and different things but it's all God moving through the church and he'll put us into our positions and how is he putting us in our position positionally placing Us by the word oh and when you realize where you're that you're in your spot in your spot now I'm not talking about your job I'm talking about in your spot by the word the word placing you so that you're dressing right and you're walking right and you're doing right and you're living right and you got you got your Temperance and you got your virtue and you got your patience and everything's placed right and now you're placed placed like the Israelites were back into the Promised Land by Joshua by the Holy Ghost now you got Ephraim over where he's supposed to be and you got Manasseh over where he's supposed to be and then you see that solves so many problems because that's that's so many so many spiritual problems are caused by when we're not where we're supposed to be when we're not I'm I'm talking about the word now I'm not talking about our job now I'm talking about the word where we're not if you're not if if you're not in your soul if you're not born again right there'll all be something that ain't right and if you're not if you're not adopted there'll all be something something that you're battling out it ain't right but when God gets you right in your spot when God places you that's when that's when all the jealousy and everything stops that's when all the enmity stops you know I I think so many times that people will look at people will look at a real born again Christian or somebody that's living right and doing right and so many times the devil will rise up and his reaction will be well I hate that person that person thinks that they're that person thinks that they're better than me that person thinks that something else but you know what many times what it is is that that God has just place that person and they can't they can't help being a real lamb they can't help being a real Dove they are what they are they are what God made them and there's going to be baums and and judases and AMCs and all kinds of things rise up and poke and make fun but but you you are what you are and it's not because of something you did but because that God has changed you changed your character now there's a bride tree there's a bride tree I'm talking about where God pumps fills you with his spirit and he's just moving just just filling every fiber of your being until you can be like Jesus on the cross and everybody hates you and crucifying you and mocking you and scourging you and everything but you stand there and you you oh that's that's real Godly character when you can love the devil when you can love somebody that hates you my wife and I we had a little a little talk earlier today about how all the things that the devil can't do and you know the devil can't love brother that's what brother Ram said the devil can't love like I'm talking about real Godly love the devil can't bring the word by word which means he can't he can't manifest it he can't man he's always got to fake it everything the devil does is a fake so he can't love he can't but but God can love God can love God can love the devil God can love I'm I'm talking about not he he can like G you look at Jesus on the cross there when they were they poking him in the side and all those things but yet his reaction was father forgive him father father forgive them oh you the devil can't do that the devil can't do that but God can God can Manifest this word and that's the brid tree that I'm talking about that that the your purpose in life is to Manifest this word to be a to be a conduit for the Fountain and power of God and you see that I I was thinking about that story of the little African slave that when he when he come over uh and he knew he knew where he come from and he wasn't ashamed of it and see that's that's the position that God wants us to be is to not be all downtrod and have our head down and and where everybody's beating up on us but to know know and confidence where you come from and that's not pride and that's not arrogance to be confident and and like Ephraim Ephraim in his homeland this is my property this is where I'm supposed to be and manasseh's over there he's got his and manasse bless bless him he's where he's supposed to be you see where the Devil comes in is where you start comparing in yourself to the other person now that's where the devil gets in now that that's the definition of pride is when you start comparing yourself to the other person that is the definition of pride pride is when you say I'm better than that person or when you say I'm not as good as that person CU When you say I'm not as good as that person or I you know that person's got a little bit more favor or whatever then you start that you start get that's where jealousy starts coming in jealousy and enity where you're comparing yourself oh but God wants us to know to be positionally placed and recognize I I'm where I'm supposed to be I'm doing what I'm supposed to be now you see even even uh you we've SE we've seen that happen at at camps you know sometimes you go to camps and and that's where the devil really get in where these young people they don't have the Holy Ghost so they have no defense so they get there and they start compare and they're they know they recognize many times that there's something wrong in their in their life and in their heart but they'll see somebody else that they think has a little bit more joy than them and they start to hate them they start to lash out at them oh but if we'll just get if we'll just get our own house straight if we'll just get our own our own place in order and and then and then everything will take care of itself get get our own door swept and then then you can be like Ephraim or you can be like manasse and say well I'm where I'm supposed to be and that's where you'll find that you got real Joy real Joy comes I'm talking about Holy Ghost fill Joy is where God give you his joy and God give you his peace and God give you his comfort and then you can Bank all of your hopes and everything on him not on something that you've done not on something that you've got to do or not on your whether your friends like you or not oh that's where we get so messed up so many times is we'll we'll base everything on how many people like us or how many people B Pat us on the back or how many people how many people all those kind of all those external things but if we'll get along with God in our prayer closet and get along with him and get a relationship with God that's what we need that's what we need in our lives to get along with God and get things settled that way I think that's what brother R was talking about when he preached about desperations if we get desperate enough with God and say well I I want I want to know this God that I've heard preached about at camp and preached about at church on Sunday morning and preached about I want to know it for myself cuz that's the way I come I heard I I grew up in a message I had a minister the other day said well you were raising the message you never were out in the world and I said listen listen I had to find Jesus for myself just because you were raised in the message didn't mean that boom you just automatically were in come on you got to find God for yourself and I found him on my knees I found him like looking through the word for myself and I found him and that's where I get my joy from not because somebody likes me or somebody Pats me on on the back or somebody thinks I'm a good preacher or not a good preacher none of that matters but all the only thing that matters is what God thinks about me that's the only thing that matters and when you find that Joy you don't have to be ashamed of where you come from you don't have to walk around with a mock humility where well I I get I don't know I don't know you don't have to put on something you can be like that African slave and say I know who my daddy is I know that my Daddy's got a Cath cattle on a thousand heels I know where I come from and you know that'll give you peace and joy and comfort on the inside and you know the thing is the thing this is how the devil works if you don't have joy on the inside if you don't have a rock then you will lash out at other people and and why because there's something wrong on the inside and and you you're trying to get your joy from somewhere and that's what you that's always show love to people cuz that's why people act the way they do sometimes is they're trying to find joy and there's something wrong in their heart and they're trying to find it and many times they find it by trying to take it from somebody else they're dissatisfied in their heart and they try to take it from somebody else by putting them down or belittling them or calling them names bullying them calling them names cuz there's something lacking in their life and that ain't nothing to hate my friends that's something to love you ever see somebody that's that's in a spot like that you put your arms around them and you know in the Christian way and and show them love because they're looking for something they're thirsting for something and where are they going to find that from you where are they going to find that from the bride tree they they need that from the they need that from the they they're looking for the the shelter under the leaves of the brid tree they're looking for the rustling of the stirring of the wind under the leaves of the Bri brid tree they're looking for some of that sweet nectar some of that fruit to get that apple or whatever the fruit is off of that bride tree and and and partake of that and they're looking for you they're looking for what you've got oh pride is when you think you're better or worse than the next fell but if we can just be happy with how God made us that that's that's what plagues that's what plagues the church I we were up there and brother Josh Bennett he was preaching on do you he he said people asked me before when you hear another preacher preaching that does that make you jealous and he got to preaching on that he said no we're all on the same team look see because it's a it's a state of mind when you when you get when you get in your right place when you realize what God has called you for you're not basing your experience and your life on whether how you compare to somebody else how you compare to somebody El do do they like them more than they like me do they does that is that person happier than me they got a nicer car than me they got nicer clothes on and on and on they got they got more friends on social media they get more likes than me on and on and on and and that will torment you it'll be a torment to your mind it will grieve your mind but oh if you get along with God and let him take all that away it'll change everything change every that's what I I I that's why faith is a rock it's the rock that everything is anchored to and if if you get into a place get into a straight where you don't know which way to turn why don't you just let down that anchor until it can grip a hole to the Rock and anchor your life and anchor your life so that you're not movable by what somebody else thinks about you oh God if we could get away from that who cares what somebody else thinks about me whether somebody got more likes or more views them or this or that I want Jesus I want to know that I'm positionally placed in his word and that's where I am just be happy with how God Made You and the part of his word that you are predestinated to fulfill do you know that every one of us are predestinated to fulfill a part of his word every one of us here are predestinated to be to fulfill a part of his word you've got a part to play and I've got the part to play and the devil will get in and say well if you're fulfilling the part that I want then I'm going to be jealous of you and that's oh cast down all those imaginations cast down all that stuff but God is restoring us back to a place where we can have we can have confidence in where we are that now that's real Christian maturity where we're supposed to be he's restoring what's he doing he's restoring God is restoring everything that the devil has taken away he's restoring us back restoring us back to a place where the devil can't mess with us anymore that's what that's what God wants us to when the Devil comes to you and say well I I don't think you should like that brother I don't think you should like him I I I think you're better or worse all those kind of things cast that down and recognize it recognize that it's a trick of the devil and cast that down cast it down you know if you got joy you really want to give it away that's why when we GRE one another at church we say God bless you cuz that's a Christian's desire that God will bless you we greet one another at door it ain't just some some saying that we say we're we're grabbing each other by the hand and the brothers gra hugging each other around the neck and say God bless you because that's our desire that's sure my desire I want to see I want to see the church blessed I want to see people blessed if you're being restored you want to see your brother restored that's right if you're being restored if you're being brought up to a place of maturity you want to see the same thing for your brother so that's not that's what we're talking about this morning or this afternoon this tonight is we're not talking about reforming we're talking about restoration not reforming not patching things up but restoration all the way back to the way it was in the beginning to reform something means like if I got a car um my son-in-law Micah he's always working on his car he's got a truck that the engine just fell out or something and see that's what happens when you reforming it you you you're going you're going to uh go go on the internet and you're going to buy some souped up muffler or something or whatever it is I don't know nothing about cars but you're going to buy the the that that nice new Chrome thing and put it in there and then then you might be riding down the road like he was one time he's going might be listening and hear me talking about it walking riding down the road and all of a sudden part of it falls out and you're stranded for 6 hours what trying to fix it cuz it was reformed it's not restored it's it's patched up things are it uh you know the door might be painted a different color and and you you keep adding on and adding on and it's and you're you're making improvements you're making improvements but you're not bringing it back to the original you see that's why Martin Luther and John Wesley were reformers they were making improvements Martin Luther was like he's like I can't talk quite so much fully about against the pope like he still had those things about the pope and he's trying to improve the Catholic church and things he couldn't quite uh you know he got out of it but there was still some things that lingering the trinitarian doctrine and so forth he improved it but he didn't take it all the way back all the way back to the original and John Wesley improved it some more and theza Street improved it some more oh but that's why we needed a profit not to just improve it not to just patch it up a little bit where you might have a problem running down the road or something but he he took it all the way back to the very beginning to restore it and why did it have to be restored so the full power of God could work in the church and so that's what we're that's what we're looking for we're we're not looking for just just to know a lot of information but we're looking to see that brid tree restored that's that's my expectation I'm expecting the power of God in my life I'm expecting the gifts to be manifested I'm I'm expecting the nine the nine gifts the nine fruits and all all the different things to be manifested in the church cuz that's what restoration means full restoration means a return back to the original teachings of of Jesus Christ free from all of that influence of denominational systems full restoration means Act full access to the nine spiritual gifts that are manifested in the church healing prophecy all those things oh I'm I'm talking about I we we were uh Lily and Z were sharing with us how Lily's brother broke his arm broke his shoulder and the church prayed for him he had just had an x-ray that his his shoulder was just tow up I'm going to say it in the southern style it was tow up and and and they prayed over his shoulder and and it was healed God healed it now see that's returning back that's building up our expectation that that's what we should be expecting we should be expecting like like that Vision brother brandom had of the people going into that little room that when they come out their arms were restored their legs were restored whatever was wrong why because the power of God was restored back into the church full restoration means brings genuine Brotherly Love among Believers genuine Brotherly Love where you're not so interested in who's up and who's down and who's against you and who's for you but you love regardless and that's something my friends that the devil cannot do the devil cannot manufacture that the devil what what is it the devil cannot make the word live he cannot make he cannot bring the word word by word and he can't bring he can't manifest any of the things on this wall back here he can't manifest it he can't manifest love he cannot do it now he might be able to fake it sometimes like we know the story of the the kind old priest where he'll pay for for your your ticket he'll pay for your hospital bill he'll do all those things but brother brandham said if you go back and listen to how brother Bram framed it we don't we're not looking for a kind old priest but we're looking for the word to be manifested not just somebody to look like they're on a children's television show grinning and playing the banjo and that kind of thing that's not Christianity but we're looking for the word to be manifested the word to be manifested in Power full restoration brings a a position where faith in God's word is reaffirmed why cuz it's positionally placing you and full restoration brings genuine joy and peace genuine joy and peace where you're satisfied like the children of Israel that were placed in their Homeland you're satisfied with where the word has brought you and you can eat the old corn of the land you can eat and be satisfied with everything that God has given to you and full restoration brings genuine Divine fellowship and it brings healing through the rights given by Jesus's sacrifice because the scripture says by his stripes we are healed and it gives it brings power and authority over demonic forces in other words we ain't got to take nothing from the devil when the devil tries to take your joy and tries to take your peace you just give it right back to him because he has no power when Christ is here when full restor restoration is here so Resto restoration means to bring it back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition brother Brown said in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore you you know what I think that means that that should give us confidence that when we go in prayer that God has given us a right to call for the restoration of our family to call for the restoration of our children now I think so many times we we just we're we're honestly we're slack about it and you know we we come and we hear preachers preach about it but oh if we'd really get desperate and really get sincere about it we'd find out that God would move I I can tell you so many times in my life you know raising raising children you'll find out that they start slipping and sliding and doing stuff that makes you grieved in your heart and and and it makes you come to a place of desperation and where you you've got to respond in faith and you have a right to resp you have a right to do that you and oh if we can have confidence when we come like Paul said to come boldly to the throne of grace knowing that he is the high priest of our confession in other words he's going to take take whatever we say whatever we pray in faith and he's going to take it like a priest behind the veil and make it manifest make it actually act because he's bringing our sacrifice he's bringing our sacrifice of praise like a high priestwood he's actually performing what we confess and so we when we confess in faith believing that there's a law that we can enforce by the power of the Holy Ghost it will go to work it will do what the word says that's what brother Ram said he said we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us you see we we get we get tied up sometimes we want the minister to do it for us or we want somebody else to have the faith for us but you can have that kind of Faith you can have that kind of Faith Like hadie Wright did that that caused her children to fall over her knees and receive their salvation it it is I'm I'm I'm not preaching a a hope so maybe I'm preaching if you believe it will happen that's the kind of faith that we've got to you know Peter he was sitting there watching Jesus walk on the water and he didn't I often wondered why didn't all the others stand up but Peter stood up and said well if Jesus can do it I can do it too and he stepped out of that boat and you if you look at scripture that way if the word says whatever you say brother R said God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to theur Church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan say give it back and he has to do it he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it oh you realize what that means is the Holy Ghost is backing up his word and when you come believing the Holy Ghost is there to back it up and make it perform so that means we've got a right to Salvation and you got a right to claim salvation for your children you we we've been studying on job how job was watching his children do all of their things and every day he offered up a sacrifice and you know you can go to go offer up your sacrifice of your incense of praise and worship and prayer over your children and it will actually influence them in their lives and and guide them but why because you're confessing and praying and laying your confession before God you've got a right to Salvation and you've got a right to Healing you got a right to it and the devil wants to take your rights away but this message and this gospel that I'm preaching is to take back everything that the devil's trying to steal from you if you're sick in your body or you're sick in your mind you got a right to take it back we've got a right to deliverance and we've got a right to Restoration and we've got a right to the Holy Ghost and brother R say the law of the land is to enforce and the law of the spirit is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people but God made us in His image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them oh I think if we really would apply that scripture rightly we'd take things seriously when we got down on our knees in prayer believing that the things that we pray and the things we confess and the things that we say and do will actually have an impact because you got a right you got a right by the token of holy ghost that God has given to you you got a right to use it you got a right to use it like a policeman that says stop devil you can't come in here and tab my kids you got a right to do it you got a right to Dell the devil he got he's got to get out and where does it say in the Bible that the church is given the rightful legal rights it said it's in Genesis 1 12627 God said let us make man in our image so you were made in the image of God after our likeness and let them have dominion so you were predestinated to have dominion over what over everything over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that means every serpent every every slimy slithery thing that wants to get in your house you are predestinated to have dominion over that thing it creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him and male and female created he them and that is what God wants to restore to you he's trying to bring you back to a place where you have that kind of dominion where the power of God is working in you like that and you know it and and and that is your joy and that is your peace you recognize it and you know where you come from like that African slave and you know you know who your daddy is and that is your joy and your peace that nobody can take away from you God wants to restore that to you God is in the restoration business brother Ram was telling that story about how brother evans's car was stolen and and he said so we got down on our knees and he asked the question see see what power you've got that you might not be taken advantage of they got down on their knees and the Holy Ghost began to work and brought back that car that was stolen from them now what'll happen if you and I get down on our knees and begin to call out to God in faith not beg and you don't have to beg but I'm telling you what I believe in fellowship with God I Believe In Worship with God I don't believe in prayer as a mandate to your salvation but I believe in getting along with God and fellowshipping and worshiping and telling him that I believe his word and laying his word out where he can see I believe and saying God you said it now bring it to pass you do that and watch it watch and see if restoration won't happen just like it did for that car now he said now Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for he was the word but now we're not the word and you know in Matthew chapter 18:19 it says this is the prayer that a lot of times you'll hear the ministers praying over people when they come up for prayer if two of you shall agree on Earth now you think about this if two of you that means if me and brother Louise agree for something if me if you and your wife if there's a need in your home and you agree like brother Ram said he said that used two they'd get together on New Year's Eve him and his wife and they' grabbed each other's hands and they'd pray over the Bible that God will give them a good next year that God will be with their home and they get to pray and now it's just them two if just two of you agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven why for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them to agreeing oh you see what power we have that you've got a right to claim the promises of God and and don't cow down maybe tonight later on this evening you maybe these thing these words will kind of fall from your remembrance and you'll get all caught up in the world and caught up in how your children are doing but don't do that I I want you to really let this fall down like a rock in your heart when when things get rough and condition get all all around and you begin to wonder what's up and what's down and and you see your children going out in the world and different things don't forget that you got a right to claim restoration and and we ain't just repeating words in a dictionary we are we are speaking what God actually spoke and with confidence that he is going to take those things that we speak and perform them just like they did when they were calling for the restoration of brother evans's car and you do it with your husband or with your wife or maybe gather around your children around the coffee table and you call for whatever needs you have now if we'd start our day off like that if we'd end our day like that how much more fulfilling and joyful and peaceful would our lives be if we'd start off like the Bible says and brother Brown said what is it he said that Holy Spirit come upon that driver of that car condemned him and he turned around about halfway what is it enforcing enforcing you got to do it Satan you got to get out Satan you got to let go Satan you got to give in Holy Ghost is here to enforce see that's it he said that's what it's talking about restore it bring it back to its right owner and that's what the restoration of the Bride tree is all about restoring her faith restoring the faith of the Bride to enforce restoration we've got a right this morning or this afternoon brother Brown's saying this morning I'm just reading the quote to enforce the claim of God so if the devil took something from you take it back amen oh you think about all the things this sitting here this afternoon that the devil might have taken from us you might might be sitting here maybe you don't have any joy and and maybe you're maybe you're in that spot where you're trying to take joy from somebody else and and it's because the devil has taken your joy but why don't you take your joy back from him because you got a right to do it that's right how do you do it you get along with God and and let your faith go to work say I I don't have no joy but I want it and get along with God until something happens start start looking at at the word of God open up your Bible and just spend 30 minutes every day and start going through the pages and say I I I don't understand it but yet I'm just going to read it I've seen it have an effect in other people's lives and I'm just going to read it a and and and you watch something begin to take place read it with faith because we got a holy ghost right to enforce our claim that's right brother R say the only way that he can work the Holy Ghost is when you let him work you got to believe it That's the Law believe it and it will work believe it and it will work it will work how many times brother R said take the gospel medicine have you taken the gospel because if you haven't taken the gospel you can't say that it doesn't work if you take the medicine it's going to work you got to take the medicine he said verily verily I say un you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go under my father it's going to work you you think about so many promises in the Bible that are about the word manifesting in the hearts and lives of the people that's what the brid tree is about Greater Works than these shall you do that the works of Christ will be performed in his bride why cuz the law was in US yeah he brother Brown would he T us that a fish has got a law in him where he can go and he can go I I was looking at pictures of these deep sea fish you know the strange looking things that go down way in the bottom of the ocean way way down many many leagues down way down until pressure is just pressing in and and brother Brandon framed it up he said that there's a law in a fish like that that he can do that CU it's part of him that he can go way down and all the pressure and just you know they tried to do that with that submarine where they they went down and it just blew up on them so we we can't do that but the fish is made like that that where he can do that see he's got a law in him now if a law was in that fish to be able to withstand the pressure what about if there's a law in you that law that brother R's talking about the law the law to take back the law to raise up when it's down the law to restore he said there's a law in Christ and that law is in men you can bury them to the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lowest tail there's a law of the spirit of God that will raise him up again you know there a law in birds that that some birds can climb way up high you look at we we were riding to church this afternoon we saw a Hulk up on the on the foam pole and there's all kinds of hwks around because we've got chickens in the backyard so there's always Hawks coming around and a Hulk can fly real high but it can't fly like an and brother Brown told us there's certain kind of birds you know like that that can fly is they'll just try to keep flying up up up but they get to a certain spot and they just can't go any higher but if there's a law in you that's comes by hearing the word for this age you can go just as high as the eagle profit because you're hearing the same word oh you find you find that even in in the gospel you'll find that certain people they're they can only go so high now that's a a horrible thing to say is't it sounds like a horrible thing to say but they can only go so high maybe they can go as high as being born again well they can only go as high as the virtues oh but God has predestinated Us in this age to take that that eagle anointing and soar up into the Mysteries and climb and climb and climb until the word becomes a living reality those Mysteries become a living reality to us and and and and the bride tree is rest restored in this age the spirit and the truth are here to bring full restoration full restoration back you know when the sun comes up in the spring every winter everything freezes over and everything gets Frozen and and it looks like there there's nothing there it's just death even nature testifies of restoration but then Here Comes the Sun and the shines its warmth on everything and you see that first Little Flower come up and it starts rising up and all everything that the winter killed in the sun restores it's the sun coming back to warm everything up and what does it do brother said it forces it to come back it forces it to come up the rising of the sun forces life it forces restoration and brother R would say it forces death in other words death's got to go when the sun comes it forces death out of the picture cu the Sun is there the nearing of the Son of God in these last days come into his church restores it back to life again and brother Bram would say he said God restores his flowers his leaves his nature his seed of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation he will restore his Eden he will restore everything that death killed that's right now the only way it can ever remain dead is let it lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life again so if we can just get in the right place oh God said everything all of his laws in motion that it must according to his own word it must work according to his own word his word his word is how he's he's he's restoring he's restoring the bride by his word and that's the reason the law of life was in Christ so I think brother Brown said it is time for restoration he said he planted a fruit tree he planted it on the day of Pentecost and he brought that tree there for a purpose you know what that tree represented it represented a tree with character a tree with the character of Christ brother Ram said in that early church age when that when that when that gospel tree was planted on the day of Pentecost they had all these virtues in there all these qualifications they had all those character that's what God is looking for he said this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds and I'm going to be closing here in just a moment he said which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost I I thank God that that's the kind of tree he planted a tree that's not puffed up with how much it knows a pre a tree that's not trying to take joy from somebody else a tree that's not trying to poke or bully or prod but you know brother R always compared it the nature of Christ to like a little lamb that ain't got nothing to take but all it does is just give whatever it's got it gives and he compared also that that little lamb would be led by a dove a dove that it can't eat nothing rotten it can't eat nothing but filthy and and it's just we we were looking at out at the bird feeder the other morning and and Monica's got her little her bird seeds and all that stuff and those was two little doves come up and doves are so we were just got to talking about just watching how doves when they mate they mate for life it's two that they just stick together and both the all those other little birds coming around Cardinals and different kind of birds but here are those two little doves coming together and you could tell the nature of a dove just a little sweet little pure animal and it probably if you went out and grabbed it it'd probably just give its life freely and you know that's why in the old testate doves were sacrificed because it was acceptable to God it just it was just just a little animal willing to give and those animals a little Dove and a little lamb typify the nature of Christ and that's the kind of nature nature that God is going to have in his bride a little simple simple I think so many times we we get to think it in our mind that the nature of a Christian's got to be something else than what the Bible says but the nature of a Christian is got has got to match those those those types that were laid out here in the scripture just a little simple Dove just a little simple lamb a little lamb that was willing to like like uh Monica's always told those stories about her family when they used to kill the Lambs in the middle of the night and and they'd be uh there at the family they they wouldn't cry they just offer theirself up freely now that's the nature of a Christian the nature of a Christian is not to fight and fuss but to just that's why we don't argue over Doctrine we'll stand for what's right we'll stand for truth but we're not going to beat each other over their head over it because the same God that revealed what I believe is able to reveal it to you and it no matter how much we beat up over each other over the head about it it ain't going to change the fact that God has got to reveal it to you and God is God is the revealer god is the one that can reveal and so that's the the real character of life that is being built up in the church down through 2,000 years that's being molded and and through reformers until finally God sent a prophet to bring us back to the original Faith the original word that will produce the original character the same character of Christ that would stand for truth in the temple when he tipped over tables but also would say father forgive him on the cross when they struck him on the cheek oh that's what I want I want the the same life and the same character that's the same nine fruits nine fountains bubbling up pumping out the same love the same Joy the same longsuffering the same gentleness oh you think about what that means gentleness kind gentle gentle with one another gentle and longsuffering longsuffering patient with one another patient to wait for somebody that maybe wrestles with the truth that doesn't come to it immediately maybe it's they're looking for Joy so they strike out at other people but because a real Christian is long suffering they can deal with it gentleness and goodness goodness is that moral and integrity and the desire to always do good for others you're you're just want to do good like a little lamb a little Dove a little lamb or little Dove and Faith you just believe no matter if somebody strikes you on the cheek or somebody's rough and horrible with you but yet you just believe you just you keep coming to church you keep ride on cuz you believe a Believer is what you are and that's what you're going to do cuz you got faith and now those are the nine spiritual gifts the nine mind meekness humility strength under control you got an humble spirit and humbleness is not weakness but humbleness is recognizing like Ephraim or manasse I'm where I'm supposed to be I'm not putting myself above somebody and I'm not putting somebody myself beneath somebody but I just I just am what I am and I need God and you need God and and that's all there is to it and that's I'm just humble and Temperance self-control and those nine spiritual gifts what is it it's the character and the nature of Christ God wants us to have character he wants our character to be on display he wants us to be like him and as we close the musicians come forward that's what the scripture means when it says he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and brother Randon would say there's been different seasons it's the season of the message for your day when you hear the word for your day you manifest the fruit for That season you're actually manifesting it and so what is your fruit your fruit is the word that you've heard actually manifested in your life to produce the same character of the word that you you've heard there it is nine different Springs feeding into him and there you've got a real a real powerful real Christian Church that's manifesting the same original life restored back to the beginning the same Life of Christ is in the church again God bless you Saints let's rise to our feet and and just worship him a little bit the sun it will never go
