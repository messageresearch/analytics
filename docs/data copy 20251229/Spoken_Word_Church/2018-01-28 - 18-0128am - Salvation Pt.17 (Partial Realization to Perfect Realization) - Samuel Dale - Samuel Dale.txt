Jonah 2 and 9 and 10 and then we're going to Hebrews 10 good to see the visitors with us this morning we always say to you when you come here one time you're a visitor you come two times you're just part of us because we don't have anything to join up with we just part of the body of Christ we've got a lot of sickness among us now so remember to pray for each one my wife she's having troubles they gave her some antibiotics the other day to try to help her with her congestion and things and it just reverted different and gave her headaches and she's been having trouble with that for a few days and not able to sleep or anything else so just pray at the Lord we would touch her it take care of remember - this coming Saturday will be the Bible study so remember that got a long list coming down so remember each one brother direct called an old Terrance had already covered these but he called from the Philippines and I don't know where the his brother-in-law is over there over here we don't know which way but his brother Dan all passed away and so just remember to pray for that now sister Janet helm as far as we know life's notice they're supposed to operate on her tomorrow for gallbladder she had a an attack yesterday and everything but they thought it might have been in the heart they run her through everything everything was okay but they did say that she had gallbladder problems and so just remember that - brother Louise he's over preaching for brother gene Williams today so remember that and pray for him - Lord would bless him take care of him Lord willing brother Bob will be preaching for us this coming Wednesday he's back there in the office getting a getting the message because what I said I got a whole lot of different ones so if I leave anybody out don't don't think I done it but we just brother Daugherty will be starting treatments there sometime maybe this week or 1st of next week so remember that I guess that's pretty close to all of them at least enough anyway so gives you something to pray for all right but just for if the Lord would bless all of these and we know that around the world even today everybody I was reading the other day where there were so many cases of just colds and flus and stuff like that in the United States that were just really from what I'm looking at it was almost everybody in the whole thing was sick of one thing or another you know there's so much going because that's the day in the hour that we're living all right father we thank you for your grace and your love Lord and we thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us now as we speak about you Lord and we pray that as we speak about you then you would come upon the scene and there our hearts and our lives and quicken your word unto us and Lord if you'd got us we know you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe it for all of these that are sick and operations they're facing and different things that are taking place we pray that you be with each one and let your love be made manifest and Lord forgive our sins because we want to be covered and just kept into thy grace have your way we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Jonah we've been speaking about salvation so we've been reading this from the Book of Jonah 2 and 9 but I will sacrifice unto the with a voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land let's go to Hebrews I hope we can get over into this enough but Hebrews 10 I wish you would read 9nt and we might pick up a little bit of it in a little bit but it would give you a better thought of what we're trying to bring Hebrews 10 one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect now Washington let's seize all of that is back there they shattered under the law and the things you know that it couldn't do it couldn't keep it now you don't have to turn to do it but all I want to read in between here of Hebrews 9 and verse 8 he's talking about the Holy Ghost signifying that the way into the holiest of all way-o was not yet made manifest while the first Tabernacle was yet standing all right we'll get back to that in a minute but just bringing into that Scripture all right verse 2 for then would not day how ceased to be offered see if it done if it worked you would only had it one time right then would have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged from heard should have had no more conscience of sins but in these sacrifices there is a remembrance again made us sins every year in other words it had to make a sacrifice ever year right it wasn't just a one you can go on down through the description find out Jesus Christ died once for all to take care of it alright but we're not getting to that point we're trying to hold to and verse 4 says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins you may be seated the Lord had blessing to the reading of the word now trying to bring a point that will be very valuable later on as we begin to speak about salvation speak about the new birth because that's where we're going on into we're going into the new birth we're going in to the things of the scriptures that you must be born again we're going out into adoption the Lord willing and where was Wade was saying their last Sunday he said you know daddy's doing this and I'm doing that if you take what we're doing I'm down here below this is the new birth I'm down here trying to come up to here he's up here trying to go on up that way so it'll all tie together if you just listen and think about the things that are saying because he's in the seals and going on into things and maybe one of these days I'll get ready and start up a little bit and move up kind of to the understanding arm but now remember what we've been talking about we've been talking about the fact that the Old Testament it had a form of salvation but that form of salvation was under the blood of bulls and goats right and Jesus Christ had not been crucified and that's why I read that Scripture in Hebrews nine and eight that while that Tabernacle while that atonement was in place of the Old Testament they had to go back and do over every year offer offerings every year but see when you come to the New Testament and you come to Jesus Christ you find that if he offered once for all see so he paid for all of the sins of the Old Testament because that back tire was that those sins could not be told annihilated they could only be covered by the blood of bulls and goats because there was no life in the animal to be able to come back up on the believer to cleanse him and make him right but it was a capo as you call it a covering to her that it pushed all of those sins of mankind was pushed over to Calvary and that's why I said that scripture says he awful was offered once alright he paid the price for all of it we'd had to come over to that time or while it was in existence of the Old Testament see then they were under a partial realization of salvation we'll get to that later in the message trying to bring out they were under what we were using the words potential or potentially they because it was speaking of what was to come all right so we know that John 739 speaks of Jesus Christ and it says that the way in and other words up to the Holy of Holies let's just read that and then we'll get it they don't have to pull it up at will we'll get this John 1:7 alright I want these two scriptures put together with you the one in the Hebrews where it says you know that they couldn't it didn't change so I want these to read together but it says in in John 7 and 39 but this spake he of the Spirit which today that believe on him should receive now listen for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so in the Old Testament now keep that and read it with the word we were in in Hebrews all right read it where we were in Hebrews 9 and verse 8 the Holy Ghost does signifying verse 7 talks about the priests going in and offering the sacrifices for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signified that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first test tabernacle was yet standing right now so we know that you know we always talk about Old Testament New Testament all right and we talk about doing those praying at the park and I I'd like to say that because you know you can say to most people you know turn to the first book of the New Testament they'll turn to Matthew well let's see Matthew is not the first book of the New Testament yeah but brother Dale it says in my Bible he says right there New Testament you know well that doesn't mean it that way it just means that's where mankind put it because that's what he thought the first book of the New Testament is the book of Acts because the Bible said to testator see there was no way to have a New Testament until you had to death of the testator right you can't have a New Testament until the death of that testator and I always make it plain like this people say oh see we Baptist was oh we're not under the Old Testament the Lord we're under the New Testament you know well we were out over here in this New Testament and they always ask him say well heard that start well it starts - Matthew now as I say in our last week see the Bible says in Galatians our that Jesus Christ you know there was no way he could be the testator until he died it had to be he had to give his life all right and then giving his life and being the would could start a New Testament but yet while he was here he was still under the Old Testament law when he heals a person there he said go all for the sacrifice of Moses they do you understand what I'm talking about see we just say New Testament and we said well Matthew's a New Testament now the Bible says that Jesus was came under the law to redeem them that were under the law he had to give the sacrifices of the Old Testament law as we call it because it was still in being while he was alive well season trying to get a point see that we're looking back there and seeing something as a partial realization are seeing it as then to the point that it's potentially which potentially is something that is not fully in the manifestation now when you say potential that means something that could happen or may happen I could do no that's not the word potentially potentially it's like what I've tried to bring to you you ask for an old tree I give you an acorn you have the life of the old tree and now listen there's no way to get an oak tree without an acre all right you got it there's no way to get an oak tree when I went down yeah I didn't get a necklace no but somebody planted that and the care of it right because there's no way to get an oak tree unless you start with an acorn the guy worked one time he kept telling me how that pecans was that casserole that was hanging off of the tree you know and he said that's the seed of the pecan I said I'll make an agreement with you I said you plant that pastor what you want to call it and you put it in the ground I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna because I knew it wouldn't break but I said I knew how to do it I said I'm gonna crack up pecan where it will do it faster where we can get it through and if someone put this in some dirt and I'll bring you a little pecan tree when I said you bring me up a country off of that tie so that you got well he found out in the hurry that didn't work you've got to go back to the seed of something so then my points out been what for many services whatever you start with you got to end with a same time whatever salvation it was in the Old Testament which was won by the blood of the bulls and goats right spoke off when Jesus Christ would come for the blood of Jesus Christ to be the perfect one because there was no life in the bull than go-sees can come back upon the believer all right so then it was only potential back tyre which meant it was good it was wrong wonderful but it was waiting for a time to be fully made manifest or his brother least was talking about wind see when you get into that word perfect you know and you begin to look up those words and you find out perfect means a full age are complete all right see then we look at the Bible we say well nobody can be perfect would Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect huh now he required it so you're saying we can't be it then you're saying he's wrong how'd he do it he didn't he gave his own life think the one that was totally fully complete gave His life to be able to come back into you and I to make us complete all right are a full age come on then follow the point now they said you asked me for an oak tree I'll give you an acorn you have potentially the oak tree but you've got to plan it you guys got to have water it's got how the moisture and then things like that it's got out of the Sun to bring it forward and make an oak tree out well that's the way it was in the Old Testament salvation all of those sacrifices spoke of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ right all of those animals that were sacrificed spoke of the coming of Jesus Christ and what it was doing was just pushing the sin forward not totally annihilating it because there was no way under the blood of bulls and goats cuz it was why did Jesus have to die he said well it could be this one no no just get plain sensible Jesus Christ would have never had to died if you could do some perfection without him coming so you can't do it alright that solves a problem I don't care what you think you say well I think well that's what he said in the garden see that's what messed it up get the truth and settle it in your mind there's no way in that Old Testament that life could come forth in the reality of perfection we're gonna read in a minute we're brethren said the prophets only had the Holy Ghost potentially see because that was not into the right place but get what I'm talking about if you're wanting this to Ray to bring something into reality you've got to bring the seed of it a beginning a starting and then it can be brought into reality and when it's brought into reality you know what I like now let me let me say it the way you you'll understand it are you listening you own an oak tree I'll give you an acorn right is that true now that's the only way to get the oak tree right but you know what you're not gonna get just one oh come come on ever oak tree that will ever be come on let's with Apple where you'll follow it right when you take a seed of an apple and you plant it in the ground it grows up makes a start comes forth you know it makes a tree do you realize every bushel of apples that will ever be come out of that seed put one oak tree you know what anchored in the ground millions of oak trees will come from that one acorn so you ought to think about that it's not a potential like we just said we'll see you're saying well you're trying to make it something that it's not you're making it too small how much greater could I make it 1 oak tree one acorn millions of oak trees are you following it seem to make it where your father what the Prophet said one seed of an apple put it in the ground and every bushel of apples that'll ever be on there comes from that one seed so potential is not just well if Norina said don't do don't do potential as much you do is you do potentially because when you just saying potential you'll run aground cuz it can mean not the real thing but potentially you've got your oak tree they had salvation back during the Old Testament but it was based upon their faith and their believing in the blood of the animal that took their place and their salvation was based upon that that they could believe that that the atonement was made for them go read the songs getting there where David cries out in his heart Lord returned me into the joy of thy salvation if you think that they wouldn't repentant sinners and the Old Testament you had a bad thing if you can't read you know read your Bible and see how they cried out before God continually nor take away these things which there was nothing to take it away that's why they had to offer this offerings and keep on offering the offerings because there was no way to take away that that caused them to be like they were but yet they were good people right really probably loved wives they probably lived a better life than you and I do under the baptism of the Holy Ghost why because they were concerned they knew if they done anything wrong they had to go to the high priest they had to go confess they had to go make it right they had to go pay the penalty that went with it are the to make an atonement see they had a salvation back there and like I said to you over and over that salvation of the Old Testament so great it provided a place for them to go to once they died they went to a place called paradise the bosom of Abraham and they stayed there until the resurrection of Jesus Christ and still some of it is still left even til now because the Bible didn't say they said it it didn't say everybody that raised it said part of them did all right so you say well now know the old oh no no no that was done away with well then you you're fighting one scripture with the other one because the other scripture says that everybody didn't rise see that's where we want to get our thoughts we're smart enough now in the message wise until we've studied it until we're getting our thoughts too into a basis that we think we got it figured out well if it won't let with the rest of the scripture where you have it right see that that's the point I'm trying to get you to look at something because we see it there it's all based upon your believing salvation is based upon your believing you've got to believe that Jesus Christ died for your sin I just said what we all take it cuz I believe that you know everybody says it so I believe that no you got to have a personal experience alright we'll get to those things but listen salvation back there was based upon faith in the blood of the Lamb that paid the price enough to cover it but not to eradicate it because we did what is Jesus after die but it couldn't eradicate it but it could potentially cover it until that potential the important he had started with would come out to a reality which would be coming out to the blood of Jesus Christ see now when it comes to the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ is not a potential it's not potentially you're not potentially saved when you come to the blood of Jesus Christ but now when you talk about statute of a perfect man when you talk about adoption those things will be going through then you can see there still is potentially a lot of things so the random said Luther and Wesley and him was only potential oh well they didn't hell don't know he says now wait a minute I'm not saying that it now the Holy Ghost I'm looking at quotes if you want they learn on my desk I'll get to him later what what is it why would he say Luther and Wesley and him had a potential because it was potential the part of the word but it was only justification right it was only justification so they would have it potentially waiting for the Holy Ghost to come to bring the word in the last days all right we'll get to those things as we go along but now watch we ended up last Sunday speaking of partial realization comparing it to perfect realization all right now let's use what we're talking about potentially and let's use it as types and shadows that we did last Sunday and then use it as partial realization compared to perfect realization all right so now what is partial realization it's a part of something it's not the fullness of that it's a part of that all right so when Jesus Christ now I'm looking into church age book reading it basically also when Jesus Christ when the Old Testament lamb was slain that was potentially because it could not come forth in reality but when it come in Jesus Christ it was perfect realization right all right see then that would be the same thing as types and at the top that would be why Jesus said I'm the bread that comes down from heaven and they said no now Moses gave us that brief he said the word Moses never gave you anything I gave you that I am the bread you need to eat you saying see partial realization was the bread in the wilderness remember it rotten it done all kind of things but perfect realization Jesus is the bread that comes from heaven to sustain us all in our salvation all right partial realization and perfect realization types and shadows you know type back there there's being a shadow of something to come it's not fully there in the top but yet it spoke of in the top and it's partial realization all right so then potentially that's what we're recovering potentially the Old Testament people had salvation but now remember I keep explaining how to don't you to go off on the wrong end or other Dale don't believe them Old Testament people that any salvation now that's where you're wrong you're not listening you're not listening what I'm saying you want to listen to refute what I'm saying to you you're arguing in your mind I'm not asking you to blank your mind I could run around said don't ever do that right you know what a lot of people say come on black your mind out and receive what I'm say I never have said none like it because I found what the Prophet said he said the devil wants you to blank your mind out no think about what I'm saying don't blank your mind out onto something or get on to some other thought in your mind just listen and see if it's right she's in that salvation back there was for that time but it will not do today the blood of bulls and goats won't work today well because you've changed dispensations you've got the death of the testator you've got all of the things in view and you coming to perfect realization or understanding of salvation see then that salvation back tyre was based upon their faith in God what is your salvation based on he said well my salvation based on blood Jesus Christ it's not that didn't go through too good it it's supposed to be based on the blood of Jesus Christ paying the price because the life was in the blood right see that's where you go oh you're not in the blood no more the life was in the blood without the shedding of blood there was no shedding of the life all right now see then the lamb as it laid there and was sacrificed in our place God looked at that lamb and said okay you're covered but that lamb had no soul it was alive right it was alive but it had no soul to come back up on the believer all right see then it would take Jesus Christ to come himself to take our place all right the animal is not a living soul it only speaks of today so you're the only speaker back there it was working it it doesn't mean that time don't lose that yeah I can go through a lot more with you if you want to honey but I mean really yeah we think oh they just done and done and done you better remember under that Old Testament they wanted a law and they thought it made them righteous but you know what it does it made a record come on the law made a record now come on you say oh you just commit adultery and then the next year you just commit adultery and the next year you commit adultery you ain't read your Bible I had a little bit better understanding of that I'm sorry to slap you with it but I had a little bit better understanding in the Baptist Church than that if you commit adultery there's that one atonement you better be careful with number two now you want to get in the Bible and stay with me for a long time on that we'll talk about it but there's no need of it because there's no need to do it because the Bible it's what it was the law was a record keeper I can show you where brother Brennan said you but not come back for the same thing the next year well there was a lot under that Old Testament we don't deal with you know that our Old Testament added I mean the law was added because the Bible said because of the transgression you realize that law was added to expose our lives to bring us under condemnation come on they thought they got something they didn't get around said he said they got the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelations Jesus Christ ought to be able to bring our sins out you don't have to have a rule book do this out of the other the rest said you don't have to have no no Bible or anything to tell you that shalt not commit adultery he says you don't need that well because it's solved you know it's just wrong that's that's what gets me of all this stuff with the message people then you know if they come up here and they try to Judah and Tamar and this and that and the other you know and take Judah and Tamar which is that brought around called it adultery and he said there's no way a predestinate seed come through adultery now I'm quoting him would they take that and make it to be the channel of God did he use that that's what gets me is why there's so much truth why is people want so much error okay now listen so potentially you had a form of salvation in the Old Testament I'm not trying to lay that background or not lose to the people that wouldn't hear last week to listen and oh well all right see then potentially you have the Acorn which you need to let it grow into a oak tree so they had the salvation back there but he couldn't grow into a full reality because the testator was still alive Hebrew says the way in we read it in Hebrews it would not made right threat you know for it then you remember what we were talking about last Sunday you remember in the Old Testament it was death to go behind the vital right if you wasn't ordained dressed right everything right you could not go behind that veil that's why I've always said if you telling me to go behind the veil not back there either gonna set Moses would you do me a favor would you stay up all night tonight and look me over real good to make sure I can go in tomorrow because I don't want nothing missing because one little thing and they did he was dead see it was death in the Old Testament go behind the veil but now watch it what is it now you realize this death now not to go behind the veil we ain't trying to go over there to a building and find a veil to walk behind its death now not to go into words Jesus Christ as that or your salvation to bring you to a perfect realization a reality into your life right cuz see now listen you remember this one from what we were talking about your prophet had a way of explaining things that's the way I like it go ahead and number three we will pick up and run this a little bit with some quotes though we're a firm believer in the Prophet brought the message off of the unveiling of God preached in Jeffersonville 1964 now watching book before if man walked in behind that veil that was sudden death right Old Testament and we're going to get a lesson here in a minute see if you can you can receive it to walk behind them skins even one of the priests sons tried to do it one time and died don't go behind that veil no man that walked behind why there was no redemption yet in that there was no redemption there was a covering you can call that redemption enough but get what he's saying there's no redemption under the blood of bulls and goats cut if it was why do you need Jesus Christ if there was a redemption that you don't need you said what you said a minute ago they say that's right but it never brought him eternal life it never brought eternal life to the Old Testament people the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do that because there was no life to be able to come out to come upon the believer to bring eternal life yeah but I think sorta well that's your thinking I've got well go ahead because you're just worrying yourself to death you're not getting the point because listen folks I'm doing what I've tried to do for 50 years I've tried for 50 years to preach salvation to people to where they could accept it you saying we're all lost I've told you over and over I don't have nowhere I've told you I'd rather go down the road all of my life seeking after God and get it to end of the road and find out I had it all the time then to go down through my life and not seeking after God because of some thing that I do and I shouted I spoke in tongues I cried I done this I've done that I seen visions that are and come down the end of the road and he said depart from them well I'm trying to preach to you salvation it'll get you to realize your lost well brother now you can't you can't tell me I'm lost well why are you getting upset I mean I don't know probably I'm just preaching yeah yeah but I've done this I've done that I believe the prophets message praise God soldiers a devil so now everything you name that you say you could do we're gonna get into it I'm asking you have asked you over and over to do I've asked you to read or listen to the inner Vail are the Intervale or why as God's people so tossed about now there's a description even in their books of that brother Branham preached a message called Intervale they titled it and retitled it Intervale then they retitle it to why are my people so talked about Intervale and Intervale is two different messages you better check it the priest one of them's in Spurgeon's michigan and the other one is in Jeffersonville Indiana see they goofed in trying to figure out what was doing they should have stayed with the old original inner veil but they changed it to Intervale it is corrected which you can't correct it because there's two different messages you want to sit down and with me and look at it I wouldn't tell you something that I hadn't looked at what do you look at us yeah I'm I'm concerned my soul is involved in it but you don't want your soul is involved in this that's why I have to be so specific listen I have to listen to the prophet and look back in that Old Testament there was no redemption yet in that Wow it was potentially well it was under the blood of bulls and goats under the Old Testament it was potentially watch him he was just potential than what anything potential is not the real thing yet the oak tree the Acorn is not the oak tree yet but it's potentially everything that'll ever be in the oak tree is in the Acorn right so come on anything potential is not the real time see yes potentially it was ridden sin was covered now he's explaining what's happening in the Old Testament what happened sin was covered not omitted it couldn't be done away with then he says remitted rather watch him not remitted remitted as divorced or put away and divorced and put away is not even Corral now come on I can quote if you wanted us getting married and divorce if you don't run a little while the coaches the blood of bull you put it try to put it under the blood some way you just about as well put it under the Old Testament blood of bulls and go you better get it ride read what he's saying he's simply saying sin was covered it was not eradicated it was not done away with it was not totally to use the word remitted as divorced and put away because it couldn't be done and so the blood of sheeps and goats could not do that so Jehovah was hid behind the veil now back behind this rail where he was hid to enter into there a man drop dead to try to enter into it potentially potentially the blood of bulls and goes potentially turn away we're seeing of mankind potentially because it could only cover not eradicate it not totally annihilated it couldn't be done in the Old Testament that's what Jesus Christ had to die if I will said he died once for all old and new he had to pay the price for everything so what was it the redemption was not back down and that's why Hebrews 11 it tells you of all of the people of the Old Testament st. and said they without us could not be made perfect may I say that this way they without the blood of Jesus Christ under the blood of bulls and goats they can't be made perfect you ain't but called me and you something okay without us they without us but that's us boy we're we're South mainly what now you're getting off this too bad going the other way they without us they without the salvation that we have within our hearts and our lives cannot be made perfect our complete are finished all right see it can't be done potentially wouldn't totally remit the sin he wouldn't do it he would cover it then Jesus Christ would have to come and give his life to remit it or do away with it or destroy it well brother they'll see that's what we're going to get down to one of these days and and it's gonna jump out on you like a I'm praying to God every day and not in day for one time to appreciate to where everybody in here can come to a place to look at there on sale that sister in that message on the blasphemous names she said because of the way that you are preaching the new birth read the message of asking - he says because she said because of the way your preaching said I'm wondering if I have it the way he was preaching it because he wasn't playing around with those sugar tits on Baptist doctrine well we got everything one who believed and see that's what you're feigning in your mind you said well I believe what do you believe I believe Jesus Christ paid for my sin and died in my place amen now can I say brother Branham can I quote him you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior that's wonderful but can I ask you a question has he accepted you is that the quote from the Prophet has he accepted you well yeah he said and I believe it that's good but has he done it now then I'll say the rest of it goes with the story because the Prophet said it this way he said if he's accepted you then you can't turn down one word oh so you can't argue with anything that I've said about the Old Testament Saints and where they're sitting because it's the Word of God well I just don't believe it's good way I don't care what you believe I'm trying my best to get you the place - you don't even know what you believe what see if they're that way by the way you can do something about it you see you're the funniest preacher I've ever heard cuz everybody wants to get us build up and build up yeah build up in what tell most you to realize you're lost can I quote wrote around he said we're too full I can quote to you know he said we're too full he said we need to be have empty vessels well I just I just can't go ok ok ok now watch him as he go don't go to number four which is God's provided place of worship notice also then science of the Old Testament potentially under the sacrifice they were waiting for this new one to come and a good conscience toward God they were potentially it wasn't lost they're saved but no the Old Testament had the new birth and where do we get to that and ask you a simple question what is the new birth I believe on Jesus Christ I'm looking at notes laying on my desk where brother Branham said as long as your confession is right you're saved but he said if your confessions changes you're lost oh brother down you're trying to say we can be saved and lost we can be we can be saved and lost well we can't be born again and lost there's a difference in the statement we're gonna get down to some technical thing where the Prophet said you receive eternal life when you believe you Nene's gonna say you can't believe without the baptism the hold of God sort of said we had a long ways to go to find out what this new birth is why is it I've asked you why is it that it took the disciples 3 and 1/2 years of walking with the Lord Jesus before they could ever come to a born-again experience but yet once that Holy Ghost failed in the upper room outside of a matter of a few hours later the Holy Ghost fell on three thousand then you run over to kinesin house and just by hearing the word the Holy Ghost falls on them and don't forget now we got scripture says if they receive the Holy Ghost like we have like we did oh they just got this they just got that you you got a lot to go through let's go number five Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and think about what he's saying now the prophets could not be sanctified now watch him the toe just using that the other day read it on down and you'll get what he's saying he's simply saying the prophets could not be sanctified they were just potentially sanctified he goes on to explain it and watch him the prophets could not be sanctified potentially they were potentially they were not sanctified as a form of a New Testament form of speak Oh sanctification oh they never had to but they were potentially by the offering of a bull or an ox or something or sheep or heifer they were potentially under that blood as the brother most gallantly has presented that they could be sanctified potentially under looking forward to the atonement being made perfect for under the blood of bulls and goats when the bull died are the heifer died or the sheep died the life in that blood could not come back on the Prophet because it was an animal's life and an animal's life would bring you profit to an animal they are you listening to what he's plainly saying you can't bring the blood of Jesus I mean the blood of an animal to anybody and make them perfect with it right it doesn't matter if they're prophet or who they are they can't be brought to that place to worry that it would work okay go ahead the number six he swore by himself man dropped plumb down to hear the blood of sheep and goat held him this far as potentially until the fullness of time came then God came down himself not an angel not a chair of being but God came from heaven and went all the way to hell to bring man up from Hell to heaven with him he come hunting the lost sheep waiting until Jesus Christ came the reason I gave you this about the prophets is called see I know the statements I've been around 50 something years and listened to people and their work talks about Elijah and it says as thy soul liveth the people saved either he had eternal life now how could he have eternal life what he's under a potential they wait I mean we got you trapped brother Dale don't jump too quick those you covered that you covered Adam in a certain way sure did not still believe it so don't just jump up and run off with it now just listen potentially until the fullness came and what was the foolish when God came himself okay now look what he says on the message souls that are in prison now he talked about the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in the seven mystery of Hell the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption new Testament well now read it now we just read back over there we're under the potential there was no redemption it was just covering it pushing it forward to a redemption through Jesus Christ now what's he saying don't let to see you steal the seven mystery look and it was the book of redemption now watch him New Testament not the old it only proclaimed for the New Testament the Old Testament only proclaimed are pushed forward are paid what they have been made cannot be made perfect without us Hebrews 11 see now the redemption only come when the Redeemer died that's your word you know that the New Testament with the death of the testator Hebrews Redemption only come when the Redeemer died and they were potentially under the blood of the lambs not the Redeemer hadn't been redeemed yet until the Redeemer came so when you're dealing with Redemption remember your Old Testament is not dealing Redemption it only spoke of way to hit that we just wait along the line we don't talk about what we're gonna breathe wide worried about it I don't say to him you need to preach this and I'll preach on this they don't know we don't do it I don't do it within these other brothers either I don't try it in any way to do to the influence them one way or the other I want them to preach what God gives them in their heart I've always told them don't worry about it anything comes up we'll work it out they don't fit right we'll get together sit down talk about we'll work it out we'll see what's right and we'll take what's right code I don't have all the answers let's see that was sold in prison let's get this one will at least get a little bit look what he says on the number eight which is the maniac will get a really pronounced hitting 1954 now the background behind this to try to tell you and brother branham said in other words the guys making fun jibber jabber since I run said it's pure blasphemy the guy was saying his point was he was proving that you didn't and it the points right listen he was proving that people did not speak in tongues he's saying John didn't speak in John he said all these others didn't speak in tongue his points right but he's jibber jabbering Brett run says in other words he's making fun of the tongues and the thingy and got it right choice blaspheming don't make light of the word of God it don't matter if you don't understand it leave it alone and I've seen them many of many things and I wanted to get up and this screaming holler about it but something says leave it alone you leave it alone if you don't make fun of the Holy Ghost you don't matter what but look what he says the guy the man now the man is one Satan John the Baptist received the Holy Ghost and didn't speak in tongues now that's what the man is saying are you following me the man is saying there a lot of these receive the Holy Ghost and so forth like that and never said anything about tongues Zacharias and them now let's follow him but listen real close I said that was before the Holy Ghost was ever given the man was arguing about the this and not speeding it and he said that was before the Holy Ghost would ever give him he said well they say they had any pauses because he's stating what the man is saying so evidently the man must have been saying well they say they had the Holy Ghost or something cause he stops in palsy now take what the Prophet says and I said now they did not say they had the baptism of the holy God do you know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's actually saying now come on I'll give you this one I'll give you all the quotes you won't code I'm gonna worry about it I'll give you her brother Brown said John received the baptism of the holy ghost while he's in his mother's womb with any sin hear that John didn't do it he's not contrary he's explaining things in different places different ways if not you tell me you think I'm trying to interpret it or figure it out you come and tell me what it is I'll come back to the church and I'll say brother so-and-so said sister so-and-so said and it's what straightened me out now no problems with it but I want you to bring the whole Bible the whole Word of God we don't talk about silly jibber-jabber that's what that guy was doing listen and I said now they did not say they had the baptism of the holy God he's 1000% correct now come on we'll to be far enough into the message to know at least one thing just you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost own your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell so we ought to know that's true right but let's drop on down a little bit further to see what he's talking about he's saying John never received the baptism of the Holy Spirit oh yes he did okay you got the quotes I got him I'll bring him tell you so he must be explaining something if he says something in one place and something over here and it seemed a little different they must be something there he's trying to explain that's not me trying to figure it out I just lay down both things he said I can conclusively prove that you were born again and then baptized into the body now is that statement contrary it's contrary to my thinking in yours because it don't make sense he explains what he's one is come on listen now get his point what Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially I see you've argued with me over the time that I preached from blasphemous names trying to show where brother branham said over and over that that Adam received eternal life breathed into his nostrils the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God you've argued that in your mind now argue this quote Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially so evidently Adam didn't have everything that's what I tried my best to explain to me I tried my best to explain to you over and over and over that Adam received eternal life in his soul that's what your prophet said but that still left him to where he went out and he done wrong I did if I had listened some time instead of trying to argue to refute something Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially that's right all the prophets as they were moved by the Holy Ghost to watch him moved by the Holy Ghost but the Saint John said that that the Holy Ghost had not yet come but he's just saying in the same paragraph same sentence that the prophets were moved by the Holy Ghost then he turns around said that the Holy Ghost is not yet come because Jesus had not been glorified so there must be something about this Holy Ghost am i quoting lawful stature of a perfect man am i quoting from blasphemous names and did we say we understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost do we he didn't say that they had the baptism on the Holy Ghost John never had the baptism the old ago he's all I got Luke one in 15 or he'll be great in the sight of the Lord and she'll drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb well that's and that's contrary to what was being said a moment ago well how about another one we deal with John we deal with Adam we deal with people like that what about this scripture can you get number 12 brothers I'm asking you to jump over Feist we'll come back to these next week Luke 141 well I keep that one up here because it says in Luke 115 and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb what did his mother get what did John's mother get and it came to pice Luke 141 that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost what is the vamp tears when the whole ago well you shall confuse me brother de you you've made I'm hope to god I can't confuse you because if I can confuse you you don't have what you think you got is that plain enough yeah but you're hateful hateful of what I spent my whole life to try to save your soul my whole life has been trying to save your soul and it's talking about everybody or anybody after listening it counts it we say John the Baptist had the baptism and Holy Ghost one in mother's womb amen John had the Holy Ghost Monroe's Ruth amen Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost do we understand what it means to be a baptism when the whole ago how could Elizabeth have be filled with all ago when Jesus hadn't died yet he was still learning to Mama's wound this right Mary's wounds when he was talking to Elizabeth Elizabeth John's about six months and ain't moved you get over the book of Acts you can really get into some wonderful time because a lot of times when they met in the book of Acts the Bible says the Holy Ghost came down and filled him holler or this enter the other about him you know they had I say for the Holy Ghost was given this is for the Holy Ghost was given what is the baptism of those oh okay we're wet who's on number uh was on number seven number I excuse me huh bypass number eight because number eight is simply telling you that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean you're going in what he said cuz you have it on your spirit please go to death remember in that spirit you can be baptized with a genuine spirit of God and still be lost but we understand all about the baptism that's number nine excuse me but they were on I give 10 but they see baptism the whole girls don't mean you're going in at all not only don't have anything to do with your soul okay that's a baptism don't have anything do you so that's the baptism here's the inside soul the new birth is not a baptism on your spirit it better be a baptism in your soul well praise God you confused enough well bless God I'll just leave well let me say this to you goodbye which you'll leave confused but there's one thing about it then nobody ever left this church that I wanted them to leave now you can talk all you want to about this that or the other I have never tried to run anybody off in this church I've tried to save everybody it was here now if I did run them off whose problem with me okay let's go one more then we'll quit again go to number 13 you have to flop away over cord we passed a couple go to number 13 this is from questions and answers 1964 now listen Jesus told Peter who had been both saved and sanctified and he believed on Jesus was sanctified Saint John 17:17 jesus said sanctify them father through thy truth thy Word is truth and he and the word is the same they were sanctified potentially through the truth now it took me two weeks to get to this quote okay hang on a minute let me speak on this quote amendment listen they were sanctified potentially through the truth the word the truth and Jhin Jesus told Judas are now changes it to Peter Peter the night of the betrayal he said after you're converted strengthen your brethren after you you're converted the man had followed him for three years this is Peter right had named on the lounge book of life and cast out Devils and done great works and healed and done all kind of preach the word everything and still wasn't converted the your leading to conversion but now as I said three or four weeks ago started on this trying to get to that one little statement I hope you followed me to the point back up a minute the Old Testament was under the blood of bulls and goats that life of that animal could not come back in to the human being to bring a new birth so it was potentially that he says those prophets were sanctified I'm holding at him on to that point because I want you to think about Adam Adam had eternal life in his soul your prophet said it I didn't and he said he was an eternal person with God but then he said Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially evidently Adam didn't have anything right when he had he turn alive see that's where you're not listening to what was preached God started his church in the garden with a man and a woman with eternal life in their soul but not in their body and spirit and that gave the way that Satan could enter in to Adam and Eve you say Adam well Adam was not deceived he knew better so he's in worse shape as he is until it was perverted even with him with eternal life in his soul I'm not gonna argue with you because I'm gonna try to hold it and believe it John the Baptist then we'll ask you a question a second so hold on John the Baptist could have received eternal life into his soul but mama Elizabeth got an anointing you say yeah yeah because remember Adam only had the Holy Ghost potentially so Adam didn't have it right the way it's supposed to be now we're gonna say it because what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost may I quote brother branham justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost completes the birth right justification is a work of the Holy Spirit it is not the baptism sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit it is not the baptism the baptism is the new birth so Adam never went through justification Adam never went through sanctification Adam never went through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to get it it was imparted unto him he wants to all evening what about a foolish virgin that one day will be given eternal life do you believe that do you believe was a foolish virgin when they can be given II it has to be an impartation because he don't go through justification sanctification the baptism of the whole now the disciples went through justification sanctification it was potential because the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shared but as quick as the shed blood came they went straight to the upper room and received the baptism with the Holy Ghost outside 3000 went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and received eternal life into their soul started to church in the garden with a man with eternal life in his soul started to church on the day of Pentecost with a hundred and twenty in the upper room with the Holy Ghost into their soul developed over in just a few minutes flowed outside in 3000 received it what is the baptism when the whole to go justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't go you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without getting the baptism ago and my quoting brother Branham but if you come through justification of sanctification the baptism when the Holy Ghost you got the new birth but if you don't and you just say I believe it and I got it when I believe you don't have it that's what I've proved over and over and over because those Old Testament Saints went through potentially justifications potentially sanctification the prophets went through he's ready potentially the disciples went through it potentially because the Holy Ghost had not been given so nobody could get the new birth so Adam never got the new birth he got eternal life no hole to go John never got the new birth he won't scripture the least in the kingdom and greater than John that's Scripture but John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb you said you're gonna call yeah I'd say he had eternal life in his soul from his mother's womb so did Adam what are you thinking what is the baptism in long ago I shouted I cried as brother Brendan said there's nine hundred different ways am i quoting him remember that nine hundred different churches that have different ways of saying you must be born again whatever one of them has got something related to what you do or don't do I shouted that cried I spoke in tongues that is not the baptism with all of those that's the outward effect of the Holy Ghost amen he said many shouted and didn't get it but he said many shout and did get it we don't quote that we quote the many shouted and didn't get it we don't hope that some shouted and did get it what do you think about it you want to talk with me buddy come on let's talk let's talk about Adam when your prophet city had eternal life let's talk about John the Baptist when your prophet and the Bible said did he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the only thing I've asked you to do is show me where Adam went through justification sanctification to get the baptism he didn't do it the disciples couldn't go they could only go to justification and sanctification and listen that was potential because Jesus hadn't died yet so that put them right exactly where everybody else for that could we be justified and sanctified could we be in potentials come on these issues could we be having to say the Holy Ghost just potentially well how I know brother Dale because the only evidence that the prophet would put it on with what if the spirit in you agreed with the word well it's a great I agreed with everything I've ever heard the Prophet say why is there so much confusion among the believers of this message over a simple matter that brother Allen said the first message Jesus preached was you must be born again if we can't get that right there's no need to worry about the seals the plagues the vials the thunders this time if you can't get the new birth right I asked you a simple question the other day I said can you tell me a definite time in your life that you know you met God in a new birth well brother Dale I was down at the altar and I begin to shout speaking to I don't want to talk about that I want an experience I don't want a sensation or a stimulation upon the flesh the friend says you can have the baptism in the Holy go without a sensation what are you putting your salvation on 90% of you right now would say because I believe the message the devil beater star you see why brother branham if you can't I don't mean I'm right and this is writing that's go but I'm just saying I've tried for months to explain one little thing what is the new birth well yet everybody understands all that brought around him understands about it but he said that sister on blasphemies my answers he said she was concerned about the way he was preaching and she wondered if she had to baptism one home to go the preaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost will split this people to message wide open it split it wide open new birth you don't have to get mad and divorce and seals and flags and the thunders and 70 weeks of Daniel you know how to get this preaching new birth understand oh we got member wide base ministry next afternoon pray for him [Music] eat up here Lord of more you love a bright morning star [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] try to keep
