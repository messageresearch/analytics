========================================

you were not here Wednesday you need to listen to the p i see the DVD cuz what we were covering here for a little more many times you read the breef once twice two times I read it once well I listen to it well this when I say read I mean read in here all right act one what we're going to do is me you're real close what we're going to do is we're going to start in Act only you she really looked nice last night she looks nice today why she look nice last night at the we all had a had a wonderful time thank the Lord for our M all right acts one get before I was interrupting by the up here so close we're going to look like we were talking about Wednesday night the son of man in Matthew 17 was telling us that he was going to be risen again from the dead and we know that son of man died one time a natural physical death but the second time will be not will not be a natural physical death it'll be worse worse than a natural physical death because if somebody's alive and you count him dead and you take everything he's done and just do away with it but yet the Man still alive that's what denominations and Creeds and our ideas not just theirs has done to the son of man we buried him again like I said Wednesday night under Creeds and denominational doctrines and brandom doctrines and I don't mean the wrong I mean the right one I mean the ones we create that brother brandom didn't say all right around the message that's what's messing us up now but let's see what the last thing the son of man did before he left because remember that son of man which is God in human flesh will not be seen again on this Earth in a human flesh body until we come back with him in the Millennium right right so he's going to be somewhere else but he said in Matthew 17 the son of man had to be risen again before these things could happen right it's on before these things could come to pass so let's read the book of Acts 1 Jesus has been with him he had told him that all power in heaven and earth been given unto him he was still here for 30 40 days he was in a human flesh body walking through walls appearing disappearing exactly the same thing that you and I are going to be doing after the resurrection right so he's our he's our spiritual type but he's also our physical type he is he physically typed what you and I are going to be once the resurrection happens and the change in that 30 to 40 days before we go into Rapture that's exactly what Jesus walked through he was a human mortal man but he was Immortal he was mortal and he was made remember he went from mortality to immortality no man has ever achieved that no matter man has ever went from Mortal to Immortal now say what you will about Enoch and all those let's just understand what we need to understand all right Enoch walk with God for 500 years if we walk close with God for 500 years he'd probably take us in the r all right but we don't have 500 years Ray and Kathy couldn't make it 500 years together just Kidd not in the glorified body think that's why it say that only God and that is correct excuse me see Enoch is a type but Jesus wasn't a type he actually went through it right see Enoch's a type brother saying en's the type this one's the type this one's the type but Jesus Christ actually physically died his body was dead and now that body has been resurrected not just resurrected like Lazarus Lazarus was resurrected to a position and then he kept getting older and he died again Jesus Christ raised the Bible said once for all when he raised he'll never die again and he said I'm alive for what ever more all right and have the key of death in hell so he's got all the power he physically went down and he physically rose up so that body is now Immortal now in the chains that's exactly what's going to happen to you and I because we have to become immortal to get out of here right all right the only reason he ascended on this day just like this right here was because he was Immortal he was a mortal man that had become immortal there had been a change right and where did he come from inside right son of man died Son of God went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that Spirit man Spirit God theophany eternal life went and preached to the souls in prison come back up to Paradise picked up the dead Saints and sent them on to Glory he come back and and steep right down in that body on the third day quickened that body raised it up out of the ground remember Romans 8 says the spirit that was what in Jesus Christ it dwells in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body not not your soul Soul's already quickened by the new birth he said it'll Quicken your mortal body and then what change it just like it did with with Jesus Christ all right so let's read the book of Acts this is the last thing that happened to the son of man before he ascended but remember he promised that he was going to be buried again cuz he said when a son of man is risen again from the dead all right one time he was risen before this book of Acts right he was risen on the third day right 30 40 days later that's why they called the day of Pentecost cuz Jesus actually remember how we went through the timeline Jesus actually resurrected and it was exactly 50 days he said go ter in Jerusalem if he was there 30 or 40 days he give them about 10 or so more days right here and told him to go to Jerusalem you'll be endued with power from on high very 50th day that day of Jubilee the 50 days after that man Resurrected he came back on the day of Pentecost in what Spirit form again Son of God came back everybody understand that either shake your head or say Amen okay all right because if he hadn't he could not come back as a son of man again in the physical form because of Luke 17:30 what we read last Sunday and what we read Wednesday night that's what barred him from coming by back because it had to be in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of all these people well that wasn't that day that was this day so there had to be a group of people on the Earth today to accept that all right when the coming of the son of man when he would be risen again from the dead what dead works you know remember brother R said there was 68 million Jews killed during the Dark Ages he said told billions spiritually died see so it's worse to be spiritually dead than to be naturally dead right cuz what it is is the Bible says you're alive but you're dead and don't know it right I mean you're you're you're physically alive but you're just as dead as the door Nowell that's worse than just go ahead and you know giving your life for the gospel maybe what brother B said about being naked in the Bible right naked don't even know yeah you're naked and and somebody tells you and you realize it what a wonderful thing you can put your clothes back on but being naked and not knowing it like they are in the end time that's worse all right book of Acts this is Luke speaking let's start let's just start verse one the former treaties have I made o theopus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments and to the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion for many infallible proof by many in fallible proof being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which was what go back to St John 14 St John 14 says I'll send you another comforter I and my father are one we're going to come and take our Abode in you that's bringing the what the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the hearts of the believer that was the promise of the father remember Jesus said my father whoever he chooses there's not one you know in other words you won't miss one of them wait for the promise of the Father which he say you have heard of me which was the 3 and 1/2 years that he preached for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with a Holy Ghost not many days hence see the Holy Ghost had not been given yet sure John received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb but that didn't make him a born again believer right he was just quickened by the Holy Ghost right and I don't mean that just cuz he was one of the greatest he was the greatest of the Prophet but Jesus didn't stop there he said but this Kingdom my father's fixing to set up he's not even in it the least in the kingdom is greater than that man call John the leash the little the toenail the fingernail whatever you want to call it the body of Christ for John through the baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel what are they they're still in a natural condition they're saying okay you said you were going to bring this Kingdom you said you were going to rule you were going to reign you going to do these things when's it going to happen I wrote in my Bible they didn't know cuz they didn't have the Holy Ghost that's right they heard the word just like a lot of us do we like I said Wednesday night this cannot be head knowledge head knowledge will kill you that is where the death is death is in head knowledge right right this has got to be made alive in somebody's life amen all right because here's the group of people for 3 and 1/2 years God himself walked face to face he told them things that they didn't know about and then sometimes there was things that he explained to them and they said oh we understand that and right here before the greatest happening he had just resurrected from the dead told him what he was going to do son of man be put in the earth three days and three nights he'll resurrect they were there they were a witness this man walked for them for 40 days and they still ask him this question right they still ask him this question are you still going to restore the kingdom to Israel what Jesus say it is not for you to know the time or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power everybody say this with me after Holy Ghost has come upon you that's good enough after not now or they wouldn't ask that question after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and into the uttermost parts of the earth and that's where this is now this is the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight all right so he he's going up where he's going up in a cloud and he disappears that correct right he goes up in a cloud he disappears that's how he left right now and while they look steadfast toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up in heaven if you remember Wednesday night that's what denomination that everybody all the ball players and everybody's like hey thank you Lord thank you God thank you God you know start pointing up in heaven it's not bad to point it's not bad to pray this way but why he's in your heart he's not anywhere else but there he's not in your heart I don't know that but I know he's in mine they're doing that for other people though they want other people to see right that they're but their understanding is too that there's some great God way out you under somewhere that just come down and scored a touchdown for him right but yet he's still up y under somewhere you know and and you know not making light of them but I don't you know brother way but it's serious I mean they don't understand there's your dead but yet physically alive I I don't think I've seen myself there I've seen myself if I we that way and here here he just walks right off the Earth and we're looking up in the clouds we know he just stepped through a Dimensions what he do sure absolutely you sitting there looking and I'm just thinking pow in the back of the head go do what he told you to do and that's that's what I did right many times but now did that solve the problem they still ran into a room and shut the doors and closed the windows and barred up everything and and and didn't move cuz they were for fear of the people to kill them well if they don't know you know they haven't been thought so I guess they're not going to be judged for they got to be judged for what they know right well the last thing they have to prove what they are that's all I'm going to say no I don't they ain't no more Christians in that Chari is if their lives don't prove it but um anyway Listen People this got to be a life that's right we're coming down to a life right that's if we don't can't if we can't if we don't smoke drink cuss run around and do those things and God's going to we're just going to barely make it God's not going to wink at that anymore this is the day that's why y'all missed it Wednesday night I'm telling you people this is the time where we walk down a narrow pathway and few the Bible said will be that find it this message come to Quicken a people to get out of here there are no Christians on this earth except you and I amen I'm sorry I don't care how good your mom and daddy is that's right how good my mom and dad is if you're not born again you're on the outside of the economy of all this Bible right here right and brother Joel that's true I mean they'll be judged but how are they going to be judged this right here right that's right and if you'll look in the news paper and look on the internet a few times you'll see how them ball players live and it ain't Godly until they score touchdown so I get but anyway I want you to realize one thing I'm not trying to be mean but God come to get one group of people and that's all that's right that's all now that'd be like me coming to get June and and and taking Lisa in my house and Rebecca in my house and and and being husband and wife all three God didn't do that I don't do that so I know God's not going to do that God come to find one person that's a bride one not two not three one CH and if everybody else is dead then it's just you and I and everybody else it's and I'm you know I'm saying look let me tell you something let me get a little closer you said said well the message is the only thing that's right no the Holy Ghost is the only thing that's right okay that's what I said about head knowledge Wednesday night pray to God this is not head knowledge because being so close to this amen and not doing what it says you're in worse shape than if you never heard it before right you'd have a better chance like brother Joe said to go God nobody ever told me about you nobody because remember brother R said we will be held accountable the bride will be held held accountable right for not going to the people and telling them about the true meaning of Jesus Christ I just go out there and give them a d confession but a true meaning well the only way I know to do it is a life live you know and I know the the young adults last night we had Valentine's dinner and the young adults got to see a lot of how us couples interact you know as husband and wife and the things we said to each other through that little piece of paper right really you know and I I made a joke they're back there in the back wall going you know cuz it was kind of mushy and it was lydy and it was but it was some it was funny my bassb babe but it some but it was an interaction though that the children what if you know then take them we're a little off the subject but this is the way we're going take them and go put them in a worldly Valentine's party yeah oh my word where there's drinking and and cursing and women and all wanting to be with the you know other men and men want to be with other women and and them wanting to be liars and and drunks and stuff put them over there in that situation and you look what you got you know we just hope they see the difference that's what you're trying to do yes I just hope that they see the and if they can't see the difference then God help us that's God help us if they can't can't see the death right absolutely I mean it's a life live you can sit up here you know Daddy could be preaching for 50 years and if he lived like the devil then that 50 years was just counting for nothing right it's the life that we live it's going I told yall a long time ago I've always remember this when I started preaching I said it's going to come down to a life live it's not going to be that you can quote this seal book or that you can make brother Brown said this and brother Brown said that it's going to be a life that you live right and if you don't got the goods one day you're fall off one day you may not for 40 years but one day you're going to fall now to prove that you're not right you stay falling off now that doesn't mean like sister Trudy and I were talking about if you fall and get back up that means you're a Son of God that means you're a daughter of God we all fall off but when you get back on that path and start again I'd rather see that a lot of times and some people that's that's Untouchable seems like that they never do anything wrong just wait the devil will be right there at the door and he won't be far away do had to hand I was just thinking so many times though with what you're saying the life live people turn it into Works sure they turn it into Works in this message sure oh yeah absolutely they absolutely turn it into works but I'm telling you the ones that turn it into Works somewhere they're going to fall cuz if you build your house on Sand it will eventually fall if you build it on work do this don't do that don't do this do this we don't do this and you'll fall somewhere they may not fall for 50 years but somewhere they got to fall if they don't have the goods now if you got the goods I take that from Brother Claude he says it all the time he this gu to got the goods you know but if you got the goods yeah you'll stumble and fall but you get right back on track you won't stay away from church don't tell me you backslide for 25 years no you never got it to start with you that pull you back up that's exactly they fall they don't got right anybody fall and and and you're gone from church three or four five a year six months you didn't get the Holy Ghost you need to come back and get the Holy Ghost then if you fall you may fall and and the best thing to do when you fall is get right back in church get right back in the word of God just say Satan you got one brother R said Satan's got one one punch he didn't say two though thank God he did one punch now y'all think we're off the track but Revelations 5 there was a man took a book right and he had blood all over him that's right what blood was that that blood is what covers what I'm talking about right now that covers our past life because the lamb is the one that took the book now when that lamb takes a book and goes and sits on the throne he becomes the judge right he becomes the judge so then the world is going to be judged by what that's right you and I so that's him taking the book brother Brown said and we're going to read it maybe seven horns and seven eyes which is the church ages that lamb had seven horns and seven eyes what it was the Bride of Jesus Christ in symbol formed by one man the lamb the one that took the book we're going to read that before we before we leave today we're going to read Revelation 5 been about 4 weeks trying to get to it and while they look steadfast toward him as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel got slow down out of breath too fat nobody had enough sense to say amen I heard it under your breath that's okay oh that's right we're on internet which also said ye men of Galilee I told them they need to get one of them cameras that like them Spaghetti Westerns you know make them like Clint Eastwood look about 8 ft tall but if I turn this way Joe said he said be this way little humor to kind of break it up a little bit which also said you men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven in other words why are you looking for this man out under somewhere he told you to go to Jerusalem right here and you would be endued with power from on high and you're going to do the same works that I did you going to do also and they're still going he's leaving he's leaving us he's going he's supposed to restore the kingdom he's supposed to come back with power but now remember they didn't stay that way about 10 days later that man that left came back in the form of the Holy Ghost it wasn't that man the son of man it was that man the spirit of that was in that man come back on the people to what give them power and Buddy when they did the doors open they didn't care who saw them they didn't care who saw their life because remember when they went to Antioch they were first called Christians because they acted like Paul no cuz they acted like Peter no they acted like Christ Christian excuse me this same Jesus now they'd have to be lying if he didn't come back this same Jesus this same man that you saw leing which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven now there went the son of man off of the face of the Earth never to be seen again in a physical form right until he comes back with a bride in the Millennium right right but now wait a minute Matthew 17 says Jesus said when the son of man's risen again these things are going to happen maybe he's talking about something here that's what I wanted to get to in Revelations 10 we see that same scenario an angel coming out of the clouds come down to a prophet on Sunset Mountain that's right to bring a message not the son of man in physical form but he hid himself in Simplicity in a man called William Brandon amen he hid himself in that man and brought a message from 1963 to 1965 that was the same message that you read in Matthew Mark Luke and John but one other scenario the unwritten part that's the part we're going to get into but we must have a basis of why that the prophet had to come to a position why because the scriptures told him he had to I mean who of us ever read Revelations 10:1 and saw a mighty angel coming down and know it was Christ we just thought listen let's be honest Revelations 10: 101 says this Mighty Angel come down that's a little a Now you listen to brother brandom he tell you he said if that's a little a he said that's an Earthly messenger but then you see Revelations 10:7 you got an angel on earth a little a god hid that from the people God hid that angel cuz brother R said only Christ it could be right to me it would be a big a cuz that's Christ right the big a would have took the scholars right to that big a where it says Angel like it does the Lord and Jesus and all the capital letters remember we saw in the in the Bible but he hit it in a little a and it took a prophet to come and say that was Christ the that's my identification that Christ come back down and started preaching a message that he left off when he come the first time he said it's finished he said it's done but there's a part in there that man has never looked at remember brother bandam when that sister had a dream about he whipped that top off of that pyramid mountain with a crowbar he said when he looked down in there he said it was things that man had never looked at before and what did he do first thing he done he come back he went to Tucson and then he went to Jeffersonville to preach the seal right you said oh that's wonderful that's it is wonderful to see the the acts of a play see this isn't actual a play but they actually took place in our town the whole pie to this thing everybody would listen is those people back there did not need what he looked into that's right because they did not have their body and spirit did not have to be right taken up or change cuz they were in another age their age counted them to go to the Grave that wasn't the time for that right had to be in the seventh days of the voice of the seventh angel that's the identification the days of the voice that's the key which the voice is sounding now in what remember all those Messengers remember we preach daddy preached I preached about the messenger coming at the end of the age to preach a message for the next age well a lot of times he'd be dead 50 years into his age of the last 500 years well who took that message on the people his voice that's right Paul died in what ad60 something his his message I mean his Ephesus Church age lasted several hundred more years well it was what Paul preached in the people right is what brought the people to the age of Ephesians right right same way with brother brandom he had to go off the scene right for us to even be able to understand because we would actually looked at him and said you're the one that's going to do it that would have exalted him to deity right Right One Singular deity now I think we're all deity and he was deity as far as a new birth everybody that's got a new birth he said that's he said you have deity residing inside of you right but when he whipped that top off it was not that that was strange things that had that that that was not there before cuz God can't add or take away it was always written there right he said light had just not shined on it until now so there's not some new mystery we're not going to learn something new that you going to write down and say boy we know something the world don't know well we do know something the world don't know that's right but it's living that that's right living this to its fullest extent let's go to Revelation 5 we're going to read it today we're going to get to it after a month did your Dy go ahead while we're doing it what I'm seeing with him within that top office you have to come up to that place for absolutely he had to be standing right here whip that top off that's right yeah he couldn't whip the top off down here that's right he had to be standing right here to cut take that crowbar and pull that top off to see what down in here what the bride in the ages these Birches been left off exactly he told him to stay there too exactly he said you stay here and I'll go yep he said stay here and I'll go cuz he what he's the one that had the message he was that seventh angel messenger that had the message he connected with those Angels we'll get to it later but we're going to read Revelation 5 Revelation 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals now next Sunday the Lord willing we're going to try to put this in picture form kind of draw it on the board what went on the scene read the breach brother rown calls it a scene it's a scene right seal what Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof he overcame something the prophet said seven because he Pro he prevailed to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in low in the midst of the Throne of the four beast and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb and they had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes what the church ages the bride he is in Bride form there's no way for you to be redeemed today there's no way for you to receive the Holy Ghost now this may hurt a little bit there's no one has the Holy Ghost in This age I don't believe unless they hear this word of God being preached in it pure form how are you going to get I know brother R said you can put an under a puppy maybe that was for his time but when we come down to this part right here where we're looking at at going in a Rapture taking a body chain it's not a puppy dog sitting on an egg that's right right it's a baby being born from a human right all right that's right I'm not trying to be different with the prophet there's a lot of things he said that continued in an age but it stopped when he started preaching those seals everybody thought he went off and went crazy no that Bible became a new book he didn't change his Doctrine he just Rose up just it just raised up a little bit higher all right let's finish and I beheld in L in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain what he was doing the work of a redeemer there's only one way you can get born again even through the church Ages was through another Born Again believer coming in contact with you are you hearing the word of God from another believer why why did Cornelius and all those people were preaching the word of God in the book of Rel the Holy Ghost couldn't fall on them until Peter a man filled with the Holy Ghost walks into the room and the Bible says the Holy Ghost fell on the people Peter spake the word because the life only comes through the body how you going to get life from Death right you can't get life from from from these people out in the world that are great teachers if they don't have the Holy Ghost it's dead letter that's right you're not I mean you might learn something for your physical life or something for your human life but for your spiritual life outside of this message people you're not going to understand you're not going to get that word's not going to be quickened you understand that yes without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it life has to come through the body so somebody has to tell me about the word of God God quickens that to my heart I can't hear from a sinner and get born again you can't do that all right so don't think you can go to a Pentecostal church that has that has no belief at all and get the Holy Ghost you can't do that you can't especially not in this age may not believe that but I believe it that's just how I'm I guess I'm dogmatic about the message but still I see that where life is there's no life outside of this message being lived in a born again believer just John real quick oh no no no I disagree with oh you disagreeing okay s can't finger up and agree that's why Jamaica they agree with boy this message revealed exactly seven horns and seven eyes which is who identified in the church ages you and I we're the only one that are redeemable he's the only one that died he died for us only oh no he died for the whole world but only the ones that accept him is the one that's going to be covered by the blood all right having seven horn seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book who a man the prophet said M the son of man had to take the book he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne we'll stop right there because that lamb was the son of man behold John said the Lamb of God had take away the sin of the world who was it Jesus Christ stand in human form on the shores of Galilee one more thing it bothers me that that he's in the B are not capitalized when you're talking about he's hiding it he's hiding it from the wise and prudent okay let's go
