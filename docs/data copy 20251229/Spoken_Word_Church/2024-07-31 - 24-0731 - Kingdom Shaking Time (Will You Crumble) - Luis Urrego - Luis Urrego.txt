amen praise the Lord no matter what happens in our lives no matter what takes place God is in control I believe that with all my heart amen I um I'm going to uh we're just going to go to the word now but uh and afterwards I I'm going to give the little a little mission report um from our trip and uh also I'll maybe uh add a few other things in there with regards to misss so um you just bear with me here just a moment praise the Lord amen if I can hopefully this will work good can it's not going to be as big as I thought it's going to be all right I I built this in a different way and and and um and it's it's not not working the way I wanted it too so oh there we go there we go yes yeah I I felt the anointing coming as it was so praise the Lord amen let's just bow our heads before we go to our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for the opportunity that we have father to open back the pages of your word and Lord we just appreciate Heavenly Father just be able to come father have the freedom to come Lord to church father and to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord place that we can Feast upon your worth on your word as a body heavenly father and we just thank you Lord God we we ask Lord first and foremost that you forgive us for all our sins and Lord may you cleanse us father from any unrighteousness Lord we fail you many times Lord God through our thoughts or maybe the things we say father and sometimes the things that we may do Lord God we ask father for for forgiveness Lord and may you just place it all under the blood Lord that it would not hinder Lord

we're just father God confident Lord God that you are more than able to meet every need father we love you and we just commit ourselves now un you bless those that may be still on their way protect them Father we just commit the rest of the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord Jesus let's turn to the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 um and uh and uh we can we can read along here if you if you don't have your Bible there but Hebrews chapter 12 and started in verse 14 and it says follow peace with all man and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord um you know sometimes we have we might be in situations where we can't have peace with people or where peace might not be there but we try to follow peace as much as and sometimes that may mean you know not not having to maybe just not just maybe sometimes avoiding them just for the sake of Peace you know that that's that's sometimes what you have to do you know but but we usually try to talk things out and and uh but sometimes you know some sometimes people you just can't there's no other way to do that but to just leave them alone but says follow peace in other words seek after it follow peace with all man and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord look and diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled see and then we skip down to verse 25 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promise saying yet once more I not only shake the Earth or I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain praise the Lord amen and um and then it continues here saying wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire praise the Lord Jesus you may be seated this this evening amen i' just like to quickly speak to you about Kingdom shaking time and the question is will you cry crumble will you crumble were you or or will the holy ghost that you have in you will it cause you to stand amen how many believe that we're in shaken Kingdom time how many believe that kingdoms around the world are being shaken and as kingdoms around the world are being shaken all believe also the bride of Christ is also being shaken too amen we are being shaken we're feeling the elements all around us we're feeling the the the the pressures all around us we're feeling the the the the the things that are taking place not just politically not just uh uh but also definitely spiritually amen because uh we are in a shaking Kingdom time amen and you and I we're supposed to be kingdoms of the kingdom of God supposed to be reigning inside of you and me amen how many believe that by the by the by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the kingdom of God Amen the kingdom of God is not something that you look at you know it's not like the a far away Kingdom you know or or or something like that eventually it will come to that it will come to a physical Kingdom but it has to be a spiritual Kingdom first amen because those things that you see that you don't see amen usually those are the things that usually stand amen and God Amen he we we may not see him uh physically amen but if he's in you amen he's he's more than he's he's powerful enough Amen to cause the a work in your in in your life amen and and we manifest on the outside what he's doing on the inside amen praise the Lord Jesus but we know that and we see that Satan amen is is moving in in the last days that we're living in and if if you don't if you don't believe that we're not living in the end time then then then you just love the world too much that's all I got to say you you you're you're just too stuck on the world we we we we really see the the the the the things is Fallen apart and then and and and I believe that it's causing and it's drawing us Amen to to seek Amen to to to Long amen for that body change to long for the resurrection of the Saints amen those promises of God that we're looking for amen that that they're they're just as real amen as I'm standing here amen you Satan might tell you well you know what a resurrection all the saints the the people that you know are going to come up and it might sound like a fairy tale but amen our head went through it first amen and if he came up amen those Saints are coming up as well amen praise the Lord Jesus so so the question is is will you crumble in the middle of the shaking amen and um I really didn't mean to make this uh like a a video slide I meant to make it like a but uh anyways it is what it is all right so uh here in Hebrews 12 we just read in verse 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved amen praise God you should be excited amen and happy that the fact that the kingdom that you have received inside of you amen is eternal amen amen that's the reason why you have eternal life and it's a kingdom that cannot be moved praise God Amen that's the reason why it continues to say let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear amen we uh I mean we are in the age of Grace and and and and double double Grace praise the Lord Jesus and I believe that we should show Grace not just us receiving Grace but also show Grace to those if we're we're supposed to be gracious people amen amen praise God we're supposed to be we're supposed to be the most gracious people because God has shown double Grace to us and I'm so thankful for that amen the grace that he shown us whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear amen for our God is a consuming fire you know when we were there in Honduras I I spoke to the young people uh one one of the the last service that we had there for the Youth the youth camp and I talked to them about the the fire of God Amen and how the fire how it was the priests that would light the uh they would take the fire of God inside the the the the duties of the priest when they would light the C the the SE the seven candlesticks and all that it had to be the fire of God Amen it couldn't be their own fire and and it couldn't be strange fire it had to be the fire of God and and we know that one time Aaron's oldest Sons they they lit Strange Fire in other words they did things the way they thought maybe it should be done well God gave us a a a recipe of how to do certain things but but they did it their own way and instantly God had to had to had to kill them right on the spot right later on we might we if you continue reading it was possible that they were a little tipsy if you you call it that way they were drunk and later in that chapter the Lord gives Commandments to the priest to not be drinking and get drunk before they do their duties and that's the reason why they were offering uh they offered Strange Fire so that is why we need to be sober in the m in the in the hour that we're living in amen sober minded and and and and know what you believe and know what what who the God that you are serving amen know what you are doing amen and do the things according to his word amen not do it according to your opinion or add one thing in there and and take one thing out amen but do it exactly as God said and you will see the results that God said you will have I believe that with all my heart and so that's why that's why here in Hebrews it says for in Hebrews uh verse 29 12 for our God is a consuming fire amen amen when he I hope he's consumed you amen and I hope he continues to consume you amen praise God I want him to consume me amen I I I don't I don't want to be living I I want him to live through me amen praise the Lord amen so so we see um we could just go look back in in in different in different ages and and we can see how the you know different Empires and I have here that uh the Roman Empire it was one of the empires that uh was that had expanded themselves worldwide and and but one of the these are some of the the failures that they had that they could they did not continue I mean I know I know we we know that Rome is still there spiritually uh that that that that that um that wound amen they came back up again overextend but this were some of the things that that the reason why they failed was overextension corruption external pressures and economic troubles led to its decline amen I wonder if we're seeing the same thing in the in the United States nowadays we we're heading the same direction amen and I and I just hope that you and I are not are not just falling falling head over heels over this political iCal stuff because it's is is leading to the mark of the beast if believe it or not it's really what it's doing amen this this Empire was too large to manage and and and internal conflicts weakened its foundations amen so they had bickering and fighting and fussing amongst each other they couldn't fully get along has what we see here in in in in in our political Realms today am man just bickering and fighting each other and uh and and when you're doing that amen it weakens you it weakens you amen and it causes you Amen to for those things to be hindrances for you to me to to to move forward so the Roman Empire didn't continue and they probably they probably thought that that that Empire and that Kingdom could never be shaken amen that that Kingdom would always stand that that Kingdom would always be there we'll always have a Caesar we'll always have somebody to rule us but eventually God is the one who has the final word amen and we know the Roman Empire could didn't last but just just just think about it amen corruption and internal conflicts and and and and and weakened their foundations amen we also see it in the the the Persian Empire from 550 BC to 651 ad the conquest it was it failed because of conquest by the Arabs internal division same thing internal divisions and economic troubles led to its decline the empire was weakened by constant Wars and regionalism amen in other words you know I I'm just they're not we're not satisfied with just their portion we want more and more and more and more and the more you get the more you want if God is not in it amen so we see that the Persian Empire they fail they fail the same same way and and um Babylon the Babylonian Empire conquest by the Persians again internal divisions and economic troubles led to its Decline and the empire was weakened by constant Wars so I I'm so glad that this that this Kingdom we're just reading about amen is an eternal Kingdom and it cannot it cannot fall amen praise the lord it's a kingdom that God Amen established amen and and it's a perfect Kingdom praise the Lord Jesus it's a kingdom that uh that's the reason why it's so important for you and I to receive the Holy Ghost in This our day amen praise God so brother brandham brother brandham says here and this is a little lengthy but you just bear with me it says in the message the Fallen apart of the world now over in the book of the Hebrews we read a while ago for we receive a kingdom not receive a Creed not receive a system we receive a kingdom that cannot not be moved the world is Fallen apart and you know and if you go back and reading these messages and listen to this messag that brother brandham preached the Fallen apart of the world or the world is Fallen apart brother brandham brother brandham talks about how in that day people were looking for a messiah you know just like in the day of the of the Jews uh uh during the time of Jesus they were looking for a messiah they were looking for the Messiah to come in and stump out the Romans and to and and to uh bring peace and and bring order the order that they thought things should be amen amongst them and and and here it was again in n in the 1960s and and the world yet again was falling apart and what was the world looking for during that time and it was Christmas time usually when brother Brandon would preach this message and what were they looking for they were looking for a messiah they were looking for someone to come in and and and and restore peace again and bring things back the way they were back in 2016 17 18 19 and you know we ain't going back to that God has you here amen because he's he's got to have Overcomers in this time amen things aren't going back PR 2016 2017 amen things are going to be the things things are being shaken amen where where are you putting your confidence in amen is it the word of God is the word of God so important to you amen or or or or is or is the political process more more much more important to you amen right you don't live with those candidates neither do I so you don't know what what what if they're saying one thing out of their mouth and well how they live behind the scenes they all got skeletons in their closet and they all have allegiances to other things and other people amen other than the United States I'm afraid I'm afraid to say that so so uh uh this this this this thing is is what people think that there's somebody that's going to come in amen but Jesus Christ has already set he is our Messiah amen he is our conqueror he is the one that we need the problem is is that we don't want him amen we we want our own thing we want our own our own uh flavor of Peace we want our own flavor of of Joy amen when God has given us joy through his word god provides joy and peace through his word amen and and and that's what that's the kingdom amen that you must receive and and that's the only Kingdom that will stand praise God so brother Brown continues saying here not receive a Creed not receive a system we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved the world is Fallen apart that's true and every politician every denomination and every church will fall to two pieces amen amen e every oh you say well that was just in the 1960s every every every that's 2024 but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved for if they who rejected him who spoke from Mount Si and the Earth shook beneath his voice how much more see that you don't reject who him his word that speaks from heaven from his kingdom for We Are are in a kingdom that cannot be moved amen how many believe that praise the Lord Jesus we are in a kingdom that cannot be moved but that Kingdom has to be inside of you first praise God Amen and I like what he says here and I put this title at the top that God made it fragile so it would break you mean God made it that way so it would break yeah amen God made it fragile amen so that you can long for something that stronger amen praise God because when the kingdom of God is inside of you amen you long for a true Kingdom amen when the true kingdom of God is inside of you you long for something better than these things out here amen and everything that happens every single day and man we're oh look at this I mean July has been has been just look at this here look at that there look at that here and everybody it it it's all distractions it's really what it is and Satan is is is is on a rampage Amen to try to get you distracted to try to get you Amen to to to Hope in someone or something he will he that that man will will will take care of all this once he gets elected in November amen I I've already voted for Christ amen you might vote for the for the for the donkey or for the elephant I'm I'm voting for The Lamb amen praise God he's the one that that that's done it all for me everything that's outside of that God sent everything he made it fragile watch he says he made it fragile so it would break so it would break Amen in its fragile condition like that it's got to break you want to say you know we know that this Earth and we know that the world Amen is is the cosmos is some really awesome stuff there that God created amen you know and it's it's it's strong you know and it's and it's it's it's it's um you can just see the the hand of the the hand of God in it Amen brother brandom even said that scientists can't even explain a blade of grass and and and so it it's it's the the the the mind of God in order to create these things and how how low can man get to say that there is no God that there is no intelligence behind the things that we see and as there saying that their their their own heart is beating and their their blood is pumping through their body and their brain is functioning and and and and and all the functions in their body that they're they're not even aware of and yet they're blaspheming God at the same time amen and they have no control of praise God Amen but yet in in all its Perfection the the the the the because we know that God created it perfect but right now the the the earth and the is the creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God that means there's something that's out of cater amen amen that means that that that something that they're Desiring that was there at one point amen but but but we are coming to that place amen and so but uh Peter and and different people in in the scriptures they talked about how these elements and all these things they were going to melt amen and now this world is going to be is going to be shaken and this and everything is going to be burnt with fervent heat so it's fragile God created it that way amen but there's coming a there's coming a a a new Heaven and a new Earth amen and I believe that one amen is going to represent the kingdom of God that's in you amen praise God he made it fragile so it would break and it's fragile condition like that it's got to break it's fragile but remember that we got a kingdom that's solid now amen amen how many can read that maybe that's the the words are too jumbled up together we got a kingdom that's solid now amen amen praise God you have to have confidence in the Holy Ghost that God gave you amen that it's going to lead you Amen to the other side amen that it's going to produce amen what what it promised that it would produce and it's going to finish the work that he started in you amen when everything else Falls and gives way when everything else Falls and gives way no wonder Eddie perinet said on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds is sinking sand amen a kingdom not a polit a political system not a political system not a church not a denominational system it all becomes Pharisees and doctors of the devil amen amen but we receive a kingdom an eternal kingom right who is the Eternal Word who has eternal life by his Eternal Word to his eternal people who has eternal life and we're partakers of this oh my that that's the thing praise the Lord Jesus amen so it's all eternal life amen praise God and the more you read of the word and the more you feed yourself in the word amen the more of that eternal life you're partaking in amen the more of that word you're becoming like amen praise the Lord Jesus amen but if we if if if we're getting distracted by other things and we're allowing those things Amen to feed us amen then we then don't don't don't uh don't wonder why you're are getting upset and why you're on Facebook arguing about politics and how and how and how Camala Harris could be the the the the the the the the Whatchamacallit the she's uh fulfilling that the prophecy you know and and all that we don't know that and so you you have to you have to uh you you have to just stay amen with what you know we you know you you you have to stick with what God didn't show us everything amen so you you can't affirm every single thing that you see is yeah yeah that's it and then that's what they were saying about Hillary and then that's what they were saying again about back in when when Biden got and and so forth amen so we have to amen just stick with what the word says amen stay with stay with what you know amen stay with what God has given us and God eventually amen will amen will F un unfold his plan praise God you just roll with it you just roll with the plan of God and don't let those things worry you amen because if God wanted you to know exactly who it was amen if we were going to have a woman president then he would have told us and he would have had a purpose to do so amen but he did not not through his Prophet amen so it really didn't didn't go it wasn't in God's mind to do so amen so it shouldn't be in your mind to wonder amen if if it is or not amen praise the Lord Jesus and and so and so we if we just stick if we stick with with the word amen and stick on what on on those things amen it'll take as far praise the Lord Jesus am man I'm not going to be too long tonight because I also want to give the little report amen about Honduras so brother Brandon continues here now anything that pulls you away from that is wrong and what is that that Eternal Kingdom amen that's what he was talking about because this is this quote continued anything that pulls you away from that is wrong anything that pulls you away to go argue on Facebook anything that pulls you away Amen to um you know they got Trump now almost at Jesus Christ status now it's sad it's it's it's it really is a cult if you think about it because because you know and and and his and his in his uh assassination attempt that really elevated his uh his popularity and that's what they wanted that they wanted this reaction they wanted this for whatever reason I don't but but but just be careful I just say be careful I say it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ stay in the word amen I'm not I'm not democrat or republican amen but but uh you look you look more into Trump's life he's not what he says he is I'll just tell you that right now and so you you you you you'll easily fall for something amen and then you start leaving the word of God Amen and and then that thing fails you and then you realize where have what have I done I I did not stay with the word amen it sounds holy and even if it sounds good and it sounds just right and amen but if if it does anything that pulls you away from that from that kingdom is wrong brother brandham said that's a false Messiah he said that's right a false anointing amen amen oh oh he said the brother had such anointing what kind of anointing that's it Hitler had an anointing too amen kusbs got one also Pope Pas has one also what kind of anointing you got if it's not Anointed with this word and vindicate every word to be truth leave it alone right amen I'm not telling you to go not go vote you know that's not what brother Brandon was telling you amen amen but if it's leading you Amen to the wrong thing amen leave it alone there's things in this life amen that they might not necessarily be wrong that's not necessarily fishing you know it's not wrong amen but if it causes you Amen to to to to miss church then you're missing the kingdom fishing is not wrong amen other things in life are are are are are not wrong you know you know that I just speak plain so I I just there's other things in this life that are not wrong amen but if it's causing you to fail the Mark if it's causing you to to to to pull you away from that Kingdom amen then it's wrong amen praise God so it's what you allow in your life to cause you to to to change your attitudes toward people to cause you to change your your the way you you you you you uh talk to God and read his word and and the way you start looking at other people because let me tell you politics divide it does the word unites politics divide and if you're falling in for that trap amen of politics amen you're becoming just as corrupt and as rotten as brother brandham said those things are right and don't get mad at me cuz brother Brandon was the one who talked about those things first amen it's so sad that people are falling for such a disgrace is that thinking that their their their Messiah amen is going to their Messiah is going to save them from all this amen when you know amen that it's this thing has to fall apart amen it's got to amen it's time it's time for us to go home amen praise the Lord Jesus I I want to go home amen and I you know what whatever needs to happen amen it's just to fulfill the word of God amen amen but I don't want to fall in line amen with those that those same anointings amen Pope P has had an anointing also what kind of anointing do you have if it's not Anointed with this word and vindicate every word to be truth leave it alone wrong if it don't produce itself then it isn't deratization they showing its color now oh say but that was for another age amen we leave that thing Alone brother Brandon said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you may be saying you know well he was just talking about spiritual things but again we go back if there's something physical that's that's pulling you away from the spiritual then leave it alone amen if it's something out here Amen in the cosmos amen that's pulling you away from the spiritual then it is something something spiritual leave it alone amen you have allowed it in your life to become spiritual then leave it alone praise the Lord amen all right and and so with with this I I'll I'll I'll I'll finish this is the last slide before we get to the Honduras STP so when this world falls apart we are born into a kingdom that cannot fall apart amen I'm so thankful for that amen amen a kingdom that cannot be shaken amen so that is why amen if you have that Kingdom in you amen you cannot be shake you will be shaken but you will not crumble amen the pressures will come and and let me tell you it won't be just one amen it'll be it'll there's going to be more pressures personally in your in your life they are coming down the road because God has to shake everything out of us that's not supposed to be there amen that's not part of his word he's got to shake it off any unbelief amen no unbelief will go in praise God Amen therefore we got to have the pressures that we have in life and the and the shakings have to come in order for us to be to to uh to be full of that perfect love amen praise God so when this world falls apart we are born into a kingdom that cannot fall apart you believe the world is falling falling apart brother bam mass and that was in this was in 1962 is uh more than 50 years ago amen imagine the things out now it's really really really falling apart amen but but young people amen you don't lose heart amen you know I've heard young people say you know what's the point of continuing to move forward in in my you know and in doing what I want to do in my goals and things like that Amen brother Bram said just continue planting your potatoes continue with your plans but do it with God in your life do it being led by the right thing and by the right influences amen and and and if God if God wants to bless that he will bless it amen if if there's and sometimes we don't know the will of God unless we we we we we we try amen and in trying amen after you've prayed about it then God will lead you in that and you'll know exactly if that's what you need to continue doing or or if you if not amen and so God is God is uh sometimes we just have to trust him amen and have faith amen and just take him by the hand and say Lord you lead me because I can't lead myself you believe the world is falling apart its systems are falling apart do you believe that do you believe the econ economical systems are falling apart the political systems falling apart the national the UN system is falling apart the church is falling apart amen the denominations are falling apart everything has falling apart amen but I like that but we got a kingdom that cannot be moved it's the Eternal kingdom of God and it cannot be moved amen so thankful that we have a hope a hope there that that that we can we can lean our shoulder upon and it's and my if I I'd certainly be a miserable man if I had to put all my all my trust on Donald Trump or Joe Biden or Camala Harris God Almighty help us I'm glad that we have the word of God that we can put our trust in amen praise the Lord that's never failed amen that's never had skeletons in its closet that's never amen has ever lied amen it's but everything else does those things never do I'm I mean the word of God never does Amen praise the Lord so thanks to brother Boyd that we started so early we just going to we just I was supposed to sing oh my goodness okay then that's why you did it well I apologize brother boy that I make the the song special sheet and I forget that I put myself in [Laughter] there well it all works out I'm singing now praise God all right well I I appreciate each and every one of you for your uh for your prayers on the trip that we took to Honduras it was a short trip it was only July 11 through the 15th and uh earlier this year brother Matthew Watkins there and brother Jason dears there on the far left they asked me if I could uh go with them to Honduras to help to be their interpreter and being that I had already you know we've gone several times and this this was their first time going to Honduras they' they've been to other places but not not to Honduras they they asked if I wanted to go and I said sure So we um and and it turned out that that also it was a a perfect timing because another brother which is the brother there in the middle brother Eli he's a pastor there with that was hosting this Youth Camp um it was in the same exact time so it all worked out and um and so here and there's brother Solomon Huffman there on on the right as well uh brother Eli there in the middle had uh had invited brother Solomon to go uh in from Nicaragua when brother Solomon usually goes to Nicaragua to minister at the the the byc camp that's there the Spanish one and uh so this was his first time in Honduras as well so it was first time for all of them uh there so that is at at the camp so this is uh I think this was the day that we got there sweetheart this is the day that we got there and we met up with brother Eric you see brother Eric there on the right you all know brother Eric and um and so we we we got there okay around I guess around noon it was just Christine and me that went this time and um and we this is we stopped by and got a little a little coffee now um poor poor brother Eric I mean every time he he just it's like the devil just constantly fights him so he was carrying uh we were riding in another vehicle with another brother and he was carrying brother Matt and brother uh his his his family and brother Jason in his vehicle and of course you know he had issues with his vehicle so um when he we got to the destination it was something with the brakes but uh there was some other things that had taken place as well while we were heading over there and uh thank God that the money that that you all gave as a love offering we were able to help pay for this repair for them and took care of that for him so um uh he was able to get his vehicle back again now so uh the the youth meetings there brother Elise Church uh in El Sero de Hamas in Honduras there was about 230 youth that attended it was the first Youth Camp that they had at this church now just a little background of this church when I first started coming to this visiting this church at brother Eli brother Elie's the brother that I've worked with to go to Honduras uh up to the those a few years ago when I showed you the videos and the pictures of us going up to the mountains hiking really high well it was him it was him and me that that that we that we went and so um he is right now pastoring this church until they can they get another Pastor so he's there helping them right now I guess he's kind of like the interim pastor because their pastor had passed away so so it was a small group at the time and the church was small as well but they have built on to the church and we have helped with some funds to help them build a Sunday School area in their at the bottom part of the church and some other funds that that came from other churches uh they've helped uh build a pretty much it's a whole it's pretty much a brand new place um you know it's not it's not not as nice as we have it here but it's a it's a lot more room and uh they were able to hold their first youth youth camp and so uh so 230 youth had attended around it's what what they uh what they had that signed up and that showed up there was others that had signed up but they did not show up and overall we had around 300 people that were in attendance there if you add the adults that were there helping out as well so uh this is me right there on the right interpreting for brother uh Jason dears on one of the morning services and and my goodness it was very hot every time we' preach our shirts would just be sticking to our our body but uh we made it through and uh this is kind of the the landscape where we were at up up in in this is the area where where we were at this is this area is called el Hamas um and here's some more pictures there's some of the sisters preparing uh meals and the their their kitchen is on the outside so they're they're they were all all the whole time just really much preparing meals that's uh the Friday night service uh the meetings started Thursday and they went all the way till Sunday so this meeting there on the left is brother Matt Matthew Watkins preaching and I was interpreting there for him and uh we we certainly had a really really good service that evening um people are still talking about it the the Lord really spoke and and really I believe the Lord really met needs there that night and and young people came to the Lord and uh just the Lord used brother Matthew in such a powerful way and I I we appreciated that for him yielding himself that way and uh and then there here's some of the uh the youth uh they're they're singing a special this is I believe uh different youth from few different churches and there there we are there preaching interpreting for brother Matt that same Friday night and uh on one of the services uh during the day they asked for the ministers to come up and uh so the pastors that were there and this is a picture uh of us these are different pastors the pastor right here um if you this brother right here he is uh he drove with his group of of of young people over 14 hours and they live out pretty much in the jungles and that's where they have church just to be able to be in attendance to so uh God bless them for it and uh they they were they were there to support the the the the youth meetings and uh his name is brother natividad so um so yeah yeah so that's I didn't um well we leave it like that here's some of a shot of the some of the young people on one of the morning Services as you can see they they always they usually sit them the sisters on the right and the brothers on the left um most churches they do it that way all right on the last service on Sunday I I preached the closing service when before the young people left and uh that's me preaching all right and then there's some more food preparation there on the right now I I wanted to say something about these uh these these beds here or these mattresses they these mattresses go back these little mattresses right there they they they they they keep these mattresses and they use them for all these different youth camps and all these different meetings and and things like that and for a long a long time for many years and they were wearing out and uh uh did we did we help we helped with some of the they needed to have uh to be re re uh I guess upholstered or covered again and so about two or three three years ago I believe it was we with some funds that were used here for your offerings you see some of this stuff you don't know because we use it from your offerings that you give before we leave and and really I failed to kind of tell you it's exactly what but but this is this is one of the things it was over I think it was over 600 of these of these mattresses that were redone and we helped uh the major I guess the majority of that to be done so that they contined to be used for the young people that stay in these youth camps and and and and in ministers meetings and different things like that so here in a moment I'll show you inside the church because usually what they end up doing is they they they end up using the sanctuaries and it's because of the lack of space they really don't have anywhere I mean they don't have nice facilities like at like at bethl and and and byc and stuff like that they got to use what they have and so they got to use the sanctuary the church to be able for example that was the place where the where the young man slept on the floor so they took out all the chairs and every single service they put all the chairs in put all the chairs out and they would use the sanctuary for to house the the boys to sleep there's no other way to do it so you know so you times sometimes you might say well you know you have to be reverent and things like that but what can you do God understands God knows the hearts so so so uh and then of course the sisters they were housed somewhere else you know they have to kind of keep them separate and uh but they lay out all these these these these mattresses and and they sleep all a lot of them just sleep all in one room and so here we are this is a uh having a meal with us the brother here on the right uh um right next to the first sister here on the right that is brother Paco and I know brother Aaron he knows brother Paco and and uh brother Paco is their main interpreter there in Honduras he used to go he used to live here in Alabama and uh he he he uh he was there with brother uh the brother um Homer Lor and uh he had to he had to go back to Honduras and and so God has really used him there and uh and and now he's he's he's he's one of the main missionaries and also the main interpreter there in Honduras so um but he can't do it all on his own so they really it was nice for them to have for him to have the help you know and there's in the evening time some of the areas where we where they sit and have meals all right there's some of the sisters all you know just all around just cooking all right this is the sanctuary and you see how they got the uh the mattresses ready to go that's just some of them and they they they they clean them up they clean up prepare the area and they they just lay down in there and uh they just have to do what what what you know they don't have a nice shower or anything like that I wish I had a picture of the showers that they do have it's like a makeshift thing just around plastic and uh it's really no shower it's just a bucket a big 50-gallon drum and and you just pour water on yourself and that's what they have to do so um I I bet you they they if they went to byc these young people they'd be in heaven or they went to they they just feel like you know wow we got it made and we're complaining why we took a little break you know during one of the services and uh the nearby City had a little mall so we went there and and brother brother um uh Jason dears wanted to pay for a meal uh and we were at actually at a little Pizza Hut so Pizza isn't something they always eat so we took him to a little Pizza Hut and brother Jason dears he he took care of it so we we appreciated that all right this is uh me with brother re renei renei he's a pastor there and and uh if we go to in December you'll meet you'll meet brother retti brother Wade and uh he is down there in in the area near Chola Honduras and um he sends greetings to you all by the way all right so this is the last day and everybody was leaving and uh different pickup truck pickup trucks had their own little the their young people some of them driving different different hours um and so everybody's packing up and ready to go and as we were packing up um there was a storm I don't know if you could if you could see there was a storm getting ready to come and some of those young people I mean they were in that back and they were just the ones that we were hauling behind us and we were only driving about two two to three hours it was about 3 hours they were they just got soak in wet poor I I felt so bad for them but but the sun quickly came back out again and they dried up again so uh this is the truck uh the brother that with that the brother there with the blue shirt that that's brother melito and he was the brother that was uh driving us around in different places and see these are some of the young people that got drenched back in the back the these are some of the young people that go to brother Eric's Church in in there in in talanga Honduras all right and everybody's saying goodbyes and farewells and I think I already showed this picture all right and so brother Eric and sister Rebecca and there's little Olam right there look he's got more hairir now but I just want to appre I want to thank you all for your prayers and your offerings um we were also able to help brother Eli the pastor who hosted the the the uh the meetings we were able to help and pay for all the food that they used with all the with all the the the offerings the offerings that you gave um so that pretty much was covered there was also fath for some of the young people and some of the brothers that were coming from far off like 14 hours and so they needed bus fairs and they needed and we helped pay for that as well so that they were B able to to take that was a able to be taken care of and um and there was something else and I can't remember I always have to have my help meet to she keeps track of these things I'm sorry car yeah the car repair brother Eric's Car we were able to help out with of course we also gave some money to the brother that was driving us around he drove a lot and um there was a um uh and just different miscellaneous expenses I mean you just constantly have expenses yeah oh yes yes the brother that the brother that we stayed uh the family that we stayed with he uh we gave him a little offering as well for for for having Mak going to stay in his place but he was a uh I'd seen I'd met him before but the brother apparently he had D fever the whole time and he was still working he was still he was still trying to you know just we prayed for him we uh and I believe about a day or two later he was able to feel much better and so um uh he was the first two uh Services he didn't attend but then the last two he was able to do to attend so God answered prayer there so we were able to give him a little offering for helping us stay in in in his home and um and so that is pretty much the trip in a nutshell and we just appreciate your prayers pray for us uh because Lord will and we're going to be going to Portugal in September will be in Portugal they asked they're going to have some special meetings did did you all know that brother Brandon went to Portugal most people don't know that 70 years ago and so the brother brother Mario de Gama who's uh the pastor there he's holding he's he he wanted to hold some meetings to I guess in commemoration of 70 years that brother brandham had been there and so it's like a three-day meeting three or 4 day meeting and he asked me to to speak at the opening service so there's going to be Believers from different parts of Europe to be there and that's going to be September 10th I believe through the 15th if I'm not mistaken somewhere around there so you all remember us in your
