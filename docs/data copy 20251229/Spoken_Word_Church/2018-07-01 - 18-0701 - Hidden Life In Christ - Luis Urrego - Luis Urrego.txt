========================================

okay thank you I trust that everybody's had a good week and and I trusted you all have been enjoying what brother wait they're bringing out of our romance yeah I think it's very good and you know yeah you might say well we're doing a lot of reading well that's what we're here for right well it's the word that takes preeminence right but but I like I've always liked that going verse by verse and taking even brother Brennan did that he did that all the time that was the way he talked which is going verse by verse and just staying on the verse even to services but then you keep going keep going well if you say even kept brother I mean you kept up yeah brother job when that actually for for a while you know until somebody got tired anyways well we're gonna go ahead and uh I've just been thinking about this little thought here I've been thinking about the thought of a hidden life in Christ or the hidden life of Christ in the believer and and the reason why I was thinking about this was something that something that I heard a couple of months ago brother wait on him brother Dale brought out and he was talking about and he's talking about how in the ages the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust all the different worms the bugs had eaten down the world right throughout the ages and but what they could not eat down was was the root correct and I thought and that really stood out to me because I never ever saw it that way before and I believe in brother Branham teaches taught the same thing because what the devil and the religious systems the outside systems the outside forces can do they can kill the influence of the word in your life right they can kill just like just like Satan and religious systems of Jesus of when Jesus was here on earth of that day they were able to kill the flesh body of Jesus Christ right but they could not kill that life right that life was hidden I mean none of that that they couldn't even understand that life right right so therefore with the religious systems of that of our day and different nominal ideas throughout different ages were killing the influence of the word in the room in the bullet and the believers life because of the way they were hiding the word more and more from the people we know that the Catholic Church they they did that you know the only ones that could have a Bible even open it to read it were just the priests and they would read it to them in Latin and so and people wouldn't even really understand so that influence was being killed but still did not mean that new births were not taking place there was still new births taking place for the word that they have for their death right there were birthing and the word that they had for their day so the life of the word was not killed that's the reason why Jesus Christ I mean he resurrected because that life that life was there right and that's why he said I will restore the set the Lord so that life was coming back up because they could not take out the root that's where that's where like this because that root is ain't and you know you look down at her tree and the roots especially when they're extended I mean there's no way especially if it's hooked in and to us or river source right and and I believe was David that talked about with a pleated tree this planted by the waters you know it's always got the source of life right there and so so that got me to thinking you know and I I preached a message a couple of months ago about when God saw the light we when we looked at Genesis chapter one and we want to look let's just look that real quick minute in Genesis chapter one that's so different here that's this one about once a month early Genesis from the birth birth death anniversary in the beginning God created the heaven the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water haploid moment ago just keep and God said let there be light and there was light right there so God said let there be light and there was life right when we look up that word light amen I like this meaning right there it says the light of life right so that was God's life amen that light that it was talking about we know it's not the Sun you know it's not the moon because later down in several verses later we see where God created the moon the stars in the Sun right so that is the life that I wanted to discuss this morning amen and and I guess if I could give this a little title the hidden life of Christ in the believer and so let's look at these these scriptures here I don't have anything here organized so you all forgive me he's been looking through some things kind of preparing a full message so I don't have a slot PowerPoint presentation or anything so just bear with me but let's read here enough the Colossians chapter 3 it says if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God amended us when when Christ who is our life shall appear when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye observe up here now I like what it says there when Christ who is our life right shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory amen so we not we for the believer we is not that we just have amen when we have Christ we have the true life of God right here and the same thing when we just saw in Genesis chapter 1 that life amen was the life of God it's what it's what makes up the believer when it when when when you're born into the kingdom of God amen you have the life of Christ amen and it's no longer you live in but is Christ living through you amen and you right is right all right so so let's read this let's read here in Ephesians chapter 3 says for this cause i paul the prisoner jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ right which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit amen that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel so either with this life was a mystery throughout ages right we're off I was made a minister according to the gift of of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning art and to make our men to see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Jesus Christ so this mystery has been hidden God from the beginning and now it's been revealed unto us right so since you and I are privileged people in this our right to have this mystery have been revealed not just to you and me but through you in me because it's hid it's attached to the life of Christ right to the intent I see where we are to the intent brothers personally to make all men see what is fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him yes we didn't have boldness and confidence before we were scared when I was young and I would hear about if I did something wrong I thought Christ or God was going to send down the lightning bolt any moment and but now we don't seek God that way right right at least you shouldn't you shouldn't if you still see God that way you know then you need to you need to grow in God you know you need to get closer you know have a personal relationship than God because it wants you just like as Paul says here in verse 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him and in Hebrews in Hebrews it talks about us entering in to the into into the UH into his sanctuary with boldness and confidence right because that's how we need to approach God God you said it in your word I believe it that settles it that's right that's why he wants you and me to do but sometimes the way we approach God is be approaching God if he want to run but that's not the way we approach God reproach him with bonus taking his word what God loves for us to take his word back to him because that's the only good thing he reads that's the only thing he will he will back up as his own word not your thoughts not your own not your own thinking but his own word and so if you if that word has given you confidence and boldness and you approach God with that boldness that you've received through the word to tell him he has to do nothing but but answer whatever whatever you have me of amen so in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith of me and wherefore I desire that you ain't not at my tribulations for witches your glory amen praise God now so um I was thinking about the UH and I will read another scripture here in just a moment but and see if I could bring this quote that brother Brennan you know what since I actually read a whole message last night started at the beginning and ended at the same the same night and I usually I usually don't do that it takes me several days but last night I was just looking at this hidden life in Christ medicine like wow this thing's really good but brother Brennan says here it says my burdens are like yoke up with him the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs when you're once inside the veil with him he becomes your life the prophet said that in the people of the old day said he would write his laws of new he would put them in their heart now Mount Sinai was a place of duty but Mount Calvary was a place of grace people are still trying to live on Mount Sinai you know with the do's and dont's the law thank you but they don't they don't see about the grace of Christ that has come down we're living in a dispensation of grace right where that and that's why brother Brown was talking about Mount Calvary right people are still trying to live on Mount Sinai if I'll go to church if I'll pay my dues if I'll do this or death I'll quit this and stop that that's still on Mount Sinai when you come to a place where you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost the whole Christian life becomes a great glorious shout and hallelujah to you and your head away daily that's key not every now and then but you're hid away daily on a daily basis now we notice that once in there he was isolated from though once the believer was in there the person was in there the priest and that time he was isolated from the world their curtains the curtains dropped around him and he was hit away with God everything become real even though he knew that he had to do these things he knew the law he knew though the the but it wasn't really a real thing until he was behind the behind that veil or the holy of holes alright now I'll get to that just more glory a glory in this place where we once get hit away with Christ everything becomes a new thing to us then that's the reason why I don't see why people get bored with the word you know I can understand nominal people they don't know what to preach and they don't know what what else to look at so they'll just kind of rehash it's kind of like the world you know they don't know what other movie to come out with so they'll just rehash something that came out in the 70s and just add new effects to it computer effects and and and and unfortunately to some people I say even even people who know that God sent a prophet in this day they've gotten to a stagnant place in their life where the word doesn't even do anything fortunately it's not a new thing to us anymore and the reason why is because we're don't go in behind the see it's okay that we are out in the outer court right and and I have a picture here the tabernacle right it's all right that we have we have the out of court and you know what when the manna would fall the manna fell on the outer court manna fell outside of the tabernacle right because the people were living outside of the tabernacle was right so the word I mean I know that manna would represent the word but they would get nourished and they would get that manna every single morning afresh and remember that God told him not to take not to eat that manna that same thing don't let it go throughout the don't let it get old don't let it go throughout the day because by nighttime evening time it was old it was already getting worms and everything like that that's the reason why the but the the the the manna that we eat the Word of God is not to be stored head knowledge right it's to be eaten right that's what God wants us to do is eat the word not to just to have it as head knowledge because as head knowledge it's not gonna do you any good after a while it's gonna get gonna get old it's gonna get stinky it's gonna get it's gonna get wiggle wiggle tails it's not going to produce the life of Christ right but when the when the Israelites doing that manner would fall fresh they go out and gather it every morning meaning that every day every morning you should be seeking God every day it's all it should be it should be you and God afresh every single day right yes and every morning they would come out and get that manna and they would have to eat it right away in order for to strengthen them for the day right same thing with us amen every time you get that word and you receive it and you need it amen it's for the strength of the strength that God has for youth for the time that you are sitting at right that's right don't give me that I believe God gives us food in due season because that's what the Bible says for the round table table that he gives us food in due season he gives us food exactly the exact food that we need for the time that we need it for you know my wife she talks about [Music] now my wife she would she's mentioned to me before that during the time that we started out I'm in the hut I've known you all you know it's like early two-thousands but then we didn't really start coming here to church go round towards the end latter part of 2014 and of course God knew that we needed this type of preaching we needed this type of work right and it was a couple of months down the road after we started visiting here that we started seeing that my mother-in-law she was getting sick right she was she was getting sick and things were getting bad with her you know and eventually you know she went off to be with the Lord but during this time Christine my wife she tells me that brother Dale and the minister here would bring out preachings about about what it is about to be on the other side you know the going pass beyond the curtain of time and and all those things to bring an extra an understanding a further understanding than what she had at that time which helped her when it came time because God knew that her mom was going to go away and so it gave her more confident more more comfort when mom when my mother-in-law passed away that she knew that everything was ok you know everything you know she had I mean we know we all know we've read the the the testimony that brother Baron talked about going beyond the curtain of time but sometimes it's just here no but then when you actually look at things and in a more deeper way and looking at in the Bible studies and things like that looking at those things it really solidifies your thinking about those things and really builds confidence in right that's the reason why when you have confidence in the word and when you have confidence in your in your where you know where you're standing in Jesus Christ that's why you can approach him with boldness and confidence right because that word has given you it's been revealed to you right and when something is revealed to you and that no devil in Hell can take that away from all right no no the Satan can take that away from it because it sits there and it won't move it won't shake yes it's true to preach in this captured right [Music] that's the one that's gonna make make me go who has made Christ their head he's the perfect man right and when that perfect man that life of that perfect man is in you because it's not it's not since it's not that we all have these virtues already in us the only thing that's going to they have to manifest on the outside right but the only way they can manifest on the outside is if you keep feeding on that body when that life all right they just won't manifest on the outside just on their own right you have to keep eat so I always look at the statue of a perfect man and I was going to get into that appreciated because you know just as a new Tabernacle you know you were walking towards the Holies of Holies that's the head right there right that's that's the glory of God right there you're also walking into that that's the head right there right Christ is our Hey that's that's that's all in all right there and and so going back to the to the manna so in that mana it was told by molded to Moses to take some of that men on that original manner and to put it in in that holy of holies right now if that man on the outside it would get old it would get stinky would get worms but the manna which represents the word it was placed in a golden top the Bible says we know that Christ is always typed with gold you know so it was placed in a golden vessel and every time the priest would go back in there he could take some of that manner and it would always taste the same and actually it would always be needed right here on the outside it would give wiggle tails that would get old alright so and so a lot of people a lot of people you know the way I see it nominal people even people who have even gotten to know this message know that God sent a prophet there's still sometimes stuff that justification and sanctification right and then some have come further a bit more right gotten into the word more and of course we know that they're that good that they're here they're they're all about the mysteries and all about their giving in the word a bit more amen but there's something a men that that they haven't gotten to where that life of Christ because this here can just be all head knowledge you see you can see the lampstand you can know what the lampstands about you can know what the church ages is about right the sinner out here could probably know what the church take is about right they can even know about baptism the navel or Jesus Christ by head knowledge but the thing the thing is is that if you go and do it that's when you know that you're there's been to you right away they can know about the table of showbread they see they pray the golden incense altar is a type of the prayers they pray but they just can't seem to get in that Chicano glory of God why because they haven't come in there's something that that that's hindering them from further get further further in themselves in the word I'm happy where I am I'm happy out here I'm happy with God sent a prophet I'm happy with justification sanctification amen the God has only got to reveal himself to you the further that you go with Frank he never pulls us by the hand and said you're coming here no he's he's a gentleman that's what I like about God right so that that goat that mana so the priest could always partake of that mana every time you do a another thing is Aaron's rod was in there you know that humanity or would and the Bible types humanity right that rod under Aaron's hand it did all that get it was dry it was but when once it was placed in the Shekinah glory of God in that work in that in that and the Holy of Holies it started liven it up again it even buddy because do you say well that rod or that stick wasn't attached to no tree but yet it was it was a text to a life a life that which is the root right remember we talked about the Genesis one amen that life that light right so it was attached to the life the source even though there was a no physical tree that it was a test and it was growing almonds and things you see so everything out here is everything that you can do to approach God right so what you have to do to approach God in that in itself that's religion religion is what man duster to try to get close to God Christianity or the life of the believer is what God does to try to grow closer to man right but then when you come in here behind this veil is everything is about God then nothing that you can do why because you didn't make that rod bud you didn't make that you didn't make that that mana stay fresh in a new no it's it stays like that and all you have to do is pour take over its partake of it and admire and and in and we know that also between the gold the chair of the growth of the cherubs that were there of the the tabernacle or the ark we know that there was even a glow light that would come down right so it was all about represented life and light and so when you go in behind there everything is a neat to me then so whenever week with whenever you're whenever you're when you when the were the believer receives the new birth in his life and in their soul that's as if you're in there right this is the view in there that's the that's the eternal nest that's that's God Himself right there in the belief and of course we know that that the priest couldn't stay there forever they have to eventually come back out the process that you keep repeating right process that you keep going in and out well eventually remember I was talking about the the other day eventually one day will always be in there amen and you know coming out right perfection that is finest right face done so you mean I wanted to read this real quick and then we'll turn down Colossus scepter teeth all right and start at verse five here says for for though I be absent and the flesh yet I am with you in the spirit of joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so mean so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as he have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving talked about the uncircumcision and the circumcision of the Spirit and all that and the other night I was I was reading with this with the girls I was reading with the girls in here in proverbs chapter 27 we came up this this verse right here it says verse 7 right here it says the full soul loketh and honeycomb that means a person that's full doesn't want to eat anymore right you know and I looked at the history on that as as travelers were traveling they would be maybe eating some things on their way and they've come to like a honeycomb on there under on their travels they wouldn't want any of that because they were already full right just like if you keep snacking all day long no dinner at night you know but to the hungry soul every better thing is sweet but to the hungry soul every bitter thing every bitter thing is sweet now you remember the the you remember that in the Old Testament when this children of Israel were caring to cry leave Egypt they have to eat the lamb bitter herbs were added into it it's the same thing when we when we're walking in this way bitter herbs are gonna bitter things are gonna happen amen in our lives right but to the hungry soul that should be the believer amen right every bitter thing is sweet no matter what's going on in your life no matter what's happening no matter the chaos everything it can be falling all around you but when I'm in Christ when I'm hidden behind that veil everything is sweet no matter that priest was in there behind the inner veil it doesn't matter what was happening on the outside there were slain Lambs and killing blood and things going or splattering everywhere that the world was taking place all kinds of things was taking place but while you will that well while you're in there in that interval none of that was affecting because you were in the presence of God right and the reason why I say that is because the world is going into course right there's lots of killing there's lots of chaos there's lots of things taking place in our day but when your life is hitting Christ when you have that life of Christ and you're in that glory none of that none of that is poverty so to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet that's why when and we'll finish with this that's the reason why in Revelation Jesus the angel told the angel told John Lee was the angel told John said eat the book right when when when you eat it it's gonna be sweet and then but then it'll be better to put it to your belly right that's the life of a Christian you got sweet moments and you have bitter moments but you know how to balance it you know how to balance it when you're in Christ hey so I guess we can go up now so thank you for listening [Music]
