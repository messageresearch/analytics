========================================

in you we know if you ever saved one person if anybody else will reach that same position the same point of Faith or thinking upon you then you'll save them also because you're God and you cannot change we love you and we thank you have your way now speak to us and let your love be made manifest in each one of our hearts and lives and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth but now there's the key to the whole thing if we don't die and become born again you're still under the law that's right you said no the law was done away at Calvary Christ is the end of the law the Bible says for righteousness the law is still in existence out here the world will be judged by the Ten Commandment law is still in existence until you're born again only the Born Again believer is not under the law now think of those things I know sometimes maybe that I make strange statements but think about what is said unless you're born again you're still under the law right so then we've got to die that's the best way to get it you know right we got to die to ourselves and become born again now an illustration see for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so her old husband must be dead for us to be born again right so then if while her husband liveth she' be married to another man she be shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law how by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God or when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members not the Ten Commandments the law there see it's the law it's the law that while we were in the flesh we were controlled by the flesh see there's many laws in the Bible that is not just Ten Commandment law when you say law to most people it say Ten Commandments the whole Bible is the law unless you're born again all right for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law because of that law of us being where we were born did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law what that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter amen you may be born you may be seated cuz see if you're born again you may be born again I hope two thoughts in the same mouth that's pretty good my wife laughs at me because I have been guilty of of reading a book and listening to a tape and uh the tape would be one message and the book would be another one she said what are you doing but see I'm just listening to a point on that tape to till I get a thought cuz I know it's in that message then I stop and write it down you know but uh you know so you it does work sometimes it does split and work and I hope we ar born again because if we're born again then we don't have to worry about the rest of it all right now to get back to the point of this morning what is our thought that in the message called The Invisible Union is a marvelous message to me I really enjoy reading it now if you could just see the one I've got back in the office it's just one slap out from reading so much on it you know and writing notes and things on it but to me you can take that message and just go through it and you can just glean out the thoughts that he's bringing you can see that he's speaking to a denominational World in a denominational church and telling them how bad organized Rel religion is that's an amazing thing that they even let him come and preach you know and do but he's preaching the new birth but he's preaching about marriage and divorce he's preaching about law and Grace he gets on the future home and he's preaching about the soul of man being saved and he's preaching about these bodies being changed then he's preaching of a future home that will go live in when this world is totally redeemed but see then you just read the message and you don't glean out which way he's placing it maybe that's not the right word for it but you know you just kind of listen to what he's saying so then thereby as we were talking last night about you know the progressiveness of of the word as it unfolds to us see maybe the first time you read invisible Union first time you read the future home maybe you only were thinking about the new birth right well that's what you were receiving from it but then it moves up see into the future home in the in the invisible Union moves up that's what I'm trying to do now in a three-fold revelation is to talk about the New Birth because as I was trying to express this morning there's no need of you worrying about whether your marital problems is messed up or not until you're born again right because until then you're only dealing with and I was looking a moment ago I should have ran it off where the Prophet says we try to make these bodies come under law and that's commendable that's great I'd like to see a whole world full of people that were trying to do right wouldn't you right amen it it would be a Utopia but see it's not so because it's what Paul said we had that motions of sin developed in us and it'll never be that way there's always going to be killings and and everything else because mankind are not born again but yet still if we could just think about the new birth and think about how that every thing is hinged upon whether or not you're born again don't worry about the marital situations don't worry about the the uh Rapture because if you're not born again you're not going why worry about something you're not going to be a part of see why the prophet would say the new birth is the most important thing in the world right and like I said it would be then the very first doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ that's right that you must be born again the first thing that he was trying to deal with was to get people saved amen but we worry about the other things well brother Dale just can't you explain this to me let's get get born again right and then we can see that even the same illustrations of the new birth you know remember the message I went through about illustrating you know you illustrate something you give an example Paul is talking about a man must be dead then he's illustrating it as a like a marriage and divorce situation but he's really talking about law and Grace right but see let's get it into the point of what we need for the time or what we're doing maybe we'll do like the lbby said the other day she said Papa's been preaching on my name for a while her name's Abby Grace so she picked that up I've been preaching on Grace well see we we quote a lot but do we really understand right the Bible says that we saved by what because I shouted spoken T cried and done this and done that and I was a good person and and and you know no it says you're saved by grace now what's the point it doesn't say you're saved by faith oh I had this great Revelation I'm saved I can see the message so I'm saved it doesn't say that it says you're saved by grace amen that's through Faith amen through is a journey right amen of life that we're going through through Revelation sure then what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you is that what the prophet said not all these other things is whether or not you're born again all right so then we'll try to take that point and I was asked a little question so he gave me an opportunity excuse me about the cough drop because I have to put him in or I have to shut him up one so we'll put in the cough drop I've been doing good here lately preaching preaching many services but I know when I tax my voice a little hard like this morning I got a problem but forgive me but you're saved by grace through faith right that not of works lest any man should boast what good thing is it that we could do to be saved now you know that I'm not throwing stones at nobody but you know yourself you go to churches and back some of the old days and things and he said well that brother and I know he was a bad brother but he paved the parking lot he's going to be in glory they always want to put it on some form of something we done or didn't do right well I never did lie to cheat or steal that don't make no difference you're lost amen it didn't make me lost because I began to lie and cheat and still that just part of my nature that's just part of my ways and then it always comes up see to try to preach the truth it's a whole lot easier to preach a lie than it is the truth and you you try to tell the truth and then people say you don't want us to live good no I don't want you to live good think that over out in the world I there just listening to it think it over I'm honest I want you born again if you get born again it'll take care of the life the r said don't you women think that you're hiring you're dress and clothes that means you're saved that's right where would it be by grace through a revelation from God's word that's the prophet what is a new birth he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ as I said a minute ago personally to you amen not to brother brandom right and you God uses people to speak to us right amen go Faith cometh by hearing but see it's a personal experience of a new birth and you're not born again in your body right there's no faculty part of your body that can be born again that se taste field smell here you know all right you're not born again in your spirit because your spirit is memory reason conscience affection Love and stuff like that you can love God and still be lost that's right right right you see people that that are just great people but that they don't claim salvation being good then is not what it is so you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul amen and that soul is the part of you that was what I was asked while ago when was I going to maybe bring another series on the soul so we'll just put a little bit in right here pick up our thought to make sure that we understand see what's the difference in a human being and an animal we're nothing more than just a higher form of an animal that's right we're just the highest form of a mammal you know warm-blooded beings but there's the secret and mystery that we never could understand of Darwin's theory of evolution and couldn't see the difference between or the connection between man and the monkey and you know they've tried to breed the man and the monkey together to try to get things out of it and they can't get it all right because that that was a different makeup right but in the Gard Garden there was an animal between man and the monkey right and that animal would be called in Genesis the beast but it would be called The Serpent that's the key to the thing it says the Ser the the the serpent the the the Beast was the most subtable of all of the serpents you know all he wasn't a snake to start with if you even got a scoffield Bible if you'll read in the Bible of the Beast that even scofi himself in your Bible if you'll turn to the front and read his footnotes he said it was an upright creature made a snake see it was a beast all right it's the missing link that Darwin could not figure out how to get those two together right he could cross everything else but he couldn't cross that line because it was just destroyed cuz that's what happened the beast in the garden it was destroyed made a snake see where was an upright creature then it was made a snake all right in other words put in the snake domain never to be able to mingle back again all right but in doing that see then that caused CU what we believe that Eve had a relationship ship with the Beast right amen and I said this morning that surely wouldn't eaten apples right but to do that it made the human race being born wrong well now how much more could a seventh grade education man say than the way the prophet described it and he said that Beast that was in the garden said he was an upright creature look just like a man he could talk he talked with Eve but said he didn't have a soul right said he had a place for a soul but didn't have one now what's he meaning was an empty compartment in the Beast you know some hole some place or is that a terminology right of a person to express what it is that Beast was just look just like a man but it had no soul it had no connecting of a being that was with inside of it that would make it long after God because that's what the soul of man is then no matter where in the world you are you find people searching for God worshiping totem poles animals Stars cows uh whatever why because within man there's a there's a part that the animal don't have and that's a soul amen right and that Soul was created in the image of God and remember Ezekiel 184 says All Souls are mine amen I know there's doctrines in the message no need to worry about them but they teach that Satan gave you a soul well he can't do it cuz he can't create he cannot create that's the old two Soul doctrin forms but Satan can't create but he can pervert all right so as quick as the babies came or or quick as the not the babies but Adam and Eve to start he immediately through the Beast attacks Eve and he gets her to do wrong and that perverts the wound and that makes all of us born wrong there are doctrines among organized religion I heard of this many many many years before I heard of the Prophet that they believe that man didn't have a soul until the law came because you can go through the scriptures and by Paul saying by that coming the way we did we have a knowledge of sin yeah but see the Bible said that Adam became a living Soul right right so God created all the animals I believe in evolution but not the way man teaches it I believe in Creative Evolution God created this animal the next animal in a higher form the next one a higher the next one a higher each one that way science could go crazy trying to put the parts back together and miss the whole thing right right but then he came up and he made the Beast then he made the man and he made the man a living Soul so what is a soul of an individual really what is a soul see then you're a body Spirit soul as a triun being that we are the animal has the body he has the spirit form of life and certain amount of reasoning factors goes with the animal race I said a certain amount because he can't do a whole lot but yet didn't be trained because see he has the brain he has the mental capacities of the of the a little bit of memory reasoning conscience and things about him that it's amazing what they can do with an animal right but still you take the animal you turn it loose it'll do just exactly what it's been doing you can teach a bird to talk right but you turn him loose he go back and build his nest the same way build it the first time why because he cannot continue on that thought right any more than to be able to speak outwardly from the mental part of a brain of an animal but mankind see that's why he was cast out of the garden if you remember cuz the Bible says the imagination of man's mind is continually evil so we had to run him out of the garden all right see because that's the part of us that something with inside of us makes us just always wanting to be creating doing things different and and I'm enjoying it myself now whether you are or not I like an air conditioned house I like an air conditioned church I like an air conditioned car you know I I like the good things of Life all right I was raised where you know everybody likes but it's no joke where you could look through the wall and see the neighbor coming without opening the door you could look down through the floor and see the chickens under the house and you could look up through the top and see the stars a lot of you was never raised that way you know it was colder inside the house than it was outside I never could figure that out but but see I enjoy that because that's the part of man he's building look at him and he says you got to put him out cuz see nothing is withholding from man the prophet of God said he's broke into God's laboratory look at him take what's in my hand Adams send a rocket millions of miles into the sky and bring it back why because of that soul of that man right that's in the image of his creator he's a little Creator himself all right but what really is a soul see we can look at the body and we can see the sea face taste feels melon here we can look at the spirit and we can see the memory reason conscious affections and but what is really the soul of man cuz that's the part of you that God is working on we'll read this in just a second I just pulled these up to where we could read some and then we'll try to finish our thought of this morning and see see that soul is a part of you that makes you what you are right now you can be in a coma you know laying in a bed you have no recognizable ability to be able to uh communicate but yet they'll tell you in a hurry don't go in a hospital room with somebody in a coma and talk wrong right because there's something about that person that will be able to remember those things something about you that's more real than the animal righten you can teach the animal to talk you can te him teach him to count you can teach him to do all kind of things but yet it's like I've always told you you the buyer the old boy buyer will even kill his own offspring to cause the female buyer to become receptive for him again and she will fight him to the death of her over over her Offspring right but in a few months she'll be looking up the buyer to make again because that's just the way they're made they can't bring it to a reasoning Factor but see that's what we can do God made us with that ability to think things out and to communicate have you ever noticed it's always been amazing to me I always wonder you know when a dog goes off well it I go down to Spanish Town and I hear the dog going ar ar is he barking in Spanish or is he barking in English right you say it's silly but I just try to make a point the dog understands go or what would be Spanish for go see well y they got a certain amount of ability but we're just hire that we can come up with all those languages but now think about it what makes you so different is because with inside of you is a soul that that Soul has a longing for God we perverted by the things of the world and the the way we live and what we do but every little kid is born with a good nature about him right now we call it turo twos we're just turo 73s I guess but you know but we we think about it being terrible but it's still has a love about it that's amazing coming from something with inside of it and then you just think about everybody is in some way or other is trying to find God right the said would it be the cow the totem pole the the images of whatever is made of people you worship or ancestry worships or and then doing all of that you're trying to find something to satisfy that inward part not just the body and the spirit cuz in the body and the spirit in the spirit realm especially because there memory reason and con see you can deal with a person and they can be converted from one thought to another one Doctrine to another one belief to another all right but once that Soul anchors amen he'll never be the same one contac in of with God no matter how bad you turn out you'll always have something to remember that because that's where God deals with a person at is in the soul because if he can get that Soul the prophet said to stand still you see salvation is not a horrible or a bad thing or a hard thing it's simply believing amen but you know there's a lot of people cannot put because of their training in life their the way they've been brought up they cannot that old husband we were talking about this morning that we were married to the Natural nature and because of all of that you wind up in being just not able to sensibly reason out things you've talked with people like that had you they said they just couldn't get them to reason about anything well I don't see God well I don't see nothing but God well see there's just a difference in the way you're doing but that soul that you are that soul will either answer here or later and the Bible doesn't say the spirit that sin us shall die it says the soul that sinth so the soul is a real part of you right amen now speaking spiritually speaking as we call it Jesus couldn't lay a finger on those Pharisees they had kept his word to the letter what about you trying your best to to bring people to a position and they're living exactly the way that you describe it you know exactly the way you want it and yet you try to contact them and they don't want you brother R said birth birth pains I'm pretty sure he said he couldn't get them Pharisees to admit they were Sinners where they could be saved because see you'd have to first realize your lost amen see then that way of preaching sure you watch it now you you've been around you you're old enough yeah I can get up here and preach on hir and dress and make you cry and laugh and scream and go home and change clothes but a few weeks later you'll have them back on cuz there's no conversion to it I can preach against alcohol and you can get up and SAR that you're not going to drink anymore a few weeks later you're going to be drinking preach against smoking people take them out lay them on the altar right throw them away two hours later they're out digging up butts as we call them the end of the cigarette that's left over from smoking one because there been no change mentally you were contacted even spiritually of the memories the reason the things you're contacted but yet that Soul doesn't change so no matter what and you can train people like you can train a dog you can train a dog to do things you can train people not to smoke not to drink not to chew and they can get in that as we talking about this morning that sanctification stage and they can come to that place until they just they they love God and they're just in a Warfare you know they're fighting constantly to try to keep theirself under control and they think that's Christianity but Christianity require requires death right amen it required that almighty God die Amen in human flesh am we know God can't die Spirit form FR come on but he died in that flesh that life left that body to go up and come back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the dead of Pentecost into a group of people into their soul they had to hear that word cuz the Bible says faith comes by hearing if they had not heard the word there's no new birth until you hear the word amen come on you don't just fall out over the world Why didn't it fall out on the day of Pentecost to everybody right because it was only 120 of them that had the word and held it yet 500 had seen him after his resurrection come on I'm quoting scripture where was the other 380 that even seen Jesus after his resurrection amen right they didn't hold on no M no doubt they might have been good people no doubt they in flesh and spirit realm they might have been Christians as we call them good people they didn't make it to the upper room cuz Jesus in the parable he said the so went forth and swed said when he s deceit said some took the word and held it right they counted it worthy they knew that it was something and see that's why that was talking about this morning Billy Graham said I can have 10,000 converts and maybe have 10 or 30 brother Rand said it like this he said Paul go into a meeting he got one he said he comes back in a few years and he got 30 he said Paul carried his own the group that he had a person on to a personal experience something with God dealing with that soul in other words Paul daily was sitting there there talking about the scriptures and the things with that person bringing them through trying to get him to see what salvation really was he was speaking to the soul you see as I said a moment ago preachers preach to the bodies and try to clean them up they preach to the spirits and they get people shouting and Glory Hallelujah they go out the door and live like the devil but you see that one person who was it DW Moody that was it told of him one to of them where the lady rented the barn and and got the preacher to come in and have a meeting and she thought it was a failure one person came right that one person came to the alar that night and got saved I believe it was Dr Moody I believe that's the correct one millions of souls won the glory because of that one little woman's job she done she probably died thinking that she'd failed but yet Dr Moody got an experience amen so I believe in an oldfashioned experience of justification chopping off your pie sins repenting I believe in Sint ification to come and cleanse the vessel and set it in order but I believe in the New Birth coming and living within that soul of that individual see then you know the story that even you can be anointed in your spirit with a genuine holy spirit of God and do great wonders bam was come on his his writings is in the Bible what he wrote was in the Bible not just about him but you see God is dealing with that soul and that soul may go a long time before it will ever move very much see it's that real part of you amen right see if you die the Bible says what your body goes to the Grave right the Bible says your spirit goes back to God who gave it but where does your soul go we know from The Prophet's message then the Soul goes beyond the curtain of time into the sixth Dimension as we call it in the Old Testament it was called Paradise the bosom of Abraham but it was the soul of the individual and when Jesus Christ died on the cross he said my soul is troubled then he said into thy hand I commend my spirit you know what God done he just exited out of that body and left that body hanging on a tree they took the body put it in the grave had it went long enough it would have rotten but it couldn't because it already said I not leave his soul in hell so what went to hell amen the Bible had done said that right David neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption so he was coming up before the corruption set in but his soul went to hell amen Paul or Peter I believe it picked it up and called it the spirits in prison they were disobedient in the longsuffering in the days of Noah because the word spirit and soul is an interchangeable word form even into the Greeks and the things you cannot Define a lot of times what it's speaking of you must take the example that it's bringing it in to understand what it's meaning but he said I'll not leave his soul in hell you realize he went to hell for you and I he didn't have to go to hell for himself he had no sin amen he that knew no sin the Bible said became sin what became my sin right he took my place I don't have to go to hell then right nobody has to all you got to do is be born again but he send his Spirit back on the day of Pentecost and we call that this well of spirit but the prophet done a wonderful job one day of saying said he sent back his spirit in the form IM morphe form where it was of the soul of God what was was it come back on the day of Pentecost just an anointing of a spirit falling down no that's right the soul of almighty God because see he had spent three and a half years getting them 120 cleaned out planting enough words that it could drive that unclean Spirit out and then when that Holy Ghost came it just quickened that Soul it made that Soul alive so what is the soul of man it's the party you it's not your brain it's not your thoughts it's the part of you that is going to live on that's why I said a while ago the the Bible says the soul that sinth what does the bible say that the life's death is the death of the Soul why because that's you right you said well we're a unit well I agree and I got a quote here that we are Tri being Body Spirit Soul without any one of those things taken away you're not complete right you be laying there as I said in a coma you're still living you're still breathing you're still doing and even people will be talking Danny we was up in the hospital with him years ago when he had that real bad fall and for three or four no matter how many days we don't know he would sit up in the bed and talk to us he said we already have know it when the doctor said you need this operation he said get on with it that's what he said he said you ought to know I wouldn't awake but for so many days he talked to us and one day he woke up you know and wondered what was going on we had to explain to him what had taken place but yet he was still alive right he could remember certain things because of that ability of the human part's working but you see church I've never tried to get anybody saved in body I've never tried to get you saved in just a spirit real to get you to come to church and be good and and all of that if you're born again I don't have to worry about the rest of it you see yeah but all these preachers are after money I don't let you know what they are but that's all right that's their business but you see it's not your money that I'm after right am it's your soul that I'm after amen as a preacher I can contact that body and I can contact that spirit and I can get you to just put money in the offering plate you know just give it to me and I can just buy me and you Cadillac and man I can do all kind of things but you don't what to happen one of these days somebody will come along with a little better way of dealing with that spirit and they going to get you in their church and they going to have a new Cadillac and I'm going to be driving an old one talking about a soul but see if I can get you born again you mean you'd think if there was only two in this building today that's born again just two you mean those two would let me be hungry and be in need no they'd give me everything they got wouldn't it I do it to you I have done it so nobody can't argue the point what I have done you see that's the difference in being born again and just being a Christian by Christian Realms or whatever God is dealing with that soul that part of you that's so close to God until it's almost an immortal part of you brother random will even sometimes called it Immortal may even talk about a sinner but it's not an eternal part until it's born again but it's the real you it's that part of you that keeps you moving and going and doing and thinking correctly and then when everything goes wrong you know you know what I mean that when Trouble Comes away a lot of people just blow up and run off right you cross their Doctrine or ideas I was ending up this morning talking about it if you get upset with me for preaching the truth and you don't want to have nothing to do with me I still love you anyway it don't make no difference I still do anything in the world I could do it to help you but you see that's the way I can tell the difference whether you're genuine or not see a genuine a lot of times maybe not they don't understand they think you're throwing off on them they think you're calling their names you know when you're trying to save their soul and see then they realize it one day and then they just nothing can ever separate that part May separate in human flesh and live in different parts of the world but it'll never separate that part you cannot separate me from the man that brought me in this message because he dealt with My Soul for two years until I become born again you think I could ever deny that part no because it's part of my being part of my nature part of what I am you see the soul of an individual is it's it's entirely different than just a thinking of a some nature or some ways or some doings you are a person and there's a personality about you that no matter every soul is not the same you know what I mean now by that see it's according to your natures and your ways brother BR said if you're born again under a an emotional atmosphere you know spicing and he said that's what you want to deal with he said but if you're born again under a quiet more atmosphere he said that's the way you'll be why because it's the spirit of almighty God they can come in see then on the day of Pentecost when that that spirit of God came down and it touched that word that them them disciples that held 120 of them in the upper room the Propet called him spoken words Original Seed called him Little Seeds pulled back in the upper room little so little individuals sitting there waiting on something the one said hey look like we already got it let's just take it by faith and walk out somebody got up in the crowd and said wait a minute we don't have what he said right amen and I know I'm just natural carnal if that had have been me you know what I'd have said they jumped up bless God we got it we got it let's go let's just go face the world tell them about this Jesus and say okay you number one open the door you go open the door you go preach it if they don't kill you will'll help you you know what I'm saying there wasn't nobody going to go out that door cuz they were scared to death right amen but when that soul of almighty God dropped down into them individuals that little lick of fire that is it called it tongues of fire set on each one one not just sat on it come down and dwell in them and when it did they walked out of there every one of them want to die showed something happened on that inward part that was different from the body and the spirit of the man Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith as a Son of God he didn't claim to be living no more he claimed to be dead he claimed his old husband died the old nature of his soul not the nature of your body anybody in here get born again did it change the nature of your body other than the things you were doing you know you quit doing all of these other things you know what I'm saying Prophet said my new birth didn't take the nature out of me to want a hunt my brother how back are grinning at me he didn't take it out of him he loved to hunt right that's just the way it is I I love to make a garden cuz I was born and rais pl of mu well that's all I know but it still holds on I love to see stuff grow you know but you see it didn't change me when I got born again I still love to hunt and fish and see my my nature is kind of on a a lighter side of comis I guess you'd call it being comical because that's just part of me but if You' have known me up until I was 16 years old you'd know the difference I used to I couldn't look you in the face I was so embarrassed I talked look it away but see something happened one day not even my conversion to do that I made up my mind you know what he ain't nobody in this world no better than I am I made up my mind I might have plowed an old mule ate beans and ters but they ain't nobody no better than I am but you know what now that I'm born again I think everybody's a whole lot better than I am cuz it changed that part about me we see children kids young girls and boys ain't nobody know better than you are somebody make fun of you go up and hug their neck and say I love you show them something within you as an individual right we sure change a lot of things that's right I get on this and get slowed on but listen God is working on that soul to get that Soul saved let's read some of the things the prophet had to say the go ahead brother we got these and we'll we don't have to give the numbers but some of you that are holding the notes you'll see number one on your thing but look what he says in the end time evangelism 62 uh 603 Jesus said you must be born again again in in order to be born again it's letting yourself go and die and the spirit of Christ come into you then you're no more yours is Christ in you see the Holy Spirit Paul said I Die daily yet I live not I but Christ liveth in me see what is the soul then see that's the part I'm trying to talk to to get away from your memories your reasonings your factors and speak to that inward part of you that inward part that when you go home I used to I've told you about it and I don't tell it to be nothing just TR truth if I have stayed with God when I saw him in about 11 years old it been a lot of difference but I didn't I was taken away from that by the world and the things of life but even as a sinner because I never even claimed salvation whatsoever in the Baptist until my wife and I were married and that was 1958 which I'd been 18 years old I'd go out and do things wrong and I'd feel sorry for it because it was a remembrance of a god a totem pole people they they have a remembrance of a God and they'll take a baby and feed it to an alligator to try to appease that God there a remembrance of you that's that soul of you that's that part of you that's longing to be saved see all you got to do is touch that and just touch that with the thoughts of God then what you need to do is let yourself go and die just say Lord I'm sorry how many of you ever done that this they said Lord I'm sorry there must be a God I never had any thoughts that there was never a God because I had met God I'd experienced something that I didn't ever call everybody would call after new birth I can Mark the Spot he was standing old and about 10 or 11 years old I wanted somebody to get me to that God but everybody I talk to about it they'd say you need to go to a Pentecostal Church you need to do this you need to do that they didn't understand I had met a god that was alive you said well how come you thought that you wouldn't born again when you come in mess CU When that Prophet started talking about that God I seen that God dwelling in a man's voice I heard the words that I wanted to hear us Baptist talked about a god up in heaven one of the days we're going to get there if we're good you know but he talked to a god living down here that was longing to fellowship with you God created man for Fellowship he wanted to come down and be with us amen what he did come we killed him you see I didn't do it if you'd have been there you would have so just shut up on that part you think there's some holy pie something wouldn't have done we would have done exactly how come we doing it now that's right I believe you must be born again to have eternal life I believe you must receive the life of Jesus Christ to come and live in your soul the prophet said if he can get that soul to stand still long enough he said it'll die see because that's what's wrong with people there's so much shout Glory Hallelujah I believe in never been that I love it I can talk about the presence of God to even smell him until he would be so close but yet you got to have a personal experience that's right in that Soul part of you amen look what he says on the future home go ahead with the next one sorry for being a little emotional but I love him and I want to see you saved what you think about me we'll put that in the sea of forgetfulness it may take a while to get it there I'm on honest I'm a human being but it'll be put there look what he says you remember the Bible said if that Soul won't do as he did said do he will even destroy that soul but you see he can't destroy himself and remain God so if that soul is of the world it has to be destroyed and one day it will be if we're not born again but if it's eternal with God it never did begin what the eternal life never did begin the soul begun when you were a baby because it's a part of God it can never be destroyed amen what a beautiful how how thankful that the church ought to be to see that to see that you could be born again and become Eternal but we're taught in the message by everybody and that's why those false doctrines that's law and Grace will get more on I come into the world with eternal life well if you did Jesus Christ died in vain right come on that's worse than the Pharisees amen but you see that's what we believe because it's what somebody taught us they taught it to our intellect and that Soul has become perverted I say a while ago the baby's made perfect body spirit and soul not Eternal but perfect and then we perverted it oh I've done everything I could to save my kids come on it's like I've told some of you you wanted to pray for your kids to get here and you got your kids here and then you started laying out yeah there you go amen am I mean or is that the truth maybe the reason your kids is not in this church today is because of you I'd go to my kids and apologize to them yes sir amen that's right they don't listen to me we'll write them a letter I ain't going to apologize my kids I've done the best I could that's a religious hypocrite Pharisee get mad at me and do what you want to I'm tired I'm through with playing sugar tits if you're going to stay here you're going to hear it straight from now on but with the greatest love that I could ever have let me scream till I die my voice out you got to be born again going to church is wonderful if you're not born again see let's look what he says on souls in prison paragraph 36 see we're we're we're brought up and we've been taught throughout the message the soul is just the nature of the spirit there is no quote for that there is no quote that the soul is just the nature of the spirit that was added by a man that was producing a Doctrine right the quote is the soul is the nature of the spirit cuz when he said the soul is just the nature of the spirit you're just making it anything it's just the nature of something it's just a you know it's not a real being but when you say the soul is the nature of the spirit now you can have the Holy Spirit is being a being do you believe that do you believe the holy spirit is a being that is the being of God the only way you can be saved is have that being to come in and live not just a Doctrine an idea a quote now the soul of man is not not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit cuz that's exactly right and then when the nature of a man in other words we it's nature when he said we are dead well we would agree with that because until you're born again you are dead you know people they don't want to die right now Ain talking about physically yeah they don't want to die but the Bible tells you you were born dead why worry about what you want to be you already are dead we're just not dead enough cuz we ain't dead to the right things we need to be dead to ourselves that's right see and when he said we're dead the scripture plainly tells us we are dead and our lives in his are hidden God through Christ sealed out by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died y I want you it wasn't your spirit died Ezekiel didn't say I give you a new heart and a new spirit because you did it's a conversion working on the body Spirit soul of mankind it wasn't your spirit it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul amen well it's just nature or something that's where the wrong is at see it's just a bird dog chases Birds right a cow dog will chase cows you know how to train a bird dog to point you know that how many of you ever seen bird dogs you don't have to train them to point I never did understand with them little bitty fellas they walk out there and they see Mama and they walk up and Mama you just go they go they don't know what they're doing but they just doing what Mama but you know one day you turn him loose out in the field he finds a bird and he goes it may be a a brown threr or maybe anything cuz he don't know the difference until he learns but you know there's one thing that all dogs will do you know what that is all dogs will chase cars it's a lot of them kill cuz that's just part of it they're born with that nature look it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died the nature which is the soul now watch here's the quote see it's just the nature of the Soul here's the quote look the nature of your soul is God if you're born again right right if not if it's not it's of the world and you don't hear that by the two Soul peoples and the people quoting see the nature of your soul if you're born again is of God but if not it's of the world cuz you can't be no high gray area half in between right you're either born again or you're not born again that's right you're either a white bird or a black bird right that's not throwing on human ey talking fleshly listen anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then a little baby just breathe into there and they become a living Soul you know what's so odd about it is what I love every one of those little babies is different identical twins right look Alik so perfect you ain't tell the difference but there's always a little difference in that's right sister Trudy or somebody had a magazine years ago you've seen those odd freak things happened to where that they would be just one part of a body this picture was was was two little girls and they were 12 13 14 years old or something two bodies up here but only down here was just one set of legs and things but two entirely different Head Shoulders everything and one of those little girls like boys and the other one didn't you see that's is silly no we're all different because you see God made us that a way he made us the way he wanted us we perverted what he made but he made us the way he wanted us that's a beautiful story what about it Church the nature of your well I didn't know I talked to a man up in Jeffersonville and I he was talking about the two Soul Doctrine and he talking about Soul just the nature of spirit I said that's not correct tried to show him what the prophet had said and I said have you ever read in souls in prison where brother BR said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how can you have two Natures I said why don't you go ask the prophet you know I mean that's all I said to him cuz I have no more to talk to him about he couldn't understand what talking about he wasn't going to believe what the prophet said so he's denying what he said so I just didn't care look what he said let's go on now just a little but remember the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world so we got one nature or the other living inside of us if the nature of the world is inside of us it's going to do the things of the world there's where you cut in your hair and you paint in your face and you dress and your shorts and your clothes and the men and all of the hoopaloo goes for that yep because it's the nature of the world but look what he says here in 1961 when they ask him says please explain this is question and answer 61 paragraph 159 he says please explain the difference between the spirit and the Soul now the Bible what is Hebrews 4:12 I paraphrase it so if I miss it just to hire you read it it says that the spirit can divide between the difference between Soul and Spirit and joint and Mira see only the Des scripture as I said if you go in the Bible and you look up Spirit it'll give you a definition of that word you look up Soul it'll give you the same definition now you you know that you've looked it up right the only way you can decide what it's talking about is to find the context or thought that it's in right and then then you can see what it's talking about amen other than that you got the same definition all right but now watch well he said now that's a hard one but as I said Hebrews 4:12 said that Spirit can divide between Soul and Spirit and joint and miror it can tell you the difference in your soul and your spirit if that Soul within you will keep on agreeing with the word is got to be of God but if it stops agreeing with the word it's of the devil I don't care how much it's agreed up to if it ever stops agreeing it's the devil it's your old adamic nature that old husband we talking about this morning that's still alive he's still married to it because you're connected to it now that's a hard one but the first thing you are trying being just like Father Son and Holy Ghost now look at the prophet could take father son Holy Ghost about one God and explain a person or take a person of a body spirit and soul and describe God see because the spirit divides the difference the word reveal will to tell you what that soul is inside of you amen how do I know what I'm born again let me talk to you a little while we'll find out let me Rake you over the Cs about something and you sit there in body and say man I tell you what I'm hating this cuz I'm getting chewed out and I can't get up because he won't let me stand up and say nothing right but then on the inside of something says you know you already to listen to what the man's saying you know that might just be your spirit real but then after a while something says you know what he told me the truth you remember the lady that said brother brandham called her a a what was a vulture she said brother brandham called me a buzzard other lady said he called me an eagle According to which one you listening to one of them will show you of God and the other show you're not I guess we'll get on to what the soul is anyway we see like father son Holy Ghost three titles go into the one person which is Jesus Christ and you're soul body Spirit but it takes those three to make you with just one of them you're not you one by yourself you're not you all right I I want this whole being to agree with the word what about you I want my whole being to be involved in in in the word the word that that my decisions is made from that right and and we know we live humanly this doesn't do away with with living as a human beings and being people just because you're a Christian doesn't make you odd being a Christian you're automatically odd you don't have to make nothing you just do what the word says right us men we walk through Walmart and then nobody say there goes a Christian right they don't never walk up to you hey you're Christian cuz you don't never say that right but they walk around to the sisters and look at them and say you must be a Christian amen right well because they can see something I old men were just nothing anyway make no difference that's why with the ugly part of the side of it that's why it's it's a wife of a bride that God is coming back after that he's concerned with a people you all right takes those three to make you just one of them not you it takes a three to make you like I said the other day this is my hand this is my finger this is my nose this is my eyes but who's me right who's me who is me that this belongs to who is me that what all you see belongs to and we know the Plan of Salvation that these bodies will be redeemed right but you know God didn't die to just save our bodies amen right he died to save our soul he died that that Soul could have an opportunity Hey listen I've said this and I mean it from the bottom of my heart if I die and go to hell I want to see my family have an opportunity the reason I preach today I don't have to preach to be saved that has nothing to do with it but the reason I preach is to try to save your soul amen I want you to have an opportunity not to just be left at the hand dogs of this message preachers that are screaming holler their doctrines and run you all over the country I want you to have a change to see God I don't even talk about the things he he's done in my life some of you never heard what I said what I go about before that I saw God when I was was 11 years old cuz I don't get every Ser I seen God you got to come to me I seen God every service I don't tell you that I saw three times an angel a man standing in the room till the first time I seen it I grabbed a 357 and went after him that's how real it was but that ain't going to save you that's right you put your thoughts on that it ain't going to save you it's that word let me anchor that word let me preach that word amen until you can at least make a decision you got a choice I refused for years to open up this to an internet system I did you know that we started is sending out tapes it become so popular we were sending out $300 worth a month to paying for Foreign Fields to get the message to them cuz everybody wanted to hear and they said brother Dale let us get your tapes I said I can't do it cuz you got to get your pastor to okay it and the pastors wouldn't okay it some of them that was your pastors at that time wouldn't okay them to listen to what I was saying so one day I said God what can I do Richard Joe some of them here kept on and said wait them open it up Daddy go to the Internet with it at least they can hear I opened it up started on the internet system wonderful now at least some people can hear I'm not the internet pastor and I never will be I've had to write me notes and say we want to know about the answer to this question I said I refuse to answer your questions I am not your pastor I've even had pastors to do it there back I can tell you pastors would write and say I'm a pastor and I want to know I said I will not answer you go to the message but I will tell you I preached the Ser on that that's up to them to go to the series you know all right but listen I'm trying to deal with your soul who is me that these things belongs to who am I that the king would die for who are we that God would come from Glory right amen and give his life then in the message I just argue over whether it was a man or not brother brother said no man ever died like that man said ain't no man could die that way said sure he was a man in body but said they wouldn't no man like that man said he was God in human flesh amen but yet some of you had rather hear and rejoice over what you hear of some of what is said by some of these out there than to listen to the truth I'm not responsible for that I'm responsible right here to try to tell you and let you read see it's what's on the inside of me that's the intelligence that's it brother Brown said you've never seen me he said you see the body I inhabit that's right and you know I can deceive every one of you right but I can't deceive myself and I can make everybody in here think I'm a CH Christian but there's an intelligence intelligence inside of me that's telling me what I am okay if this eye if this hand if this body could body should body stood here just as it is today yet I could my body could be here but me could be gone what I am whatever I am inside of me is going on that's the part part that is the spirit watch the soul is the nature of that spirit cuz come on folks whatever is in the inside of you whether you want to call it Soul or you want to call it spirit that is the motivating factor of you it's working outwardly we try to work inwardly right we want people to quit this and quit that well don't you think you ought to preach to the women get them lined up well what are you trying to say is your wife worthy of the Gospel is that what you're trying to say I've heard preachers you have two preach an hour and a half two hour sermon or trying to line up women I think they ought to line them up I don't make no jokes when I hear a man say something there any problem with me repeating him and the man said I didn't have nothing today said and I went down to Wallmart and I got a sermon well he didn't preach on the price of eggs or clothes or lawnmowers he preached on women and how they looked well what was he looking at you know come on if all you preach on is women you preach on split dresses you know what well she got a little split and going a longer split boy that's way up I wonder what's wrong with people I thought brother brandom said that was my sister am that's right don't you relate me to them slip down dressed women and call them my sisters if they get born again what are they come on but you see then I don't agree with all in splits and things because I'm trying to tell you in the correct way that if you act like that you're lost if you wear them clothes you're want somebody to lust after you if my daughter is split and run out on the world and went out there naked and all running around and she'd have called me and said Daddy there's a boy over here insulting me I'd have went over there and I'd have said Son get on get out of here I'd have protected her as a daddy but I'd have turned around and told her you were the one that caused him to lust after you that's so you caused it that's right come on so you don't want me to preach on clothes and hir and dress cuz I get too plain right I get down where we live at right watch that's that's the part part that is the spirit the soul is the nature of that spirit and when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it does not do nothing oh listen to the rest of it you it changes or converts your spirit to a different soul what it converts converts means you change from one form to another I thought or of misst understanding of the word convert or saved it converts your spirit to a different soul and that soul is a different nature that's on that Spirit right see so the soul is controlling the spirit the spirit controls the body right so the soul is the nature of your spirit well it's just the nature of something no it's the nature of what it is a bird dog is a bird dog you don't expect a bird dog to chase cows he's not trained for that you see somebody that can't control herself they're a got the wrong nature inside of them right come on it's your nature it's the difference let's see first you were mean and evil and hatred hatred and Malice and strife now you're loving sweet kind there's the difference it's your nature I I I'll call it that it's your soul that's been changed I believe in that but I don't believe in exchange I've heard preachers read that and say exchange instead of to change you exchange you take out something put something in the place of it but if you change it he's still working on me it's just something he's doing right look what he said the old soul died you remember the quote before then now it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your soul right the old soul died and the new Soul which is in your nature was born into you that's the life of Christ your brain is not your intelligence right right come on now it's your spirit that's in you is your intelligence so your brain is a bunch of matter and cells and so forth it has no intelligence in itself if it did then as long as it laid there whether you was dead or alive it would still operate see but it's not it's not your brain it's your spirit inside of you and your soul is the nature of that Spirit that's the soul of the spirit that controls the spirit that controls the body seat there you are what is it that new birth comes in and starts working from the inside out right let's get one more go ahead to souls in prison paragraph 42 let's get a couple more and then we'll quit we'll just make this part of the message then we'll continue on that old husband cuz that's what I'm talking about our old husband is our old nature and that old husband has got to be dead that's right not just divorced not just left him well I don't act like that anymore I know I'd like to right brother around said you take a man that's a drunk and he gets converted if that nature don't go away don't pice a bottle under his nose right right Alcoholics Anonymous can car you so far but they can't convert you used to smoke and you still have the desires or thoughts of that now let me explain that one many of you have heard me explain my life over and over I guess cuz that's all I can talk about is myself that ain't the right way to say that but I'm the only one I know about okay not just talking about myself I I never did drink I just didn't want to I've explained to you privately what it looked like to me and I don't like it I used to smoke a little bit oh yeah we were all kids come on kids everybody wants to off on the kids they want the kids to get so converted and make everything so great you know why don't you act like me if you acted like me you know what you'd done you'd have done what I done I had a 56 Chet 55 56 is one we have every little boy had up over the Sun visor a pipe mine never got burned enough to even get to taste CU I didn't care about it but you know what then after I got born again and I never did have a bad mouth to cush I like my teeth in my face you know don't look too good but I wanted it to stay together and I never cussed and stuff like that cuz it was just why I told a man at work one day he's cussing like I said you ain't got nothing he had a college education I said you ain't got nothing with a bird brain he said I'll feed you the Lions one day that's all right well I said you ain't got nothing but a bird bra you can teach a bird how to cuss say something without cussing see it makes you look like you're big every word there's one down there a guy that comes in there the shop he can't say nothing unless he cusses take his cussing out and you would have but three words hi how you doing bye come on folks I just didn't do them things that didn't make me a Christian I just didn't want to do it but yet when I got converted and I i' walk up and somebody would maybe be smoking a cigarette and that old booger says don't that smell good come on I'm honest I don't I don't lie to you see somebody drinking and they we had a hunting camp together and some guys dranked at it and Wade was worried about it I said just tell him to make sure and give me a drct pepper cuz I didn't want my mouth water and over their liquor because it was liquid that was main thing you could have doubt me well water done just as good but get what I'm saying and you know that even I would start to talk and a dirty word would come into my thought that I'd have to stop from saying it he said Brother D after you're born again yes cuz that booger will get on that shoulder he's trying his best to break you if he can do it he's got you but you got to keep saying I wouldn't do it if I could oh I don't mind talking pling I wouldn't drink if I was on a desert island by myself but I'm honest if they wasn't nothing else to drink I ain't going to starve to death I'm not stupid come on on why can't we be honest that's right are you just too honest well okay I'm too honest but at least tell it to you like it is Lord have mercy mercy so let Lord help us all right listen to what he says off of souls in prison paragraph 42 then see after he done made man in his own image created he them male and female M there was no man to tell the soil and he put him in the dust of the earth and therefore became he was that man this human man was mammal see he was animal but he put this spirit of God alive into him and made him on the bases that he could make a choice and then when this man see when he made the choice look what he goes on to say but that Soul that's in their sea that soul is what God is working on he's not working on your body he's not working on your spirit he's working on your soul if he can only get that nature that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies right and the nature of the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is Not In You and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of the world comes in and lives in you and God is the only thing that there is that and no beginning and no ending you see what I'm talking about what is a soul it's what you really are it's what you really are you know and what a wonderful thing to find out what we are amen what was that that made you different right what made you not do the things of the world that other people around you done you mean I had Eternal no I didn't say that now but see God has the ability to work on people why would and I'm not throwing off on Africans anything when I say these things I'm using the terminology of the Prophet why would have taught and taught in Africa that's never heard of God of any way but yet he builds an idol and he believes that that imaginary God comes in that Idol that Idol is not his God it's an imaginary thing that connects him and he believes it and he'll feed his children to that alligator because of his sincerity that's a soul of an individual that's crying out for a God you know what I love I love the word of God you know why this Prophet say it see that's always was a burden to me is what about that hot and tot that Eskimo that person that had never heard of a god what is God going to do with them oh you just throw them all in Hell CU it got to be burned again but I agree to that but what are you going to do with that I love that quote where the Prophet come along he said God will judge them according to the way they lived under their own laws he said you go to Africa and won't find this was the old AG cuz a lot of us started there but he said you won't find one veneral disease he said a girl had to prove that she's a virgin before she can marry he said what would you do in America today in the choirs across the land but they'll be judged according to their own laws and the way they do with that law God will judge them when they never heard about Jesus Christ that is a wonderful God Amen but he said you and I will be held accountable because we didn't take the word to them right a lot of difference in it in let's stand together we're going to take the communion today Terren is one so I took part of his time cuz he'll be very short you and communion will be very short with him because that's he's short and plain and blunt I'm blunt he just short and plain anybody have a before we go into the communion cuz what I've done is got the deacons and things to serve the ministers to serve the deacons to serve because they're supposed to be able to and let them serve you because that's what they're supposed to be has anybody got any needs or anything let's just saying I love you I because he first just come and let's pray and believe before we go into the communion our sisters having a pain in their back or shoulders and trying to take her breath away so let's believe right let's believe that he is and that he heals we don't have to lay hands on our sister when she left that seat and come this way there was a spirit inside of her made a decision that Soul within her is longing to be delivered because it's not happy in a body that's sick am God wants to live in us as healthy beings so he heals us we just lay hands upon own her and believe with her right father in the name of Jesus Christ we raise our hand towards you with a sign that I Love You Lord may we always have that thought in mind and father then transmit that down to our sister that you would come down and take away this pain that's in the body and Lord use the vessel as just a transmitting ability or a thought or a touch or a contact to where that she can say by your stripes I'm Healed and the pain is gone away we condemn this hurting this cutting off the breath and all the thing we condemn it in the name of Jesus Christ and believe in your word that by your strip she's healed thank you Father we love you in Jesus name amen anybody else before we turn the services over he love him I love you want to know about his job and things and connection but that's the secondary part in this mind cuz he wants to know if he's born again amen what a greater thing could be thought about you that are born again remember the day you thought about it and wondered but then a day came that you had a pieace in your mind about it brother Mo used to call it and he had a funny way of saying things he'd say we'll pray with you and said God will give you just that little tug on your heart to let you know that all is well amen well see a tug on the heart can be a many a thing you could shout speak in tongues cry life Rejoice could be many things that could take place through that little contact of the tug of the heart but we just want God to speak right so let's just believe and as I said about sister Freda see when our brother left the office and walked down here there was a lot settled right there something LED you there had to be a spirit to lead you you can't even move your hands without a spirit motivating you or leading you so let's just believe father in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ our brother has asked for the greatest possession that life could ever exist of it's not Material wealth it's not money it's not all of the great things popularities and all that it's a born again experience in our hearts and our lives and we just lay our hands up on our brother believing that Lord you'll contact him right here and that you speak to his heart he's done his part he's repented he's followed you and done Lord the baptism and the things to be done in your name all has been done and he's a Believer Lord now now come and just fill him with your love and let that overflowing power that lick of fire that came on the day of Pentecost just come down into our brother's heart and and light his heart up for you Lord and that's that soul that we're talking about that part of us that being and come in and give eternal life we don't have to understand all the mechanical sides of what does what takes place we just accept it as believ in you we love you father in the name of Jesus Christ amen just go brother and don't you worry about it God bless you he'll come he'll let you know see it may be a while that's no problem what does it matter but he can do it instantly amen the main thing is you made the step Amen brother hallelujah amen let's just pray with our brother okay a lot I can't understand what he says because of my heart here in brother I'm just sorry but God knows every word you said so he knows what you're standing here for and we as Brothers and Sisters in Christ will pray that God will work these things out of what he's asking for and to make all things well because we believe it right father in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you heard the words of our brother and you know what's in his heart you know what's down in that soul that longing Lord for an answer from you so we pray that you would just come on the scene now and give that answer as to whatever it be we believe you yes do and we thank you Father we love you because you first loved us yes you made us to worship and now we just bring back the products of our life and our preaching and Our Gospel back to you Lord as instruments receiving from you as people to desire a longing for you Lord to answer our prayers and to come and satisfy our needs and to be what we have need of whether they be material wealth or whatever the things is it's all covered under you Lord we love you and we thank you in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ we count it so amen anybody else come ahead teren brother and we'll go right to the scripture which is uh 1 Corinthians 12:23 for I received of the Lord which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same matter he also took the cup which he had suck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as I as often as you atat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the L of the Lord but let a man examin himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly and many sleep for we if we would judge ourselves we should judge not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat te one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come he asked us to Terry and remember you got to pray pray for the preacher and
