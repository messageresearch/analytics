key and and and have um just some really good Harmony and we've got some new ones sister Emma did a wonderful job this weekend on that cello man good job and um we want to uh let her feel comfortable and then in different ones feel comfortable with playing instruments and U I know we don't have room for everybody here but we maybe we'll do a run and shift or something I don't know but I want everybody to exercise their gift I don't want to have a gift sitting somewhere and not being used and you not you want to use it and we don't have enough room to use it well we're going to try to do our best to get some room maybe and uh later on but just remember that also the Valentine's banquet will be on the 15th the 15th of February at 3:00 sign up sheets downstairs uh we've got the group coming from Ohio that we'll be keeping them at our house and a few different places and then we will have uh Brother Richard Douglas and his wife coming so they called and said they were they were going to come and be with us so we sure do appreciate that brother Burley Williams will be with us and he'll be speaking for us that Saturday just for a few minutes and then on Sunday he'll be here speaking for us so all M's clear you love the Lord you want to hear the word of God that's what I want to hear I want to hear the word of God I don't want to hear myself speaking I want to hear God speaking to us tonight so we're going to start tonight and we're going to stay in the transition to Perfection part nine but we're going to talk tonight about restored Doctrine restored remember last time we preached we talked about the Mysteries and there was Mysteries that came about that we didn't um I'm not plugged in that's why they don't have it on there it would help if y'all could see what I see sorry about that maybe now if you got your Bibles go and turn to First Corinthians there we go 2 ver9 but we're going to talk about restored Doctrine now listen Doctrine is important true Doctrine is imperative everybody with me everybody's got a Doctrine tonight the Baptist has a Doctrine the Methodist has a Doctrine the Pentecostal has a Doctrine the Oneness has a Doctrine the Tess has a Doctrine this one has everybody's got a Doctrine brother brand said a church without a Doctrine is not a church so the church the doctrine that we have here is we believe in adoption we believe in being more mature in our Christian walk and in our fellowship and then God told us here in Corinthians we'll read it 2 verse 9 he has opened the door for us to know the Deep things of God you just got to be able to get in there yourself and make yourself available to it all right remember I read y'all that quote where brother Brown said it's not just reading verse by verse not just reading the Bible though that's good but a deeper understanding of what's going on is what we need in the end time to change our bodies it's not going to be just normal preaching sure it's going to be preaching the word of God but you've got to react to it and it's got to change you all right the word's going to have to change you you can't change yourself I can't change it the word is going to have to change you all right 1 Corinthians 2 verse 9 let's bow our heads Lord be with us tonight give us strength Lord to speak to you people you do the speaking father and let us all listen to you tonight Lord the things that laid on our heart I pray that you be willing that her sick Lord be with um ana Lord getting close to that baby coming Lord I pray that you'd give her strength strength and Lord just be with them in the time lord and just be with the family Lord and bless each one father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes be with the ones that have to travel on the highways Lord that you'll keep those roads clear for each one father I pray these things in Jesus name amen 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither hath entered into the Heart of Mine the things which God had prepared for them what that love him or that Agape him not FOH him Agape him know who he is know what he's doing know what he's saying and know what the revelation of it is all right everybody with me but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit so without the Holy Spirit you're not going to get the full revelation of God all right cuz Satan I don't believe Satan can give you a revelation you know that amen for the spirit searcheth the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so the holy spirit is out there searching the Deep things of God and if you got the Holy Spirit guess what you'll be searching for the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him like I said before we can all communicate with the world we used to have the spirit of the world amen amen and we acted like the world we didn't act different we acted just like the world acted because if you have a spirit of man you're going to act like that even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God that's why we're all odd that's why we're different that's why people look look at you different or ask you question why don't you do this why don't you do that now we have received now watch not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God you may be seated the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word we talked about in The Book of Matthew we'll just review here just a second Matthew 13:5 this is the soar of the seed now what is the seed the seed is the word of God Amen the so is the son of man all right so some fell upon Stony Stony places where they had not much Earth they had Earth it went into something right amen and forth with they sprang up or sprung up okay so they had life they sprang up but what happened because they had no and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away remember that word deepness means the depth of God and we know it's a parable that the so the the seed should have been stwn deeper into the Earth naturally but that's the same thing spiritually it's the seed of God planted deep in your heart and that's what's going to keep you as the Bible says rooted and grounded in God not coming to church know why you come know why you have that desire to come know why you don't want to like brother brandom and I see he he wor he he he had the same thing to worry with he said y'all sit home and watch I love Susie well put your in you 2025 whatever y'all stay home for and I don't mean y'all I mean people will stay home for anything and brother brandham dealt with it too he said you'll sit home and watch I love he can't he never did say Lucy he always said Susie so U you can tell he didn't watch it but he knew that's what they was doing they were sitting there watching it and not going to church so anyway so they had no deepness of Earth in other words the word was not swn down deep enough to when the Sun s o n began to shine some people are going to walk away when they see the s o n began to shine in the end time because you know what happened when the s o n began to shine 2,000 years ago the people walked away from him and literally killed him amen so they didn't know the depth of God you and I is a requirement that we are not in grammar school anymore now some may be that's okay okay but we can't stay there this is a progressive gospel this is the gospel that brings us as we were talking about transition to Perfection that means there's got to be a move we've got to move we got to be a Church on the Move we got to be individuals on the Move Matthew 17:9 they came down from the mountain Hallelujah and Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scriptures or the scribes say that Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come look and restore all things so we're looking at restored Doctrine now listen Jesus Christ was the doctrine of God he wasn't a Doctrine he wasn't part Doctrine he wasn't right every once in a while he was the attribute of God because he was godl okay so he didn't make a mistake now I wrote myself a note right here he didn't change the doctrine Elijah's not going to come to change the doctrine he's going to come to restore the doctrine that's already there we'll prove that here in just a minute their Doctrine had to be restored under the first part of brother bram's Ministry it had to be restored back to where they believed it in the first place right and then in the seals open which was something nobody had ever seen which is something that you and I just we we know what it is we know when the seals broke that brother brandham said this became a brand new Bible he'd read it probably thousands of times but it became new has it become new to you have you opened a book have you opened the Bible and said man I never seen that before somebody told me something downstairs uh Sunday and I kind of chuckle because how many times have you ever done that yourself you've read the Bible and read the Bible like eight or 10 times somebody quote a scripture and you go I didn't read that or I didn't get that it wasn't your time that's what makes an eternal book it's an unfolding it's a continual unfolding something may not be anything to me Romans 6 verse1 so what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound well I don't sin according to God but I sin according to me everybody with me so we're going to have to start believing what he said because it says right here there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus so brother brandom in this first part of his ministry before he brought the great mystery because remember the Bible tells us in Revelations 10:7 there's only one mystery the mystery of God will be finished not the Mysteries the Mysteries is the ones that we that we listed and we'll get to them in just a second but remember every doctrine of every Church of every denomination comes from the four gospels of the Bible now we know there's a book of Acts but what's the book of Acts doing tell them what Jesus said what's Corinthians doing tell them what Jesus said or even Paul going back in the Old Testament Isaiah said this one said that one said everybody with me so they didn't get it from another book they got it from they didn't even have a Bible at that time scripture was not written until 1500 years ago or put together sure there were Scrolls there was things they read and and you think it's you think it's hard you take somebody like the Apostle Paul now we know Paul was a learnning man he was very very smart and he took those Old Testament Scrolls he took the Torah and the Old Testament say of uh prophets and he wrote 80% of the New Testament from those scriptures that's right that's why he was a prophet he got it straight from God and he interpolated or didn't change it he made it come alive to me he made it come alive he made the Old Testament come alive cuz that's what the New Testament is it's the Old Testament come alive all right cuz in the Old Testament we stay condemned in the New Testament we've been delivered all right everybody with me so he didn't come to change the this Elijah that's coming didn't come to to change any Doctrine he came to restore the doctrine that was already there all right then bring the mystery now we not get to that mystery yet all right cu the seals didn't open till 1963 so all that first church age all the people in the first church age the one where he says here behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers what heart of the children to their fathers what the faith of the fathers is the doctrine that the whole church should be based on you hear me should be based on because the first three Church ages it was based when you went to a church on the corner over there they were preaching the gospel if you'll read back in your history and I read back and I can't remember the book I was reading but it was a historian he was talking about the change oh it's called anatomy of a hybrid brother um um tic gave it to me it's anatomy of a hybrid what how the church got hybridized right because just as now you see all kind of doctrines on every corner before NAA 99% of the churches were from that original church at on the day of Pentecost they were everywhere and they were preaching the correct Doctrine now you had certain ones we know Paul said Grievous wolves and people like sthus and different ones brought their own Doctrine in but in a whole the first three ages you when you went to a church you heard the teachings of Paul you heard the teachings of Peter you heard those teachings you didn't hear false Doctrine but what happened was that Doctrine began as you brother Brown tells us in the U restoration of the brid tree and and spoke the word Original Seed he said the word was eaten down now listen the word's powerful but the word polluted or diluted is not powerful I said the word diluted we make it a none effect what Jesus tell them you've made this word of God of none effect cuz you brought your Traditions what so let's take that word tradition out and put Doctrine in same thing their traditions and tradition is something they did every time they did every day they did every week they did every year right but he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now that's what John the Baptist did and we know the heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so now Isaiah I want you to read this with me Isaiah 28:5 now this is the Old Testament but this is Isaiah in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory now we're going to talk about Doctrine tonight restored Doctrine how it kind of got eroded and how it been has been restored okay is everybody with me and that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of what his people and for a Spirit of judgment to him that sth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate now watch but they also have aired through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophets didn't say the people didn't say the people right the priest and the prophet have aired through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they Heir in Vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there's no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from their breast in other words coming from a baby coming from your baby nourishment up until what being an adult all right listen kids don't understand Doctrine right come on right sure they can tell you about one God they can tell you about different things but they unless they get an experience but they still have that mind now I've seen some kids that were smarter than us so I'm talking about worldly smart but but as far as being in the in the message of the hour sometimes it is hard hard for for young kids even young kids that just started in the message I'm talking about older people to listen and and know what's going on but listen you got to stay there long enough to let God work through all of your I say your and mine issues that's between this ear and this ear okay let him continue because listen we were all born what contrary to God right born in sin shap iniquity spouse for my mother's womb a liar doomed and on our way to hell right putting several scriptures together we know that amen so we are born contrary to God from the beginning so God's got to change as Paul says having a newness of mind having a newness of speech having a newness of thought because this is all contrary to God all this that we were at the beginning because we were all contrary to God listen you didn't God when you was a kid you didn't really know anything about it but you grew up and that's where we have to come to we have to come to a place where we graduate from the elementary school middle school to high school to college so them that are wean from the mil look wean from the milk that means they were drinking milk and now they're wean from it everybody with me and drawn from the breast in other words come away from the Mama's breast come away from from depending on Mama to give you your nourishment everybody with me now watch for precept must be just a little bit upon precept precept must be a sometimes precept no the Bible says precept must be upon must be upon precept right precepts upon precept he says that twice line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people remember Paul tells us that it would be great to speak with tongues and and Paul set that in order that that we could have diversity of tongues and speaking in tongues he said but what' he say give me five words in other words spoken by Revelation give me five words inspired by God that we can all understand he said I'll take that over that any day you say I don't I've never spoke with tongues yeah you have when you you talk about God doing something in your life and it's a revelation and you tell somebody out there about it you're speaking in tongues to them right because they're not understanding what you're talking about but that's okay there's an interpretation there that's yours hallelujah it's an interpretation that's yours personal interpretation remember the Bible even tells us if you stand if you speak in tongues and there's nobody to interpret it it's for you it's for you to have right Hallelujah so when don't get hung up with I've never spoke in tongues you speak in tongues all the time tongues is an unknown language right you speak an unknown language when we go downstairs and we talk about serpent seed or we talk about one God or we talk about water baptism that is speaking in tongues right you are speaking in a heavenly language that man cannot understand you ought to be happy for that that God's give you that to whom he said this is the rest wherein you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was UN to them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little look that they might go and fall backwards be broken snared and taken even though they heard it line upon line precept upon precept they didn't receive it right so it was a stumbling block amen it was they were broken they fell backwards they were snared and taken that's what happened if you'll keep reading the early history of the church and brother R covers it some with the Nan counsel that that the true that prophets went to nah men of God went to NAA to try to get them to understand and he said they got there and they couldn't do it why cuz Satan was taking over and God was allowing that to happen because there had to be a dark ages there had to be a dark time so that you and I could come out of that dark time listen you and I have dark time you and I go through seasons and dark time but remember it's just a season it's just a season right amen don't make it a year just go through a season Brother Anderson would love for winter to be three days long he look like Sasquatch back there a few minutes ago with all that garby had on to keep yourself warm but that's all right I told you know brother you're up there this tall you ought to be a little bit warmer than the rest of us but that we go through a season listen how are we going to really really appreciate spring without this right here you're not going to appreciate spring you're going to appreciate spring when we come in here and go man it's 70° outside and I don't have to bundle up now look at this let's just for a second said who shall make them understand Doctrine shall teach knowledge and understand Doctrine cuz what we're doing is is we're looking at a restored Doctrine right now today today you have been restored back to the faith of the first church age you can get excited about it or you don't have to get excited about it but I'm excited that God has put me in a place where I can that I can walk like Paul I can walk like Peter I can walk like James and John all the different ones and listen we can listen now at the Bible read the Bible understand what the Bible says because of their teaching and that do that Doctrine through the prophet through the Elijah number four has been restored back to the faith of the fathers right but now remember we got to keep going on we can't stay there though right all right so look let's look at what I looked up this word teaching that which is taught are Doctrine so even Jesus they they talk about his teaching and he talks about his teaching he's talking about his Doctrine right concerning something you got to have a specific Doctrine you say well I just believe anything that's not a Doctrine you got to believe the truth or you believe in error listen there's only you only got two ways you got right and wrong now you may be in transition from wrong to right or you even may be in transition from right to wrong we've seen people do that but they never had anything to hold them over here like the scripture says they weren't rooted and grounded they didn't have good teaching they didn't have the depth taught to them so that their Roots now listen how does a root get further down into the ground the Wind Blows the wind blows in big pecan trees in my yard pray that don't ever flip them over but every time I see him do that I think man about 20 feet under that ground that Root's moving and what it's doing is it's loosening the dirt up so that now in septe or in or in March when the growing season starts they can start shooting up again because they've got what they've got root they've got they're grounded and settled so number two look the act of teaching now this is Doctrine instruction in religious Assemblies of the Christians to speak in the way of teaching so in other words you can't just say I've got a Doctrine and not be able to tell it hello come on you the doctrine you have is you you are the doctrine Amen to speak in the way of teaching remember the Bible Paul tells us you got to give a reason of the hope that lies inside of you if you can't explain why God saved you if you can't explain how you're not why you're in this message and the Mysteries that were restored back that they had already right it's in the Bible right then you I don't know where you're at I don't know where you been amen that's right it doesn't hurt my feelings for you to explain what you understand okay doesn't hurt my feelings at all I've had people call and say hey can you come talk to this person I thought man if you can't explain water baptism you got a problem right I'm telling you don't be calling me to explain water baptism to somebody you better be able to do it yourself you better be able to understand and be able to tell that's your Doctrine Hallelujah are we just sitting here like brother Daryl was saying we just come here and we're instead of Standing on the Promises we're just sitting on the premises Hallelujah yeah Hallelujah when you get that interpreted you'll understand it I mean really that's right to speak in the way of teaching in distinction from other modes of speaking in public do you know what's going to change our body our Doctrine that's right yes our Doctrine is what's going to change our body it's going to literally change you from a from a some of us that are old but from a corrupt body to an incorrupt body and it doesn't matter if you're buried in in in the grave that doesn't go away you just take the doctrine from here and that Doctrine is what takes you there but you know what's going to happen that Doctrine is not going to go away that doctrine's going to bring them back here right amen I just believe that 100% they're not sitting over there brother D all the they're not just sitting over there going no they're having a Hallelujah time and they know that they're not in their right to be conditioned they know because of their Doctrine because they've been taught right that they're going to come back here pick up their body and we're going to take a Rapture and a moment in the twinkling of an eye to teach one to impart instruction what did Jesus do when Jesus came on earth look right here Luke 4:3 32 and they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power in other words what he said he lived it and what he said happened now remember remember though there there was a mystery because the son of man had a mystery to him that wasn't revealed when he was here on Earth that was withholding for this day when the son of man be risen again from the dead he's going to tell us how to get our body changed he's going to tell us how to live a life exemplary to God and not this world so they were astonished at his Doctrine what they were astonished at his teaching to teach one to impart listen he was trying to instill if you those of you that are still watching chosen Jesus was a human man and he had frustrations he said they're not getting he told his mom he said they're not getting what I say because of this remember she said well I know you're a human I to change your diaper right but he was so much human but he would he every day he would expound on something and they might have been days he was on vacation it might have been days he didn't feel good hello somebody but when he spoke he spoke with a man of as a man of authority but they weren't getting it because without the Holy Ghost you can't get but just the surface of what Jesus was teaching that's right and he said it in Parables so nobody can understand it but the disciples but they weren't going to understand it until the Holy Ghost come wait from power on high from on high remember being DED from with power from on high then you'll understand these things but what they had to do is they had to pack it into their heart they had to go to church they had to they had to go with him everywhere he went everybody with me the thing taught to explain or expound a thing or to teach one something listen Jesus might have got frustrated ated but he knew his work was not what cuz see remember they kept asking him when's the kingdom coming when you Resto you say you're leaving uh you're you're you said thy kingdom come thy will be done that's what he said to pray told them to pray that right right they thought it was right then because they were carnal right they had carnal interpretation but I'll promise you on the day of Pentecost they didn't have that anymore right they walked out inside and said look our work's not over it just now started the work of Jesus is not over it just got started so Luke 4:32 says they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power John 7:16 Jesus answered them and said my Doctrine is not mine but his that sent me If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God now watch If any man do his will in other words what and if anybody do does the father's will if you're doing the will of the father you'll know the doctrine's right whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own Glory you got to come to see me because I'm the only one that's got the Revelation we've heard heard that before right that's garbage garbage what do you do with garbage you throw it in trash he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own Glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him we as ministers don't seek our own Glory right amen we're telling you about our father amen we're telling you expounding our Doctrine about God not us right brother randam did the same thing he never said sure he said this is my Doctrine sure he said this is my Revelation but that we know he was a prophet and God spoke straight to him I wish God would speak straight to us every once in a while amen well praise the Lord anyhow I'm sorry pray for me but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true now watch and no unrighteousness is in him look how strong that Doctrine is and you know where it comes from listen we know we heard this we heard these great mysteries from brother randam when he spoke them because what happened was and we'll look at in a minute down Through the Ages it got all changed right and listen God winked at their ignorance but there was no power in false Doctrine there is no power in false Doctrine they think now Satan will give them a permitted power cuz remember they speak in tongues they do all these things right right but they can't put the word together that's the whole thing they can't put the word together Satan cannot put this word together he can take a piece over here what he do in the garden he took a piece of the word added a word and killed everybody but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in it did not Moses now watch what's Jesus standing there saying you're not listening to me I am telling you the truth I am telling you about my father and you're not listening because what does he say in verse 19 did not Moses give you now he's pointing to the he's pointing to the Pharisees and Sadducees did not Moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law right why go you about to kill me acts 238 Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's pretty clear for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call every bit of that got diluted every bit of that got erased out it got looked over and if people could do it they would tear that page out of the Bible brother Robert Tatum said that he when he was a Pentecostal said he look he'd get to acts two and he just flip over to acts three or four he didn't want to see that because he couldn't explain it but praise God one day God shined light on it and he didn't do away with it anymore and with many other words did he testify in his saying save yourself from this untour generation then they that gladly now watch they gladly received the word from a holy ghost preacher named Peter because they had power behind it men and Brethren what must me do we were pricked at our heart what whatever you're saying here we need to understand this then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3,000 Souls now watch and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine right they didn't waver from it they understood it and with the Holy Ghost they understood that that was the truth and in Breaking of bread and in prayer oh Fellowship too Romans 6 verse verse1 15 What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid let me read dead again What then shall we sin because see now we're under grace now then we can do whatever we want to do that's kind of what Paul was saying in the Book of Romans he said no you can't do that buddy uhuh God forbid that we take and make it greasy know you not that to whom you yield yourself servant servants to obey his servant you are to him you obey in other words the doctrine you obey you become a servant to that amen everybody with me right listen I I am a servant to acts 238 I am a servant to Malachi 4 and5 I am a servant to Revelations 10:7 but now others can read it don't bother them one bit amen don't bother them none well it does bother them but they just not going to follow it because of their what previous doctrinal teaching what brother rown tell us marriage and divorce he said the reason we're in the sh par in is because of one thing misinterpreted Doctrine amen misinterpreted Doctrine is why we're in the shape we're in well you can take it and not don't even put marriage and divorce in there put everything in there the reason we're in shape or in because of the doctrine that we that we held so true that was so false right amen his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be than that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart watch heart soul you have obeyed from your soul that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness listen Doctrine will either kill you or it'll change your body one of the two amen people are going to go to hell because they hold on to a Doctrine that's false right people are going to go to heaven because the doctrine they hold on that's true so what is Doctrine important uh-huh yes it is very Romans 16:1 17 we're going to walk through the scripture a little bit tonight now I beseech you Brethren watch this now listen we should exercise brotherly kindness to everyone right right but now watch what Paul the prophet messenger said to do to somebody that had a false Doctrine now beseech you Brethren mark them which cause Division and offenses contrary the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them amen and avoid them for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive The Souls of the simple those people in NAA got their soul deceived by the devil through those priest and all the different things everybody with me Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ look till we all come to the unity of the fath so we got to come to that Unity of the Faith by what the doctrine of those five ministers fivefold Ministry amen till we all come to the in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge now what teaching teaching of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children watch tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine amen that's what blue in the Dark Ages is a wind of Doctrine blew over here and they well we'll take this and then then you got somebody like Constantine that said say I can't defeat him with my Army but we're going to take all that and we're going to defeat them now he didn't say that but the devil inside of him was doing the same thing he was a tool in the hands of the devil to get those people to believe that now they're very religious because of him seeing a vision or whatever more but it was totally false all right that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine what by the slight of men by the slot of the men of those five-fold Ministry that we were talking that are false where does false Doctrine come from it doesn't come from the air it comes from somebody teaching you that by the slot of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive so it's not some Fly by Night something the preachers got in a pull pit and they started preaching what happened in NAA that everything got changed to a father son Holy Ghost Doctrine we're going to now baptize in the name of father son Holy Ghost we're going to say there's an eternal hell there's a Purgatory all these different things Mary Mary resurrected with Jesus you know that's what the Catholic believe right that's why they glorified or deif deified Mary and you know what you ask the Catholic they'll die for what they believe CU they've been told it since they were a kid what told it doctrinally told it but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined now look fitly joined together not clay and iron not flesh and wood fitly joined the whole body fitly joined together your body to today is made out of Flesh right all right there's no wood Parts some of you may have operation you got some metal Parts but that's not original and compacted by that which every joint suppli according to the effectual working in the measure what of every part body maketh increase of the body until the edifying of itself and love this I say therefore in testifying the Lord that look you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind H look now watch having the understanding having the doctrine darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart amen Jesus didn't didn't Jesus say give sight to the blind right that's what he come to do he come to do all these things 1 Timothy 1:3 and I besought Thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thy look now watch that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine that's right neither give them heed to fables and endless geneal ologies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do in other words he's sending somebody to go straighten out of Doctrine and tell them you're wrong Welly that'd work in the message wouldn't it 1 Timothy 4:6 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto thou Hast attained you got to get it but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness 1 Timothy 4:16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine now this is Paul speaking and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee amen 1 Timothy 6:3 If any man Teach otherwise and consent not to the wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and Stripes of words whereof cometh Envy Strife railing and evil surmising perverse disputing of men now watch perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds and watch what he said destitute of the truth amen suppose that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself second Timothy 3:16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished and to all good works Doctrine is important true Doctrine is the only way you're going to get out of here that's why God winked at the ignorance down through the church ages but when we come to this age right here this is the age that ends everything this is the age that Gentiles will be finished up and God will go to the Jews so there had to come a restoration even back to where God can deal with the people like he dealt with them in the in the first church age second Church age Third Church age amen and brother R stood and prooved he said the proof of the Resurrection you got the healing campaigns you got the the the um Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart just what Jesus did when he walked on the face of the Earth and and I just want to say this those people that thought he was God if you walked with him every day you might say it too I'm about brother brandom amen because of all the miraculous things and all the spiritual things that he he just worked in a world that was completely totally different from anything we we try to be we try to be spiritual and we ain't even close man will walk up to you and say hey if you want to find those deer go that way there'll be seven of them over there on that hill just pick the one you want and shoot it don't go over here your car keys are over there we'll get that for you everything will be fine don't you worry and it all came true it all came true you would have thought Jesus Christ was back on Earth again but we know it wasn't we know that's false but see that's how close that Satan can get even doctrinally get to where you look with your natural eyes and you see somebody that act so much like God they think they're God but listen there's one quality that you and I don't have that Jesus had one we were all born by sex he was not period every person since Adam Eve Cain Abel they were well not Adam and Eve but Cain and Abel the product of were born by sex he was not if you can if you can claim you're not then we'll we'll talk about it but I doubt that very seriously preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke reprove rebuke exhort with all what longsuffering and Doctrine what reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine they will not endure the truth but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables the Bible talks about fables sever time several times it's all connected to Doctrine listen if it's not truth it's a fable Titus 1 ver9 holding fast the faithful word as he ha been taught that he may be able by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision talking about the Gentiles I mean the Jews right right who so mouth Must Be Stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy luker's sake amen pretty tough old Paul Hebrews 6 verse1 now watch this has come to the end right here Paul gives us all that we read in Romans we read in Timothy we read in Corinthians he's talking about Doctrine exhort talk to them this this this this so Hebrews 6 verse1 he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ I'll explain that in just a second because you go to the Greek and you'll see exactly why he said it the way he said it let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God he's not saying that we must do away with those principles everybody with me we can't do away with the doctrine of baptism we may have a baptism not too far in the future laying on of hands we still believe in that can't take it out of the Bible and of resurrection of the Dead absolutely and of Eternal judgment and this we will do will we do if God permit now that word leaving now watch leaving now if we come to this church and we leave and go home does that do away with the church church is still here so that word leaving according to the strong concordance in order to go to another place so he's saying leaving not leaving and doing away but leaving this building the building's still going to be here and go on to perfection yes to leave so that what is left May remain leave remaining not doing away with the word principles that by which anything begins to be the origin are look the active cause so the active cause of us standing here today the only reason we're going to understand the seals and we're going to understand what brother Brown talks about the the three PS and and the Thunders and all these great Mysteries is because we have left the principles but we have went through the principles we've went through the principles of the doctrine of Christ we have not done away with them but we have come this building just for say this building is partial this building got a sleepy Spirit on it bless y'all's heart this building is partial just say now with that building over there is perfect you got to go go through this first you got to go through first grade second grade third grade fourth grade fifth grade right then you go into another building so you're leaving grammar school but you're not doing away with grammar school everybody with me so that he's not saying leave like leave it we don't need to teach no they still there's still people coming in there's still new people that need to learn that need to go what you went through what you went through and have patience long suffering I read you the scripture a minute ago longsuffering with people right all right so therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ let's go into Perfection listen if we just preach on what if we preach on water baptism today and then Sunday we preached on water baptism and then Wednesday brother Bob gets up and he takes his scripture acts 238 it it'd be a little it wouldn't be it would be exciting for some but others would say give me some more there's more to that because remember the Bible says there's a promise the promise is to you what promise tell me about the promise the promise is God's going to take you to this doctrine of the message of the hour and he's going to change your body amen second John 1 ver9 who so transgresses and watch who so transgresseth and not abides not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God this is John second John he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he has both the father and the son cuz we understand what we understand they're the same we understand there's an IMM morphing from father to son amen but not doing away with the father we understand that right the trinitarian says look there's a father there's a Son and the Holy Ghost must be somewhere false Doctrine versus truth y now watch if there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine receive him not into your house this is John John the Revelator receive him not into your house neither bid him God speed I'm reading the Bible y'all don't CL don't clam up on me I'm reading the Bible this is the Bible it's not my opinion amen neither bid him God speed for he that bth him bth him God speed is partakers of his evil Deeds I can say that again partakers of his evil Deeds let me read that one more time for he that bth him God's speed is partaker of his evil Deeds acts 20: 27 Paul's saying but for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God in other words all the doctrine of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he ha purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing now this is right before he dies after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock now look you would think if you stopped right there you think well now Paul will be will be aware cuz cuz somebody's going to come in and try to bring a false Doctrine somebody's going to come in the door somebody going verse 30 takes care all that also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them amen also of your own self in other words he's speaking to a congregation maybe he's having a a Minister's meeting yeah let's make it a little more personal maybe he's having a Minister's meeting he said oh be care beware them Grievous wi I'm sure they're all going yeah we need we're good we're good here Paul we're good we're good he said also of yourself shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them now that's what happened in the message this great glorious message that all the all the doctrines have been restored and everything has been wide open amen yet that's happened already many many times couple of quotes and then we'll be done he must be born again 1961 now God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning of Jesus's first Doctrine the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine now listen he's preaching in 1961 sure he's in Jeffersonville but there's Methodist that says sprankling gets me in the body right there's Baptist that says shaking of hands and and a letter and good standing I told sister Rebecca Calhoun Sunday I said you know I said you're just one of us your letter still here but we we laugh but I'll promise you they hold on that letter amen and if they get mad at this one and go to the other place they demand their letter right cuz their Holy Ghost is going with them remember we had that who was it was it Judy Judy's sister somebody was sitting in front of us remember she turned around she said fact guy Don't Preach what in other words Don't Preach what I like I'm moving my letter like you know like the whole place is going to collapse because she's going to take her letter she said that she turn she I don't like his he keeps on what he's doing I'm just going to take my letter and go somewhere else like Daddy said that brother that son and and father and son got mad at General Motors and said Come On Son let's go home I'm tired like the whole place is going to collapse yeah it ain't going to collap no sir your letter the Letter's not going to do you any good so look the first Doctrine Jesus preached was you must be born again now how many different ways of being born again has there developed that was his very first Doctrine he told Nicodemus not you must believe the message not you must speak in tongues as the Pentecostal say to get the Holy Ghost false Doctrine out of a truth right Baptist like I said Shake hand y'all may think it's strange but we have a lot of Baptist friends and if you ever make that decision and they shake your hand and turn you around and feel like that little letter I was talking about you don't have to darken the the doors of the church again they believe in eternal security that once saved always saved you can go out and live with 25 women Smoke Drink cuss and run around and die 50 years later and they'll put you in the ground as a good Baptist now that is their Doctrine and it's absolutely false there's people going to their grave that's going to say oops I said the worst oops moment moment is when those terrorists and they're supposed to get 72 birdg and they're supposed to have all I don't why it's 72 they get 72 virgins and they're going to have all this eternal Bliss when they blow when they pull that trigger and their body comes completely apart and their soul goes over another dimension that's the first thing going say is a whoops what but the doctrine is what made him pull that trigger false Doctrine is what M oh well true to him true listen will you give your life will you pull the trigger for your gospel I ain't talking about literally pulling I'm talking about if God didn't he's not going to do it but listen there was a man one time he told God he said thank you for all the things you've done he said the first thing comes through that door I'm going to sacrifice it right what was the first thing come through that door his daughter and listen even his daughter didn't pitch a fit she said give me a month or two to go and whail my my virginity in other words she was a young lady and then we come back some of us wouldve been screaming and going to a different country we we'd be under the um what Witness Protection Program 1962 restoration of the brid tree where did that first Doctrine come from outside of the Bible you historians know where it came from now look where did that first Doctrine come from outside of the Bible you historians you know where it comes from from Rome exactly where it started there they started accepting Dogma that's how irenius St Martin polycarp all of them after John's death for translating the word of God was on the aisle of patmas they burned him in Greece for 24 hours brought him back and he still wrote the Bible God was determined that this Bible would be written that's the word of God we can't take away from it or add to it it's to lay just the way it is the word now look notice when they got back when these saints of God trying to hold up that word now watch Rome came right in and accepted Dogma instead now let's just see what she did some of her false Doctrine what you done water baptism where they were commissioned Peter said on the day of Pentecost under the influence of the Holy Ghost the word of God repent every one of you baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for your remission of your sins what did Rome do with it turned it around and said be baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost making it a Creed not a doctrine of the Bible right what did he do that's that cankerworm eating sprinkling instead of immersion he's talking about the Methodist all right so you see where brother Ram had he stood from 47 to 63 we know there was a healing campaign going on but he was as as John not John as of the second first Elijah Elijah had to restore the altar back because what happened on that day those 400 prophets of Baal brought a false Doctrine and their false Doctrine produced zero right nothing they just broke the whole altar apart they broke the church apart that's what happened and the day of nah they broke the church apart right they broke the doctrine of God apart so God had to start right there with a restoration Prophet Elijah in the end time to restore these doctrines one God not a trinity amen water baptism we know for a fact why water baptism had to be the way it is we know we're doing exactly what the Bible said but 99% of the world will almost fight you over that doctrin and The Trinity they got Trinity everything right and it ain't nowhere in the Bible it's say it is a coed up lie then brother bandam say the spirit that brought that water B that brought water baptism name Father Son and Holy Ghost come from the pits of Hell amen they even believe in Eternal oh don't worry about it you talk to the Baptist about eternal hell they will fight you about that one oh yeah hell's eternal hell's Eternal right so the Catholics what they did they just inserted a place to where you can go into a spot there called purgatory and if you got enough money you can pay and get yourself into heaven cuz you're going to hell right and what happened with Holiness conduct and dress brother random stood there and he just kept preaching it preaching it preaching it bringing out the Jezebel spirit bringing about all these different things telling us how to dress but remember he did that for 40 years almost and there in in streetport on the the when he preached invisible union he said I come here and every year you Pentecostals you cut your hair more short you wear in other words he wasn't doing any good they were believing the doctrine that was false rather than the doctrine that was true cuz I believe the doctrine that William man Brandon brought was truth am truth of Church order we know Paul give us Church order in the Bible we that's where brother Brandon when he do when he comes up and says all right we're going to talk about church order today ordination of deacons how this trustee Works how the deacons are supposed to work and how this is supposed to work and how this is supposed to work well he was just reading it straight from Paul right it really didn't need an interpretation but they had got so much away from it till they made the word of God of none effect serpent seed talk to somebody about serpent seed the people in the first church age knew about that they didn't have a false Doctrine remember now body change for Abraham and Sarah that had to be something in the end time cuz nobody else preached that before but you could look inside the Bible and without changing the Bible you know that's what happened we read between the lines Paul preached on Body Spirit and soul I believe Paul understood because he said I pray that your whole body spirit and soul be held blameless in other words under the word of God I don't believe I believe they didn't they didn't they didn't believe in a tribulation for the bride no no why Throne judgment for the bride John even said he said Thrones there were people there that were on the righteous side so there were people that didn't have to stand judgment they were righteous in other words without spot without wrinkle righteousness righteous people Paul says speaking the truth in righteousness let us grow up the church ages now I understand one thing that Paul irenius Martin Columba and different ones they didn't come on this Earth and say I am Church AG messenger number one I am Church age messenger number two no they come in and they live their life and they preach the gospel they fell under the anointing of that book of Revelations 1 through3 everybody understand what I'm saying and they lived their life but it took a profit in the end time to reveal who those Messengers were cuz brother R even said he said now polycarp you would think he'd be the one but he wasn't militant enough in other words he was a compromiser he leaned a little fit toward organization so God didn't accept him statue of perfect man we know it was we know the statue of perfect man was preached in the early church ages Peter's the one that did it right amen when he wrote them letters when Peter wrote those letters he was preaching to somebody and what a man to do that a naked fisherman that cussed anybody else want to add something else he cut off somebody's ear he had a temper about every one of them right there he wasn't right right but God picked him not us not what you thought about it or your neighbor thought about it it's what God thought about him and said Peter you a you're a changed man you're the only one that can tell them how to have these virtues amen the 70 weeks of Daniel we know we're going to study them in a little while but that wasn't in the first church age they knew Daniel they knew all the things that was going on um they had an understanding but now we compile all this to today all right musicians come on we're going to compile this all to today today we set under the understanding of the great Apostle Paul right believe his Doctrine which is the doctrine of God everybody with me the doctrine of Peter we preach it we teach it right amen but you and I got to have plus because they're dead they had to go to a grave because of the word that told them they had to go to the Grave remember if that seed didn't fall on the ground that scripture couldn't be full filed so the seed fell in the ground at n brother Brown said and then have the resurrection or had or come back up through the reformers which reformers only reform people you and I are under a restoration which changes us and it will change us at a moment in twinkling of an eye we've got to have the true doctrine of God I believe we have it I believe we are standing let's stand to our feet that we are standing in the time that all these Mysteries are made known and then going on to Perfection not doing away with these but using these as a foundation because when the seals open none of this changed except except brother Ram had a deeper understanding of all those doctrines remember he preached why I against organized religion 1959 then he comes up on the first seal he says now I know he said I always knew I there was something about those denominations he said I know why now first or second third fourth seal by the time that fourth seal come he knew where Satan was he had an idea but he knew where Satan was he knew those four horse riders were the devil not God not the Holy Ghost but the the Devil Himself disguised as a writer r i d e r writer and and a writer w r are so brother brandham listened to him not too long ago he said thank God for the opening of these seals now he had preached 47 to 63 and seemed like he' preached everything where it was supposed to be but then he comes up and preaches a message and says thank God for the open of the seal is my prayer he said it many many times thank God that the seals are open why because it settled a lot of things in his in his even in his ministry it settled he knew listen the greatest thing he knew was brother John he knew God was breaking those seals cuz he couldn't do it he preached the seals a long time ago he preached Church ages a long time ago he preached him in one night he preached at the white horse rider was a mighty conqueror 1957 or 59 he preached a mighty conqueror and rest Revelation 6 verse1 but he understood right then I believe that that was it there was no more there was no more that was already settled all these great doctrines was settled but there was something new coming that book was going to be open and thank God I say for the opening of the book Thank God for the opening of the book in the end end time so that we can delve in dive in and you know what we can dive in with confidence I have confidence this message is right I have confidence that God has a people that will live this message that is right on the Earth today there's a group of people that will live this message out to the very end not go down not going in defeat we're going out of here so there's your restored Doctrine he had to restore that Doctrine he had to restore us back to the faith of the fathers so that we could understand and then use that for a platform to when he opened the seals it didn't he didn't say I see a different book he said that book I'm looking at is a brand new book he didn't say he got another one what was in this one was finally open and he could see what the Love Letter 100% meant because the son of man was 100% correct and if that Ministry is supposed to be back here somebody's going to be 100% correct do you believe that let's sing a song God bless
