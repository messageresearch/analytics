========================================

everybody doing okay today we are before we get started does anybody else have any questions concerning the first seal I know we did a little bit last week kind of got off the subject a little bit but never off the subject to answer a question never off the subject to answer a question so anybody have any other questions on the first seal we got all the symbols down you should have uh if not you can go back to the website and brother Tim got a picture of the board so it should be on the website so if you have a question I do can you tie in the lion into that a little bit more the lion brother R said the lion was bold and that's what happened in the first three ages they had the faith of the fathers they had the word of God working in their life remember the lion ox man an eagle if you go back into Ezekiel Ezekiel 1 and in there you see those four combat Beast brother Brown said that was the combat Beast which was the Holy Ghost okay that's the Holy Ghost working in The Believer if you go back into Ezekiel you'll find that that these uh that these people are looking at this these four Beast are ezekiel's looking at the four beast and seeing a lion the face of a lion face of an ox face of a man face of an eagle and they all face forward and you say well that can't happen if they're in a square but that you got to think spiritual spiritual thing would tell me is that that is the Holy Ghost in The Believer if Sister Trudy has the Holy Ghost no it's not if but it is for me cuz I don't know whether she does or not but her fruits will show it MC millon that's what I'm talking to it's try now if if she is in a situation where she needs to be bold then that lion Spirit l i o n not lying lion Spirit would come and not so much as Helper because it's the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost has characteristics everybody understand that the Holy Ghost has characteristics holy Christ the lamb see that's why I wrote that on the board Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost selfs sameed Spirit only one God with many many manifestations but when the Holy Ghost comes brother R said those four combat beasts were here to help you and I overcome first three ages needed the lion Spirit to overcome and to do what to set a standard a basis for everybody to come to and then we're going to see that the ox was Labor we're going to see that that was a different characteristic of the Holy Ghost the man with a different characteristic of the Holy Ghost and then the eagle of course we know more about that because we're in in the eagle age because what a lion is this High correct a lion can only see as far as the grass is tall Ox is a little bit taller he can see a little bit over the grass because he's down where he can eat the grass all right A man is upright he can see a little bit further because we're standing taller than the ox and the lion but now what about the eagle see we have limited eyesight as man but now eagle goes up higher and he can see Way Beyond right so in that first church they had that lion Spirit which was right here this is the faith of the fathers right here they had all these virtues working in their life Peter says what Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have right here virtue that man that walked Drew virtue from Peter all right that was the lion l i o n Spirit the boldness of a lion The Roaring of a lion they had the word of God remember we said they had the word to God until 606 ad when n come into being and then we're going to see that that's what started this four Church Age first three ages 1 2 and three Paul irenius and Martin read the commentary in the in the church A's book about those three men they all had the Holy Ghost working in their life they all were very bold hey Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel well see when we stand in the pull pit today and say you'll be judged by my gospel that's the same lion Spirit lion spirit that we need in this end time brother BR said we need all four to get out of here cuz see they needed the lion Spirit to get through the first three ages bold something that the book of Acts the book of Acts they were bold right remember when the Holy Ghost come they went out and started telling the people this is that all right then the O Spirit brother Brandon said the O Spirit was just so they could make make it through the age the ox is what very slow but that joker can pull a load an ox may be slow a horse is faster but Ox is slow and that Ox can you just call her an ox pull that's I'm going can pull that's it but the ox is slow but see there's a characteristic and that's the characteristic you and I need we need the lion Spirit to be bold they were bold but they had to die so they didn't need the O Spirit to continue on everybody understand what I'm saying okay everybody understand shake your head if you do if you don't that o sacrificial that o is sacrificial we're going to read it well maybe we need to stop stop and do this okay lion Spirit you want to see the characteristic brother Bown said that was Matthew Mark Luke and John right the four gospels was the four lion watch how many of you have a scfi Bible turn to Matthew we need to go this way thank s qu that's okay we'll go this way I really don't mind a bet like I said questions unanswered or not should not be we should all be answered now go to Matthew to the very first commentary part of make sure that not so go to the commentary where it says the gospel of Matthew the very first where it says The Gospel According to St Matthew I want you to look scoffield was not a prophet and scoffield was not right in everything that he done but scoffield brought words like theophany and logos and all these things that's where brother Brown got this from because he said now some of the things that U um scoffield had he said because he was a trinitarian he said here you see the Trinity lay through the B well that's a that's one of those cherry seeds that you spit out but now he had a lot of things that I believe the Holy Ghost move moved brother Rand said in the first three Ages was a lion spirit that was a bold now what is a lion he's the king King Jesus all right King Lion is King now what I don't think that that scoffield knew what he was writing but God knew what he was writing through scoffield and watch his commentary on all four we're going to cover all four today that way we will and I told you I think in the first we cover the four combat beast but let's I guess we better cover them now that way we'll know when we go to the Ops what we're doing the man and the Eagle St Matthew the writer of the First Gospel is all degree was Matthew called Levi I want you to look the theme the scope and purpose of the book are indicated in the first verse Matthew is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ son of David Son of Abraham this connects him at once with two of the most important the Old Testament Covenant the davidic Covenant of what kingship watch how many times Scofield says King now we're talking about the lion the LI the boldness of a lion and watch Matthew every one of these Matthew's gospel Mark's gospel Luke and John are all there's your four Spirits sent to the church Matthew was what lying he proclaims a lot of things that Mark does it watch Mark's writing Mark's writing is laborous Ox burden Bearer now Luke was a what Luke was a physician he was smart he had intelligent man remember and brother Brown said John was a what a prophetic book a lot of things that are in the Book of John that are not even in the other three gospels most of the other three gospels parallel each other but John is more of a prophetic what Eagle well watch this of Jesus Christ in that two-fold character then Matthew writes following the order indicated in the first verse he writes first of the what the king king being born king king of the Jews son of David then the son of Abraham obedient to death but the prominent character of Christ in Matthew is that of the Covenant King Lion David's righteous branch all right now turn over to L Mark now Mark was what the ox correct Mark with the op now Mark is the op so watch this the date of Mark was obviously Place between 8057 and 63 the theme here's the theme now this is Scofield writing the commentary of of Mark the scope and purpose of the book are evident from its contents in it Jesus is seen as the mighty what's an ox worker what's an ox worker a worker that's the ox Spirit the worker labor remember labor what's a worker called a laborer all right rather than as the unique teacher it is the gospel of Jehovah's servant the branch as Matthew is the gospel of the branch unto David everywhere the servant servant you watch how many times it says servant cuz what is an ox you get on that ox and write it he's your servant I mean he you he serves you everywhere the servant character of the Incarnate son is Manifest keep reading the characteristic word is straightway a servant word there is no genealogy for who gives the genealogy of a servant the distinctive character of Christ in mark is set forth in Philippians 26-8 you can read that but this lowly servant what Ox laborer burden Bearer which is who Jesus Christ he come out with the boldness of a Lon behold the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent in Matthew Mark he's a laborer but this lowly servant who emptied himself of the form of God and was found in fashion as a man was nevertheless the Mighty God as Mark distinctively declares and therefore Mighty Works accompanied and authenticated his ministry now listen to this as befits a servant gospel there's your op Mark is characteristically a gospel of Deeds Works rather than a word right there's your ODS now let's go over to Luke Luke was a what a physician very smart man look at how close that the holy spirit is using U Scofield that's why I like Scofield writing it's a good study Bible Luke is what man are intelligence right are what man is a what a human correct all right let's read the theme Luke is the gospel of what the human Divine one one as John is the Divine human one there's your prophetic John is writing about the Divine human one Luke is writing about the human Divine One the key phrase is son of man man in harmony with its dis inent Luke relates those things concerning in Jesus which demonstrate entirely how entirely human he was he runs his GE genealogy to Adam and the most detailed account is given of his mother and of his infancy and Boyhood why that man Spirit was writing and showing how that man was born but it was a human Divine one all right everybody got that pretty close huh now let's go to John what is Eagle prophetic or what Revelation watch what John see John didn't say in the beginning a baby was born as all the other ones started out giv genealogy what's the first thing John said in the beginning was the word Word was God the word was with God and the Word was God and verse 14 and the word was made flesh not the human Divine one now the Divine human one all right look the theme this is indicated both in the Pro prologue and in the last verse of the Gospel proper and is the Incarnation of the Eternal Word how prophetic can that be but listen and Son of God himself God in Jesus the Christ to reveal God in the terms of a human life revealed prophetic Eagle the Eternal this book is in seven natural divisions the Eternal Word incarnate in Jesus the Christ and then the witness of John but if you'll read there's a lot of things in John that it's not in the other three gospels um I can't remember all of them I used to I used to could name them but there's a lot of things in there that you won't find in Matthew Mark and Luke why John was prophetic he went up a little higher could see things a little further Matthew was down here telling you about a Divine King that come on the earth the lion so that's what the people in the first age was doing they were bringing that lion Spirit lion Spirit out of those four combat beasts that's why brother brandham said if you watch a fourth seal brother brand said the combat beast when he got to the fifth seal he knew the Rapture already took place because where are those four combat beat they're in the bride all four is in you and I they needed one two and three age they needed the lion being bold come out see the the the Holy Ghost was new to them there was nobody had the Holy Ghost to the book of Acts it was a new thing but they come out so bold Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you then you had the ox age which is the fourth age which what happened 68 million Protestants were killed by the Catholic church that really literally brother R said physically it killed the people and spiritually that kill the people all right what by Blood that's why that red hor that's why that horse was red brother R said he rode right through the blood of the Saints but in the O age read in the church age book that's why my brother R said we had to get the Daniel 70 weeks out of the way to put in the dates and the times and all that then you had to do the church ages to show that the church Ages was not just a happening in the earth it was something that God was doing in his people all right then he brought the seal that place the Daniel 70 weeks the church ages and the seal go back to the church age book read the first three ages there's your lion the fourth age was the ox age brother Rand said they gave their life willingly remember a lot of the stories read Fox's book of Martyrs quit reading all these other true story magazines like brother R said and all these other junk that we read we read I've read Fox's book of Martyrs they were taking certain people to be killed and and the people would the lions were so were not hungry enough so they aged them on they agged them on to get them to kill them that was the spirit of the age they gave their life literally for the gospel they believe and then a lot of the Roman centurions that took them in there and watched this threw their swords down and run in there with them and died as Martyrs because they saw a life but see that's the life they had the ox life worker laborer if you kill 68 million people in just one Church age that's about that's the longest Church age though it's about 1500 years dur in the Dark Ages when Rome ruled everything and they killed 68 million people and brother Ram said Untold billions they killed spiritually but the 68 million were as brother Mark was saying last week they were Christians they were the bride that was the Bride of that age um look at people like um polycarp they tore an out house down to burn him at the Stak and when they tried to burn him the Flames blew away from his body and he had to physically as far as I see it they physically had to push the Flames up closer and he finally said in other words you know I'm ready to go and the Flames took him and they said a white dove lifted up out of the out of the fire see that was God working in those people course poot was kind of the at the end coming close to the Dark Ages but remember all the ages left over it doesn't stop in one year no there's 2 3 4 5 10 years look at the Pentecostal age and this time Pentecostal age left over so you got all lap over ages but does everybody understand the lion Spirit of the first age that first seal was what bold white righteous Church went riding out but a real white righteous Church went riding out false one and a real one see brother Bown doesn't really cover that but you got to remember several things that he said he said Satan was a copycat so Satan never goes first doing something and the Christian realm Satan never goes first cuz he can't have anything to copy God has to go first the holy ghost in a group of people goes first then that white righteous devil comes riding in behind him so brother R didn't really cover that but remember this that as those four horse riders go riding out in those first four seals remember one thing for sure God has already got a white righteous Church on the Saint he's already got a group that he's sanctifying through the blood right he's already got a church that is the black horse is death well that's spiritual death you got to die to yourself if your old man still alive you're not dead yet right right and then the last age is or the last horse is all the colors mixed together well the fourth stage of your new birth is is brother Brown said this justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word being what made alive in your heart all right yall know understood what I talked to you before remember you got justification Sanic Bol the body just sanation Bap Holy Ghost the F all this in it's got to be the four stages remember the four stages how many bugs were they in U in Joel four four bugs eat it down pommer worm caterpillar Locust canker worm I don't even like that word but those four eat it down then four has to bring it back brother R said four is not a good number but it is a good number in restoration because you have to use it you have to have justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost sure that gets you in the body but you got to have the word to make all that come together and make it alive sure you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and cut the word off and and do like the preacher did drinking the beer you know but God's going to take you off the scene that's why you see a lot of people dying they don't take all the word of God onto the change of the body but see nobody had to do that until I didn't want to say that because we we need to stay off of the change of the body because none of these ages took a change right all right none that's what make I want this to be so important that nobody took a change so the lion spirit is not going to make you change your body cuz it didn't them the ox is not going to make you come to a change of a body the man intelligence I'm not talking about the knowledge of man I'm talking about Holy Ghost knowledge okay I'm coming back and then the eagle prophetic which all were in the eagle age but if you'll read brother Rand brother R said it takes all four in this age he said the ox age Daddy's quoted it many times he said the O Spirit we need just to get up and go to work and overcome in this age that's that same o spirit that those people sacrificed theirself literally sacrificed theel see that was a literal part but there's a spiritual part say that we have to overcome we don't have to overcome somebody persecuting us every day right sure we get persecuted enough every day you sisters do with your hair and your dress and we do with our conduct that's that's that don't make us better but our conduct is better you don't see us with tattoos and earrings and you know and I hope we're guys I hope we're finished we wearing short wearing shorts and stuff like that but that's what's going to take to get us out of here right that's what's going to take to get us out of here all four of those Beast what White Horse red horse black horse all those three mixed together makes a Pale Horse justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost all together makes you the word of God got to have all three you can't have one or two because it makes the color different that's right in the end okay but this age coming up is going to be the ox age so keep that in your mind look take peace and kill blood there's a lot of death going on here but this was natural killing this was natural blood but to remember in the first age justification we're going to cover back we're going to go back and cover this later on but first age I mean I'm sorry the first seal excuse me covers justification I hope you saw that I didn't say anything about it but that man to be white righteous you've got to be justified remember what Keith was preaching and daddy's been preaching you know those who he's Justified he's already glorified if you're truly Justified you are a white righteous person right all right so there's your first seal second seal is what blood how do you get Sanctified Bible says through the blood of Jesus Christ which is color is so there's a spiritual meaning to all this we're doing the natural part but there's a spiritual meaning that you got to get in your life you listen I'm telling you people this is the age though where we don't just see that we're Justified and our past sins are off and we live good Christian Life I hope we're not I hope we're past that point but to know that if he's already Justified you if you've read the rising of the sun he's brother bandam even speaks of quickening your mortal body your mortal body is quickened by this word to do what not reach for the beer anymore you say Well everybody's thinking way up here think down here right so simple this same hand that used to give them the one finger signal mhm you know they don't do that anymore what did God do he transformed me he took the same this is the same 16 elements the same body that's right I got the same finger still let's just be literal here I still got the same finger and I could do it if I wanted to but I don't want to anymore that's right the one that reached into that went to the convenience store and said yeah give me a six pack of beer and sit it down and no have no problem with doing it and I know most you did too right or the liquor cabinet or the or the cigarette you didn't have no problem going and say give me a pack of bro but do you do it now I hope not if you do you're not born again just just period you're not born again if you still do that because what happened this same guy that walks in the convenience store now I look at the beer and go God thank you yes look at the cigarettes and the and the skull and all the things that I used to do thank you God well I look guys it's the same me that's right right but I've been quickened this human mortal body has been quickened by something that's inside of me sisters you walk up and you sit down at the thing and and you say well I'm going to go get my haircut today let me get a little stronger I'm going to go get my nails done today I'm going to go get and put a little bit of this on and a little that on cuz they got some age spots coming Jim didn't have any problem getting her haircut when she got her haircut she just went and sat and said okay today I'm getting an appointment I'm going to haircut right but you know what that's not even a part of her life anymore shouldn't be a part of your life there should not be a question well should I shouldn't I see everybody thinks the seals and all and it is a great revelation of God but what it does it brings you back down to the Earth and shows you what God's done in your life yes not that I can point my finger and say Tim I can change you or I'm going to zap you out of no that's not that's right we'll use that when we need it Elijah didn't go around zapping people but when he needed it he called fire down from heaven to to take those preest out right there come a time when there was a showdown right but now they didn't Peter Paul James and John they just walked about I believe they just did their normal duty but when the word quickened them when Peter and and and John walked by that gate beautiful they probably walk by there every day probably saw the same man but one day something stuck in their heart and something contact they said Silver and Gold Have i n but what I have see they had to have it first right what I have I give to you now that was the same Peter now Peter was a fisherman right right crude fisherman Fisherman's always been crude Pirates fishermen all that they've all had crude language walk around you know with earrings I'm sure Peter was pretty Brash before Jesus met him but what did he do he was in that 3 and 1/2 years Jesus was transforming that man that's right and only until the Holy Ghost fell on him only until then was he a bold person using the word of God like it should have been used or using his body that's why the Bible says we make our give our body as a sacrifice holy and acceptable without blame first seal justification white righteous person second seal sanctification God is sanctifying you I Die daily I do I still got things I got to get out of my life Peter still had things he had to get out of his life right everybody did but see we come up in the last age and we got to have all four which is justification sanctification then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say what's that got to do with death that's when the old you is dead if they're still part of you alive you can't receive the Holy Ghost that's right because remember what is it called it's not called a a half birth right it's called a what you don't ever have you don't have a half birth you have a new birth that means your old birth is what dead when you get something new the other part's Dead all right that's why they called a new birth Jesus said you must be born again the old you must die there's your black horse all right and in the pale horses all that mixed together and then what did Brother R say after that fourth Church AE or that fourth steal I'm sorry the Rapture takes place why cuz all the combat Beast are gone fifth seal you don't see a combat Beast Sixth Seal you don't see a combat Beast seventh seal you don't see a combat Beast why he said cuz the Rapture take place on the four seal that makes people go completely cuckoo cuz you go 1 2 3 4 and the Rapture take place so we don't have nothing to do with 56 and 7 no 56 and 7 is what causes the Rapture to take place we'll get into that we'll get into that don't worry I mean I noticed with the Pale Horse you've got black and you've got red which are two dark colors and if you mix the two of those together there's got to be a lot of white yep there's a lot of rightousness self-righteousness in that church today for to be a pale cuz you got to have that that and pale brother R said it wasn't really a gray he said it was a putrid color would you take white black and red mix it together like sister T said keep putting a little more white into it it's a putrid pukey looking color it's not even U it's not even gray we did it one time somewhere and it was it better look good but if you're on the other end of the deal and you've got the justification right the sanctification right the baptism the Holy Ghost right then all that mixed together is a beautiful picture that's what God wanted a flower garden and not just colors we we we we harp on colors black and white and yellow people what about character what about the character God don't care what color your skin is he wants your character I wouldn't care if we were all black it wouldn't bother me a bit but it's the character God's looking for God said black people can sing better than white people cuz they got the beat they got that spiritual and he said oh Lord let me have some of that remember the old black man Daddy was talking about he said let me have some of that so you know what you still in your character your human character and you being black or yellow or whatever he liked some characteristic of that form cuz that was part of him he loved that kind of worship so don't ever think that you were born this way for just to be a burden no God wanted you that way that's if God wanted me the color I am then thank God yes but let's just connect with God that's the thing is getting connected with God because he has a beautiful flower garden and I that's what I said I believe the character of a person is much more better than the than the the skin color of a person you know and God looks at character remember he looks at character first all right so that's what we I want you to do too is look at the character of these ages maybe I didn't cover that enough and thank you sister for bringing it out maybe I didn't cover that enough for the lion that lion attitude or L is a boldness that you and I what do we do we testify somebody asked us a question somebody asked you why do you don't you cut your hair well you I don't won let me they won't let that's my husband no no no she'll say let me tell you so she was she was getting her hand operated on the other day and the lady ask her says take her hair down she said yeah I need you need to take your hair down well B when she unclipped it and it fell down the hair the lady said where'd you get all that hair from said well I don't cut I don't cut it don't cut it she said yeah the Bible says for you not to cut here the where that say that out so June just happened to have her little Nook with her you know and she was it's got the Bible in it so I come walking in and sat down and we started going through in First Corinthians and showed the lady where it says her hair was given to her for covering her glory well you know what that was that lion Spirit lion l i o n I don't want to be wrong on on the internet lion spirit that roaring lion what was he doing he was proving that the word of God was right through what not just through words that woman saw a human being a life not just something you read on the paper he she saw a life and that's what God wants he wants this to come off of this page and be a life that that you can look at them and say they're different we went to jun's Mother's Church um couple weeks ago and they were dressed the same and when we come back it was in above Helen in Robertstown so when we come back through Helen after the church service was over with there was the world with the shorts and spaghetti tops and no bras and all this stuff and tattoos that was sitting in the church that's right yeah tell me the difference that's right there is no difference and I'm not and you know they know all they know but sitting in that church I saw no different people than what was walking on the streets down there drinking beer in the middle of Helen so where's the difference you and I are different and if your life doesn't project being different every day if somebody can't tell you're different you need a new birth cuz your old birth is still producing what Mom and Daddy produced and the old spirit that they that that that was given to you at Birth you understand what I'm saying yes the old nature yes the old nature of life if you're still doing if somebody can't tell you're different now just as a testimony our first reunion our 10-year reunion was in 1989 well I'm one of the class officers and we got all this stuff together well I was still serving the world and and we went and had a drink and all these things that wherever it was no it was a right there on the corner no you're right H in I'm sorry it was a hall in no different right right right the second the 20 year one was in 1998 I got born again that year that was my year of my new birth I go to it and I'm going and there's like four or five of us officers we get in we go to each other's house and we set up all the plans so nobody else saw me but those guys so when we get there and all the class people walk in the door number one half of them want to know who I am now listen I live with these people I was a very popular in school yeah everybody knew way was so but you know what everybody knew who I was and they said that June was said well that's June's girlfriend now in the message go around in the message June's girlfriend that was June's boyfriend but anyway but now we go around places in the message and they say who's that one said that's June's husband wait who who that but they know her so anyway we walk in and number one many people did not know who I was I saw him 10 years before and Geor knows we live with each other down there most of people that there were 60 people in my graduating class and most of them still live in that one little area of Banks County so we do see each other every once in a while but the second the 20 year one in 1998 they voted me the most changed person some of them only saw me for an hour cuz we were there for just you know I mean the class presidents we were all there five of us so we knew each other Robin and me and a couple others you know so we they knew who I was but when all the other 50s something people got come in the room they're like who is this guy and then you know they said well we're going to have a who who who traveled the furthest who had the most kids and who changed the most so I was voted the most changed guy well they saw the outside man had changed yeah but I knew the Inside Man had changed too which had caused the action of the outside man to be different than what it was 10 years before that to me that's my testimony that God will change your life so much to leing the people that live around you will tell a difference you know I always told when it's said Quicken your moral body just short time ago I thought that me to change didn't I'm telling you what daddy's bringing out now is so clear you can be an adopted son of God and not make the change adopted fully adopted that third stage only show and I don't want to say only to say only that third stage shows you how to change your that that you can be changed not that that is a change but it's to win or to understand but you got to understand how to do something before you can do it got to understand how to drive a car you got to understand all the things about the wheels and the motors and the gas and the oil and all that stuff before you can really begin to drive the car brother yeah when I went to California one was asking about ha said this preacher said something had long ha said well she up Bible out and B study and one of her aunts said I see something and you guys sure right to me guys this is the seals the seals is not a great Supernatural understanding but yet it is a great Supernatural understanding of what who you are God's not going to come down God's not physically coming so where's he coming in you he wants to be in you doing the work that this Bible talks about right here and there we better go mama was here she'd already been out the door her
