like turn in your scripture turn we've been reading in Revelations 1 and then we will read from Romans 1 Revelations 1 Romans 1 and remember all of the announcements the the Lord willing brother Aaron

to pray that the Lord would bless they have me scheduled now for the third or fourth time to get around to shocking me I don't know whether they've got they don't have enough energy up there or not where we you know but they're going to do a little and a lot of people on the internet wonder what you mean going to give you a shock treatment you know they're going to shock my heart try to put it back in Rhythm so that's just pray for me that it'll be all right I don't have no problems and all like that but just remember that okay remember this afternoon you will be having the voting so you got the officers and everything all is supposed to be covered and I also remember that all right Revelations 1 Lord Jesus we love you father we thank you thank you for your love and your grace unto each one of us that you've bestowed upon us the opportunity to be able to hear about you and to walk in the light of your love we love you and we thank you bless each one bless all the visitors bless all the people Lord here today and just keep us all in your love remember the sick among us cuz you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from the destruction so we believe that guide us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives that we may walk in you we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been reading this for quite a while still don't haven't got around to our thought have we verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto per Samaria and unto pergamus and unto Tara and unto Sardis and un Philadelphia and unto lady oil the age that we're living in right so it's written down to us if you think this is not it go look up the word lady oia you'll find that it means people's rights right if you can't look on the news and see everybody's wanting their rights if you can't see that means the end of it you know all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothe with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle all right let's go over to Romans 1 and we'll start with verse 19 because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them it's talking about the the people of the unrighteousness Wrath is revealed and all right for God has showed it unto them see they they're not blind people want to say oh the people just don't know no people know for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word all right what about a people that are without excuse you know you can say well I don't know this and I haven't heard that and you know it's without excuse now what we've been doing for quite a while is building up a uh thing to or whatever you want to call it a scenario as those big old words are in our land today and I just call it plainly trying to unfold what has been a mystery since the foundation of the world that God has been trying to make your known and you know what we've been doing we've been trying our best to make it confusing because that's what we've got you turn on the radio today and you would hear one preacher talking about this way one talking about that way one going that way another going that way but everybody's got the truth you know well according to the Bible it says that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free all right so it have to be the truth if we don't know the truth then we're we're mly confused but trying to look at the things because we read there in the scriptures that uh you know you say well I can't understand the Bible I can't understand this I can't understand that but look at that scripture that we just read right of what it says says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen what being understood by the things that are made by his eternal power and godhead even his eternal power and godhead all you said but we can't understand God it's a mystery that's what mankind has done to make it a mystery to where we would not seek after God to understand I agree that it has to be revealed to you because that's the only way that it can ever be done is to be revealed and to just you know take man's ideas and thoughts uh you can get into things that help you and a lot of commentaries has been made a lot of things has been said that have been good things you know to help us to understand but the main thing is to look right into God's word to me and as we look into the word of God we see that you know God can be understood yes amen as we read here right even his eternal power and godhead can be understood by what by the things that we see right amen all right we look around and we try to look at the creation and we see in the creation that everything was created perfect now I didn't say Eternal cuz you can't create anything Eternal that's that's a that's a point that we've you know tried to do you've got to have a impartation to have eternal life you can't have something created because you can't create eternity all right we see then we look at the look at the world and the things and we they in geneses you know and we've been kind of coming down to that point of the creation and we look around and we see how he created the world right all right I said he made it perfect I didn't say Eternal all right he made the animals he made the the the all of the things and as he was making those things they were made perfect amen cuz God cannot make anything imperfect you say well well it's God's fault that I'm like I am no no no I'm sorry why don't you try to find somebody else to blame it on cuz you're not going to be able to blame on God your problems that's what my brother one time he said you know he's talking about uh he's a Methodist Minister and he was talking about how that God made evil I said no he didn't make evil well the Bible says that he knows good and evil I create this he didn't create evil How could an eternal God create anything evil you don't don't even think about that don't even consider well well he made he made me like I am that's what he said he said he can't judge me for being like I am cuz he made me I said no no no no no now big brother he's got about 8 years or close to 12 years in college you know over in the cemetery you know with him and uh so but I told him I said now you can't blame these things on God Amen that's right it's you that made yourself a sinner because he made you a free moral agent and then that way you choose and when you choose then you go the way you're going and and that way it it doesn't you don't blame God and don't blame Mama and Daddy and don't blame a uncle and whatever you know you just take it up on yourself and just look right straight at it and say well all right Lord forgive me and help me right cuz he couldn't create anything wrong so we can look back at to creation and that's the point I've been driving at uh in this last few weeks is to getting down to the creation all right and looking at the creation you know the by looking at the creation we can see the Creator amen right right right I mean you go down to the doctor's office today and he'll put you up there and they they run a few test on you and he says well you got this you got that but he's just dealing with what he's dealing with but he cuz he can't explain what all that is inside of you amen you know I mean they can take things out of one person and put them in another one right and it'll attach but you wouldn't want to put a a kidney attached to the liver would you why because it's not made to go there but yet you can take I don't know what those big old words that they've got there for it you can take some things out of one person put it in another person and it'll help them you know why because that's so designed in the human body until that human body when God made it that cells or whatever that you place there to help the person goes to one spot right and it helps that situation that's in that place because it's so designed that way I mean what keeps you alive while you asleep right that's right well you just go into this yeah you just got some kind of a sensible answer but what really keeps you alive what keeps you going what keeps all of these things is because God made you that way he made you perfect he didn't make us Eternal he made us Perfect all right then being made perfect then we have to receive eternity to be able to talk about something Eternal but now in the creation we can look at the creation and find the Creator or laying right there right science is going haywire and can't figure out a blade of Grace that's right they can go to the Moon they can go to this they can go to Mars they can go to all these places and just like the prophet said when they was doing all of those things I remember one of those statements he said well they're going to the Moon he said but when they get up there they ain't going to find nothing well that was a sensible answer me you don't find nothing why because you know here's where we're living so let's stay down here all right but thinking about looking at the creation to find the Creator if you can't see God do that part just look around you amen right that's right just think about you and the way you're living and the way you're doing the way your heart keeps beating how all of these things Works within the organism orever what you call them organs of the B of the body that you are and all of that works so perfect right right until it would have to be a Creator am all right if there is a creation there's no question of whether there's a lot of people that say they're atheists I say they're idiots but that's their opinion and their points if that's what they want to be you can be dumb if you want to but see they say well there is no God well then who started what well it all come from a pow walk word the PO what come from well it came from energy well where did the energy come from solves a problem the things that we see proves that there is a God all right and looking at the creation then we can see that He makes himself known through his creation amen as we've just read here in the scripture right even to understanding the Eternal godhead all right we make the illustrations a lot and all but it it really helps us see I'm a father I'm a human being you know I'm a grandfather a great-grandfather I've have many many titles right and things to me but yet I'm just one person so I just can't understand how there's one God there's got to be at least two you know they got the tuness people goes in there or maybe three anyway so I was talking to a person one day and uh we got to talking about the godhead and after a while he said well okay said if the father and the Holy Ghost is the self-sign spirit I said well would you explain how it can be any other way you know he said okay I guess we're down to two now I said well you done pretty good getting rid of one of your Gods why don't you just go ahead and hack off one of the others and we'll get down on some basic levels and talk about one God because you know the Bible says that the Commandments What right there's just one Lord the Bible says there's one Lord One Faith one baptism or one God one Faith you know all right looking at the creation to find a Creator if you ever question whether there's a God or not go look in the mirror and look at yourself and see how you got there like that just just look around amen that's right and see things right all right and then when you do see you can look back and you can see that all of that is what that's doing is God revealing himself amen amen cuz he's making himself known by the creation that he's there and and that way the the the human being can't say well I don't understand you don't have to be educated to understand the disciples none of them outside of the Apostle Paul could probably even write their name righten right they were ignorant and unlearned as far as worldly things but yet they were the ones that were chosen to write the word and probably on a lot of them some of them had probably even get somebody else to write it right you know somebody did you get in there and you find out that like Luke he was great you know in the writings and the things but just think about it now to understand this person that we read of in Revelations that it says that that one liken the son of man G about to pouch with a golden girdle and coming on down and and then it'll show his face and it shows his feet it shows all the things you know we look at God as being uh our B basic thoughts of God is like I've been trying to cover for about three months now how real is your god I ask you that question well he's just a spirit you know he's just a spirit he's just floating around he's just a spirit well now we found out that that can't be true now what's one of the reasons that it can't be true you know what's one of the reasons that it can't be true that God is just like the wind just blowing about well the prophet said okay we believe that right we believe that because he saw it but what did he do he saw God is real is a reason he said that he's not like the wind right saw him real had he just seen the wind he' said he was the wind all right but see we we look at it and we say well God is a spirit so we just have him as just just floats he just everywhere you know well you mean he created you right amen right greater than he is you mean you're more real come on we've been over in Genesis where it said let us make man in our own image well if God is just a spirit then we ain't nothing but spirit so what happened somewhere the poliwags got involved right right somewhere the human being got involved somewhere this body got involved you mean that that God is just nothing but just a spirit floating around and just I've tried to illustr rate that over so much because I know what the human mind thinks you know cuz I have one it don't work too good sometimes but I have one but you see we try to figure it all out but do you mean to tell me that that there is a God that is just a spirit but yet he created all of this well that wouldn't be in His image that's you're going in reverse right remember it says he created man in his own image and his likeness wellin some words there's got to be something that looks familiar to this type of us that he created it from or or brought forth right but see that's what I've been driving at for the longest try to get us to just look sensibly come on we if we just think sensibly about things if we're created in His image then we're supposed to just be spirits who got the rest of us here where did it come from who created it well he just made us more tangible well then the Bible's not right that's right that's right right come on cuz the Bible said we were created In His Image in his likeness yes all right if we're created in his likeness he's got to be look something like we are well I Brother D I've always just thought that God is just a spirit that's that's what you've been taught all of your life instead of sitting down thinking about something for yourself you just go back and take what somebody told you Grandma Grandpa preacher Pastor whatever you're just taking what's somebody else says instead of a reality but see God let some people look beyond the natural points to where that they can say well I've seen this I've seen that right all right and brother R said that is for the purpose of where that they can help you to help you to understand all right and like I said you mean to tell me that that this this pull pit is made of wood it's pretty hard it's it's pretty tangible you know it's pretty solid and you mean God is Not greater than that he's not more real than that why would we have any trouble with thinking about it if he was capable of in like Genesis 1 and one I think it is where it said God made the heavens and the earth now where did he get the material to make it well okay he spoke it into existence that's a good point he spoke into existence the material it would take to make the Earth right that's good but you mean that he's not more real than that yeah come on now what kind of a god do you have I'm not going to serve a God that that some kind of a thing that cannot help me if I need him and I'm not talking about going out and getting in trouble where I need him I'm talking about when I need him that I can call on him and believe he's real that's right if he's just a spirit he might be all somewhere else blowing around right when I need him right I know I make carnal illustrations but I want you to think what kind of a god do you have you remember years ago who was it with the man that put out the thing been back in the 60s I guess and said God was dead yes you remember that well you know to the biggest portion of the world right he might as well be right right but you know everybody jumped on the bandwagon and started saying well you know no God's not dead and they wrote songs I talk to him today well that's good right that's real good but did he ever talk back well God don't speak to us what's the problem right you know the reason he don't speak to us come on you know the reason he don't speak to us is because our brain is so full of all of the garbage can of the world right and he doesn't like to dwell in that oh but but but God only speaks to the prophet well you want where the Prophet said what's wrong we listening to him the other night he said what's wrong why can't we believe God can talk amen we're not talking about the word coming to you we're not in the garbage cans okay we're not talking about you're trying to be a prophet for God to speak something different we're talking about this simply being God what about the gifts what about the gifts that work amen what about God revealing to people are speaking in in in tongues and interpretation and and saying get out because there's a storm coming righten what about those things amen you see I I believe God is real not just the thoughts of your mind because if he's just a spirit then he's no more than the thoughts of your mind to what you are and you know what that makes you greater than he is come on do you realize why I scream so much at that our stupidity and our human doings we think we're greater than God well I thought maybe that he was going to destroy the biggest portion of the people of the world one day that's right right sir y right right right you know the Bible says Don't Fear him that can destroy the body right Satan can work on that right we got Adam bombs we got all kind of guns and everything going you know house was burning up the other day they said somewhere my wife was telling me about it and the people told me said Don't Get Around said there's ammunition in there well some hour later there were still bullets flying all over the place and finally it hit the gas tanks or something and it blowed up the whole place and burnt a house well you know you mean that see we're a bunch of dummies all we've done is created death and want to call it life all right but think about it just simply think if God is not more real than anything we see tangibly we look at you know then we better find us a God right right and you see why people like the man said that God was dead well you know what to him it was he wasn't aive right amen and that bumf fall is little the biggest portion of the people you know when they went to the moon you know the Russians said we went up to the moon and back and we didn't see no God but what they didn't keep up with was when they did go up there and back that they did make reports of a light following them all the way there and all the way back but they didn't want to tell that see because it means there something real I'm simply asking you a question what about your God is your god capable of taking care of you amen now if he's just a spirit he can't heal you right come on you say yes he can cuz he can oh he can create Hils okay now you trapped your own self cuz see you have to create something to heal you a spirit can't heal you see God had to come down and pay the price right to release his own life to be able to come back in us to give us eternal life and soul right and he had to take the stripes to let the blood run out to where that it would be for the healing Factor because there only life in the creation of sales all right but see think about him how real is he that's it is he real enough to talk to well if he's real enough to talk to why wouldn't you expect him to talk back oh we're still hung on that though you know we've got it all figured out nobody God don't speak to nobody but the prophets give me that in the Bible well it says in Amos 3 and 7 that's the word coming to the People by way of God using the prophets right who was it that was over there in prison and it went over and opened the door and went out you know God could do all of that and he could do he could speak see we limited him to the basis to where that he cannot speak to us I'm not talking about that we have to do this that or the other but isn't it something wonderful every once in a while to just feel his presence maybe some of you have never failed it that way I'm honest maybe some of you have never walked down a road or at night or somewhere and just know that there's somebody right there beside you maybe some of you have never been like joshh in a car wreck if I could play I got a pick and like Josh was in a car and had a wreck and the people that were behind him when they when Josh got out of the car they wanted to know where the other person was because they said there was a man got out of that car besides him and walked down through the woods oh but we can't see God do we the reason you can't see him you don't know how to look for him you don't know where to look you don't what don't know what to look at right do you understand what I'm driving at see he said let us make man in our image right our likeness well what kind of an image and likeness did God have right well he's just a spirit so then we're just spirit so let's go home right do you realize what you're saying you're saying you're just a spirit because you're created His Image see you're not thinking about him being real you only have him as an imaginary position and especially something to just try to keep you from going to hell when life is over yeah right isn't that basically what most people want y i right they just want him down at the end right they want somebody to take them over down at the end when life is over is that the way the prophet said it he said most people don't serve him because they love him he said they serve him because they trying to keep him going to hell right is that your way you're just serving him because that you you you you you don't want to be destroyed one day well why don't you just get born again and then you don't have to worry about being destroyed why don't you just get his life in you amen right amen why don't you just die out to all of those stupid ideas that we have right and accept Jesus Christ as our savior and let him come and live in our hearts and our lives and then you find out in a hurry that he's real that's right but you know what most people come to the altar they come to the altar because somebody's begged them or pleaded with them that's why we don't do that away we don't walk down the aisle and say you need to come to the altar no make sure you're LED of God before you go do that because you're causing that person a problem right you said well I feel led to go talk to them no no you got good points in your mind right you you telling me I'm not L of the Lord no no you just told me you wouldn't because you don't know about God Amen if you knew about God then you'd accept the fact that you don't have to try to plead with somebody to get them to come to the altar to be saved if your God is real you don't have to plead with nobody amen see that's what it was done in my my brother-in-law got killed in a car at accident I was probably 18 17 years old and uh I've told you my life story of Parts you know that where I believe I met God and where I just went on my own but yet my sister done the greatest damage could ever be when she walked to all Li walked down through the church and told me said Sam you need to come to the alar you know JC didn't have no hopes he got killed real quick said you need to come to altar well I've told you this before I had more confidence in JC that was her husband as a Christian than I had in her as one yet she prayed she cried she said she felt the Lord she'd held on to his legs I don't doubt it I have no problems with her I'm just saying she didn't line up as much as her husband did and see that throwed me away from coming to the altar I had to get over the church to be saved that's right amen amen that's right come on can I quote the prophet he said the thing that was to bring us to Christ it's paraphrasing be very close on he said was what took us away from Christ you said well we Tau them little kids they need to come and get saved yeah father son Holy Ghost is going to save us yeah we need to get them saved that's that was good that was all right I'm not against that right I'm just saying what did we teach them right that come on later in our lives and has to be eradicated out of us and it's hard to get that eradicated today because we still have our thoughts about is there three gods or one God or what is it doing right because the devil if he don't talk to you he's yours be well I guess the reason he don't talk to you cuz he's too busy with me that's maybe it's the best way to say it I'm open and blunt see by the time you get it thoughts in your mind that you get it figured out that you see something about that time it goes Haywire right especially when I come along and you think you got it all figured out and then you come on and say well brother Dale I thought I knew what I was talking about till you started preaching right but you see Church to me God is real he's more real than we are he's more real than any of our thoughts could ever be of anything and he came into the world himself not sin and a son that we think yeah now where's that in the Bible I want it did he send a son no he came himself right he didn't send a son show it to him in the Bible he came himself would you send a son to die for you come on be sensible would you send one of your well somebody's got to die so we'll pick out one of the kids oh boy you're good mom and daddy no amen now see God came himself down to pay the price that you and I would be able to receive salvation am all right and being able to do that then it would bring us to an understanding about him of how real he is that's it oh but but but brother Dale all I've known all my life is just a spirit well I think it's about time to get rid of some of our thoughts you said but that's what the Bible says but the Bible says he has hands he has a heart he has a head that's right and he is a soul I'm not going to say it the way you thinking it you're still thinking that God has a soul no you're incorrect God doesn't have a soul he is a soul amen we'll get to that this afternoon all right but you see we don't read all the Bible we just read what we want to read right amen the Old Testament it asked to or talk about how that there would be a price to be pray paid for the life of a person and it would say a ransom for the soul well see then if we are a soul and the word soul is like a being or person or whatever you are I'll give you the definitions more this afternoon but save in time see a soul the Bible speaks a lot about a soul you know that Jesus in the garden said my soul is troubled that's you I no problems say didn't it did he the Bible says in acts coming over from Psalms that I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither suffer my Holy One to see corruption amen so we know that the body came out of the grave in Le in 72 hours in it where there wouldn't be no corruption set in to where it would be correct what about his soul what do you think about your soul what do you think about you how real are you right oh I'm you I'm just a spirit we get down to it eventually or to a point to where that we can look at it and see what a soul really is amen it's you it's your being it's your person that's Webster's definition right y it's the part of you that lives it's the part of you that distinct from the body amen and you know in the the Bible it don't say the spirit that sin us shall die the Bible says the soul that sinth shall die the soul is more real than and in your physical body amen yet we don't believe that we just think it's a nature of some Spirit we can quote that can't we but it's like I told you I want to quote where brother randam said the soul is just the nature of the spirit there is no such thing he says the soul is the nature of the spirit he said what's the difference because if you're just saying it's just the nature you got a dog being a bird dog a hound dog a right that's a nature what do you think about you how real are you maybe we might find out how real God is when once we ever find out how real we are that's right amen yep listening last night to the prophet talking about you know how that a man just set a GCE up and by looking at it and using his own vibes from his body broke the G in front of him look how real we are that you know the birds and the dogs and the cats I know some of you love your wonderful little dogs and cats that's fine that's okay but remember they don't have a soul that's right oh they're so h no that's not even good sensible they have a spirit within them that motivates them and guides them but they don't have a soul man is the only thing that has a soul that's right and being the human being as to be a soul then evidently God must amen if we have a soul if we are a soul if we are a then we're in the image of God then what kind of a god do you have yeah but we're looking at a we're just looking at I don't know I was thinking about this the other day how we look at the human body and things you realize that we know that there's a spirit within this body because my hands cannot go up and down unless something within this body motivates it from my brain that's right right but now my brain is not my soul right right my brain is just a computer yep bunch of sales and bunch of things got to be motivated by something my wife sit and look at a computer all day long she don't know how to turn it on Timothy brother dy's little boy one day was riding down the road piggy kept saying that I don't even how to turn him on he said sister Dale is at that own button you m it all got a good life but she was meaning I know nothing about operating it you know so the computer is smarter than her you know cuz it sets there and got a lot of information she just don't know how to get it that's all your brain is it's not your spirit it's not there's a spirit within us right that's motivating us amen that's it but you know your body and your spirit is not the real you that's what I'm driving at folks the soul is the real you because I quote in the scripture there a while ago it said the soul that sin it shall die it doesn't say the body because body can't sin right there's no sin in the body without the spirit that's right there about to be a motivational part makes that work all right but the soul is more real than the spirit cuz the soul lives on after death the best you can say about the spirit is it goes back to God who gave it but be careful once you use that because you're you're saying it goes back to God and be careful that sinful Spirit can't go back to God right now that's just don't play with words that way you can't put a sinful Spirit back to God he would annihilate it quick as it come into His presence so then there has to be something else maybe that scripture is only speaking of and it really was speaking of Jesus Christ if you go check your scripture where Spirit goes back to God who gave it but if it is we can talk about it if you want to talk about it as being a a Christian but remember no matter what whether you're sinner or Saint you are a soul amen that's right you're a person your being y your nature and you're a little Creator that's true right yep birds build their nest the same way right dogs do the same thing cats do the same thing but human is constantly learning right the dog has an ability to communicate with other dogs to a degree they know certain things they can follow a pack or whatever they want to do but they can't use it to reason out what's going on oh yeah you can teach a course to count but just remember he knows to hit three times and you're going to give him one piece of bread or four times you going to give him two pieces of bread he just learns by that smartness of those things all right but he has no soul of that's why the Bible says in there in Genesis and he God breathed into the of Adam and he became a living Soul all right when a baby is dropped from the mother there is a little life waiting for that amen baby to come into because God then Mom and Daddy by God you giving them the ability they can bring a body into existence but the Soul and Spirit has to come from almighty God yes amen right and see then by doing that that's that soul is the real you amen so then the Soul is if we talk about God that's the real himym right sorry for the terminologies that's I don't have the education but it's the real hym right right amen that's why he would stand there in the garden when he was actually getting ready to be crucified you know just abouted and he says my soul is troubled but go back in the Old Testament where you find out he says that my soul is fed up with you my soul is fed up with you look up the word soul and just see what it means so you could find out that you could look at yourself and see a soul a human being right by way of the prophit and the understanding of doing and seeing then we can see that that Soul lives on right you remember beyond the curtain of time when he saw the people he said that the scripture says Souls under the altar well we're so smart we think no that Souls under the altar can't be well I remind you that 1965 but you see what is the soul of an individual it's you it's what you are am I look at your body your spirit can display things through that body y but your soul is what really you are if it wouldn't that way why do you you ever talk to yourself brother hus used to say he said the only time I know that I'm caring on intelligent conversation is when I'm talking to myself that's right amen how real are you you are so real until I could remove from you by way of killing you or whatever the body that you inhabit right I could cause that spirit by taking away that ability for that body to live and do that Spirit could be removed away but that Soul no matter whether you're a sinner or a saint that Soul's going to live on because that's why the scripture I talking about while ago don't fear him that can destroy the body but fear him that can destroy the soul I cannot destroy your soul right right right you can take your own life but you can't destroy your soul and live on somewhere CU that's the real you right getting away from the part of just saying God is a spirit not meaning that's not right because it is right amen sure cuz it takes Body Spirit and soul to make an individual amen any part left off is you're not complete right and see then God had to come down as I said while ago he didn't send a son he came himself that's right he gave his own life am he gave his own soul right in the Tomb when he was laying there we have scriptures that tells you what he was doing that's right he went and preached to the spirits Souls right that were in prison amen now he was a witness to those who did not accept him that was in the days of knowing the things you know amen but you know what he was something else while he was there because he went down and you go down to the regions and you get down to where the devil and his parts are and there were people there that he had to be a witness against those were Souls right people right right y who' they look like they look like the person that was living on Earth right right amen all right you move over into another real when he starts back back up and he's doing another thing he's coming forth to be a witness to those that are in the regions of where it talks about the bosom of ab Abraham you know paradise and he's a witness to them that he was the Seed of Abraham amen and you know what he brought them out of that place now not the ones that were in the regions of the Lost those Souls remain there until the day of judgment am right but he brought them out of that place their soul all right see because that soul is the real them so no matter what whether you're a sinner or Saint you are a being you're a person you're a soul that's my whole point to get it Y and you're looking at him to pay the price he has to pay the price for our sins and the thing and then come back not as just an anointing of a spirit because that anointing of that Spirit can anoint you every day of your life and you you still not be right cuz you got balum you got all the different ones in the Bible you even got kyus prophesying of the Lord Jesus that one would have to die for the sins of the people but Kus is the one that also cause the judgment to come upon the Lord Jesus right yes so you can have that anointing ing upon you that Spirit can anoint you right not to do wrong now but that's still not the real you the real you is that part that we talk about Soul amen I run into a group of people years ago that there is actually a teaching that man didn't have a soul until a law came into being and he was really making a good teaching out of it there at work and I didn't interfere with him while he was speaking I just waited till he got through and people left and I said well son the only thing I got to say is that uh you said the law didn't come into existence until the soul didn't come into existence till the law came and I said according to my Bible it says in Genesis 27 I think it is he breed into the nostrils of Adam and he become a living Soul he just looked at me I never thought of that I said well it'd be good for you to think about it he was spending a lot of time teaching era and never looked up anything about what the truth was he just had an idea sounded good sound good see that the law was what made you think about being wrong so that's the soul no no no no the soul is the real you right let me put it this way it's the instigator of your nature is that a good way of saying it all right y that's why the prophet would call the soul being the nature of the spirit then he get over in souls in prison he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again said if not it's of the world that's right there's a nature within each and every one of us we all are made different irregardless identical to wins you keep on you'll find out one will be a little different than the other one sister Trudy used to how the magazine years ago where that this body was still you know was two people up here but only one body down it was actually proven to be true and this body up here was split and you know and there was two heads and one of them they were girls and one of them like boys and the other one didn't cuz it's a nature see when that soul of that baby comes into that body to make it a living being then a nature will be formed around that that will display what's within there right and that's why Jesus Christ had to come and die because there was no nature and no man even the animal we know that we know it couldn't it didn't have no soul it couldn't take away those desires and the things you would just go right back and do it again right oh you could be repentant become soft-hearted but it wouldn't be long you went right back into the same things but when Jesus Christ came that was the very soul of almighty God that came down in the human flesh right to be able to release that life that it could come back into you and I and giving us eternal life right and changing the nature of our soul amen I'm looking at something that'll be 20 messages down the road of how real that is what actually happened in that new birth you say it was a Spirit come in well if it was a spirit comeing in you could be anointed one what actually happened in your New Birth come on I'm just asking questions well brother Dale this Spirit came on me and I shouted Glory Hallelujah but you could be just an anointed one that's right amen right right you better consider whether that Soul you have or you are whether it came from God in the correct way right that's what your New Birth has to do with it right it's just not a predestination and a flop flop and this fell here and that fell there that nature that you have if you'd have followed that nature and a sinner look what You' have been that's right y right I know you don't like for me to talk because it exposes things but when I was a sinner I would go out and do wrong and come back and cry and weep about it and think I shouldn't have done that I wouldn't saved I wouldn't save when to come on into the Baptist church and was a deacon for almost 10 years and Sunday school teachers and directors and everything and teaching adult Sunday School classes when I left but I didn't get born again till I come in this message cuz I didn't know what it was well I got this and I got to praise God I'm not telling you you didn't I am telling you to make sure make you're calling an election sure listen the other night where the Prophet said the devil used to tell us that we're lost he said now the same devil tells you that you're saved now which one you going to listen to that's right right better make you calling an election sure but you understand what I'm getting at this a simple point then we'll pick up this afternoon more if we're created in the image of God then we have to do away with the point of just saying well God is just a spirit we got to get down to a reality a realization of who we are and what we're doing you know but we got to get down to a basis of seeing that God is real not just the thought in our mind that's right that's a teaching that there's a great teaching that that God is just the good thoughts of your mind and the devil is the bad thoughts of your mind well I'd be in problem because I stay over on the wrong side you tell me you don't I'm going to call you a liar and then you're going to get mad at me cuz I tell you the truth right I'd love to be able to come up here and say the Lord dwelt with me all this week and I had a wonderful week and I never had a wrong thought I never I'd just be lying yeah right that's right but every once in a while he does drop down and say something to me and you know yes and gives me a while to think it over and I go pray a lot about it to see whether it's right or not and then I check it out in the word to see what it is right see we've got a Bible to check it with and we got a prophet's message to tell us what that Bible says so we've got something to check with we don't have to be like the world that's got what's your opinion well that's just your opinion no opinion don't get you nowhere but reality will what do you think about God I hope you understand the point I was making what you think about God is what you think about yourself right what you think about yourself is what you're thinking about him one day realize you are something real right and you know that God loved you so much until he gave that Soul a ransom yes right he paid the price as a ransome y right he so loved us until he wanted to join himself to us in a new birth I'll say it this way but I won't say my point see then I'd consider to think about what a soul is I'd consider to think about those words the prophet used called theophany logos speech I'd consider those things as to make it more into reality than into just thinking it might help us to understand who we really are you don't ever W wake up into night and just wonder well Lord who am I amen why did you choose me you don't never think that way amen you don't never think about why did you choose me amen that's right when you think about people that are so much greater and more marvelous in their lives and their doings and things you know but you think about what he didn't call them right yes Lord isn't it a statement there that many are the flaws of the ones that are chosen of God you look at the chosen of God and you don't find any of them that doesn't have flaws right name one it doesn't have a flaw well look at B yeah he was a murderer consenting to the the death of the people whatever you want who you want to name you're going to find out you're running in a hole you can't find out anything in this world is worth anything amen and why would God die for you and I amen thank you Lord why would he give his life that it could come into you and I amen and like I tried to explain it the other day you know for a little bit see we think of God like brother Mo used to describe him like a you got an apple pie and you cut it up you give away the pieces and you don't have no more pie left that's what we think about God but each piece that he cuts off goes out and multiplies into many many more we're in the expanding of God instead of the doing away with God that's right and expanding means you and I are his offspring we're his children amen that's what he's done for us come on Brothers amen think on these things is God real how real are you sometimes you sit down and think about that so you know brother Dale told me to Lord Let's help me just sit down here and think about it what am I I'm a body spirit and a soul right I'm created in the image of my father amen and you know when he was here on Earth that soul and that Spirit of almighty God lived in a body that we call Jesus right he said Philip have I been so long with you if youve seen me he said you've seen the father you know why because there in that human body that we call Jesus was the very nature that's it amen of almighty God he wasn't a son that was just done this or done that no he was the very nature of almighty God Amen and that body was very Soul and Spirit of almighty God Amen the Eternal godhead right to be able to be seen by the things we look at walk outside after a while and you'll look and see that even though it's right in the winter time and everything so bad you look around you'll find some green grass you'll find some Pine Tre trees that still have green thistle needles on them you find a lot of things amen that let you know about God am then if you fool around and mess up enough and turn around you might look at somebody and see God standing looking at you am amen amen you look at these little children these little babies especially and you look there and you see the eyes of trust and love and sinceri and things and just remember then they are given to you and the nature they receive comes from being around you you know I don't blame my neighbor for his kids acting like me right right CU my neighbor didn't instill the nature but I did make sure you raise them kids right tell them right cuz they're watching you to see what you do what we got brother 2779 279 red book 279 red book anybody have a need the altar is open remember we're talking about God to be off with the Lord think about it is God real to
