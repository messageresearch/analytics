had to stop and he was breaking up he was hacking my spiritual computer that's only we don't know mo he's hard to talk to a preacher boy dig a good scrip you down nothing man we got on some planes out of world but also I got some inspiration for another message so we thank the Lord for that sowed appreciate you this evening my wife she was not able to come but the Chris loans to give me his green is this evening and I'll be praying for me it got a her and he pulled it out and he's in it was in a lot of pain so y'all remember him praise God so I'm gonna go right to the word Lord this evening little thought I've been preaching on and I thought it would be good to share this evening with just you know I'm gonna read from the book of Genesis the fourth chapter and I will read verse three to verse 5 you know I'm so gonna read Romans eight then I'll read verse 9 through verse 11 Genesis the fourth chapter beginning at verse 3 it says her program using it then he said but in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offered unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had what respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and K was very rough and his countenance fell let us go to Romans 8 Rome is the eighth chapter and I'm read from verse 9 down to verse 11 Paul speaking here he said but ya are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his but if powerful right well then let you know it all go back to God how loose articles in his a anything he goes on in their birthday and he says but if Christ be in you the body is dead because of same but the Spirit is life because of righteousness then he brings the revelation together he said but if the spirit of him I noticed you know that is not them helooo it the spirit of him he say the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the day telling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you praise God let us pray our gracious Father forgive us this day our trespasses and all I say is Oh God many mistakes Lord my father we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ father help us to heal herself to you O God a body soul in a spirit Oh God but I trust God that you helped me to get myself out of the way Lord that you can use my body for your glory but I gotta give you all my scrip for this service in Jesus Christ's name we pray you mean God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening so if we took from the scripture this evening I took from the book of Genesis I deal with two boys going to worship Him one was accepted and the other was rejected ha Luanne and I went to Paul and Paul begin to he did say he's a but he begin to talk about the spirit and the flesh and don't worry beginning to realize let us understand that the flesh is rejected there's no way to meet God in flesh honey you gotta meet God by revelation so I want to take a thought or just evening people start on broken connection between the natural and the supernatural the broken connection between the natural and the supernatural and I looked up a definition for that here disconnect it it means to stop or in or supply of electricity I'll do in other words if a connection were breaking the building the night hallelujah overload and the power the breaker box will automatically cover all the power that might will go out hallelujah the lights will go out got nation and brogre and the building will be powerless hollow that's the same with the Holy Spirit honey if the connection is broke between you and God you'll become powerless it ain't no way for you to in other words there's no power there's no way for you to beat the enemy if the connection is wrong so that what I was dealing with in reason I with the jitters there because what you know we want to go back to Jesus because we would realize when in the beginning God God our God had a connection he made hellooo God created man in his own image created man he male female created he them haloo God put Adam and in other words God when he created us uh I just been her Holly it was uh it was a powerhouse of energy that's when Adam was he was a powerhouse of energy how did I deal with children oh sure and God created him male female created he them halu only is cited item was an invisible union Holly I want you to know in his mind and in his heart was his wife Holly that was so she was mystery that was hidden inside of Adam others I know what you to notice now if you noticed this when Adam was created in the image of God hallelujah anyway incident to the image of God did God took this image and put it behind skin and breathe until he became a living soul hallelujah that word and it became the mystery of God on this earth haloo God gave him supreme deity over there hallelujah God would decrease the Supreme Spirit on the whole universe but Adam had everyday under his power and I want you to notice here I would you know the devil never came to Adam he were too powerful the devil I'm gonna never knew I knew better than to trying to approach Adam because Adam ate enough bow in here to speak him mighty existed how he the devil in that crazy how do you know where he knew he he knew he knew that the poverty was another and he knew it was no way for him to face Adam so he stay here and all the evils that all the time saying it was in the garden entire the whole time because the Bible said in Ezekiel 28 he was down all the time in the garden but in his shorts a stat him the tree in life with the tree of knowledge without all the time and Adam II hit anyway I don't walk that he is supreme deity God let Adam - Adam whatever your thought is you could call it daddy honey what Anna was not speaking his thought he was speaking of mine a Christ every time he named something it was not him speaking it was God using him we begin to look at this deity here we begin to realize her so now and it was so now in the words of God being Adam had a deep culture too deep he created every day in his image at a a male and a female created a rooster head of he created a buck here - no he did not create two roosters hello tooth bumps how did that man the one mess it up not God how did the perversion of his angels what men said of not God huh Luba had male and female honey in the beginning but God here go enemies but she was on the other side of Adam and Adam had a deep culture the deep that one approach that it does a deep call that got to be a deep to respond to that call Adam wanted somebody he could hold their hands and they could walk through the cooler the gun and they can enjoy the paradise of God Hollywood anyway he wanted somebody who sat down in the cool of the day and they could talk about what the father had did he wanted somebody he could help fellowship with how do even though she was on the inside of her but he could not publish your winner hope we would have been low even though the insider because he was there scared and she was invisible in the word with no fishy bit way but he wanted something he could touch her whole head hey know what sit down so God what did God do God put out him in a deep sleep put him in a deep sleep and what did God do when he did God opened up the side of Adam he opened up his side hey God reaching that took a real from on his heart and God took out the feminist spirit hallelu did God closed up the side once God took it out he closed it up hallelu didn't we got closed it up how do we took that real money may hear a woman may be a woman not not naughty that was when she got an independent spirit she did not receive that name she received a new name after she weird name had to see it fell from God but in the beginning she was a missive Adam how loose she was his revelation she will what come out of Adam honey but God close up decided at him why would you know that when we the second Adam God never closed his side up Bobby go we got to come back to him Holly we got to come back to what we fell from hell is Oh God open inside but don't let me here he was so novel a new Adam did it thank God okay goodbye ha Louie Adam says I'm going to call you woman because you too mr. Adam can you my revelation you would come out of me you bone of my bone and you flesh of my flesh huh anyway so further element something now that he he could eager charge he had something he could hold hands with hallelujah something that he could his descendant oh he got brave boy after his kind I lose I'll have had that perfect he had the perfect mate telling me you know I want you to live the problem world Satan was in the garden the whole time but he was a spirit and the spirit is powerless without something a word through say there was in this study because he's a scientist don't forget shame he is a scientist honey when the brothers are and bidding that's dream world what did he see that he's seen scientists mixing up the Word of God how do you double deal today people try to miss the revelation with human understanding it won't work the revelation only had come by God and God alone but then Satan was there all the time as Satan was steady this day now when saves seen his woman he realized that she was a byproduct hello he realized God took her from Adam Island so you notice he never talked to Adam you notice all the time that it was into God he never come madam but all of a sudden here after she come out Satan came to her not Adam honey but would you know him what would you say that you remember say was that all the time but Satan was not a creator to make him a creator you got to give him the same power that God got he had to be same really God he would have to have he would have to be a eternal creature but he know he's not a creator he did not create something as a governor or what God could already create he can use the law Oh God and get results yeah well devil can pay ties and be blessed you can check it every day I don't even only if a man just got enough fame to pay ty he could still drink and smoke and God bless his men got a blender but they told me he go in heaven that mean that he obeyed a lotus in the world and God cannot lie I don't care what you say Cody says her so I'm beginning to realize it as we begin to hear so Satan knew he couldn't create but being a scientist he knew the law of God he knew that God has said every seed might bring for at his kind had ever seen my brain boy at this guy the same God has said that the wheat would grow by the same rain the God also said that the thought of desert would grow by the same rain and they gonna be thrown in the fire burn but the law of God we're braying up the thorn just like it went to eat honey so low that Satan will use it not creative power low uses God love to get what he wants other people we didn't come to church to use go along we come to church to be born again let me pour about the spirit I'm not trying to paint I'm to get a blessing i paint time because the works a so thought I thought they didn't talk about that in your dish you do better so st. says array I can't create he began to study to God and all of a sudden all of a sudden he saw this big burly creature look like the man strong burly Rud he said wall and he's seen as crece says guess what I can use he says remember beasts has no power to reject a demon spirit if they want to enter them pigs had no resistor he's a when Jesus met Legion and under what did that demon said let us go to the peopie permission Jesus let go the peace couldn't say I resist you they can do nothing about it how loose so kawaai they have no soul how do i bestow had to prayer i bestow had to be snow had to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll do either be Satan knew he could overtake this spirit this beast so Satan says I'm gonna use this big burly thing and he enter right into it because it was so close to me now say knew that he didn't have a soul but he knew if he could put skin on himself he can have a soul honey they were the woman I'd only supplied a body for Jesus she also applied a body for the servant how do you know where he had to come to her that why Christ had to go back and come to her the same way Holly sure did say this is all right if I use if I can enter into this woman I can receive a body and if I get a body after the cat the law of God require me to get a soul he thought that word he thought that would work if he didn't think that the word he came wouldn't be trying to wash it as it came with me bill knows that he thought that was get him back in the presence of God Holly didn't work but he was already a falling demon had he already been excommunicated from the presence of God for eternally separated he totally did there's no way for him to get back to God turn you know this year so what did he do he goes in here and he in turn into this beast now was he internet now I say you know I totally know today I'm pretty today the concept of the world it was just big beautiful snake hanging out of the tree the woman walking up there Big Apple's right there in the stage a baby wouldn't bite of this Apple come on people you you never seen the toughest me come you could teach a pad to talk but you can't teach a pad to reason he only can say what you say Holly don't worry but here go do anyway so now we related we realized this was not a snake that guy that was into that goblin that same with you did it was a alright creature so poster man but without a soul and Satan could not give him a soul go to you now to creator so he looked at this woman he's seen her he says that's a way to get into the human race so he started talking to her he come evening what did he do and he told her part truth and partly how do you never see that way of making so conception is and not that something be uh uh some deceive you in something to deceive people it's almost right Holly it's almost right it looked good and it looked right but it ain't

one how do we go we all will die these body and we'd not change so you go to there and it goes in a day here he was so now at a neighbor I would you realize know what you what you know before I did hello what did I do when Ellie came down and saying that Eve had broken the connection between the natural and the supernatural he realized what he looked at he that the woman has stepped across the line from the supernatural to natural Adam says oh my god the Bible said Adam was not deceived how can you deceive the Spirit of God how did he hug you deceive the Spirit of God God was it out he was in God own image and it was not deceived when he did it he knew the condition she was in he knew what she had done he knew that she was gonna die with the serpent when God come now he won't burn her with the sûreté know what Brennan said before a 104 the Church of God with a burny with the siren and a Buddhist and Adam knew that God he knew that she was part of him Adam did not go walk out from behind the word just to say well I guess she didn't down their identity Adam walked out because he loved her he loved her she would hear she was bawling his mole she was she was appointed out of me she was mad Adam loved it was love it out of it it was showing his love he couldn't redeem her but he was willing to die with her he they she gonna die you've got gonna kill her he going to destroy me he kept them in the time to when he didn't cause it no way no way mother just me I love my son oh god Eddie come on the Z recon Avenue and God disco each he would have to describe him he loved her how do you say he made a decision he made a choice I'm going with my wife and God but same be sitting there Jesus man he loved us then he stopped across her into death the get us out it was all my friend of Dennis how they said when he did it he stepped out in time and there were he stepped out in time and then eternal life that he had in that mortal body hallelujah at mortal body it was lifted off him now he can feel what Dell feels now you go have to learn how to die hello he had to learn how to die hello you the pain begin to come forever beginning to come Hollywood's the signs of death how do you know the word so Adam had to learn that but in ER in the meantime Eve was pregnant it would only get to she was pregnant she had got pregnant he got his beasts God Kastner when he come down for that he did he cast his beasts how they turned him into a serpent and he put it in me between the scene of his beef and the seed of the woman he they you were never in this fall be able to come into the camera race like this again touch you now he turned into a snake and he moved on now God turn around look at the woman he's there because you did this because your desire was some of the spirit I said your husband he said I will let you know order for you to make it you want to be saying in childbirth and you were harder it be your desire had the people your husband Holly hitter World War II he had returned her desire these are her desires for something that was not the word that was God coming to return a husband but no matter cat for because I was on something else we had to go back to the word political Judas is here saying these are your desires should be to your husband Holly didn't work did he go to kill Adam he said now this is a different situation if I curse Adam quite the curse of myself and about Chris myself I'm not God so God now he says I had him for your sake I'm going to curse the ground honey but you'll see gonna go kiss the ground and thorns and thistles and bras and pain digit and about the sweat of the breath out your own when I sweat you got to eat from it he won't eat over to the day you'd return back into the dusted here for attaboy you taking dust you on dusty shepherd he begin to put this on now but the point of it when he cast her he does not only did he curse at us he comes to these sinners no matter which could be me and you every one of this boy we will be under the same curse we all come a nerve is how old I am how long have been standing there - your question you say what you try to tip you eating that bit dirty and when you die you turn right back to dirt and that dirt was right in the beginning he was something too old a thing that's on earth but you living here huh nothing old dirty do you think about it it was in the beginning in the Earthmen car Holly we cooked in the world we come to the world already on the curse the body was already under curse Helene under whistle from now when she did you sir he says these words I got a man from the Lord she really thought that she had received this blessing yeah the thing that was in her she thought it was of God but God said this is not my son I'm taking the blood test I'm gonna identify him the way they worship your worship would tell which what you come from hallucinate Jesus I'm gonna identify which one is my son by the revelation to worship hallelujah why you saved by worship hey people well we had try we shouted over that is not the way I'm talking about that worship God and know your position and cry how do you know what you watch because Gina told a woman and - well he knew you was you but you don't even know what you want you you must know what you want you me since I'm gonna identify you by worship I want to show you which one is my son by worship by the revelation of the right revelation will I tell you the way to watch everything so here know him okay he goes out he Braves the fruit of the ground holly breathe all his pain he overtook God and God said no way I would not accept this earthly Walford I already custard every day to come out early cutter all the food you eat is correct I love fruit you eat his curve I can't accept nut not curse it if we wouldn't curse you would not approve it it was I'm not gonna quit eating chicken don't care what nobody say I mean up you get around people not everybody here in this mess man I'm a help all you got to do eat the vegetables God never gave people vegetables he gave him meat he never told one person to go either Turner or cucumber I'll pick oh he's a go eat some meat so many people that believe in vegetarian Eagles but here we are praise God vegetarian Eagles on my mind but the point of it is he cursed earth and every day come out and so King Alfred was not sufficient for God to excel because it was under crash hey God's ain't no way I can accept it I refuse your sacrifice he said but Abel officer from Earth would an animal come from yes he did come from nerve but the revelation he hadn't come from the earth that was the dividend but not the beast that he slew come from the earth to beat that God's cold and we had come from here he didn't call them with fruits I don't ride that it was not covered him but he covered him with sunny covered him with blood he covered him with scared they left a present of God they were cold his skin had to go back into present of God we must go back with skin owners so Freddie's guys over there so here to able get some revelation he stakes a beach he slew it and blood was flying all over the place you know where it was man whatever he was doing but he couldn't go to slinging blood hit work but God looked down and he says that's it I respect it I respect you sir what was God respecting he was not respecting it's called a bird killed Hanuman he were respecting his foreknowledge how do we go here in the mind of God that was a lamb already slain before the foundation of the world that was blood that they were saved by he saw the blood anything that's a table and blood honey that's what we gotta be saved by today I don't get out holy you bear if you don't come through the blood of Jesus cut you cannot make it without the shedding of blood there's no remission was singing church praise God to both boys worship both boys both boys they tried their best but able by revelation able by revelation I'll get back today I got a lot of course I can read night but the wind I will just don't go cutting and look over the bank and you got a good teacher so brother but say I'm a brain here be able to break the holders down that alley then I'm makin I thought at all that Jim he just kind of here break it down but not want you to know sir would you - no sir - that curse that that that that curse right there it would go called it needed scheme God it needed God could not I want you to notice him God was too holy they come down God was so holy you couldn't even touch the mountain right but he needed a way he could feel what we feel how could he feel it and he was that only so the God had to do it himself when he touched the ground do you realize himself the body that he come here would like to be able to feel that crafty brunner he was not he was not born in sin go out the way wheel boy he took I'll say in the cat's let his world upon himself he took it so he could feel what you going that would've dealt with the whole thing for him to do this he cursed her so he could be able to come down because it won't take only thing they can go to hell with singing Hallelujah anyone ever say didn't know he had a trick laid up for him but guys aint go tell the devil every day but when I get doing everything he did he think he gonna win but I wasn't you know he already done lost the war huh he gonna look like he gonna win the war but he's already lost the battle is already won victory is already tough gonna go down here and stuff we realize him that we begin to realize huh so I'm gonna bring it to a point here because I'm gonna want to maybe try to leave bring this out before I leave so now the showdown we want to look at what we live here we realize here how we know which one of the sons of God or not how you know your son of God well I think so daring how you get to be a son of God so the guy has nothing to do with your thinking no way it's got to be a revelation from God how do you got about Revelation you would know where you come from and where you going honey the devil is defeated not by you by your revelation and what covered it up so we begin to realize here I don't know I could write you so many direction I'm jumping I keep going away but let me try to bring you down to the side look at this right here so now so we realized here so Satan moves me in the flesh k became the mystery of Satan revealed when you seen K you see Satan behind skiing he was a revelation but he could be accepted by God hallelujah he was and they were he had a desire to worship a human desire to worship don't please God it's a revelation honey so he had a human desire he tried his best he tried to be a good person he was a good Pharisee he was a good friend see there how about him God knew how to act it out but they didn't know how to worship they didn't know how to tap in and get revelation because revelation was not given by human ability revelation come by us supernatural inside of God he gave it to you you didn't get it on yo so now here he was so we realized and so now it was Godhead to come in and do the same thing same come do flesh by high breeding high breeding hybrid operating means built in the mingling of two different species that's how breathing I said you know we always have read will say a black and white mix inning in this net make hybrid that is not happening that's gorgeous hallelu because if we get with you know how you say any hybrid if it was how breathing how can a black man take his blood and give to white man he be in and white man taking blood but but God hey don't try to say I don't believe probably I put a bounce in here how do the reason I marry black because God made me black how do something I'm gonna saying this but I'm looking at like there some bad brother Toby say if you miss you go straight to hell under that's a lie how do you know every word you might have a little cartridge different but they don't see you the hell how do you show me if that decay Moses inhale Solomon Hill Hollywood you nobody idea huh well hi brady was mixing in Jewish media whether what Cain was have beast and have half human doctor brother say the truth of it he will have humor and Happy's when Mary had Jesus he was all human he loved human but he makes in the human race Holly was it was blessed becoming word and word will be coming slice so we gonna realize here so you needed a body himself so we know the story he needed her body he needed somebody need to manifest himself he'd he's skiing on him so he spoke the word he but realized he would the spoken word not not doing man cuz I he come to the word other he comes supernaturally through the word Holly another word mary had to believe the word to get pregnant Holly you got a bleed to receive the Holy Ghost I leave if I could ever get you to agree with the word it would kill your own nature it's hard the man concept to say this is mainly just look too mysterious no you need to believe it hellooo Gaga if your human mind could tap in on it you wouldn't need revelation honey so now we begin to go live him we realize he's a wild revelation because it's told away it's the only way you could be saved by revelation nor by by he said your new Berfield when you got a real revelation in a new birth here's a reveal to you who Jesus Christ the same yesterday the day available if your new birth don't reveal cheetah crime you're not born again either what I believe program was a prophet that gonna save you how do we got the blood of where Brandon did not go to calorie for you he putting you to Christ they are trouble with the word you know when you preach that people say will you turn the Prophet down no they probably got himself out of the way so you can see Christ I didn't and now he's the one got out of the way I'm a decrease so he good entry he realized I gotta be they cannot be told at the same time because your eyes will be on the best man and you would never see the word praise God somebody getting to realize here so now we begin to go through I praise God trying to find place to brain disease but let me just say this here say go there so now you know the story to Mary the Holy Spirit comes to Mary hellooo tell Mary she gonna be pregnant Holly Mary every human being she trying to thank ya I mean I see what you say Mary was not in doubt she was with a question the question was she didn't know me which everybody been born that way she was not crazy ha Lucy they never happened that way before so she didn't she was not doubting him she had a question for you she said how can these things be I mean I see what you're saying and I believe what you're saying but I don't understand how could it be I'm engaged to Joseph but me and Jordan had new each other yet that was she was saying how do you God said no marriages ain't gonna be of Joseph hey they gonna be up man he then a holy God would always shout at you and then holy Dana be your whoo will be the only go that's a holy go and always shouted to her and this sees when there they are and God made a couple is the same holy go Mary still you know she didn't really it was just too much tears he's all right man I said you're not getting this I'll see you not getting this up you know because she had to make a clear-cut decision is that ever just saw the holy go God Oh get the Holy Ghost to somebody that's in confusion I think I got it oh how about I can feel it no you don't need a feeling you need to believe it you ain't gonna feel like you're Christian you won't live a happier life not feeling like you're Christian but you got to have a revelation I am saved by the grace of Almighty God so now he says I gotta tell Mary Mary just what I needed to get down to her level God said this is too mysterious so he says this way this way she can understand I want you to know this yeah Mary at this time your cousin sister Dale it's Sammy Dale has got a baby become whole church is ready to vote brother sailor mouth whole churches get to come in target or brother you hear with this death day she prayed but Sammy believing and saying that we need to take a boat Nick Sunday hey everybody be ready take a vote Mary I mean if I didn't know better I brought that you put my boat into it just don't happen Elizabeth was too old to have a baby that one hate to say it this time Lisbon training with a child Mary knew and lizard burger get prayed it it was nothing too hard for God Cory did I work and got pregnant it no feelings at all just think revelation say you can seal the wound wish he believed in God said that's all I need you to do all I need you do is believe it honey so now now we write her and we don't laid it down to this was she was pregnant with the word halu Christ created the egg and blood Holly spoke it into her house Mary it beans and potatoes and put skin on it what she did she was skiing on it how about her eating show you how were you guys were you you and you're pregnant to see the mama don't eat the Sun the baby died but then she et begin the developments lol skiing on Holly don't work so Mary beginning either the thing that was already the ker hey the earth was cut now hello Jesus the logos of God he had behind ski free to message the mighty God unveiled God behind bag of skiing God human skin human curse but he was not that was your body helping my body laying and he neither sacrifice did he we go on here we begin to look at this thing right here so now this birth was so mysterious it was supernatural it took revelation and received this hallelujah in other words because Satan did not know what God was doing if he wouldn't do what God was gonna say you know he would not know what God was doing because he even put a question in Jones of mine that was not God to put them there Holly Jordan had a problem Joseph says me and she think I'm crazy the young girl to marry me now she got pregnant she goes no no no what I ain't read I'm gonna put away probably I don't want to see them kill her come he knew them Pharisee would have killed her it is I don't want to see them kill me I'm gonna put Mary away probably Holly because she I'm not doing huh I just get except she got pregnant and then she kind of hit me they had a history save the Roman Helen looking she went over got pretty bad rubber but God's angels don't you believe the word son this is the Holy Ghost then what God was talking about when he got those jokes ah you can see it but the devil never saw it that one ever saw this the devil thought they each they just can't be it because he thought if God come you come down he were to come down right no white horses hallelujah come down on white horses hello a band angels around him Satan wow that's him but he didn't come to what he thought it was how you think brother and preacher mr. guy here to reveal the simplicity the simplicity of God they blinded the devil you so much you say how you know you were blind what did is what did his father was say we not be born of fornication they were calling Jesus illegitimate because they could not bleed it was a supernatural child wholly sure he planning to mine at him now make a feint thinking in their mind oh but you think we crazy you think we crazy you and Joey got a little secret that we don't know about we know what it does that some work God he'd the third pool held a guy here what he doesn't got the devil with a knew who he was he wouldn't have never killed him he wouldn't never try to hit his son if Gina would kept living he's ain't gonna give exist if he would only knew who he was Satan had a question don't and still got a question who you is how do you go to question now it's just really the Bride of Christ I see all that mistake I see that they they do but you don't see whether he don't see that your name is written in heaven and to demarcate take that out so you realize here know what you he told Joseph don't you don't you free to take under he married our wife and then she get pregnant she got pregnant she going around testify I got a man from the Lord people going around saying children been tricked you hit me she was already pregnant I count the days I'm leaving I was at they waited people you know how people's is you get pregnant a boy you better be sure you do it right you bet you got your you gonna get married you better make sure your boyfriend is not living living a real holy lay coming everybody got calculators now she may not be pregnant she have it in June I know something else you ain't getting by the day with it when Gina was come on earth they were trying to do the same man trying to be God they knew that Jojo had Mary Mary yet they was not married so they had added up when she gonna have a baby tonight it just can't be they was not here but they but the point of it was she would tell somebody there is the Challenger King if the only goes over shouting hey man you think we created a holy why y'all people like the way y'all do hell is the Holy Ghost Hey yes so be gone Lagoon the same thought he would so now remember Jesus in ever type ever type if he break one type of being a lamb the whole whole message of the lamb is marked it is no good so ever type had to be a lamb when John man mo not coming in the river he didn't say behold behold the dog he said behold the lamb how they behold the lamb of God to take away the sins of the world he had to be a lamb it had to be washed honey it had to be a purpose sacrifice so say didn't know what he was dogs are bad it was working for the good it looked bad when they with the every house knocking on the door you got any work for us to have this baby never I said nope we ain't Bobby it looks inside when you read in Scripture there was no room for them in here it should have been a room it was God hidden simplicity there was not their repeat yeah God loves seem to put it in their heart not let him come here trying to drive them kind of stable cuz of lamb is in a stable it was God all the time upon his message that would look a few Satan Satan even the king of King born in a man just keep see this no you don't foresee this how do you God would hear the simplicity holiday and any comedy come out how do what you think st. with telling Jesus thing like there if thou be the Son of God that wouldn't for you that was inevitably he were trying to prove it get him [Music] turn these stones into bread he would try to figure out who Jesus is Jesus use your power let me see you use your power to do this buta son of God if you were really just some guy turn these stones into bread what was he doing he was trying to get Jesus to obey his voice Jesus would have done it do you see that something God wouldn't never listen to me but jesus knew the voice of God he said it is written yeah why don't you try me man should not live by bread alone but by every word never seen at a time ago whoa how can you get him tried a let me try this I get noticed from the work if he's God if thou be the Son of God cast ourself down him for me would not he give us angels charge concerning me what I was saying doing this cuz Satan knew that the angels of God would be a comfort around here he knew that he was not crazy he knew they was Ryan God 24/7 lady he said you said how you know the angels of God when Gina were hanging on the cross they was standing out leaves is angel ready to turn this world upside down he the hold your peace I got to go to the car by myself hold your peace they would have turned it upside down Satan was trying to see him nudists when that he'd give his angels charge concerning the accept that - I think it's tough to say it is written don't you tell me the LORD thy God see to me he's still testifying he's God he didn't change his testimony so st. say well how do you way he went to play the god thing I am personally to God he just wouldn't get him all the time to him personally he changes herself impersonate God the God he came on a high mountain did he speak to him as he was a God if that would fall down and worship me now he's taking this position that he can't claim he won't it die fall down and worship the wish it was to get sell his birthright over to the devil that was to give his birthright to the devil and to fall down and worship the devil he would had to give over his birthright to it he said I will fall down and worship me I give you the kingdoms of this world and here it looked as though he was God but Gina knew his position in the world he's I will Washington LORD thy God and him only what was that that was the body speaking to the spirit praise God praise God you see what God said Jesus realized here he realized here that's the way he will try st. out here Shane says her he wanted God to worship him in one form of the other but the very you can't deceive the very elect cannot DC the very leg so gasps ibid he was the most powerful showdown that Jesus had and all of come now he gonna go to the cross when the spirit the anointing of God that's left now you're gonna go as with me but you ain't still in the inside so he goes to the cross he goes to Gethsemane as a man singing realize I'm gonna walk over his mind I'm gonna let him and he know what the sting of Defense the bees buzzing around his head he's trying to make a decision for his wife like a demain for his wife that we just saw was about it was a love affair it's a book of Jesus's living yourself out again through Christ hallelujah it was a decision had to be made I had I made a decision I love my wife I'm going to die for gas remedy was the same act going played Jesus and gas hit me making the decision and he tried to eat a head around some with human reasoning human of a human idea he's old God it's wet them blood vessels brushing blood coming from his sweat gland Oh God if it be possible let this cup last he doesn't wear a knee was any more he said it twice Oh God if it be possible let this cup pass but the descending one and inside the word roller say not as I will but and I will what would he do he made a decision I'm going to die for my wife ordinary table bag it will not take him divert and he made the decision to die for you we ought to make a decision to live for him he made the decision I'm gonna die for you we need to make a decision in a heart Lord I'm gonna live you holiday where he made additional died when he did that he already died Jesus didn't down the cross he died when he made the decision he walked out as a man to die for his wife he could take his way back how do we know where so now we begin to look at this thing right here here he was he goes out now Satan goes are in that same still could not steal he thinking he still testified he said he's God volunteer would I proved it in God by the time I get to beating him with this this the catenin this I'll tell you what I forgot today you called it cannon and tear did you ever see him the thing that beating we it was glass it was metal it was all why does Satan beat him like that he took 39 stripes Satan was intended for Jesus to bleed out but he could it blood didn't come from me sell break another blood sale because he should have died from the loss of blood but he didn't die from the loss of blood the blood of Jesus out he should had already died before he went the calorie but would you know you cannot kill him he said no man to take my life no man could make me bleed out I come from cotton-eye walking back to God his blood created blood to the devil you put him on the cross he thank you dear and this is Satan would only knew he shoulda realized something took place the way he didn't beat this man we're just man is gonna blade he's still gonna sing sure to realize it's something about this man is different right honey but he was just too dumb to see it he determined well I'll just get rid him from once involved they put him on the cross on the cross Jesus was dead dying but coming out his body blood run across his brow from the thorns it's a bloody mess his balls was reject push God turned this son everything down cuz he can't look on singing your sins was hanging on the cross and the show it didn't it so deform the body of Jesus counselor ever spirit will attack that body he was down for you so by His stripes you could say devil be how do you know where he would take it he was Lutheran he would go get her Brian revelation and take power over sicknesses but we are scared of taking a leap till around this is what God won't we be no regard I want you to be he wants you to accept what the word said about you it's hard for human reasoning said I'm here when we don't feel him oh sure went whole different ways on this goalie right here am i way to close out with this one so yeah sorry go go there and he goes on here on my chin nose here so he played out he he body is getting weak now remember he could not man could not kill Jesus man never killed Jesus Jesus I bother I guess forgive my spirit in that I had he the one who submitted his spirit now why we didn't look to the cross I rely we say it was God all the time hiding behind Christ oh you live he's standing he's hanging on the cross let's think about this it was two things hung there just think about what was going on good dave was wanting to humiliate him so bad they script all his clothes off him beat him they form this body all kind of weight bones out of place out of socket everything pain it's crushing pain he's in his body and Jesus the man breathe it's all he had to do is say to give my spirit in your hands just think about this know two things that man not even church guys street boys party - spilling robbing drinking and everything else but all of a sudden the devil was on the cross with him still on the cross trying to see a miracle if not be the Son of God come off the cross where he look here do you realize if I had to take a miracle for him to come off the cross even even because he was already kneel down to the cross that loosen this come off he's gonna say let me see something supernatural you've got me the Sun God come on the cross save us this save yourself save yourself you save us in the subtle thing says man you got your mind you know for a God wait a minute wait a minute we got a problem why would he be wearing that who fear God both of them was dying and going to hell both I'm ain't been doing that for God but still in the robbing and whatever they did but here he was talking to this other man man you don't forgot he think we deserve what we did now he realized I'm a sinner I deserve to go to hell but this man he know he can be going to church he ain't done nothing to deserve this where did that come from that was his revelation that's what God saw him before the world ever beginning halu death was part of God that was responding back to God Holly did he did all of a sudden an inspiration at a dead rat he departed were you coming to your Cana would you remember me right would you remember me he recognized Christ right now cries gotta recognize him honey cuz he died remember he's beating his breathing and everything he freeze warning surrender and give her sever he was thinking down he said would you remember me he sucked that light body right back up yes this day you'll be with me in paradise he pulled light back in you to speak to that Center on the cross he put his life he did not release it like just day you'll be with me in paradise didn't hear Allah is finished it is finished I give my sweet in your hands Lord he surrender and meet his spirit with the God his body went to the great and his soul Saint made a mistake dear we made a big mistake oh you realize where he went do you rely witty with the hell Satan it already lost the war the battle was already why he went to hell people we walk around like we'd losers we already don't want I don't care how you play the tape back you always want I'll see Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier in it look if no Joe Frazier beat him but when I played the tape back Muhammad leave one make it look when the table pay but we already wanted to walk he goes down to do what they take the keys of death and hell yes inhale and conquered death and hell been conquered he took the keys what you mean he took the keys he took the keys of death and hell so what you trying to say I'm trying to say Satan a big kicked out his own house halu eating got no place to go right native woman back and forward in the earth had calling all this fighting and culture and all the perversion in the world ain't got nowhere to go but he will meet his evening Holly will meet with the keys in his head he covered epigram in the hell and we are we are we are we're here we died with him we're over here now in the second heavenly places here in the world of eternal life here what God did well here with Christ be immerse old people that will tell you right now this revelation right here is the most powerful revelation of Jesus Christ ever scrubbed up if Jesus Christ is not revealed to the whole book you missed the whole revelation how love would you notice this here the question is where people's today what do I need to do to receive this eternal been the question simple question simple solution repent is it that's easy no it ain't that ain't
