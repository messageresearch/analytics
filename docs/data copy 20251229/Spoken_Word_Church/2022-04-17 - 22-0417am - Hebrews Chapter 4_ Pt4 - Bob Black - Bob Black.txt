========================================

god bless you thanks good to be in the house of the lord let's just pray before we get into our study lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather into your around your word this morning and gather together with other believers of light precious faith and we just ask lord that you'll just bless the services today lord god and be with us as we study these scriptures out we ask this in your name amen so if you've got your bible we've been studying and uh going through hebrews chapter four and we're uh we've been been talking about rest and uh hebrews chapter four verse one says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left left us of entering into his rest any abuse seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest so we're laboring in it to enter into enter into christ's rest and you know rest is a good picture to maybe to set in your mind is to think about rest is christ jesus is laying in that in that boat asleep and this is kind of a you can't quite see it but they're trying to they're trying to wake jesus up in this boat and all the storms of life all around him are raging and and yet he's asleep because he's calm and you know he knows he knows he's uh rest really is is a revelation a personal revelation of jesus christ a personal revelation of what your purpose is and you know think about jesus laying there in that boat knowing that that how he's what he's got to do what his purpose is that he's got to die on the cross and and he's got you know got some more preaching to do so he's at rest think about david at rest going up against goliath knowing that he had been anointed by samuel um but this arrest that we're talking about is is the rest that comes by the baptism of the holy ghost and and to to think about you know we want to just kind of meditate on what is what are the effects of the baptism of the holy ghost in your life and one of the effects of course is to to cease from your own works and and and that god will reveal himself to you and that rest is that you're not resting on the things that you do or the things that that you you think about in your intellectual mind but you're resting on a revelation of the revealed of the promises of god so jesus jesus gave us a promise of rest when he said in matthew chapter 11 come unto me all you that labor under heavy laden and i will give you rest and the last few uh little lessons we were just kind of uh just kind of looking examining that pattern of labor before you get to rest and you know in the pattern that we look at sanctification you can look at sanctification as is like you're laboring you're going through that process and like like an ox with a burden you're you're pulling the heavy load and you're trying you're packing that word in and going to church and doing the things that uh you know it looks like a christian would do but you haven't yet entered into rest because you're laboring to a place where god god opens up the word to you and you're resting on what he said and and compare that with the stages of ruth where you know brother brown said in revelation chapter five in that message he said what ruth under justification and ruth under sanctification laboring a legalist and then she finally ended up resting where she she laid down at the feet of boaz and boaz threw that threw his skirt over a type of the baptism the holy ghost and all she had to do from that point on was she said and she she knew that when boaz got up he was gonna he was gonna go to work all she had to do was just rest and trust in him so you know we we follow that type of the of justification sanctification of the baptism the holy ghost where the the lutherans believed it by faith and come into the land and the methodists taught sanctification which was the legalistic standpoint of it so you got to do something i got to quit i got to let my hair grow out said the women of course they wouldn't they don't do it no more but they did do it something legalism sanctification something something that you're doing you're working through they had to work quit wearing the paints in their faces they didn't wear their skirts wrong or short like the others did they had to do something see that's what she did the state of justification the state of sanctification and again down at the bottom right you can see the little the little picture of that ox because you know when you think of sanctification you think of that labor of the ox the ox spirit it's the the the spirit of christ working to do something in your life to bring you to a place and of course we examined last time legalism is when we base our justification on our own law keeping so so again comparing comparing working versus rest you you when you're in that sanctified state you start looking at the things that you do and you say well maybe i'm maybe i'm good maybe this is good enough but you legalism is when we base our justification on our own law keeping rather than on the finish work of christ what he did legalism exists when people attempt to secure righteousness in god's sight by good works looking at what you're doing looking at the thing you know i'm paying my tithes i'm coming to church i'm you know i believe i believe the bible that is true and and you say well that's good enough but yet you haven't entered interest yet legalists believe that they can earn or merit god's approval by performing the requirements of the law that's why in philippians chapter two you know where you're well there's labor before rest and philippians chapter 2 says wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure in that in that a kind of almost a paradox that you got something to do but it's christ doing doing it the work in you christ and you together in second peter chapter one that that talks about that going up the statue of a perfect man give diligence to make your calling in election sure in other words there's something that you got to do you got to open up your bible and spend time with god and make set aside time for him you know there's things that happen automatically but there's part things that you have to do as well for if you do these things you shall never fall do what add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge add to your knowledge temperance and and there's so there's something you got you you have to be convinced that it's true you have to be you have to make yourself available to god so give diligence means to give careful and persistent work or effort constant and effort to accomplish something there's that ox again laboring you're laboring trying trying to get from point a to p to point b persevering attention like like diligently searching through the through through like a filing cabinet for something or let's say the word of god diligently searching like the bereans did to see if these things be true when you hear something preached it seems a little bit perplexing or whatnot you you want to you want to find out if it's right or not constant and effort and jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest of course now that this rest is you you you when you're sanctified you're you're laboring and you're in that state of trying to get to a place where you can rest but then christ said that he would give you rest and to take his yoke upon you so that you you could become yoked with him and you know last time we talked about how you can you you know you you think about it if you've ever had to um uh you know the brothers if you ever had to do some kind of heavy lifting or something move a car or push something heavy with a lot of others and maybe there might be one that's not doing their their work and just kind of just kind of acting like it well that's really how it is when you're yoked with christ you look over and you're yoked with him and he's really the one that's pulling all the load because you're yoked with him that's why he says take my yoke upon you and learn to me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light when you get yolked with him now now it's like the cross is lying now to take up your cross and follow me now it becomes a whole lot easier because you're doing it because now you're in love with him and he's revealing his word and you know what your purpose is and you know why you're coming to church and it's not just that you're going through the motions and things but the the word has become alive where it used to be it just was dead works but now it's a living christ in you and it's you and christ together that's why now brother branham and the message desperations he said the token we've talked to the token all the way along now what's the token is the baptism of the holy ghost the lutheran's allowed it to accept in the word accepting christ as personal savior when you get happy enough to shout that's it the pentecostal says speak in tongues then you got it and we find out that all of it was wrong see the token is the token it's you and christ as persons together see us the holy spirit his life in you working his own life through you and that's that's the rest that we're talking about this morning where you know that christ has got you and you got him and you're you're all wrapped in up up together and in that day you shall know that i am in you and you and me and i'm in the father we're all one brother said in christ the mystery of god revealed he said you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it because something's been changed in your soul to take the desire away just to make you live it to make you be able to walk it you're yoked with him now now you're yoked with him my yoke is easy yoked with christ which is with with his word and i do only that which is pleasing to the father he said if you can believe that i am he then believe the word and then so now you're yoked with him and you you labor a little bit differently that's why first corinthians it says we are laborers together with god now now you're laboring to build to to build build yourself up to to to to build up let the word be built up within you now you're laboring that uh preachers labor and preaching the gospel people in church labor that the word can be packed in in their life and come to a place of maturity first corinthians chapter four labor and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it in first corinthians 15 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was in me which was with me see there it is paul's laboring but yet not i the grace of god is god in christ as one in a man in man working like like that type of yoke yourself with christ and you've got christ in himself and you and in colossians 1 29 he said where unto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily so there we've got that type of of of you labor to get enter into his rest and then you begin laboring some more and then you come up to come up to maturity to come to up to a place where god can can begin opening up the seals and things to you which is why in second peter he says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith giving all diligence but now when after the the little call of baby form sanctification you come to a place where you're resting in god's promise and what he said and it's a you're resting not in something that you did but in what christ did on the cross you're resting resting in the finished work of what god did on the cross so if god if the bible says that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities then you can rest on that that you can rest that there's a promise of healing if the bible says in psalms that that don't forget all the benefits you can rest that there's benefits in the bible if the bible says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and there's a promise of the baptism the holy ghost you can rest in that so what we're doing we're not resting in a feeling or a sensation or something we're arresting what christ said that's what charles spurgeon said when he said if you rest on the finished work of jesus you have already the best evidence of your salvation in the world you have god's word for it what more is needed what more do you need in what then god said it so now if you go back and examine what what uh what brother ram taught and and you know when everything that brother brown said he would tie back to scripture everything that he said you can take take back to the word and when when he began to talk about rest as he was preaching the hebrews chapter four series or hebrews cherry series he would go back to the old testament to to identify what that rest is in isaiah 28 and it might be a little bit small to see so i apologize for that but just maybe maybe just listen as we read through this but you think about think about how many places and what a strange thing it is in the old testament and in the old testament in ezekiel 36 and isaiah 28 and joel it talks about something that was going to come the baptism the holy ghost but yet they they could not attain to this yet in the old testament but this scripture isaiah 28 and ezekiel 36 and joel was all those things that they talked about were fulfilled on the day of pentecost when the baptism in the holy ghost came now listen listen to how isaiah describes the rest that we're talking about the rest whom shall he teach knowledge how's rest going to come and whom shall he make to understand doctrine because listen when you when you understand the doctrine that's us that's something you can hang your hat on you can hang your soul when you have a revelation of jesus christ when the word opens up and and the picture becomes clear that's something you can rest on whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts and brother brown would say you know things like see not not little babies god wants us to get a get us to a place he wants us to position us to where we can understand deep teaching you know i think that's what you know maybe maybe examine ourselves this morning do we want the word eagles eagles want the word because the word is what is going to bring you your rest right for precept must be upon precept you see we quote this a lot of times but maybe maybe this morning just think about this in the context of that is your rest precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line up online hear a little very low for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people i think about that i was fulfilled on the day of pentecost to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they will not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept lying upon line line upon line to hear a little and their little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken how would you be snared because because the word comes just a little bit here a little bit there and people get confused about things it looks like some in some places the word contradicts itself but when the revelation comes everything fits together just like for example matthew 28 19 looks like it contradicts acts 2 38 but when when it come when the spirit reveals itself like reveals the word just like it was revealed on the day of pentecost when peter came bolton out of that upper room and said this is that and begin to identify the correct way to be baptized not in the name of titles not in titles but in the name of jesus christ because he had a revelation of who jesus christ was you see how you see how you can be baptized wrong because you don't know who it is you're being baptized how to be baptized but to know who jesus christ is give you the correct way to be baptized to go down in the water in the name in the name of the father son and holy ghost which is jesus christ and so that's that's rest that's rest this is the rest where whether you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing and seeing that are refreshing when you have confidence in what you believe and not to be confused not to go around wandering from this post to this post from this church to that church but to know what you believe you know what a precept is as a general rule intended to regulate behavior or thought and as we were studying on wednesday night and the greatest battle ever fought brother adam was talking about how that when you receive the word these little precepts align upon line it actually opens up a channel between you and god for his spirit to work through you and so as you receive these word and you the word the word goes forth and you say i believe that then because god will not violate your free will he won't override your free will so he wants you to accept it and when you accept it it allows him to begin to operate in your life that's why in romans chapter 12 it says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god and so you as you receive the word the word is actually transforming your thinking and transforming your actions and transforming the way the way that you behave and renewing your mind and i've got this like this little ladder that's going up to kind of show that as you add line up online it's taking you higher and higher into a relationship with christ precept upon precept so brother branham said he said now what's the sabbath the sabbath rest not not a day that we set aside anymore but the new testament sabbath is a perpetual resting in christ because he sent his holy ghost into the church to give you an understanding to give you peace to give you a peace in a time of trouble just like jesus in that boat when the winds were rocking it but yet he was resting and who he knew he was and what his purpose was he was resting in the promise of god not worldly knowledge but spiritual knowledge who shall he teach knowledge as isaiah 28 says whom shall he make understand doctrine oh bless god our organization don't believe this they wouldn't put up with that as many of the organizations say today but if you can find somebody that will accept god's word they'll be able to enter into god's rest what does god's word say about it oh well our pastors you know are educated oh sure certainly got so much education they left god out of it truly for you can tell them the word and they'll walk around and say well i don't believe it just that way so you can see how the sabbath rest does not come by education education is like like cane that sitting there would buy education education say well i know how i need to get my offer i'm going to bring up some fruit of the fields i'm going to bring some grapes and some stuff that i've harvested but that was that's what you get with education so it doesn't come by by just somebody just laying out things so that you know it's maybe maybe plain by intellectual understanding but it comes by a revelation because abel saw what it really was by revelation what what what had happened in the garden and he come up there with a lamb and offered a bloody sacrifice because he had a revelation and that's what he was resting in a revelation of what his purpose was and how to get back how to get back to god it was revealed to him and brother adam said in the christ the mystery god revealed he said remember the sabbath day keep it holy one day in the week now he magnified it the rest comes from keeping the spirit of god precept upon precept and lying upon the line here little and there little hold fast that was good for with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and that is the rest that's the refreshing from the presence of the lord and yet they would not hear it and wagged their heads and walked away for their denominations in that exactly what they did when jesus was on earth with the pharisees and sadducees they didn't want they hear the things the deep things that jesus was saying like except you eat my flesh and drink my blood or i and my father are one they didn't want to hear all that so they wanted to stay with their their denominational idea but when truth comes truth comes if you'll receive it it's a real rest what is the holy ghost brother graham priest in 1959 he said somebody keeping a sabbath day i'm not rejecting or making light of anybody's church or religion but said the sabbath day the sabbath of god was the rest day here's the rest day this is the rest he said that you cause the weary to rest it'll be precept upon precept lying upon line there's the rest what is the holy ghost the rest come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i'll give you rest how because you get yoked up with christ and he starts pulling the labor hit by the burden he's the one doing all the work for you what what does that mean he's the one that changes your desire to dress differently to look differently to not look like the world he takes away that desire to drink and smoke and all that stuff that you used to do and and and to address like uh like a barbarian and changes you changes your nature and now you're yoked with him and what used to be a labor is now a pleasure because you're in love with christ what is he the one that comes in you gives you peace your sign your comforter comforted at rest sealed it's a sign the world knows something's happened to you what is it a seal you're at rest if something happens to you there's something there to make an advocate for you right quick see making intersections it's the spirit of god living in the church prophesied exactly what it would be when it come it would be an everlasting eternal rest because this rest is something that nobody can take away from you once god gives it to you it's there forever what is the new birthing and brother ram said in christ the mystery god revealed you'd say well brother brown what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place whether you get sick whether you have a bad day at work whether things are going rough whether your family leaves you and deserts you well no matter what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth and the musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll stop on this note when ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promises of god we have the earnest now of our salvation we're not worried whether we're going over there or not we're going god promised it and we've got the earnest all we have to do is just wait we have the earnest of it right now waiting for the time that when he comes back when you got that rest all you got to do was wait on god to fulfill his word and we'll stop there [Applause] you
