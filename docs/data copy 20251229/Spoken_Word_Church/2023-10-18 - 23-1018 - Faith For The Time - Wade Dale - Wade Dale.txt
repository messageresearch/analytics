========================================

the first thing you look around a dad isn't there no more that's exactly right it's coming and we don't know what time but the thing it is when it's over then it's over and there's nothing else you can do about it amen you say I've heard that a long time but you're going to your your last time amen that's right it's going to happen because it's the word of the Lord and remember has it failed any time through these eight nights that I've been preaching but what what Jesus said here has come to pass and done every Church age Justice exactly and we see this church age right into it and at the very hour even this morning and typ in the virgins the very time that the sleeping virgin now remember the Bible said that the sleeping virgin when the crow went out behold the bridegroom coming the coming of the Lord the preaching of the word and then what happened the time is at hand atomic bombs and everything ready the preachers run into the streets and begin to scream the message and it seems to do the big church s the sleeping virgins said oh well we've been presbyter a long time maybe we would study and find out yes you know I believe we do need the Holy Ghost and they're writing pamphlets and everything about it now starting out and they said uh uh would you give us some of it and they said no we just got enough for ourselves so when they went to get the Holy Ghost went to pray up like the churches the big fine churches are doing today the organizations when they went to get the orl the bridegroom amen amen so they're trying to get it right now great churches organizations great International meetings about it in the in the organized churches saying we got to get back to the Pentecostal blessing we got to have Divine healers in the church we got to have speakers with tongues we got to have interpreters of tongues we got to have all these spiritual gifts in our church and we're just going to have start meetings and start doing it they're getting counsil started to do it while they're gone to do that it's at that very time yes that the bridegroom come and got those who had the arm their lamps and went away then they come and what happened they were cast into outer Darkness the Great Tribulation period where there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth amen while the bride is in heaven oh my then at the end of that three and a half years he will come like Joseph did and make hisself knowing to his Brethren it'll cause a weeping all over and they'll say they'll separate their families and weep and and say where'd you get them scars and and Pierce the ones that pierced him she'll see him and you'll make your known to his brother now he's trying to make himself known to his church and they pushed him outside and he's still

for the time let's bow our heads Lord Jesus tonight we commit all things to you Lord we commit ourself we commit the congregation all of our minds our hearts Lord to be centered toward one thing and that's Lord to see your quick and Swift return and see the quick and Swift Return of the saints that have gone on Lord that if you have preserved in the sixth Dimension father according to the prophet he went there and saw him Lord we believe it 100% because we we know that there's a place for a Christian to go and that's where she went Lord this morning about 2:00 a.m. father I pray that You' just be with the family and bless them sister Genie sister Tootsie and all the different ones it's uh um the son they Joseph and Lexi different ones Lord we pray that you'd be with them take care of them Lord just hug them like you can hug Lord and just love them like you can love father we ask you just be with us now in the fur of this service good to have their visitors and brother John and sister M with us Lord we we sure you know we love them with the love of the Lord and we sure appreciate you sending them down they want to visit that too so we we sure appreciate that and also be with brother Danny del mundo he just sent a text and he's coming um the Lord he's coming uh Friday I think Lord and just be with him and bless him he's not coming to preach but he's coming to visit brother Dale so we all love they all love brother Dale brother George Quinn had a wonderful time lord we appreciate that that you give him that time to be with him too father just be with us now in further service Jesus name we pray amen Hebrews 11 vers1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand now look through faith through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you may be seeing the Lord at his Blessing if you'll remember several years ago brother Joe Green was preaching here and he preached a sermons called now faith we need a now faith we need a faith for the time right they had a faith before they had a faith before now there's a faith for this time we have to have rapturing faith no one else has had to have rapturing faith but the end time bright all right and if we say some things that are strange just bear with us we believe God sent a prophet according to Malachi 4 and we're we're going to quote him and we believe him and and we build all of our um Faith Around Jesus Christ but we did need a prophet because we had so many differences and and you know denominations and and a lot of things of this baptism and that over there and this over here but everything was brought together I Believe by seventh angel messenger all right so we we appreciate U we appreciate God sending us one he s to me behold I sent you Elijah the prophet he sent him to me right I don't know about you you got to believe that he sent him got was sent to you too right so let's look at this word faith faith means Fidelity faithfulness now look the character of one who can be relied on when you say even in your public life and your private life you you put Faith in things now I know sometimes our faith gets torn down because we do put our faith in stuff and and it falls apart or we put Faith in a person and that person falls apart all right but you better put your faith in Jesus Christ cuz he never has fell apart never will fall apart come on somebody we're going to preach tonight we're not going to teach a little bit you're going to to say Amen somebody got have to say it I'll say it myself so the character of one who can be relied on so we come tonight relying on that Jesus Christ will be here to tell us something all right through a five-fold Ministry all right so the word substance means that's which which actually exist that exists that's tangible that is a substance so faith is the substance or the evidence right here a real being a substantial sustain substantial quality nature of a person or thing look watch this the steadfast fastness of what mind firmness courage that's what we're going to talk about a little bit about a battle in just a few minutes the steadfastness of Mind firmness courage resolution confidence firm trust and Assurance that's faith is all these things but now you got to Center your faith in something am all right like I said before you put in politics put it in government I work for the government I work for the post office please don't put your faith in you get in your mail on time praise the Lord Lord anyhow but anyway but anyway um we need to put our trust and faith in Jesus Christ and that God did send us a prophet he did send us an end time message that we Believers and that's why we call Believers because we believe it all right now just for a minute I want to talk to you a second when we get into this but let's talk a minute about the U um social media and family just for a minute um I know most of you know that we were on WhatsApp last night and this morning and just to make everything to be covered over as a church we need to make sure we have all of our fact straight number one and then make sure that uh cuz we know all most of us all knew know what happened that that that a sister found out that her sister had died through social media that's not good listen even the even the even the siners out there in NBC CBS and ABC they won't release a name until what the next of Ken has been told right the government will say all right we had so many deaths and they'll come to your door if you're in the army or navy or Marine they'll come to your door right brother John brother John was in the military they'll come to your door and they will not let it be known anywh other way you're not going to get a letter you're going to get a person that's going to tell you so and so of your family or what more passed away all right is everybody with me so let's just be sensitive to that all right and make sure that all the family knows before we start posting things all right uh I would suggest that maybe if you wanted to I know I got a private WhatsApp or an email from um sorry text message from someone and that's the way probably it should be if you want to text maybe maybe me and and and then let me say okay we can present this uh I mean you can have a family member tell you yeah but remember church family is church family I know we're tighter than most families are all right I understand that but remember when it comes down to Brass tax when it comes down to the rubber meets the road we don't make the decisions for the family as far as burial as far as singing songs as far as who's going to do the funeral right we don't do that because that's family blood relative family all right so let's let the blood relative know and make sure they know first how would you like to find out wake up at 6:00 this morning and look on the news and found out your wife got killed in the car W last night see and listen nothing was done I talk to a lot of people so not what is nothing's done maliciously nothing was done to harm anybody but let's just stop just for a second and ask them one question has all the family blood family been told it's all you got to do or you can just if you find out about it send me a text all right we're all on text we're all on WhatsApp I have and you we can do a private WhatsApp but just bring it to one person that way that the sister won't find out that the sister passed away by social media that just it's just not good okay she was very highly upset this morning when I talk to her so um just keep that in mind um we want listen this is Information Age I social media is just here to stay we just got it even in Idaho there's social media may not be as much but there social media all over the place so just I know we got a church family I know it but we got natural blood family and we have to respect the blood family first right the mama the daddy the brothers the sisters we have to respect that and and and you have to respect that and you may sit in your mind and go why in the world did they do but that's not not your business okay it's not your business it's not it's the family all right so just leave it at that be careful with social media be careful when it comes to a tragedy now for prayer or for a baby being born or something like that yeah that's not going to harm anybody but a tragedy or something like that let's please just kind of either like funnel it through me like I said or or or or make sure the questions asked does all the family know yet okay so because look one more thing I was thinking about this morning um the process of grief everybody Grieves different some cry some are totally silent some get real you know they get over in a corner and and and then then they have their big cry or are some don't cry at all so grief is processed in a different way as a Christian we shouldn't grieve as much come on that's right the Bible tells us I read it it brother how's funeral the Bible tells us to Rejoice at the death of a saint we got it backwards we rejoice when the kids born and cry when somebody passes it's supposed to be totally opposite now I'm telling you that's the Bible that's not good news for Modern Men that's the scripture tells us to Rejoice I Rejoice this morning you know why because I said hey I I know that Freda I've known her since she was my first girlfriend I know most y'all know that but she was we were 14 13 14 years old so we've known each other all our life pretty much but she's had a hard life but she's she's faithful at church she's faithful to her F real really faithful to her family but I thought Lord he's one thing for sure you know the Bible tells us and brother Brown tells us that Christians don't die ain't that right come on Christians don't don't die you already died if you're born again tonight you're already dead you died in Christ if you're already dead brother John you can't die again so sister Freda didn't die she just got out of that she just got out of that shell she was in that was full of cancer and hurting and pain and Agony and when she stepped over into that other dimension I'm sure they brother Brown told us he said I'm just going to preach for a minute get off my notes for a second but but brother R said that that God would send somebody down to the river that you know praise God cuz you know what you've never done this before you never died this like this before you never passed from this life into the next life all right right so it's going to make it a lot softer if through that fog her sister Becky died many many years ago long Jo how long Lord I many 40 years ago 30 years ago brother Brown said he saying somebody down there that you know so you've got everybody that was in her life all the way but Becky was her blood sister and she died of cancer years and years ago so there she was standing at the river she said come on say this is what you have been waiting on this right here is what you've been waiting on you're not going back you're going to stay right here for a little while then we all going to go back when we all get out of the way we're going to go back they're going to go back come back here and I tell you one thing for sure and I love this now the Bible talks about are the death angel we s we talk about the death you know death knocking at the door and you talk about death angel well now if a Christian can't die who who comes and gets you when you pass from this life into the next life who comes against you the death angel I don't think so cuz he goes against dead people right so I'm sure the death angel though like well I I got to go down to the hospital there and pick this lady up all of a sudden a man steps into the picture glowing white beautiful he said hey I'll take care of this one amen this one's mine this one's mine I'm Michael I own this place this one's mine Death Angel you just make you just go go get some of them other people this one's mine she accepted me years ago so we're I'm going to help her across I just the way I just that's the way I see it listen remember there's more going on in the other dimension than they are here amen like right now fighting and everything they're going on right now in your mind in mind but the process of grief should be softer as a Christian we should sure we're going to miss her sure we're going to miss all of our loved ones but remember we still got to fight if you're in a battle we're in a battle and I'll read it later on we're in a battle the battle that we're in brother John you were in the war you you don't just stop because one person dies right you got to move on you got to press Paul said press toward the mark of the high calling I got a goal to meet I got some where I got to go if you don't know Jesus Christ tonight that death angel will come and get you and I'll promise you he will not be nice he'll take you in another place just as sure as I'm standing here but if you got to baptis of the Holy Ghost Michael I believe Michael come get you cuz you're part of Michael anyway he's going to say Hey you my family I'm taking you right on in all right don't worry about this oh there's a sting but Paul said death where's your sting grave where's your Victory so let's look just a second before we get started and I know somebody's had uh some people have had questions concerning faith and and and let's just talk his family tonight I guess but we think that well why are all these things happening do we not have faith why are these things happening to us why are the why is this happening why is that happening well let's look at the life of a prophet now we know William Brandon was a prophet he was a holy ghost filled believer a preacher and had a message for the end time for me and you all right everybody with me all right so you would think in our human mind that God would you know he just like step in a room and all the stuff just like I said before you know when you get born again you still get bills yeah still got to make payments groceries still cost a lot more now than they did okay but your battle is not that your battle is what here it's not flesh and blood it's here it's inside right so brother Brandon was a prophet now here's a prophet coming down and he disobeys what God Said right hoping Sharon Rose paid the price come on and every prayer you talk about a man that would stand there and pray for people every night and see them get healed also the stomach issues that he had and I'll read it here just real quick for years he had that stomach issue he'd pray for the sick he'd see cancers fall off people he'd see blind eyes open he'd see deaf ears I'm talking about miracles I'm not talking about just maybe miracles after miracle and he'd go home and be throwing up he couldn't even eat that's a paradox that would be that would drive me crazy but did the death of his wife and child stop him one second no he said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and he walked out and he preached until 1965 when the Lord took him home and he never stopped some of us would stop roll over play dead whatever also having the stomach issue I read this right here I found this in 1950 brother R said sometimes when I go up in the mountains I have a picture of the audience I set it down maybe by the side of a tree and just kneel and pray and pray and pray God will heal them and it's to my interest my I like to see people get well no one can enjoy appreciate good health any more than I do when I've spent much time been very very sickly in my young days one infirmity especially bothered me was was stomach trouble for years I've drank barley water and eat crackers and maybe start walking and start spitting it right up in other words sometimes I went to all kind of doctors and Clinics just nothing can be done I'm sure he prayed Lord you know Paul did the same thing Paul said Lord Lord can you just take this away from me I got something that buffers buffets me all the time what what the Lord say well now Paul this is not this is a picnic now we've turned it into a picnic not a battle so I'm going to take that away from you he you know what he tell Paul my grace is sufficient for you didn't take it away from him nothing can help you they give me medicine and everything just couldn't stop it and I went on just the same about seven or eight years constantly and I would just eat I would try not to look at the table and see people eat and sit down I would try to drink my barley water you know and maybe a little prune juice for breakfast barley water for dinner and need a few crackers soda crackers with barley water maybe a gram cracker occasionally when I see people I go to work picking shovel work hard all day let's continue on through he weighed 118 lbs 20 lb I think that now all these years after suffering through that my eyes are 2020 he actually almost went blind because he lost um nutrients when he throw that up he lost nutrients and he almost went blind so this is a prophet that prayed for people that saw miraculous I mean hundreds of thousands of Miracles now he said his eyes are 2020 in other words God healed him all right now he weighed 153 PBS and he very thankful so that's what a prophet went through so let's not question our faith because I'm going to read you something here in a few minutes where the prophet of God tells us that your faith is what works the gift right amen your faith is what works the gift now he had a gift of Divine Healing and there were times like like Sunday we saw where Sister Mary was having a seizure there in the seat and and then we prayed the prayer of faith over and now she's home and well and they can't find nothing wrong with her all right so praise God for that we we don't sometimes we look at the bad ones and don't look at the good ones that was a victory brother George preached his heart out Sunday and there at the devil came in the house and tried to disturb us he he had to leave we and then you know what the doctors testified that everything's okay all right so see we got to look at the victories too as long as as also looking at the so-called amen temporary defeat remember Christians never defeated all right but we have to go through life and we see death and we see life and we see all these things and we process grief here what brother R says don't judge a man because he can pray a prayer of faith for the sick and they get well don't judge a man because he might do some Supernatural Miracle as being a sainted person but the only way that you can judge is by the love that they have for Christ and for each other what brother B say he said Give Me Love take all the gifts away from me give me love right because love conquers everything all right listen to this he said let's bow heades for a moment talking about fight with what we have watch what brother Brown says I want you to think of this over you say brother R I could never preach the gospel maybe you're not supposed to I I could never have faith for the sick maybe you're not supposed to I could never sing like them singers from Sweden and around I could never do that maybe you're not supposed to but what you have won't you rise today and go towards the darkest spot and fight as only you can fight amen as only you can fight well if I had don't get in somebody else's corn field don't get in somebody else's place stay in yours you shall have never done nothing brother Ram said sit in a Pew pay your hi and pray for everybody what did he say was the success of his meetings the other one time two ladies got in a closet and was praying he said that was the success of my meetings not that he was a prophet not that anything he said those two women were the success of my meeting brother R 1951 says see I'm trying to say that it's not for me your faith is what operates that without faith there's nothing you can't receive anything the people who beat him on the head with a stick said prophesy there was no virtue at all for them it's those who believe 1958 Jesus Christ the same yesterday brother R said look now friends I don't know what more he could do I don't know one thing more he could do he's proved to you that he's not dead He's Alive and in here now what good would me do standing here anointed if you were out there and wouldn't believe it takes your faith your faith is what touches him and does these things it isn't me I don't operate that you operate it with your own faith is what does it see it's you not me you all right this man was given a gift of Divine Healing but he stands up and says you operate it what the what the angel said if you can get the people to believe you in other words believe you can pray believe that you can contact God but you still can't go up there halfhazard with a sucker in your mouth and chewing chewing G and popping bubbles right you got to go up there with faith and reverence listen to this it isn't necessary to come up here and kneel down and pray through until you're saved you're saved already but you have to accept it your praying doesn't do it your faith is what you're saved by not by prayer wow but by faith are you saved same thing by healing I'm sure we all understand that 1956 what Visions are't up here in Old Spindale North Carolina where brother Joe Green living up there close see your faith is not what you feel your faith is what you believe remember faith is a substance faith is Fai listen I was talking to somebody today we hope is good it's good to start out with hope but if I just hope I got to church tonight no I had faith I was going to get here and guess what when I arrive I don't have to have faith to get here anymore brother I'm already here so believe in what you're in get in what you're in have faith for the journey but right here is where it's all over with hundreds of people look that's what happened here at the platform when I would when I have healing Services hundreds of people that way they come to the platform oh brother random I got all Faith what now this is the prophet if it was ink it wouldn't da an eye right I'm just telling you what he's saying see you got hope instead of faith faith is positive right there's no nothing can move it it's positive no matter how sick you got how everything went nothing now if you're trying to Bluff it it won't take bluffing the Devil he's a bluff himself and he knows how to run a bluff but when you got the goods it don't take loud hollering right M don't take stomping and screaming we see a lot of that that's truly unnecessary it takes Faith he will recognize it don't worry just say the word am one quote watch this brother R 1951 talking about the angel of Lord he's explaining the gift he said your faith is what operates the Divine gift your faith now this is one I want to read you this one and not shouldn't be very long tonight I just wanted to read this to you and then we'll make some comments in a minute this is kind of long but listen and and I want you to don't get caught up in the in the U in all the um paragraphs that we're going to read but basically this is when brother brandham there was this lady that the baby died inside of her he prayed for her she got some kind of disease and that she was dying he prayed for her the disease went away he calls it something here in a minute I'll the baby had died cuz she was ureic whatever that means I I'm not a not a nurse she had Ure she had ureic all right he prayed for it and we'll see in a minute they did a blood test after the prayed it was over it was done there was nothing in her she was fine remember she goes home they do all the stuff they need to do she goes home tells her mama says mama I'm going home I'm going read it all mama I'm going home yeah honey you we're going home no no mama I'm going home she said you heal she said yeah we're going home we'll all going in the Rapture together she said no mama I'm going to die I'm going home and she died and brother Brandon was out of the was out of the country or or out of the Tabernacle and somebody did her funeral when brother R got back you're going to see here in a minute Prophet makes a mistake no tomatoes he'll tell you he did he said God you owe me an understanding in other words you owe me an explanation of why that woman died and you pronounced her healed so let's read it one day I come home about four years ago or five something like that and this young girl which was about 8 years old when she was on the Cradle roll she had been married and had two children she was lying in the hospital out there at the point of death she was about 4 months old five with a baby and the baby had died and they couldn't operate cuz she had ureic Google that I didn't and they couldn't operate so had to let the mother die too can't operate see the baby would kill her like that so they she was just dying that's all wasn't no chance for her I went out to see her she had sent for me went to the hospital she was under the oxygen tin I raised up the little flap talked to her a little bit and I said you remember me she said sure brother Bill I remember you how is the do you understand how sick you are yes I do said that's why I sent for you I said well how is it with you and the Lord she said brother Bill I I I'm not ready to go well there we got down and prayed and her mother and her husband many of them in the room and her mother and husband started crying and then I asked her and she got right with God paid her vows come back and made God the promise and if she'd be forgiven how she'd love him and sorry for her sins the way she'd live now this is working out to be a miracle story so far and when went on with her repentance and crying and after a while I got up and went out of the building and the next morning they called me up to come back down there and come to find out they come in that morning for a test to see how the ureic condition had Advanced and found out she didn't have a speck of it it was all gone every bit of it Ure ureic poison had left her the doctors were so excited till they said my why it something very strange we'll get her ready and if it's still that way by the morning said we'll keep giving her pen sing and whatever there was giving her keeping the infection down will'll operate take the dead baby before it sets some in something else said if she's all right then all right well two or three times that day they tested her again and that night late they tested her and nothing was wrong perfectly all right prepped her took her out from under the oxygen tin everything was fine they was going to operate on her the next morning take the baby well I went out there because that was a that this was done now I never knew it I never knew it the Lord never told me nothing about it you could ask the people if you wish he never never said it would but oh my to see such a thing her husband being a sinner come over and say brother Ram I want to give my life to the Lord Jesus and I said all right just kneel down here and take hold of your wife's hand and then you walk this straight life together the mother came back she said brother Ram you know here's me and my children we've all been in and out and in and out and around the Tabernacle and things we sit and listen to you preach we'll go up to the Altar and come back said I'm backslid too brother Bram she said I want to come back to the Lord Jesus for his goodness to my child here's the whole family being saved all right well you see that very that's very nice but you don't come to the Lord Jesus because of that in other words she was going to come because of that along toward midnight 12:1 her mother dozed off to sleep and she called and said mother she said yes honey what do you want she said you know I'm so happy she said I'm so happy of you being happy she said I'm at peace with God and said oh how fine it is in a few minutes again she called back and said mother yes said I'm going home she said I know you are yes sweetart the doctor will take the baby tomorrow and then about a day or two when your incision heals up we'll get away from here you go back home and be happy again you and your hubby and little children to be a Christian and live for God she said mother I mean I'm going to my heavenly home she said sure honey at the end of The Journey she had so much confidence in brother R praying for and everything was all right and done she was just not going to you know she was not going to allow that thought to come in her mind she said this is the end of the this is the end of the journey oh she said now what's the matter said the end of the journey said yes Mother within a few minutes I'll be gone well she thought she just got nervous and Delirious she called the nurse nurse took her respiratory respiration everything was normal and within five minutes she was gone she was dead then when I came back home in a week or two he'd been gone I think brother Graham preached the girl's funeral when I come back home and M told me that girl died that night my couldn't I went to see the mother yeah and I I don't know what caused me to do it now watch it's a prophet but I said Lord God you owe me an understanding see after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you've done these things for him and all like that and then take that girl's life I said you owe me an understanding let me stop there real quick don't ever tell God that I don't care if you're a prophet priest or a king don't ever tell God that cuz watch what happens when you tell God something like that he'll leave you sitting alone he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well he just let me pout it out for a few days now watch few days now look then he said and after three or four months one day I was out in the creek Bank the Lord spoke to me in the vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time now look at the Providence and sovereignty of God she should have died right then but by forn knowledge he knew if he'd give her a little more time she'd make it right thank God thank God he did that for all of us right amen yes sir she should have went at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go she wasn't ready then and that's why all this happened and why you went out there then I got down and cried I said Lord Jesus forgive me you're poor stupid servant I should have never said that Lord and I went back down to the lady and she lived over on Market Street went over to her and I said I going to ask you a question sure brother Bill is it true that this girl almost drowned she said that's right brother bradam said her husband they had to get her out of the creek they had to use artificial respiration to pump pressure they had to get a machine pump the water out of her had her skirt on she was having a picnic she was out there stepped on some sand slipped off over her head and strangled in the water they didn't notice her and directly they seen her coming up and going down anyway she almost died I said that was her time to go cuz that's what God Said see God knows what he's doing I'm telling you tonight whatever we have a question and I know we do in our mind we question uh you know Sister Freda and we question brother Hal we question all the different ones and we question God that's okay you better question him inside your heart though and do it real gingerly cuz he don't ow you an explanation he don't ow us no an explanation see God knows what he's doing now the Lord probably would have told look now the the Lord probably would have told me that if I hadn't taken the attitude that I did when I said Lord you owe me to tell me about that he don't owe you nothing isaah 648 said but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay Thou Art the Potter and we are all are the work of thy hand Romans 9:20 says NE but old man who are thou that repliest to God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay praise God of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and one unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and make his power known endure endured with which longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction there's a group over here and there's a group over here God made them both God made them both it's their choice their faith or non-faith this what makes the difference right so yeah we question why God take we question there was there's several people in this building that that their their husbands have passed away at a at a very young age and we we wonder and but but let's not number one don't fault yourself don't fault God for one don't fault yourself there's a Providence of God let me read this right here real quick God is Sovereign now that mean when you say sovereignty that means he has complete control there's nobody he has to have counsel with now the Bible tells us that but he has sovereignty means if we're a sovereign country that means no other country can tell us what to do we have a sovereign Church no one can come in here and tell us what to do cuz we're Sovereign we are our own so God is his own he is sovereign we need to put it in his hands that he knows the end from the beginning not us God is Sovereign this is a 1964 Harvest Time brother R say when he who could tell God how to make things in the beginning when there was just him by himself see if we have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God so if we have eternal life if you haven't now we were with God right then a part of God we were his attribute we were we are now his attribute because in the beginning was a word where was a thought expressed so we were his thought then we were expressed down here so we were his thoughts then expressed in the word it became what we are in other words we became into human form to prove God God's going to prove to the world through us through the bride who he really is cu they're not going to see him again they going to see you all right and if it wasn't there then never will be in other words remember I said before God doesn't change his mind if he loved you before the foundation of the world praise God he loves you today he never didn't love you he can't not love you if he loved you one time thank God for the sovereignty of the Lord that we can put our assurity on that one person that he can do that we can't we're shifted as sand is we have our ups and we have our downs we have our good days and bad days have people taken out of our life we have people put into our life just to persecute you true true the Potter as Roman well it's for your benefit if you're a child of God it's for your benefit the Potter as Roman 8 tells us who can tell the Potter can the clay say make me thus thus see no God has to display all of his attributes and tonight you and I are part of the attribute of god sister Freda was an attribute of God in his choosing and sovereignty to take her out of her pain and her despair he took her home right no question see no God has to display all of his attributes so he has to make one vessel Of Dishonor the other one to honor to show that one show that one up of course now but he is Sovereign you see nobody can tell him what to do and he makes us different even we're told in the Bible that the star is different one from another one star different from another you know there is a difference in heaven in angels Angelic beings there's Angels cheram s and they're different they we're all different and God has big mountains Plains prairies grass Desert Water he's different he's a god of variety but he's still Sovereign you can't take away from that listen to this and we wonder we and we do Wonder we wonder why some get he now brother Brown tells us that a prostitute could come by and get healed and a real saint of God loser healing all right 1965 not not pro his word I cannot you say what about me I could not tell you it's Sovereign all the works of God is Sovereign there will be many people healed Crossing this platform tonight everybody with me stay with me just for a minute it's only 8:00 that's late for old people but like me but I'm awake there will be many people healed Crossing this platform tonight there will probably be many not it's all in the Sovereign of God who can tell him what to do no one he works according to his own will his own plan Philippians 3:13 Brethren I count it not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before let's read it right here Paul says I press toward the Mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we's stop here just for a minute talk about being in a battle and not a picnic when you are in a battle and brother George bless his heart he's from Ireland but he know knows more about the Civil War and every battle that was ever fought in a Civil War and what should have happened if this one moved this way and what would have happened if Le would have went that way and what would have happened if this one would have moved he's got a chessboard and he just plays like this with battles I don't even know who fought any War except Lee and Grant that's only two and Long Street cuz he lived here that's all I know but he knows them all brother John and he's like well see that's a battle you have a battle plan but remember when you charge you made a commitment you made a commitment when you say I can charge and I can take this hill you have made a commitment and when you head out of those woods every gun of the devil is going to be on top of you the only way for you to survive is the sovereignty of God live knowing you'll make it knowing you'll make it but you got to go through the battle to know whether you can make it or not we were talking and it it just hit me I was preaching for brother Ron Spencer several years ago in Virginia and of course you know a lot of the they're they're from Virginia and most of the Confederate battles were fought in Virginia Pittsburgh you know Gettysburg right in that Virginia shannona Valley Place there was 600,000 men killed in those in the war the four years of war 600,000 men so if they had not had children course most of them were young kids like 17 16 they lied about their age some were 14 15 if they died brother John brother John then then their progeny or their generation was cut off they they if they didn't have children surely being dead they couldn't have anymore right but how'd you get here that's why I asked them up there you know 200 people in brother ry's congregation I said how'd you get here you had somebody that fought in a civil war in your family if you live here long enough amen I said there was an angel that was an angel that watched over whoever that was in those battles and moved your head over one way or move that bullet over you think I'm crazy no I ain't crazy it's a sovereignty of God to get you here didn't brother R say he bred this one to this one this one to this one this one this to get you here right right so you're here fight fight to win though don't fight just to play Paul said I press or push toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus 1 Corinthians 9:12 I therefore so run not as uncertainly now watch so fight I not as one that now what kind of fight is that you Bea in the air no what do he saying I have a purpose for every punch that I amen put out am I have a purpose remember Muhammad Ali you know brother um J for he love Muhammad Ali love boxing but love Muhammad Ali he said know Muhammad Ali be boxing and said you'd think you'd hit him three or four times and you know they do that thing where they grab you to try to get their breath back you know he said he'd whisper in the ear of that opponent he said I'm going to knock you out in a few minutes then get back he I'm going to knock you out in a few minutes and he probably most of the time did but that was a confidence that he had but he wasn't beating the air so God's not beating the air any move that we make should be a move that God has sh saw that we make good or bad in different I mean we we make mistakes but Paul says I'm going to run not uncertainly that's like it Gettysburg you know at Gettysburg it was a great battle you know uh the South got whipped pretty bad but there was a time in a time in there that they could have won the war they could have won that battle not the war but the battle if they had made a certain move they were uncertain about a certain area and they didn't go to it well the union got it and it was high ground and they got whipped you and I as Christians we shouldn't be uncertain about what God's done for us and what he's going to do for us and it doesn't M listen they're going to fall in battle I may fall you may fall but somebody is going to make it somebody is going to stand one day and say death you've lost the great battle 1 Timothy 6:12 said fight the what good fight oh W you well you oh is me no come on that's right bring it on you say you're crazy no I want this thing to get going I want it to be over with I want somebody to stand on their own two feet and do as a prophet said when death comes up your arm you just go wipe it right off right fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where where unto thou are also called and has professed a good profession now listen I was talking to somebody today um sister Freda her profession was perfect you you never knew she was sick but the Lord by Providence and by sovereignty took her home last night but you never really knew because Jun and I talked to her two weeks ago two Wednesdays ago we were going home and she wanted to talk about the end and she's like I'm good I feel okay so they're going to do this certain thing and this certain thing and a certain thing and Janet said she talked to her a couple days ago so her profession was and how many of you know my dad most of you know my dad grew up with him how many times have you ever seen him profess he was sick how you feel doc I feel great watch's that lump on your head I'm fine but it's a profession you got to profess it to possess it right and has professed a good profession before many witnesses so you can't just go to one person brother yours you got to go to the world everywhere you go you got to profess that you're a Christian doesn't matter if you lay on your deathbed God Stills A Healer now brother R tells us that he said brother R said I couldn't find it because I couldn't word it right brother R said if God never decides to not heal another person he said I'll still preach Divine Healing now how in the World cuz he's looking at something different besides all the circumstances he's looking at a prize you and I should be looking at a prize we know and we we we know as human beings there's gaps left in our life but God will fill them up he said he would he said he never put more on you than you can stand but you just don't really know how much you can stand until he puts it on you that's right that's what sister um nma Jeff remember junior he passed away he was but what 50 maybe at the most have brain cancer and passed away and she said wait why why would God take him of course you can say that that's okay to question like that why would God take him I said well I said the only thing I can tell you is nma is God knows you could take it cuz I'd go back crazy if that woman over there died put me in Asylum don't you die thank you yes ma'am but I said God knew you could handle it or he wouldn't put it on you cuz he said he not put more on you than you can take can we not start listening to what God's already said about us come on and hang on to that that's right we know it's going to be a battle but listen those battles at Gettysburg and Sharpsburg and all those different places they were battles that that were many questions and many mistakes and you who knew was going to win that battle we we know who wins this battle we know we win this battle and sister Freda won her battle and all the different ones has passed on we got a whole we've been here 52 years brother and we've got a lot of people that's passed on but we've got a thing downstairs it's our little Hall of of U people returning from at eight we took a picture of at 18 or 20 years old like brother R said and they're on a wall downstairs that's what they'll look like we not see Freda see I know her cuz I knew her when we were 13 14 years old pretty pretty blonde girl I have to say and that's what she'll be she'll be 18 years old she won't be the freedom with no hair wrinkles whatever was there was gray no never see that again brother Tatum for y'all that knew him you know he had so much arthritis his hands were were like this never will we see that again never will we see brother Al struggling for breath or our our brother Gary uh struggling for breath Brother Gary Atkins we'll never see that again listen we'll never even hear a cough out of them praise God what a mighty God we serve that has preserved us told us what we're going to be that's right that's why the prophet of God could stand there and say I'm scared of this he was standing in the sixth Dimension he said if I got to go back and get in that they said yeah your time's not done yet you got to go back down there and get in that body he said why I think I'll just stay here fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where thou are called all right you're we're called for this and has professed a good profession before many witnesses second Timothy 4:7 we'll finish right here I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith continue with a crown of life has been laid up for me like brother George was talking and I've always said you can't hurt a theophany you can't hurt a theophany when Paul put his head on that chopping block whatever Mom and Daddy brought was laying on that shopping block right he was a human he was a mortal but inside that man was a theophany and when they chopped his head off brother he didn't have to pick his head up in another dimension there's not a Gun there's not a knife there's not a nuclear bomb nothing can harm your soul if you're born again listen freda's sickness wasn't in her soul it was in her body all right her soul was redeemed Eternal and because you know why that's what she that's what pulled her into that other dimension it matched what was here and here and it come together if it wasn't then she went somewhere else but it matched and they just said come on come in wait for a little while Fred's like I

with the angels we don't have to talk to angels we're going to talk to people people that went on before and said hey don't worry just sit right here for a little while and I like what brother George told his wife see there's another one brother George Quinn he lost his wife in March of this year a man of Faith a man of absolute Faith he watched his wife for two years with dementia go down down down and pass he said he was sitting there looking at her and he said all of a sudden he said I'm praise God a milky white substance came up out of her body and then disappeared you don't have to open the door to get your soul out yeah there ain't nothing formed of man down here if you died at Fort Knox in the middle of the in the middle of of the uh wherever they put the money well it ain't there no more cuz we ain't got nothing but but your soul wouldn't have to wait till somebody dialed the right number to get you out of that box and they listen they ain't going to have to pull your body out of a grave either when you come back into Resurrection I have fought a good fight I finished my court I have kept the faith and he was heading toward his death he knew knew but Paul knew he had persecuted the Christians for years and years and years and that was always in his mind that's why that's why he told us though forgetting those things which pass amen let's go to the High Calling of God in Christ if we go by the grave so what God chooses to leave us here for the change of the body that would be beautiful but I'll promise you one thing we win we win we have battles battles battles

human beings musicians come on as human beings we all have questions it's okay to question but what's what happened to brother Brandon when he questioned God directly he said God you owe me an explanation in other words an understanding and God's like no I don't and I'm going to let you cry about it for a few months before I tell you what's going on maybe that's the same with us cuz our

question myself than question him question myself where do I stand where am I at with God not why did that happen to that person over there cuz listen brother Ram told us is what the new birth is what an indiv individual affair with God individual it's you and God Alone there that's why I said about family when family has an issue in a crisis let family be together blood family and then our church
