Holy Holy I lifted up shining in the light you GL for at your power in love anding Glory Glory Glory holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen amen you know I know brother uh Samuel's been preaching it but do you know in chapter 4 of Revelation brother R said that's the rehearsal of the Rapture do you know you have actually seen him the one there was an Open Door in heaven right there was an or Open Door in Revelation 3:8 too and brother Ram said that open door was you know in the the hour of sanctification there was a door at the end of that was open to where if they' have walked through the door they'd have walked into the baptism of the Holy Ghost right exactly but the one that was open in heaven if you look at what it's a revelation and brother brandham said the Rapture is what reation so chapter 4 we're looking through that door we know the door the sheepfolds Jesus Christ what do you see what's the first thing you see one sitting on the throne right I'm going to tell you something if you're going to be a part of the Rapture you're going to see what John saw amen is that do you agree with that you're going to see one sitting on the throne right you're going to see those four beasts and they got six wings is that right and I'm going to say something in a minute kind to blow your mind on that I don't know if you I talked to brother Wade about it and I kind of I kind of knocked his sock off on it today but brother Ram did say it and I want to explain something to here in a minute can I do that not while you're standing but I want to say something and you go read the quote I told Brother uh I I got it marked I just didn't print it off but I have a quote I want to read it to you it's a pretty awesome awesome quote let's go to Deuteronomy 7:7 if you would please and I going to uh this is what my plan is I'm going to talk to you about those four beasts a little bit I think it'll give you a little better understanding or more understanding not that I know it all don't I'm going to say what brother brandom said okay and if I don't say what he says then he's going to correct me when I leave or before but he'll correct it okay cuz I have confidence say he's the he's the man here I'm not the main man I'm just visiting this is your Shepherd you understand and he this man I promise you will lead you through cuz God gave him a Ministry spirit and that's his job and he's going to do his job okay I just want you to know that I have confidence in this man great you know what confidence is what I told you love yes if I love this man if you love your pastor you have confidence in him if you don't have confidence in this man you do not love him right okay okay Deuteronomy 7:7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all right but because the Lord loved you amen don't you love that oh this Redemptive story just makes my heart melt he loves you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers ha the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt right that's what God's done for you and the reason he did it is because he loved you he loved you and it what no greater love has a man for a friend than to lay down his life he proved it at Mount Calvary you want to proof of his love go look at Calvary he loved you cuz you're his friend remember Ruth means friend you're that little Ruth okay let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for this service and the people that are gathered we pray that you'll give us understanding give us a revelation of your word there's no such prevailing power as a revelation from you father and Lord I I don't have the English words there's nothing I can do Lord to express my love deservedly to you Lord but as a man and and as women here we're going to do the best we can brother ramam said all you can expect of somebody is their best and this church this people we're going to give it our best is what we're going to do Lord be with us in this service in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated let me get back to R what I did in our church I like I told you these three parts I showed you this morning what I did was I preached on revelation of church ages and I did a series on it then I went to Daniel 70 weeks and did a series on it then I went back to Revelations CH 4 and 5 cuz brother brandham I don't know if and you understand it I'm going to tell you what he said brother brandham said that chapter 4 was a rehearsal of the Rapture right does anybody know what a rehearsal is a rehearsal is something you do over and over right and over again that's right and you have a a a undress rehearsal but you res if you're uh who are you Romeo we sister Peggy he is Romeo by the way yeah okay Romeo you're going to we're having this rehearsal you're going to do the part Romeo Romeo Romeo until you get it down pack right right then what you're going to do you're going to have a dress rehearsal a little rehearsal and then you're going to do the performance is that right it's going to happen do you understand so chapter 4 is the rehearsal of the r Rapture is that what he said the example he used go read the book he said and I said ceil my wife chewed me out Cil be the meal my wife is a word Smith okay so I went to church and I said Cecil she said it's cesil I said it spelled Cecil she said it's cesil be de Mills so when I preached it that morning she jumped all over me like a good wife would normally does and so I came back I said I went I said cesil be theill okay so anyway he did the Ten Commandments right well he had Oral Roberts there right and what were they going to be critics right they were going to take a look at it and say did this meet you now one critic they didn't have there I was upset about was William brandom right right brother Bram said he could be a good critic did you know he said that but see they wouldn't put Brad the brandom there they had all the others there right that's how they thought a year profit but anyway he said it was the rehearsal you agree with that and what it was the rehearsal when you when a door was open a revelation has been come open in this hour and we saw one that sat on the throne we' seen the emerald color around him we' seen the four beasts does everybody agree with that right now this is something I'm going to say I want you to go take a look and and I told Brother Wade that morning CU I knew he had preached this and I so I'm not trying to I'm not trying to make a trouble you know but the four beasts there had six wings does everybody agree with that they had six wings the four beasts in chapter 5 did not have six weeks remember in chapter 4 it's the Rapture in chapter 5 it's the Plan of Redemption exactly now it said they when you go look at and I'm going to read it here in a minute and I'll stop and tell you this is what I'm talking about it said there were four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders right it said they fell down and sung the song of redemption Angels can't sing the song of redemption is that what your Prophet said a seraphim cannot sing the song of redemption is that what it says a cherubim cannot sing the song of redemption right they have not a part of redemption if they sung the song of redemption they'd be Liars now we got Liars in heaven if that happened right so I'm going to tell you something in in Revelation chapter 4 brother brandom said it if you go read further down where it says the four he said they were not men or they weren't Angels they were not redeemed men now that's what he said he said I want to tell you more about those living creatures and this is chapter four so don't get that mixed up with chapter five right okay cuz one is speaking of the r where you see him sitting on high does everybody understand that Isaiah seeing him uh Ezekiel seening and they talked about wings right well that's what the high and mighty lifted up holy holy holy he's the one that said they seen those Wing creatures do you agree right but the brother said they're not Angels they're not redeemed men and brother BR said that in Revelations 4 of the book so I'm not guessing about what he said but then when I was looking at it when I preached chapter 4 I seen that and then when I preached five it said they fell down and worshiped them I thought now wait a minute that's a different four beasts so if you look and you follow the four beasts out brother Bram said there were four living creatures in the Old Testament right remember the 12 tribes how they camped around the ark the each the head of each one of those tribes or not the head of each but there were four and there were three there the eldest of that one he had an ins sign right and the inside was what it was a lion an ox a man's face and an eagle does everybody understand that they were the four living creatures that protected the ark if you were somebody an enemy that wanted to come and get the ark you're going to go through one of them and they had eyes behind and before so if I'm John not John that's that's your new let me see I know I'm at home I don't have it now but the inside if you're going to get by that flying eagle the one on the other side's going to see you coming so they had eyes before and eyes after you that right so brother and said the Old Testament he said that was the 12 tribes everybody agree with that and that's what the in the New Testament he said it was Matthew Mark Luke and John exactly they protected the books of Acts you couldn't get to the ark if you didn't if you didn't come through them and they all agreed Matthew does not disagree with acts right Mark doesn't disagree with Matthew they're all saying the same thing were they not right every one of them were saying the same thing so to get to the book of Acts you got to come through one of them right now go look at it and when you're talking about the Plan of Redemption everything in that chapter speaks of redemption right everything right I know I kind of got you miffed here a little bit don't I and I'm going to prove it to you in a minute it'll blow you away a little bit but so that that's in there those that Beast represented look the 12 Elders right it it the anointing in the church ages does everybody understand the anointing of the church ages what were they lion Ox you know what an ox is a converted bull got the fight taken out of him where's Zach at you know what an ox is don't you Zach they get the fight taken out of them those people those 68 million had to fight taken out of them they didn't resist them they went right to right to get burned at the steak you know brother R said they had it easy we have it hard kind blows your way don't it all they had to do is okay they and feathered and lit the match done what we do is year after year we're fighting the devil year after year we're fight day after day like I said this 200,000,000 demons you're fighting and wrestling with them every day that's right they had it easy you have it hard right but God could trust you God has confidence in you in this church okay you want hear me say that over and over God has confidence in each and every one of you here that you're going to be an overcomer or he wouldn't have put you here God didn't put you here to be a loser God put everyone in this church here to be a winner you understand you are a winner that's what I want get positive okay so we understand that in the book of chapter five which five is Grace by the way you agree with that he put it he put it per the most Sublime is that what he said right he put it right there those four beasts okay are talking about the Redeemed yeah and I tell you that it doesn't look at it it doesn't say Angels there it does or it doesn't say Wings there right it says four living creatures right now I want you to I know that and that's maybe a little different than you've ever heard it I'm not trying to be different I'm just trying to be honest with you okay so go take a look at it and you'll see that in that fifth one it speaks of redemption now I want to read chapter 5 and all the way through it if I can okay uh hold on then we're going to go through Ruth and I'm going to hurry I hate to keep people long I really do I used to sit out there like you did I did it for 21 years under a good preacher and now I'm the guy up here holding them too long okay let's go to Revelation 51 and I saw on the right of hand of him that sat on the throne a book right written within and on the backside that's what I tried to tell you give you the real what Redemption is it's on the the back side of the book there were seven seals put can I say this on the Book of Revelation yeah and the seals were also within the book on the inside of it right all the way from Genesis all the way through what was hid from the people was Redemption yeah they never totally fully understood it and one place brother Ram said this is the fullness of redemption right is that right what is it it's the full Revelation right cuz remember it's a door open do you agree with that in chap 4 so right now right here in this church you're starting to understand the fullness of redemption right amen right you got to get the Revelation first and then you're going to get the manifestation right right so this is what it's talking about we're going to go through chapter 5 okay I lose my place already and follow me I want you to follow me cuz sometimes I'll say okay where was I at at our church I my mind just races you know you know how that is don't he's laughing he knows what I'm talking about you're preaching you're going at warp speed yeah you'll never understand what it's like unless you've done it when I get out of this pull pit I don't like at church I tell them don't ask me say brother clly can you answer this give me an hour to get out of where I'm at right don't come to me and and ask I want you we'll meet but give me a chance to get out of what I'm in okay cuz it really you'll say something you don't really mean to say is what it is okay and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither look therein and I wept much right not because his name wasn't on the book like people say or he seen his name on the book no he was weeping because there was no man worthy to open the book that's what he was weeping about because no here it says it no because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed Prevail means overcome exactly you're Overcomers cuz he overcame Amen in every Church age there was a group that overcome out of that age remember I told you this morning brother R said the seven plans of redemption there was there was every age there was an overcomer okay so he has prevailed do you agree to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain L having seven horns and seven eyes everybody agree with that which are the seven spirits of God see those seven spirits of God have to do with Redemption amen right he said seven PL that's where he got it brother brandom's quoting the word the seven plans of redemption are the seven spirits that were sent into the Earth they're doing the work of redemption okay that's what it's all about and he came and took the book out of the right of him that sat upon the throne and when when he had taken the book The Four beast at four and 20 Elders did they all fall down okay listen to what it says before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vials full odors which are the prayers of saints and they they they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take what song did they sing at the end of this verse is going to say it the song of the redeemed Angels can't sing that brother cherubims can't sing that Shams can't sing that they got no right that's your song that's the 12 4 and 24 Elders song The patriarch song is everybody agree amen the 12 Apostles song but it's not cherubim's and saram song it's ours four beasts four and 20 Elders found for lamb where' I go no I'm in the wrong one and they sung a new song and I said song of redemption he's going to see my notes no he's got he didn't print my good thank you then you give it away before I say it saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast Hast Hast past tense redeemed Ed past tense right us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and Nation including the Jews and Thou made us unto our God Kings and Priests listen to this this is a part of the Plan of Redemption we shall reign on the earth amen remember I said the fullest Redemption hadn't come till we reain on this Earth you agree with that right and you're going to do that in a new Earth new Heaven and new earth now you ought to be doing it in this Earth I'm not going to wait for that we are it's time we have dominion over this thing yes okay what you are here is what you're going to be there right so you need to take Dominion of this ugly guy I got to look at in the mirror every day this guy is the one I got to put under my feet right here right right okay see I think you ought to bring it down to the individual yeah I really do right amen and I beheld and heard a voice of many angels I put this gospel preachers andin an angel a messenger you know what brother Brandon was the messenger of the age you're the messenger of this little church and you're going to say what that messenger said this man's a messenger right yeah people may argue that point but it's just flat to truth right that's right roundout the throne the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 that sounds like Iles to me they're not numbered does everybody understand that we're not numbered now the 144,000 are included in that 12 Elders the 12 tribes that's the 20 and4 Elders right that's inclusive in that right so they're redeemed right so they're part of that but here it show it's identifying the bride right remember there was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousand of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb now see that's the way you're supposed to be when you come to church you ought to be worshiped you ought if you got if you're a part of the Plan of Redemption whatever you are here you're going to be there right right you're not going to be something different there right you're not going to be all Smiley there if you're not all Smiley here you get what I'm saying let's wake up a little bit and get real with this okay let's start being here what we're going to be there right cuz if you're not here what you're going to be there you're not going to be there right that make sense I think I did I hope I did I grind that a lot you know to receive listen Worthy is the Lamb that is slain to receive power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing that's seven yeah that's completion that's what he's worthy of right that's what you ought to be given in this is what you ought to be given him right to receive power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing that's what you're supposed to be done and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth are such are as are in the sea and all that are them heard I say I heard saying blessing honor glory power be it unto him that sth upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever and listen to that and the forast said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever now listen to this and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth do you realize when I I caught this and it really I know it sounds like a baby Babi I'm a little baby fied okay I'll admit it do you know the birds are going to be singing the song of redemption yeah are the birds going to be redeem you know why every creature is moaning and groaning for the manifestation right because they want to be redeemed just like you want to be redeemed that bull that brother bam talked to wanted to be redeemed just like you want to be redeemed you does everybody understand what I'm saying amen look if if there's going to be a new Heaven and the new Earth right and the Earth is part of redemption do you realize that every animal comes from the earth is it do it come the same it comes from the same dust you did they're going to be redeemed do you realize the birds are going to be singing the song of redemption do you realize the bees are going to be singing the song of redemption do you remember that Mr Lion's going to be singing it they're going to be so happy that look they're a part of redemption aren't they right amen I've seen that and maybe I'm a baby maybe I don't I know about you but that kind of excites me I'm kind of wanting to hear a bird that can sing the song of redemption I think it's going to be a little special don't you glory I haven't heard one sing it here but over there they're going to sing now they're going to sing it her little birdie language but it's going to be awesome it it's going to be so awesome I can't even explain what it's going to be like over there but everything that's been redeemed is going to be singing a song of redemption it's guys it's going to be don't you miss it whatever you do don't you miss it it's Sublime that's what he said this chapter here is Sublime brother right it's Grandeur it's it's one of it's the greatest thing that you could see in the Bible is this right here it's the greatest story it's the love story you understand and and I just wanted you to understand that and in reading chapter 5 it's it's Sublime how can you say it any better than he said it right I don't that's the only word I can find if you found a word to better explain chapter 5 it's Sublime it's a Wonder ful time it really is guys so I I hope you understand I know you do I always say that I don't mean to say treat you like your dummies you're not you're smarter than I am I'm a dummy trust me I'm a dummy okay let me go here okay I'm going now let's go to Ruth can everybody go to Ruth with me I can find it got 27 pages of notes Here I get a little lost sometimes you're laughing you never had 27 pages of notes what I do when I start a series I just keep adding notes until finally it's like huge right this is huge okay now remember give me the slide on Ruth where I said the four Junctions brother bam called it right brother Joseph remember brother brandham said there were four Junctions in the Book of Ruth right there there was Ruth deciding that's justification there was Ruth serving that's sanctification there was Ruth resting which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he'll give you rest for your souls does everybody agree with that so the third part of that is the baptism Holy Ghost the fourth part is rewarding sure that's the fullness of redemption do you agree so Boaz went and did the fullness of redemption is that right remember the name Boaz means to Quicken it mhm yeah see look you could read the you could read Revelation 5 the rest of your life if God don't Quicken it you're not going to get the fullness of it you're not going to get the complete revelation of it in this hour we have received the full revelation of chapter 5 amen the mystery of God is finished right so our Prophet has brought us a revelation of chapter 5 that's the fullness of it and we go we can go all the way to new Heaven and new earth we know what it's going to be amen you understand the new Heaven and new earth I do the Revelation has been given to us you understand but God has to Quicken it this man can't Quicken it God has to Quicken it has everybody got that right now I'm going to tell you something I tell our church you know sister back down there told me something but listen to what I'm telling you science says the average human has to hear something 14 times to comprehend it right did you know that right I told the church this so if I repeat myself don't blame me cuz some of you out there aren't average yeah yeah so you caught it I hear you laughing I said if I speak at 28 times it's not my fault it's yours because you know what me and him are going to sing them over again to me wonderful words of life and we're going to keep singing this song of redemption we're going to keep sing it's a new song to me right it's a new book to me ain't that what he said and when I I seen the whole book I've started singing the song of redemption and I can't stop nobody can stop me I'm going to sing this song of redemption is that right and I'm going to sing it over and over and over until you start singing it amen right that's right is that fair that's what I'm going to do if it takes 28 times okay let's be there 28 times that's why I just preached this I was in part eight when I left right what am I doing I'm singing it over and over until they start singing it with me I'll start seeing everybody's face go do you know when you catch a revelation you'll grin your face will testify of it when I look out there and I say something there's one sister in the church and I pick on her all the time she loves me and I love her she's just awesome and she'll sit out there she she'll go and I'll walk down the stairs I'll go over to her I said did you get that she go yeah I knew it I didn't have to ask I said okay let me say it again and so I'll rephrase it or say it again I said you get that she'll go honestly her face goes from your body responds to things folks that's what I'm saying if your body can't respond to Redemption there's something wrong exactly I seriously there's something wrong if you can't put flesh and I said it earlier I'm going to say it again you can't put Flesh on this Redemption story something right you're not getting it does everybody understand you're just not getting it right and I think that's why we see people in the messy churches so down and out you know they'll come to or sickly we're wiers you know that let me tell you what juwel says Wy Wy me has he ever said that here W Wy Wy woo do you know he's preaching Ruth to you did you know that you don't believe me let me read it okay where did I stop at I didn't I didn't start did I now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land famine in Israel and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to soldier in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was aik and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of the two sons M you know what me means sick sick you were sick this morning weren't you now look I'm not going to scare you they died but they had her name raised up by Boaz when she took Ruth now every one of you I look I got an insulin pump on me I'm not being critical you see that I'm sickly but God's going to raise a name up for me in Israel God's going to raise my name up even though I'm sickly sister Peggy and it says now that's what men means you agree with that and chillian means piny or a wher you I'm not being critical I could look at the sister and tell you some of you wh downstairs didn't you didn't we you're going to be raised up it don't matter quit worrying about that now quit whining but if you do whine quit worrying about it he's going to raise your name up is that what Boaz did when Boaz redeemed Naomi she redeemed brought men and his name up in Israel right amen He restored their name I don't care if you're sickly this morning I don't care if you're a wher this morning you don't bother Boaz Boaz in the end of this thing is going to raise you up that is a type of redemption everybody you know healing is a type of redemption it's bringing your body back to what it's supposed to be right see that's what it's talking about when it's talking about poor M and Chilean Chilean M yeah it was Chilean wasn't it yeah m m and Chile they were sick and and whiners but God's going to raise it up I know you may think that sounds funny but look they were born an Israelite they were part of the inheritance weren't they yeah they may have been down there in that mile land which they should have never been in but God's going to raise a name up to them through Boaz look your name's going to be raised up through Boaz you can't raise your name up yourself you should have burned along with the serpent sister and me too but through Boaz that quickening Spirit your name's going to be raised up even though you may be sickly and a whiner here today you're going to be raised up right I love this mest thing it just gets all over me just a minute I'd almost like to shout I'd speak in tongues if it wouldn't interfere with things ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and liik Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of one was orpa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years they had no children they didn't did they I mean they married Ruth and they married orpa but now they would have been married two years a half year before they died all I know is imik and Naomi was down there 10 years okay they married the two girls the two boys and they the the daddy and the boys died right and all that was left to her was the two daughters right does does ever no I ain't going to say that you'll think I'm crazy if I say that which I am um and Ma and chillian died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard what is justification right hearing the word right you know what she was down there in that Mobi land and she heard that the famine was over in Israel Faith cometh by hearing the word of God see how it's typing justification all the way through she heard that there's not famine in Israel she said I'm going to return to Israel right well see that's what Redemption is you returning to the Lord right you might have been seekely you might have been but your name will be I'm going to tell you folks your name will be raised right Boaz is going to Quicken me brother Glory that's the hour we're in do you understand that we're in the fullness of this thing that's right heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited the people in giving them bread he gave it to them everything you got in this life is what God gave you you don't think so he gave you his son he gave you the five-fold ministry he gave you the Holy Ghost right what did he not give you brother it's what he gave you it's not it's unconditional it's not what you done it's what it's not what Abraham done it's what God did from Abraham and we're the faith seat of Abraham it's what God gave you you you you God gave you that right right boy you are loving more after thisall wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on her way to return unto the land of Juda where did I get did I turn two yep hold on and theom send her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me remember justification everybody said what are you doing you know what my family said about me is just another phase he's going through cuz I was I went through a lot of phases trust me and they were right they were what they said was right I am going through a phase but this is not going to end I'm not coming out of this phase that's what they don't understand I Cann not go back right does everybody understand Ruth was a moabit does everybody understand Ruth had the wrong birth right do you everybody understand the moabites were born out of incest their birth was not right that's why Israel did not like the moabites right they hated them cuz why they didn't have the right birth so here you have Ruth that doesn't have the right birth Naomi heard and Ruth stayed true to Naomi now let me show there's quote and I don't if I read it I'm not going to get through with this and you know it but brother random said Naomi was the type of the old Covenant right Ruth was the type of the New Covenant now let me you know that's a good say let me break it down you Old Testament Ruth had to stay true to the Old Testament sure you know the number one thing the people in my church come to me they say people out there in the world will tell me that's the Old Testament you don't have to pay attention to that Ruth stayed true to the Old Testament do you realize you're Ruth and you're going to stay true to the Old Testament we are the only Ruth is the only one that's going to stay true to the Old Testament does everybody agree with that somebody told me that downstairs and I said I was going to get on it whoever you are I don't see you I know you're here but he said look in Deuteronomy 22:5 when it tells you women not to wear that pertaining to a man are you going to stay true to the Old Testament are you going to stay with Naomi I say they will if you're Ruth you will you ain't going to put on clothes that pertaineth to a man because if you do you're not staying true to Naomi the Old Testament that was the that was the justification that Ruth had was she was going to stay true to the Old Testament right she heard there was a f that the famine was over exactly she heard underneath Naomi Ruth heard that there was one God right here oh Israel the Lord thy God is where did you hear that from Naomi didn't you the Old Testament you that where it was are you staying true to it or did you hatch up three a trinity did you did anybody hatch that up if you do you're not Ruth right see that's why chapter 5 it said there was one that sat on the throne amen see and brother R said the perfect type of redemption is in Ruth so look does it show one God in Ruth does it show three sitting on the throne pretty simple isn't it so see Ruth absolutely is a perfect it shows you the Plan of Redemption perfectly amen that's what it does okay that's why the that's why the sages left it in now I don't think they even understood why right but they must have read it and been inspired and say no it's inspired how else could they got it God moved on them by the Holy Ghost to tell them to include it right but brother ra said it's a hidden Mystery and now what we're going to do tonight to this morning we're going to look at that hidden Mystery okay and we're going to see as we go through it we're going to see The Plan of Redemption right and this hour is the hour that the seals were loosed amen where now we can receive the fullness of the Plan of Redemption everybody got what I'm saying this is the hour you're in okay na only said un her two daughters-in-law go return each to your mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto the Lord unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb so see justification you remember when you're Justified you come to the altar you're all so happy the whole burden of the Earth's lifting up and all of a sudden it's like here the Devil comes right he's trying to make you go back he's going to make you go back go back right but there's something inside of you says I can't go back that's right I'm going to say something you're going to think this I'm weird I am I'll admit it if you say I'm weird okay I'm weird how what do you teach your children when they're growing up do you teach them how the seals open did you teach them about the coming of the Lord or did you teach them about Noah did you teach him about David and his little slang what were you treat what what did your kids when they it says teach them the way of the Lord and they'll not depart from it what what was the you see this the tipes you taught them all that right you did that sister Peggy didn't you you told them about Moses you told them about the burning bush right and your kids wouldn't part from it why they were little Ruth is what they were right the people that part from that so you teach your children the old Testament cuz why it's it's just little simple little don't you do that Dianna she can probably tell you about David in's little sing she can tell you about the ark and all the giraffes and all the things that went on the ark and you know what you teach these little kids these things you're teaching of the Old Testament and when they get older right now they don't have the birth everybody see where I'm going with it they don't have the new birth right but you know what they say I'm going to stay with that I kind of like that that and you know what old brother Samuel sometimes he talks about the type of the of that Ark how it was justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost right see it's all in there Redemption folks it's all in the Bible and so what they do is they say you have stayed true to the Old Testament right so your little kids you teach them that and they stay true to it and that what brings them on in to follow all the way to Boaz you understand what I'm saying and that's what God did he brought all those little you think they're little stories and they're big stories yeah but what is it it's preparing you and you hear them and somebody says oh you believe that story of Jonas in the whale yeah why that whale's mouth ain't that big how can he swallow Jonah well you know he said he was a prepared fish is what mama told me what you told me it was a great they call it a whale but it was a great fish that's right you told them the old test and they'll stay true to it why did we stay true to the Old Testament where Ruth and she says let your God be my God let your people be my people let your city be my city now to Israel what was their City Jerusalem what's our city New Jerusalem same city you understand what I'm saying right so in in Ruth it's showing us justification is you're going to stay true you've decided you made up your mind you're going to follow this thing right and you you start out you're going to and you're going to stick with Naomi no matter what that's why when people out in the workplace they're trying to get you away from the law do you understand in Simplicity they say oh that's in the law I don't have to do that you sisters are staying true to Naomi when you sisters don't wear them pants and you men don't wear dresses I tell you we'll grip about a women wear pants but it says a woman man ain't supposed to wear that a man ain't supposed to wear that you would you would you hear me preach if I War dress I hope not sister I you're sick but yeah I guess you would you'd laugh all the way through brother you're not going to get a laugh cuz I won't do it okay this guy is going to stra stay true to noomi you get my point right and and it just that's a little bitty simple thing but it's not simple we're finding out it's big so we're going to stay true to Naomi right everybody's going to stay true to Naomi please raise your hand amen me too all them little stories I want to stay true to them cuz they're true true stories okay where where did I end did anybody know us where I am I have to ask that but where am I at nine thank you 1 nine the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of the husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and we and they said un her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and now said turn again my daughters why will you go with me there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I'm too old to have an husband if I should say I have hope if I should have an husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you T for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth caved unto her yeah one of them forsook the Old Testament yeah you understand what I'm saying they'll say oh the law don't matter that's what orpa did now I don't believe orpa went back down to mobat and was a bum I think she prospered no right I do I really think she went down there and prospered you know what I mean I really do knew but Ruth clave unto her stayed right next to her you that's what clave is right you're going to stay real close to the Old Testament you understand you're not going to leave that you're not because why Noom me told you these little stories and you believed it is that right right the Old Testament told you these stories and you're going to cleave to that that's what you're going to do so see it's the law has a whole new meaning to me you know what I mean I'm going to cleave to it and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back on her people and her Gods her Gods you see what happened when you return back in the moabit land you return into your Gods so you don't stay true to the Old Testament here o Israel the Lord thy God is one okay this is what I'm talking to you chapter one's about justification right if you're Justified you're going to leave them other gods right if you're Justified you're going to leave those Gods okay return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God see how it's different between orpa right and Ruth exactly we're going to St your God will be my God it's Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus Christ the new your God will be my God glory right absolutely okay where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried right the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee in me when she saw remember she said if I part from you the only thing I want is for death to let us part but I'm going to cleave to you and nothing's going to separate us did you know that nothing I'm going to be H nothing's going to separate me from the Old Testament I believe it's real I believe those Shadows of that Old Testament by the opening of the seals by the seals on the backside and within of being opened up where Ruth become a new book to me right Genesis become a new book to me Exodus become a new book to me and I'm want to clave under that I'm want to clave under that Old Testament right I am I'm not going to leave it right sure when she saw that she was steadfastly minded that means she ain't going to change her mind Ruth was not going to change her mind I am not going to forsake the Old Testament has everybody got that how many in here let me see your hand see if I'm hitting on this how many in your hands work and they say that's the Old Testament and they want you to leave it how many come on raise your hands haven't you been told that some of you were shaking your head they'll say what do you mean that's the Old Testament see what they're wanting you to do and if you do forsake it it's proof you're you're orpa right and not Ruth do you see what I'm saying by you staying true to the Old Testament it shows you are absolutely showing them you're a Ruth and now when they say that do you know what you need to tell I'm Ruth and I'm going to stay with Naomi now they may not understand the type but that's what you're going to do right right that's your justification staying true you understand when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they went though so they two went until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass when they were Come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them yeah did you know brother brandham said this and you said you say yes brother Bram said when you get saved all of Heaven stands and looks over the balander the the the uh what do you call it the banister because you got saved all of Heaven is moved when you get saved did you know that when here she is right look they went back to Jerusalem all the city was moved sister when you were saved all of Heavens stood up and look over the banister right and said yay yay yay we got another one back to the city you understand right look when you're when you're truly we were talking about this when you're truly Justified you're glorified now we understand this first chapter is justification but when you have true justification you're glorified you know what glori glorified means it means you were glorified back there right your name was on the book that's how you were glorified did you know that's where you were glorified but but down here you recognized it and when you were Justified you came to true if you got true justification it'll lead you to sanctification right and then sanctification is going to lead you to the baptism Holy Ghost and then at the baptism the person you are now a person a little Messi I like that a little Messiah you're just like him right okay so the whole city was moved I like that don't you and they said is this Naomi and she said to them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me yeah I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me Naomi seeing the Lord ha testified against me and the almighty hath Afflicted me does anybody know in the church ages I love this when I taught on it you know the church ages the first church ages it was Antichrist Spirit right and I told you did I tell you this morning about the one that said 16-year-old girl when they become 16 I'll let them do what they want to do they show me a quote in in the message that says that do you know that's Antichrist Spirit sister some of these little sayings that you have in this congregation and where you make up your mind you better make sure that's a quote right I I had to preach it cuz a sister told she got four daughters she said when you're 16 you want you want a 16y old do what they want to do would you let brother Wade do what he wanted to do at 16 he'd be in jail now if she did I know him he's trouble but no I love brother Wade we we we pick at each other a lot but so everybody understand what I'm saying that little sister had the Antichrist Spirit working on her and she didn't even know it that's right she so now then so I'm going to sit there they all four come to church they got earrings in now they cut their hair one girl wore a dress to church I couldn't believe I thought my wife got on me when I got home said you need to say something to them do you ever do that sister Peggy don't laugh now and you you know what I told her whoa sister I'll do it when I feel to do it right is brother had tell you that yeah I know they have that's beautiful though in it where' I stop I got off she said yeah okay okay I went out full and the Lord ha brought me back empty then call ye me Naomi seeing the Lord ha testified against me Almighty to name to Naomi returned and Ruth the moabit US does everybody understand Ruth had no inheritance right do you realize you had no inheritance but you do have an inheritance because Boaz quickened you yes right so you get his field oh yeah you get the world right did I not read in chapter 5 that you would Reign on this earth right that's right Bo what did he say the field was the world is that what he said the Earth is that right is that when the son of man planted seed the field was the world right is that right now that this is we've been working in the field little Ruth right yeah and see what is your inheritance Boaz field right what is it the Earth what did he give Adam in the beginning and Eve earth right what did they they didn't just fall from eternal life they fell from the earth right right brother said when man fell everything under him fell which was the birds the bees the Earth and that's why everything that fail is going to be brought back I you know I know this sounds child I know I'm childish I I'm sorry I am I'm a 57y old baby I can't wait to hear a bird sing the song of redemption I don't know about you guys but I like to hear do you like to hear birds aren't they beautiful can you imagine sister Peggy what it'll be like when they singing the song of redemption right it's going to knock your socks off that's a cliche from Oklahoma okay but it's going to be awesome isn't it 12 2 so Naomi returned in Ruth of moabitas her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley Harvest yeah right yes exactly that's right in the beginning of the barley Harvest you know what the seven Church ages the first church age was the beginning of the barley Harvest do you agree yeah because the barley Harvest look it took 50 days to harvest right from the beginning to the end now the church age is 77777 7 * 7 is 49 right so when did Ruth come into the field right when did the Gentile Ruth come into the field right the beginning of the church ages does everybody see what I'm saying amen now she's going to have to serve and work in that field sure right through the church ages but she's going to come to full Redemption one day Boaz is going to Quicken her remember I told you this morning Boaz means quick his name means quick so what is Boaz he's a type of Christ he's going to Quicken you but you know what at the end of the church ages is when this is what has he done he's quickened us Revelation 5 to a lot of people it's a dead letter but it's not to me right Revelation 5 I don't know about you guys but it's been Quicken to me Glory it's lifegiving to me it means everything to me chapter 5 cuz it's the Plan of Redemption everybody got what I'm saying okay beginning of the barley har and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of almic and his name was Boaz and Ruth of Mo said un her let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him that's talking about God not Boaz I'm going later on I'm going to explain to you and show you how it happened okay I'm going to show you it's really it's really a beautiful thing right in whose sight I have found Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers does everybody know in the chap in what is it Matthew 13 the Reapers does everybody know who the reapers are you want me to tell you who the reapers are Paul right irenius right Martin lumbo Luther I might have got him out of order there Wesley and brother brandham right now look you're going to go into a field and you're going to stay behind the rapers you're the final voice of the final age under your messenger you can't get ahead of the reaper you can't get ahead of brother brandham right some of these preachers in the message think they got something smart brother brandham was wrong and their writer the whole thing Ruth is you're supposed to stay behind the Reapers right you understand that you know what I'm going to stay behind Paul am I I believe brother R preach what Paul preach you you want me to further expound on that I believe brother Brandon preached what irenius did I believe what brother Brandon preached what Columbo did I believe ROM preach what the other one believed right because you know what he said look we have what they had plus right so if brother brandham if we're not saying what irenia said we're in deep trouble folks because brother brandham said what irenius said right now let me tell you I'm going to give you some light on it irenius had some he had the truth but there was some mystery left off from it you agree remember brother Bram said the story of Ruth had some hidden mysteries in it yeah right and it had to be quickened it wasn't enough justification sister that don't Quicken you you understand what I'm saying I know that sounds funny don't it but you got to go all the way with this thing cuz the the quickening the fullness of Redemption come at the end of the Harvest that's right now you stay with me when I go through it hopefully I can get through it everybody follow me right if you have a question ask him how's that that's fair I'm going to throw this out here and you're going to have to clean up my mess when we get through how's that okay where was I at and she went came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and and her hap does anybody know what hap means

beautiful isn't it and she went she had let read and she went came and gleaned into field after and her ha everybody get it her luck her Fortune yeah was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz one day you walked into a message church and you haed on to the field of Boaz didn't know it did you you just walked in one day right but you did sister it was half it was hap that makes me I want to shout don't you see how good God is it was a hap it it was luck it was Fortune that's what I thought but it was God it was God leading me through Redemption you understand was to light on a part of the field belowing to Boaz who was of the Kindred of almc okay before and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then Boaz said Boaz unto a servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabites damel that came back with na Naomi out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now it was evening time everybody got it right look the beginning of the church you got that church age chart Brother Joseph at the beginning of the church ages we started in this Harvest do you agree it's 50 so what we in morning is when she started until the evening time and when the evening time here come Boaz riding his Chariot down who is that who is that in my field Ruth it's Ruth we're going to go on you'll see it so you you understand it started here and she's going to serve now she's chapter one was justification right now what she's moving into is sanctification sanctification is you ministering unto the Lord yeah it's you serving see sanctification is what you do I said it this morning that's why I said it I want to keep hitting it you sanctification is what you do in appreciation for what he's done for you that's right that's what you do the bride ha made herself ready right look it's it's sanctification is what you're doing we under and I want to say it again so nobody misunderstands me out there in the in the uh tape world we understand we're Sanctified by the blood right we anybody I'm not questioning that but if you really appreciate that he shed his blood for you you're going to serve him if you really believe Jesus Christ died for you 2,000 years you're going to serve him you're going to serve him with all your heart mind and strength by the way that's the Old Testament that's Naomi I'm going to stay true to that are you I've seen you raise your hand sister you're going to stay true to it aren't you you're going to serve God with all your heart mind and strength you are true Ruth sister we all ought to be raising our hands on that right okay where' I stop somebody help me thank you then said Boaz under Ruth Harvest here hearest thou not my daughter and that sounds kind of backwards from what you but listen to what it says go not to glean in another field everybody understand that right look people you've landed in Boaz field you have a man here a young man can I tell you that that is staying true to the Reapers that's staying true to Boaz he's staying in Boaz field everybody understand that's what this man is and he's telling you Ruth stay in this field brother R said listen to this and this makes me mad really mad at message Believers I've had people call me on the phone and say we're not coming back Really we love your church we love your ministry we love the people but we're going somewhere else yeah you know you're supposed to find a church where you're spiritually fed and remain there the rest of your life that's a tough statement isn't oh yeah well Ruth did did she leave I'll challenge anybody to show me Ruth where she left his field right once you have on the field of Boaz you best stay there the only reason brother brandham gave you could leave that field if he gets off the word amen if this man gets off the word you run for your life cuz you're not in Boaz field you're in another field does everybody understand in Israel there were thousands of fields there was one field that was Boaz what are the odds what are the odds sister Peggy of her landing on boaz's field when there's thousands of fields what are the odds of you being saved one in a million didn't brother R say that brother one in a million one in a million right you ought to be a real Happy Fella right yes see that's what I get mad at us message Believers we're not happy enough we I Wonder do we really see the greatest love story am of the Bible do we really brother brand said you know what H what's wrong with us we really don't understand her remember the brother that accused brother brandom of that he said but I know the author real good but I'm going to tell you something brother brandom knew his Bible I'm going to tell you something that guy let me tell you he's a walk in Bible and you're supposed to be a walk in Bible amen you're supposed to know your Bible where does it say faith final resting place is the word right you know what the word faith I told you this morning means I know you're supposed to know your Bible right that's Faith right see you're supposed to know your Bible there's no excuse in this hour for you not to know your Bible and if you don't know your Bibles cuz you're lazy and not reading it you're not working in Boaz field you're not serving right you're not ministering to the Lord like you should is everybody okay with that we not end somebody I get I did that huh where did I end somebody tell me where I ended nine yeah let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charge the young men that they shall not touch thee brother Bram said this bride won't be manhandle he instructed this guy here the young man don't you manhandle these people is that what is that a quote is that what he said see where he got it out of that little Kentucky guy quoted a lot of scripture we just said amen but he put it in Kentucky easy but when you read the Bible this ought to become a new these this Redemption Song you ought to hear it you ought to hear it remember the love letter you got to read between the lines you know how you read between the lines cuz you love him

Ephesians where it says when it gives the five-fold ministry it says pastors and teachers it don't put a comma between pastors and teachers a pastor has to be able to teach pastors if you're not teaching your congregation you're not getting them placed where they need to be look there's a place in Boaz field where you need to be and you need to be there every time the church doors open told

right that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger are we a stranger and a pilgrim oh yeah and Boaz answered and said unto her it ha fully been showed me it has fully been showed Boaz beauti listen to what he says I love this listen to how he tells about her integrity that's why I told you this morning if you don't have any Integrity I doubt if you're in I doubt if you're ready right if you can if you can bust a brother on a deal there's something wrong with your experience that's right you're going to have more Integrity than that people you need to check up can you lie to your wife or a brother or sister there's something wrong with that Integrity a bck had more Integrity than you do and he was a king of he was a pharaoh of Egypt at least he told the truth he didn't know Sarah was Abraham's wife or he had never took her right God spared him see how much God loves Integrity amen you need integ and this Ruth will have integrity and Boaz answer Sor it ha fully been shown me all that thou Hast done right you see done sanctification sanctification unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother remember Jesus said that except you leave your father your mother you have no part with me okay and the land of thy Nativity and are come un a people which thou knewest not here too for remember when I read in Ruth how he said you came into a church the women look strange here you had bobbed hair earrings and makeup you're looking around your long hair no makeup and you're going that's what Ruth did see that's what brother man's talking about she went to a Strange Land and she's going wow these are strange people down here but you know what second third service she a't wearing makeup fifth six service earrings went split tailes up to here went you understand what I'm saying you know why they went cuz they seen you sisters and you were dressed right everybody got what I'm saying you're serving the lord you have sanctification she's seen it and they're GNA say you know what I'm gonna fall into that right that's the way it happens sure remember what brother Brandon said what people want to see today is somebody that lives the word that's right when these people comeing this church they're not just coming here that that Ruth is happed in here right she don't know you guys she don't know your Customs she don't know nothing about she happed in here does everybody understand but once she gets here she goes wow I like that they say they believe the Old Testament oh here oh Israel the Lord see they well they don't put away the New Testament they stay true to it and look at the women well they stay true to Deuteronomy 22 look at them and it brings that person into the message you understand it brings then all of a sudden you see they're a pilgrim and a stranger they evolve to what you are you can't go any higher than this man you people are going to evolve to this what about somebody that comes through the back door a new sister she's going to evolve to what you sisters are and she can't go any hireing you guys you understand what I'm saying you've been here 30 and 40 years you ought to have sanctification down sisters that's right you shouldn't be playing a game where we're at okay where did I in somebody help I'm awful well the Lord recompense thy Work in a full reward you get it full reward that goes back to Revelation 5 everybody see a full reward we're in full Redemption now we're starting to enter we're coming out of the partial now brother you agree in chapter five we're moving into the full reward is that right so he says look the Lord Rec recompense thy Work and a full reward be given unto you right given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou are come to trust Glory right I have in my notes Revelation 17:14 remember Israel is going to come under the wings going to be taken with two Eagle wings they're going to come under this same thing right they're going to start trusting the Lord too go read it Revelation 17:4 when you get home then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord lord didn't say Lords for that thou Hast comforted me comforted me who's going to be your comforter Glory Holy Ghost and for thou Hast spoken friendly unto thine handmade though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens and Boaz said to her at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers that's pretty good a't it I like that and he reached and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men preachers okay saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not right everybody hear what I'm saying amen you in the message you know I'm going to tell you something Boaz has kept your reputation right you know you have a reputation out there you know Boaz keeps that that's right you said don't you reproach her don't you ruin her reputation you have a reputation the only one that can ruin a reputation is you Boaz ain't going to do it right he told the preachers you keep their reputation everybody understand what I'm saying what he's going to preach to you you're the wife of Jehovah you're the bride right you understand that's what he he's not going to reproach you he's not going to ruin your reputation he's going to say good things about the bride is that right the only one that's going to ruin your testimony is you you you're your worst enemy right exactly and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose I like that handfuls of purpose right for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she hath gleaned do you see she's working she's doing something does everybody understand when you take barley out of the field and you beat it you're knocking the dirt off from it right do you know your barley and what your work is to knock the dirt off you're supposed to get the dirt off of you do you realize when you walk in Leo DEA your picking dirt up on you right and you need to take that you understand in the Old Testament the first fruits right remember they when when it was in April it was called abib which means green ears when what the high priest would do he'd walk out in the field when he seen the first group of green ears of barley he would take a handful of it and he'd say 50 days from now there's going to be a harvest right do you understand Jesus was that first fruits right right come on didn't he say he redeemed him off the Earth to redeem the rest is that what he said so he picked up that barley the high priest took it into the temple and they beat it with rods and they got an r a bow full of R does everybody understand that does anybody want to know what R is three and a half pints and he waved over the field a three and half year ministry right does everybody understand what I'm saying right you see Dani 70 weeks where I'm going he waved over them three and A2 pints down here in the well he took my church Joseph give me the church ages back yeah but at the end of the church ages what comes another three and A2 Ministry another three and a half of the son of man Ministry amen right right right and there's your seven that's the seven-year ministry that's been given to us right it's when Jesus was here in the flesh the first time that was waved over you and you all are coming to fruition you're going to look just like he looked she is him you ain't going to be any different Miss barley than what Mr barley was you're going to have green ears just like he has green ears you're going to look just like the first fruits that was raised over you was it oh yeah God waved him over you so down here see what we're coming we get another three and a half here at Harvest time now we got the seven-year Ministry the Jews got three and 1/2 years at the end of the 69th week that way right it wasn't 69 and another half week right he was cut off at the end of the 69th week he preached three and a half years right right that's what he pre to the Jews but they rejected it now he's going to come back with two prophets and preach another three and a half years of Son of Man ministry right two prophets one of them's going to be Elijah just like our Elijah Same Spirit exactly why wouldn't he preach the son of man Ministry though the last Elijah did and they're going to pre and now you got seven now he redeemed Leah by working seven years right he's redeeming Rachel by working seven years does everybody understand that's what he's doing but you have to glean in the field you need to be in Boaz field the message you need to be serving there right and you're going to find Grace in his sight and he's going to meet every one of your needs he's going to drop plenties of purpose for you for your needs is that what I read why can't you believe he's going to meet every one of your needs it's in the word brother ra said the bride will take him at his word hey I don't know what a bom inomics is going to bring but it ain't going to be good you may have and I'll be I I work 34 years at conical Phillips I made real good money I've got a lot of stock out there it could go tomorrow and I'm not going to cry baby around cuz I'm Ruth yeah and whatever I need he's going to give it to me I have confidence in him cuz if I have that kind of confidence I love him yeah remember confidence and love is the same so quit looking at your dollar bill ain't going to save you Boaz is what's going to Quicken you get your mind and affections on things above let's get it off the world and the things of the world we were talking remember them sheep that brother Ram said went down through that Marketplace I'm going to type it like can I use my own type I'm a typologist they're walking down through Babylon through Le O let's say Le oia that's where we're at walking down Le oia they didn't look this way they didn't look that way they followed the shepherd is what they did my sheep know my voice and another they'll not fall that's what we need to be doing with Ruth okay amen okay where we at then she said unto me find me find favor in thy sight my kind for thou H has Comfort well that's not where I'm at except beside the reaper and when she had risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young man sing let her glean even among the she and reproach her not not let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field in the evening beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an epath of barley and she took it up and went into the City and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave it to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed and her mother look Ruth suffice she gives it to Naomi you understand we're going to take this message back to Naomi I don't care what you say we're going to hand the Christ child back to her and she's going to nurse it does everybody understand that and by doing that they're going to raise old chillian and Men up old sickly and old Wier boy are going to come up you understand and that's that's got you under that too as a part of redemption you may be sickly today but God's going to raise you up as a part of redemption he's going to raise your name up in New Jerusalem I'm not going to that mortar over I'm going to New Jerusalem is where I'm going and God's going to raise me up at New Jerusalem and I'm going to have a name there is what I'm going to have right praise God where rought us thou blessed be that did take knowledge of thee and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought and said the man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz and listen to Naomi said huh see listen to it and naom was sent her daughter-in-law Blessed Be he of the Lord who ha not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead right does everybody understand the dead and Christ will rise they might have went down sickly they may have went down a whiner but they're coming up Boaz is going to bring you up right don't quit worried why you guys worried about stuff quit and now we said to her the man is near of Ken she didn't know that before does everybody know that she said what field have you been in right that's right where you been oh I've been in BO Boaz he's a de kidsman you see how Ruth man she perked right up right unto us one of our next Kinsmen I like this and Ruth the mo said he said un me also Thou shalt keep Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my Harvest you're supposed to stick with your preacher brothers sisters stick as close as you can to this man on the front row amen that's right right right until the end of the Harvest amen he'll lead you through know what brother this is where he got it I'm not joking this is where I believe brother random got those quotes I'm quoting you where he got them I believe see faith f final resting places in the word that little Kentucky fellow with the Kentucky language was quoting scripture and paraphrasing it in Kentucky ease I was telling him last night in the car Jesus said in Nicodemus 3 thou you must be born again do you agree where'd he get it that's right Ezekiel 36 yeah he said he'd give you a new heart right or he give you a new spirit right and put my spirit in your heart that's the new birth everybody understand Jesus paraphrased Ezekiel but those noad priests well you're not saying what brother random said I mean you if you don't quote a quote with some message verbatim oh my you're not sa they don't have enough Holy Ghost to understand you're keeping the continuity of the message does everybody understand that's what's happening around the message oh you got to quote it verbatim Jesus didn't quote the scripture verbatim and you know what the scribes are going you know what Nicodemus now he was a teacher he was a rabbi he was a big dog around there yeah he said can I crawl back in my mother's wom he said and you're a teacher in Israel right right you know y to say and you're a preacher in a message would it be fair would it be much different if I said that what you don't know these things you being a preacher of the message if I put some oky bonics art do you get confused with me and this guy like I said he talks in he's a Georgia guy you know what I mean I understand him he understands my OK bonings yeah now I may not be quoting the quotes at verba but he's got enough Holy Ghost to know I'm right and I got enough Holy Ghost to know he's right right what's wrong with some of the others I'm not saying we're I'm not saying we're the only two right there's a lot of them out there right but there's a lot of them out there wrong so be honest with you okay where did I end somebody tell me thank you and Ruth of Moab said he said unto me also Thou shalt keep fast by my young men till they have ended all my Harvest and Naomi sent unto Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field see there's other churches right sure you're not the only one that's right there's some other maidens in MO in Boaz field right there's other young men out there there's other preachers so you're not the only one I'm not the only one right exactly that's what I'm saying she so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean into the end of barley Harvest and of the weed heart and dwelt with her mother-in-law huh dwelt with her mother-in-law she kept with the Old Testament right she dwelt that's pretty close isn't it she dwelt with her okay and Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor do you know what Naomi was telling Ruth yeah about the kinsman redeemer yeah Ruth or Naomi the Old Testament has explained us what the kinsman redeemer is right did everybody get that right Naomi all of a sudden says oh he's a Kinsman she knew the law of kinsman redeemer right she knew the law the Old Testament right the Old Testament started telling Ruth he's a near Kinsman he can redeem me and in redeeming me he's going to redeem you mhm you understand yeah when Jesus died on the cross did he redeem Israel did he redeem you he paid the price of redemption right so you see you got to stay with Naomi if if you do away with the Old Testament how are you going to understand Kinsman how you going to know these you can't right you can't that's why people people out there in the world all the time they tell me oh that's the Old Testament they just want to throw it away but see they're identifying who they are that's bottom line right when somebody wants to get rid of the Old Testament even in this church if they'll say a that's the Old Testament you know did Brother ROM say that on tape huh brother ROM said you got to God don't change his mind about his word if you read it in the Old Testament it's not dead letter it's still it's God Amen do what it says serve in his field right stay as close to Naomi as you can right right these people driv me crazy out here right and he went with barley does anybody know what winnow with barley is let me read something here if I hold on I might let you oh my goodness okay I'm sorry I've already taken a long time but I want to read this this is a great story brother wow to listen to I'm going to tell you the last day what I like to separate or distinguish listen to wiow falsehood from truth he was winnowing he was taking the falsehood and the truth and separating them well that's what he's doing he's separating the true from the false yeah does anybody and I'm going to have to take time here I'm boy I apologize guys I hate taking this much time but this is just a to me it's a greatest story in the Bible look this is what happened when they wied when they went they went up on a mountain and they had a threshing floor everybody heard of that fling floor was a circle that had a door in it and what they would do they'd get in it with pitchforks they would throw it up and the heavy stuff the wheat would fall back down into the threshing floor the lighter chaff dirt would blow off the mountain does everybody understand that so God's going to take you up hither he's going to give you a revelation and that Revelation is heavy and you're going to fall back down in the threshing floor everybody got what I'm saying we're speaking of redemption you're heavy wheat's heavy because why you got a revelation Chap's like they don't have a revelation they're going to blow off some Doctrine two Lords is going to come along blow him right out it's going to happen now what we see happening right so that's what's happening he he was Boaz was up there doing that Boaz was doing that right now let me let me I don't know if I get it now let me do it right now does everybody understand a thief have you ever seen a thief work for something before he stole it no a thief a thief don't want to work that's why he's a thief if you steal from Brothers you're a thief you don't want to work for it shame on you this is what would happen in the days of Boaz when they were winnowing it they' go down and sleep in that door because look if I was a thief sister Peggy what you think I'm going to go out and reap that and work out in the field to get it I'm a thief I'm lazy that's why I'm a thief so what they do they throw it up and they got it down here all that Boaz lay down in the door that night remember he does that I'm coming to that he was winnowing barley does everybody understand that he was separating the false from the true and he lays down in front of it he's the door of the Sheepfold and he's not going to let something come in and steal you out of there because you're heavy with Revelation you understand see they want to come in Devil Wants you cuz you're heavy with Revelation but he can't get past Boaz right everybody got that so he laid there and he wasn't going to let the devil come in that thief and steal the weed out of there so as long as you got a revelation you're heavy with Revelation right you're going to be in the threshing floor and Boaz is going to lay there and not let anybody come in right right all that the father hath given me Glory will come to me and I'll not let the devil will not take a one of them right cuz why you're weak you're barley and you're heavy and you're going to fall straight down lord right you ain't going to let a wind of Doctrine carry you off out of here when you hear somebody preach a false Doctrine it don't take you out of here because you've been preached and given a revelation that'll bring you right back to your seat it'll bring you right back to this threshing floor does everybody understand right boy this is a pretty story isn't it where did I end somebody tell me where I end wash thyself therefore right and anoint thee and put thy arment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down see she's telling he's going to lie down at the thresh does everybody understand that he's not going to walk they spent 50 days out there working to get this in he's not going to let some devil come in and steal you at the end what kind of God would that be you understand what he does he's going to have you m completely mature he's let you stay in this field till all the greenness are cooked out though you're heavy with Revelation he's not going to let the devil pull you out everybody got that wonderful is he a wonderful God Amen where was I at I'm terrible that way I have to constantly but you know what you're staying awake aren't you yeah I want you to I want you to tell me where I'm at where am I at four okay thank you and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet right remember remember what I talked about feet you get it folks Redemption they uncovered his feet right type of redemption what did they do in redemp they took a shoe off their foot what did Moses do when he come to the burn took his shoes off blessed are the feet of those that carry the gospel Glory what is it I carry Redemption he carries blessed or the feet it's a type of redemption folks see all the way through it is I love that he shall lay down thou sh go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do right and said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do and she went down and see what all that she who Naomi everything the Old Testament tells me to do I'm going to do it amen that's a sign of being Ruth folks everything you tell me I'm going to go do it brother say if you don't do it you don't believe it right shows Redemption here and she went down into the floor and did according to all all all that her mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn you see what I'm saying and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight Midnight mid midnight that's where we're at folks I don't know about you we're at midnight right this is the hour right that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet right and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman right he put his garment on her right you lay down at the feet right at Calvary you're going to lay down at his feet right and he's going to put His Garment on you you understand right and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning as much as thou Fest not young men whether poor or Rich okay well they did fall young men in the field do you understand that yeah you you understand what he's saying you just didn't run out of the field just falling any old thing you know what I mean some preacher come along with this Revelation you run out there to that field right right you run over here somebody told me one time they said they said well I went to this church I went to that church I went to that church he said I'm not a church Hopper and I he just looked at me and now and I just stood there he said well I don't think I'm a church Hopper he knew he was a church Hopper by definition he was a church Hopper how many you seen Church hoppers in the message now that ain't all bad as long as you land on Boaz field that's okay you better find Boaz field and you'll h on to it you understand right but when you find that church you need to stay there you need to get the greenness cooked out of you need to get a revelation in you where you're going to land on the threshing floor right everybody got it and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people does know that thou art a virtuous woman right a't that wonderful and now now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than I do you know there was a Kinsman nearer than you the devil you were born in sin shaping iniquity he was nearer to you than God was right exactly something think about it isn't it he was a nearer Kinsman that's what it says but he don't want to redeem you not Ruth no he wants Israel but he could care a hoot about you boy you're just a dumb old Gentile you know that the devil don't care Hoot about you Gentiles right he wants you know why he wants Jerusalem he wants him to sit in the Throne of God right you know where God's going to set his throne one day Jerusalem and that what it says in Thessalonians he wants to sit where God says you know why that Pope's going to go to the battle of Armageddon to go get Israel cuz he wants to set his height right there where God's going to set one day that's what Israel is all about he wants to go occupy that he could care less about you Gentiles I'll redeem Naomi but I don't want that Ruth you you are worthless to the devil but not the Boaz you get it not the Boaz now is true that I'm in near how be in near kinman the night T this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman and he won't let him do the Kinsman part but if you will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down and until the morning what is she doing resting look this is what it well it ain't there now that's okay but the chart remember it said DEC deciding right serving right now what Ruth is coming into resting which is a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see it's what he does for you you understand baptism of ghost what you do you've come into he says I will do it now you rest right so baptism of the Holy Ghost is not what you're doing it's what Boaz is doing everybody got that okay and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor see he's going to save your reputation right he's God's going to keep your reputation right and also the world may not but he's going to keep it also he said bring the veil that thou Hast upon thee and hold it and when she had it she measured six measures of barley brother R said that's a 6,000 years right isn't that what he said right that's what it's 6,000 years of redemption does everybody understand so that's what he measured into her and laid it on her and she went to the city and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me where he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law right exactly then said she sit still my daughter still resting sitting is resting right until know till thou know till you have a re remember know is a revelation sit still till thou know he's done the work yes sir you got to have a revelation he done the work right B you set still with the baptism Holy Ghost till he finishes this thing I'm going to tell you brother B said that's where we're at now a quote he said we're now here and you're going to set still to a Boaz right you ain't going to be running to and fro like it says in Daniel you're going to be sitting with the Holy Ghost waiting until Boaz finishes this Redemption okay until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest lookie what is the Millennium it's when God's going when Jesus is going to rest right it's you and him in a rest brother Ram said a honeymoon a rest too though right did you ever work on your honeymoon did when you went on your honey did you have your wife out there digging ters boy if you did you're a sorry husband I'll tell you that no you're going to be resting in the Millennium you understand amen say still my daughter they don't know matter then went Boaz up to the gate right and set him down there and behold the Kinsmen of who Boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a
