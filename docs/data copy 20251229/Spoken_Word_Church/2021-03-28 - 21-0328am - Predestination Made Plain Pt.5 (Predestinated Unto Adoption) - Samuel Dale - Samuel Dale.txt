lord would would be with you brother luis will be getting his uh interpreter suit on where he can tell these people what i'm trying to say that's that's the best way to put it i guess amen but it's good to see everybody just pray the lord would bless remember all of the sick ones among us and and we we're down to word that brother colley is the only one that is uh still maybe on the positive end of it and all but uh he should be through with it it should be covering all of the things but it's just a lot of sicknesses that are different things or are you know not the viruses and etc but just something that you know in life of doings we don't blame everything on that but yet we still say pray and ask the lord to take care of everything all right now remember the lord willing next weekend wade in june will be flying out to be with brother chris long and them and for the services and also just pray that the lord would bless them in their journeys there and back the lord willing this coming wednesday brother aaron will be ministering for us taking the services there so we're doing that all right then next sunday uh it'll follow our lot to where that uh i'll be doing maybe the morning service brother bob doing the evening service and he said it was his birthday so that's that's be pretty good we get to hear him and and get to hear him you know preach about his own birthday so it's his birthday on that that'll be good you know but uh let's see is that all welcome the visitors i write myself a note you know to where i can remember all of the things but if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from in ephesians 1 and we'll take our thought from there and try to continue on in our understanding of predestination all right how have we come to the point of understanding how did the prophet teach it how does the bible teach it it teaches predestination by for knowledge those who he foreknew he did predestinate all right he set a journey for those he did for know so remember one thing now he foreknew all things so he foreknew everybody's journey you know that's the main thing to hold he he would uh understand and know what would take place and what would be in the hour that we're living but yet uh you know we want to just get into the thought and continue on our our kind of little notes and things so we go to ephesians 1 verse 3. let's be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now watch because remember what our heavenly places that's the believer's position right okay all right because that's heavenly places according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence what now having made known unto us the mystery of his will now what is his will his will is his word so what is the mystery according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to get a thought and just holding that thought the prophet said you know if you get something and hold it up before the people he said hold it there until everybody sees it all right then move on to something else so we've been talking about predestination for quite a while so it's very easy for us to drop back this morning with company we don't want to lose them and things in what we're doing we're trying our best to understand the word of god that covers us in our day preaching about what happened in the the prophet is wonderful we're that's great we're there preaching what happened in luther's day wesley's day zeus street what happened there what happened in all of those positions is great but how about where we're at to see the hour because see that's what we've been talking about what does predestination say predestination is a destiny set all right a destiny a determination you know a position or whatever is set for us in our do it in life and things and that's what is called a a destiny all right see then that destiny is set for everybody in the world because god foreknew all things so everybody has a destiny you say well you mean ever well what are you going to put it that would you wouldn't believe that everybody has a destiny everybody has a an appointed part because of god's foreknowledge and how does he predestinate how does he set a destiny to be by his for knowledge he could look down through time and see everything that would ever take place in the world if not then what kind of a god are you serving you know i serve a god that i believe that he knows all things all right and in knowing all things then he can set down a destiny because he can see what will take place so he looked down through time he saw all that would be there and he just set that for that but the main thing that he set was the word for each age remember how we've been trying to bring that the word for each age each age has a a part of the word all right you've got the seven church ages and each one of those ages has a part of the word of god and for it to be and to be made alive by someone amen all right so then we look back and we see well luther's done his wesley you know we go to paul irenaeus martin columbus you know we go through the bible of understanding the day and the time and knowing where we're at but what is the destiny for this age what is the determination or what has god set forth for this age not that he made it happen as we consider a lot of time thinking about predestination he desires that everybody be saved he desired that everybody have an opportunity for salvation all right then that desiring would put him to the bases that he would not just stamp it and say that's the way it's going to be no he would see it he would look down through time and see what everybody would do is any problem with that is any trouble with with that or thinking of that about our eternal god who is infinite who who uh you know doesn't have to think things over his first decision is his final decision he doesn't have to change his mind to make it fit anything it's all set all right see then he could look down through time and see what would be and he saw this you know covered he saw all the people of the old testament he saw david he saw moses he saw all of that and he could could put a point there before them that they would bring forth the part of the word for the hour that they're living we're living all right then you come into the new testament you pick up and you get into paul irenaeus the church ages and things you know and as you do then you can see that there was so much of the word for each age to be able to make manifest or bring forth or reveal or are to do all right and they've lived their ages all right now you just think about what we're trying to say they have lived their ages they have made manifest the word that was foreordained to come forth all right see then in that then it comes down to where we're at it comes down to our point of what we got we have the full word of god to be able to be brought forth in this age whereas maybe you know one of the ages behind you could look at something well they didn't have the amount of well that's true they didn't have the amount of word that we now have because we have the finality we have the fullness of god's word in this age i believe that you know no matter how long we're going to live here in this world and what it takes place that ain't got nothing to do with it what's to do with it is to be able to understand and recognize our day and its message okay yeah we believe brother branham was a prophet he brought the word of god unto us we thank god for that okay but now somebody has to make that manifest martin luther preached the just shall live by faith but the people is what made it manifest the pope in them didn't get mad at at luther he was doing fine they didn't get mad at him but when the people begin to rally around what luther was preaching then they begin to get upset see the enemy doesn't care as long as you're just dabbling around but when the people of that age and time begins to make manifest the word of god then all right so we see luther with his as we said a moment ago that then he just brought the part of the word that he had but see then wesley comes along with sanctification and bringing them into those things and as it does there's the word of god for that age okay and the people of that age made that manifest they brought forth into reality what was their age all right zeus street pentecost they had the word of god for the age that they were living all right they made manifest that you know they seen the things and they made manifest in in those days and some of you are old enough to remember especially some listening in of some of the end of the age maybe their timing there was with us getting older you know and you could remember some about the azusa street and the people and the the doings you know of of life and things and how they lived and they believed that word and by believing that word then they made manifest the word of the age that they were living all right see it wasn't up to luther to try to manifest wesley's message no it wasn't that it was just get his message get it right and get everything set in order and that would start the stages of the restorations and the things to come forth and see it would come forth in wesley you know the just shall live by faith then it would come into the sanctification or setting aside of the people you know and then it would come into azusa street with the baptism of the holy ghost the prophet said there's where the people made their mistake he said they got the new birth now i'm going to believe with him a lot of people you know i've even heard ministers in this message say the zeus street was false and they wasn't true well now i i don't agree with that at all i believe azusa street had the word of god for their age and time they manifested their part for their age in time and that's why i believe we must have a part of that it's not to just look back and see somebody else and see what they do we've got to come to a place to find out what is to be made manifest in this day all right azusa street see they started bringing back the gifts the word of god and things began to be restored to the church all right sure they cabbage down on that but that's why god would have to send a prophet in that age and the starting and and and to bring the word of god back to its purity all right then he would start preaching uh the things and bringing it forth come on down through the seals come on out through the entire word of god being made manifest as he was preaching the gospel and see people began to rally around that in back in years ago and and they moved on pretty good but then after a while it's now beginning to fall away because now the people are saying well you know uh brother branham was wrong here it was wrong here uh that's expected to happen because the devil is not going to quit i mean is he going to throw up his hands and say well that i can't well no no no he's going to do everything he can to try to destroy you enough and that's what we should be doing we should be thinking about it and studying the word of god in that realm or line of the age that we're living not to azusa street that's right i'm not trying to bring back azusa street with the gifts and all amen i believe in the gifts and i'll approach the prophet said a church without the gifts would have to answer all right so then we're responsible see if the gifts are not operating in this church then we'll have to answer for that one day because that's what is supposed to be done we don't we don't throw away what anybody has brought martin luther priest of joshua lived by faith he stood on that and the people rallied as i said around it and when they began to rally around it the catholic church got upset oh yeah right amen but see then it moved on up into the time of john wesley and john wesley began to preach sanctification a cleansing and setting aside of the of the vessels and things well if it did then he began to try to uh convert those that were behind and all like that but yet still he had to not try to bring luther's message he was to bring his own message the message he would bring would be the message that would bring the conversion right and see that's what it's to be to me and you the message that we have heard in this last days the bride the prophet said is to give birth to malachi 4. luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 and those things she used to give birth to that well that's our time that's our responsibility that's our destiny we have a destiny set before us today which is the entire word of god the entire word of god to be brought forth in this age because what's going to change the people what's going to bring these doing as i said the prophet will tell you zeus is street sure they were wonderful they've done a done a good job but they begin to cabbage down on what they were bringing and as they did then god had to move on he had to send a prophet with a message to brain all right and see we've got a message okay we're not looking for another prophet to come or somebody to do those things no it's already finished in that realm that the word of god has been brought unto us okay what are we to do make that word alive make that word manifest there's the destiny of this age all right see if you'll think about it the bible is so marvelously uh laid out and and having a prophet to express those things unto us to put it in order that is a marvelous situation because like i was covering the other day you know we read here and that paul speaks of and he says predestinated us unto adoption a great mystery that's right well we baptist we preach the great mystery but you know what we preached it as and it was right don't misunderstand me listen it was right in the basis that the gentiles being grafted in to you know to where it would be a gentile dispensation literally you know and the gentiles coming in to the re receiving of the word of god and as those gentiles become then see the jews begin to get all upset about it and they begin to fight paul and the tangs and their disciples and things you know the the natural jews then even the jewish people that tried to believe they begin to turn against the the gentile dispensation but that's not the mystery that paul's talking about it is part of the mystery yes or the engrafting of the gentiles amen we believe in that it is part of the mystery but it's not the mystery that he's speaking of of a predestinated unto adoption now you've got another word involved you've got something else involved instead of just having the engrafting of the gentiles now you've got the bringing forth of the word of god to where the gentiles are going to make manifest god's word see this is a gentile dispensation all right in doing that then it'll be made manifest in this day to finish it all up and you realize well what if it what if we you know another 40 years 50 years what we are all right but still somebody's got to carry the torch until that comes we've got to carry everything and line it up and if it's going to be 50 years 100 years still that has nothing to do with it right that that's that's turned not for us to look at you say you think you'll be no i ain't going to be around here 100 years i ain't preaching dummy uh i kind of think i believe the truth about it i mean i'm 80 years old i don't look to be around here another 100 years but somebody is if time lies all right well see i don't believe time's going to last i believe we are at the time and when the prophet was bringing it about this age is the age of adoption all right see that was what paul was speaking of not the end grafting of the gentiles he covers that later on he gets on over into the romans in a different one but he's covering it he covers it in galatians how the the air is is same you know until he's uh tutored and raised and different things he covers it in uh doing into the romans how that even comes down to the life's part would be the redemption of the body he covers that and relates it to adoption okay peter picks it up and puts it in and calls it in first peter he's talking about as newborn babes desiring sincere america the word that we may grow there by a growth development then he brings it on over in second peter is picking it up of bringing the stature of a perfect man add to your faith virtue knowledge temperature showing those things has to be made manifest here it was not made manifest back there in total reality sure paul and them had those things i believe paul and those brothers had it but they did not have the headstone to come to the church and see then brother branham when he would come that would be where he would be dealing and bringing the word of the truth of the seven seals and the opening of those things just trying to give a little run-through of fights to where we can understand maybe brother russ won't have to put me on the double this morning he has to he has to that's so southern talks to slow the brothers dunker he he just puts us on fights forward well that's that's doing very good again but i thought i was you know that was what i thought i was over in israel and uh this guy that was there he said sam slow down what they were a bunch of people with us were northerners you know in our group i said what do you mean he said you're slanging things of your words is off and said that's a lot of trouble but he said you're you're talking too feist i see you telling me i'm talking facts when them yankees is over there you know they're over there talking like a magpie to what we think about it but uh you know maybe brother russ could catch up okay but listen knowing the day and the hour that you're living is the main thing that we must understand for where we're at all right see keep these notes because i'll need them in the next message the next one coming on to where we can have an understanding so there's you that keep the notes doing all right and and they can put it on the internet to where they can hold it because a lot of times now i've been where i just quote something i don't read it off because that way it can be put forth all right but thinking about it the last message we preached was talking about what is your destiny what is your destiny huh well i didn't know i had a destiny well what are you doing you know what are you trying to uh make manifest or live see because these ages are saying each age had a word they had to fulfill that word all right that's part of the word of god that is the things it was doing in those ages all right but we come down to the finish of all things this is what the scripture says at the end of all things has come upon us all right we're not a doomsday trying to say the lord's coming tomorrow they said no no i ain't never preached nothing like that i ain't never done it so don't accuse me of it i have told you that we could last way on out beyond where we're at now but i didn't try to make that to where it would be a doctrinal idea i was just saying what i believe the lord showed me all right but see knowing that here we are somebody has to make manifest the word of this hour all right so it's your job it's your responsibility men women children whatever it is you realize that you living the word of god is what god has waited on amen it was trying to express you've got peter in him you've got a few of those back there of the faith of the fathers that they could have a great amount of the word of god all right they were always doing good and they were trying to bring it to teach us how to go on and come up the statue of a perfect man how to do those things but there were some things that they did not have understanding of you know and see then that way it has to wait and had to wait until the prophet could come and then when the prophet comes now the word is here see he brought the word all the way through to us all right now it's our job to take that word that he has brought let the fivefold ministry as the brothers have been trying to minister about wade especially take the five-fold ministry and let that fifo ministry break down into just straight terminologies or languages or ways and try to help us to understand what has been taking place among us all of these years and i believe that i believe god has been uh bringing forth his word you know i remember my memory goes back into the 70s and and the things where the when you you uh you know you just uh you mentioned adoption and the people just go oh we don't want none of that old deep stuff that is well i didn't know it was deep i thought the word of god was the most simple thing that there was when it's revealed see we went through those things and we were supposed to understand what was to take place and like i told you in 1969 i was preaching that the bride of jesus christ would be the word of god made manifest the son of man the lord jesus christ in a bodily form called the bride of christ living on this earth i was preaching that then and how much you think i believe it now but knowing too that that had to come forth into manifestation how do you think the prophet felt when he would stand out there and preach those great things and then the people would say you know he'd come to the seals and he'd say now just give me the questions on the seals now because we want to know what's on your mind well you know what was on their mind should we wear pantyhose should the women do this or should the women do that what about water baptism brother branham you teach for lord jesus christ when the bible seems to say father son and holy ghost how do you think he felt how do you think the man felt about trying to bring the word and there was babies and i call them babies because that's the way you and i are every born-again believer starts as a baby we all start as a baby in christ and grow in grace and knowledge i don't care how much you say you think you know and whatever if it's not made manifest it's not worth anything other than head knowledge all right well see we've been preaching these things for 40 50 years when my mind goes back and it did this morning just picking up and looking at it that you take the bible and and read it and see how that that the corinthians you know the word uh for uh corinthians ii first and second corinthians that means correction well there was the church that needed correction there was a group of people that had received the baptism in the holy ghost yes they knew by the new birth what it was but they couldn't go on amen and see paul and peter and all of them john and them was trying their best to tell them how to go on in christ but yet they just well i don't know you know i just don't understand uh you know i don't understand what what he's talking about here what does adoption mean what is it well then you have to go back and explain adoption you have to explain to the people what that adoption was when we was teaching that in the baptist church and i'm not throwing those stones at you or anybody but that's the god's honest truth we were teaching adoption we talked about adoption in the baptist church but we didn't have no understanding right of what it is and the truth really of it we done the best we could do but yet we taught some of those things back there and believing and trying to move on into it but the main thing is to get the people to believe it get the people to see it i keep quoting i always like to quote that because see the catholic church never got upset with luther oh they didn't like it they didn't like what he was doing and they talked about him and against him and everything no but when the people begin to rally around that message oh man they went after luther then because they knew they had to get him they've done everything in the world to try to destroy him right kill the christians of those days and things right because of what they were believing and you know who was killing the christian christians you ever thought about during the dark ages when they just take a woman up and cut her open and and grab the baby out and feed it to a hog and everything else trying to get them to deny jesus christ and you know who's doing it the church come on go back and study your history it was a church church was what was killing people name was trying to bring the truth to him to to protest the fact of what they were doing luther never wanted to get out of the catholic church i've read his own writings got it at home he didn't want to get out he wanted to convert to church he was going along with a lot of what they were saying but he wanted to convert to church but the church wouldn't turn they went back to catholicism all right but you see we're we're in another age another time it's not for us to try to protest the catholic church you know you don't see me get up here every sunday and preach how this an old catholic church is that old mother and that's this is another one it's all of these things that's not for us to preach that was for luther to preach that was for wesley to bring amen amen that was for azusa streets and him to bring yes ours is to take the entire word of god and fully understand it like i said then you say what is adoption okay adoption in the natural is you're adopting somebody else's children you know you adopt somebody else's children that's what you call adoption you go down you fill out all the paperwork you get all of the things done and they let you adopt that person that child into your family change the name making it to the name making them part of the family all right and see we have the new birth the new birth came on the day of pentecost luther had the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth wesley had the baptism of the holy ghost the new borough it was just the age and time that they were doing they had the new birth for their time and azusa street had the new birth for their day the gifts and the things happening all like that but they turned down the word when the word came forth to the prophet see then they stood with him up until a certain time they done pretty good with the prophet until he's preached through the 40s and the 50s began to taper off in the 60s that they wouldn't have him where he would start preaching to start with to 500 000 in india or something and he'd wind up preaching to half a dozen people in a trailer why because people turned him down who turned him down the church right who was against him the church when he tried to preach one true and living god who was the one that was against him the church when he tried to preach serpent seed and things like that and bringing forth the real truth of the gospel of the word who was turned against him the church when he got into adoption like i said we baptist preached on adoption but when the pentecostals got into it they just cabbage down to the point we've got the new birth that's all we need that's true if you want to die and go by the grave i'm saying to you in the little church i'm speaking to the little church not to anybody else anybody else out there is listening on their own account you know i'm not talking to you i'm talking to the little church you see we must step out on this message that has been brought unto us not protest the catholic church but it don't do no good to protest jeffersonville come on i'm not against nothing like that right i'm for the people of this message all around the world but what's wrong the people won't take the message and move on to see what's my what's my destiny you realize that what happened with martin luther when he started preaching to just shall live by faith that was what god saw before the foundation of the world and knew exactly that he would be that and there he stands why don't we talk about abraham and they like why did god choose those certain ones because he could see in abraham something that would be a contact that he could lead or be with him and no he saw in martin luther a man yeah a human being sure had a lot of problems a lot of troubles drank beer and sat in a pub and smoked a pipe that's no joke about it he would say amen if he was standing here because that's the things that they done because they didn't understand john wesley began to preach sanctification the lutherans got upset with john wesley when the people of john wesley's day begin to make manifest a thing and believing in sanctification and and cutting off those things and all the lutherans turned against them are you following me one age right after the other one age would try to bring the word then you'd see that age die down then you'd see the people running and fighting against that being against it see then when the prophet brought the message to this age he was welcomed in the 40s 50s 60s when he was preaching adoptions and the things of the word of god they rallied in that i've noticed a couple of them that i've got were that he was saying uh you know he said that message was a great accepted message of the you know hear ye him and he preached that constantly back in the in the late part of the 50s and then on into the 60s and preaching hear ye him to bring it to an adoptional stage to bring it to the point that we could understand what it was and what was it you're born a child all right but they had a way over there doing it and really if you'll check it you'll find out you're coming down from the romans and the greeks and the things with the adoptional parts but it was perfect for the word of god so paul could use it to explain what was happening and he was the great one to take all of those things and bringing it forth into the ephesians the romans the the galatians and the people that he could start teaching those people the word of god showing them what they need to be doing all right see that's what the prophet done in this day forgive me for coffins listen when he began to bring the message the people rallied around it but when he began to lay it down and teach it and bring it to a place a position that it was something in a life of an individual right adoption is we'll get back to these when we get into it you realize that the holy spirit is your tutor and you know that holy spirit being the tutor it teaches us and you know brother brown says that said see there said god said sometimes i have to kill the people you don't read all brother branham said you don't listen god allowed people to die he didn't kill nobody don't misunderstand me allowed satan to take the church and put it in the ground in isaiah right he didn't do it but he allowed satan to do those things looked like he would run to the church and rally around it that's what used to bother me when i first heard about it and and read like the the fox's book of martyrs and things you know back it even when i was first hearing of the prophet and thinking about how those people and thinking about what i was saying that while ago and you got somebody standing out there and they're they're killing that person and they're standing there saying you deny that god you believe you say i can't deny jesus who do you serve i serve jesus what's the problem you're serving jesus i'm serving jesus i used to look at that and wonder what in the world could people come to that they'd kill each other over or kill somebody over and they believe the same god yeah but you don't believe the god i believe well what is there another jesus yeah father son holy ghost yeah trinitarian doctrine the trinitarian doctrine is what killed the people and the trinitarian doctrine is the teaching of the trinity of the people of the religious world do you understand what i'm saying what would make the catholics want to kill anybody for believing in the same god they believe in unless it be they don't believe in the god you believe in come on they don't believe in the gods you believe in you try to explain to them the gods you believe in of the one true and living god that it's not trinitarianism it's one true and living god they're going to kill you for it again right because somebody one day is going to do it the prophet said it too many times he said one day somebody will stand up so the word the bride will come to the word and as she does says then the world's going to come after the bride this is i told you with this viruses and stuff like that that's not though no no tribulation that's a tribulation that worketh patience i was reading sister trudy gave me a a book to to do and they told in there about the people from uh 165 a.d this away and there's been over 500 million people died of viruses one of them alone was 200 million people you know what most of those done within one year that's according to them no they even give the dates of where it started or it began to taper off and ended up most of them the longest any of those viruses ever lasted was like five years 500 million people that's not the tribulation that's pre-tribulation that's tribulation the work of the patients see all right so you say well let's it's poured out on us no we're not under no tribulation if you are you're under the wrath of god tribulation means the wrath of god poured out upon you it is not because you get sick and you have this virus and you have that one or you have this bug that takes so many whatever that's not tribulation that's tribulation at work with patience that's a pre-tribulation you've heard the prophet in the seal vote get into it a pre-tribulation to where people would die he said i was looking at one this morning he said uh cancer would be like a toothache no well look at the viruses that's going around look what's taking place but it's tapering off now right well how long have you had the virus come on you don't think about what is being said and what happens how long has the virus been in effect a little over a year right now it's tapering off well is it odd then i mean i'll give you the book i'm not trying to promote a book or anything but i'll let you read it to where the that most of those viruses only lasted like one year and then it would begin to taper off and die of 200 million people die in one year but that's not the tribulation tribulation is when the wrath of god will be poured out upon the people but there won't be no prey and there won't be no virus and there won't be no uh go down and get a shot to take care of you'll die right in your flesh and just rot the animals just come and eat right off the flesh as you're still alive that's according to the bible that is coming to a tribulation all right what you see the bride of christ crisis to go into rapture she's not to go through the tribulation she goes through the tribulation that make us patience she has her troubles with all the world sure we're under all of the things that's happening to us is having all we're not immune to sicknesses as a matter of fact the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord leadeth out of them all it speaks of maybe more for us than it does for others i tried to tell you when this first started i said this is not the tribulation church i said this is this is tribulation that worked with patience how many people has died of this thing but i'm praying and hoping that it'll do like the rest of them it's tapering off on hope because that's what they're saying now all right but see the bride don't go through the tribulation she goes in the rapture for the tribulation takes place but what about them poor old jews that'll be there even the chosen of god 144 thousand they're going to be in the tribulation the world is going to be in a tribulation where there won't be no it will be the wrath of god poured out it won't be that you can pray and god will hear you that's tribulation when there is nothing just you scream and cry or you want to at least you can go get an aspirin for a headache but what time the time comes when nothing don't work then you're talking about tribulation it's not supposed to be upon the bride so then we were we were going to get out of here before but you know what's going to cause us to get out of here is the revealed word that was brought unto you and i by this prophet messenger that is made alive by someone why is it that the the diseases is not supposed to come on you because of what you have inside of you don't mean that you won't get sick and things can happen but you can pray what about a time when it doesn't do no good to pray that's right he said well that sounds like doomsday that is but we're not supposed to be there we're supposed to be in the rapture what is the life stage of adoption according to romans we'll get back to it romans 8 to wit the to understand to wit to witness to become a part of a something that will take place that these bodies are going to be redeemed the prophet said that will take place at the resurrection because it'll all transpire right in the resurrection change in the moment of 2011 and i step off this earth why because we believe the word of god because somebody's going to believe it and going to stand on it somebody's going to say it's for me you said well but i just can't see this for me brother well why can't you what's your problem that's right do we believe god see these sicknesses you say well they've come among us they've come among everybody there's no such thing as saying that that we're immune to sickness because we're a bride of christ but now listen you say what the prophet said it okay now you handle it you got the pulpit come on you handle it no you ain't gonna do it you're gonna all you're gonna do is run your mouth when you get it home but run your mouth over one thing the bride of jesus christ as long as that blood of jesus christ is here and it'll be here until the change of these bodies that's going to be there for you and me to be able to pray and god will hear us and honor our prayers but he's waiting on somebody to step out he's waiting on somebody to just step out and believe it and say that's for me that was why i was so thrilled when when you began to tell me and there i was in the hospital and things and saying well the world they've got you on the internet they've got you on this you're in all of the countries we've got it brother dale we put it out everywhere and they're praying for you well thank god because somewhere it may not be for one person and i ain't worried about it i'm just saying it that way it might not be but one person that was praying but god heard that's right well and the most of you have been taken care of that the fact that you didn't get the viruses and things and even if he did it's turned down into a smaller case well maybe it had to strike me and my wife where we could stand on faith and one thing and say we're going to make it through we're going to make it through this time we're going to pray we're going to get a bride people around the world to rally around the prayer line and pray for god to take care of these things somebody's going to come what is adoption to be the natural story of adoption as i said you adopt into your family a child make them part of your family all right now see in the spiritual part it's you that have received the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth all right your new birth is not your adoption we'll read these later on but we've got them laying here it's not your adoption to your new world the new birth is you coming into the body of christ as a child of god adoption is when you take that child and tutor that child and train it for all of the times and it comes out to be a child of god with understanding and and then god can take it out and give it full authority as i said what did paul do paul took galatians explains it if you want to study adoption read these let's see i wrote them read galatians especially the fourth chapter read romans especially the eighth chapter read ephesians especially the first chapter read first peter and read second peter and you'll see what god is expecting out of you and me somebody's going to make that manifest somebody's going to stand on this word and say god is real and he's bringing all of these things to pass and we're not afraid of him i honestly can say i could lay there at a hospital by myself and nobody around and nowhere to talk to anybody but yet i was never afraid there was never a moment of fear there was a moment of rejoicing to find out that people was praying for me that was a rejoicing time not a fear you see you're not afraid of dying no i'm not afraid of dying that's that's the problem if you're afraid of dying you've got a problem you need a new birth see that's the first thing that we need the first thing we need is the new birth do you have that because there's no need of talking about how you become adopted into the family if you don't have the new birth if you're not born again don't worry about adoption it's not for you it's like the prophet says that it was a child that never proved to be a a trooper or the tutor couldn't bring that child up to a position of you know a adult hood or acting like it that child stayed a child he stayed a child of god but he was never adopted now i'm going to say this whether you like it or not then you're going to see the days of martin luther they had the new birth but could never reach adoption because they never understood it the days of john wesley they had the new birth of sanctification even your prophet said they had the new birth they were in the body of cry but they never reached an adoptional stage azusa street coming to be the greatest of all of the movements of god signs and wonders and gifts and all working but yet they never come to adoption like we were talking about the other day why why would people be so you know odd i never have understood this because you know here's brother branham i'm just not making a joke but i'm just talking here's brother branham stands up there and he says now uh you know said there's there's graham said that's g-r-a-h-a-m he said that's six letters right in the name and said we've never had a worldwide evangelist or anything like that with that ham on the end of it until billy graham and he thought the world he said he had the baptism of the holy ghost i believe all right and he said here he comes with that but said there's got to be somebody come to pick up higher and get 7 is the right number with god well why didn't somebody sit there and say seven then now billy graham g-r-a-h-a-m that's six who's this guy by preaching william marion branham seven seven seven you know that they had his name was changed brother brown's name was originally graham his father changed his name why didn't somebody get up say who is this guy what'd you say your name was how many letters in your name i got 21 of them i got seven in each one well maybe this is the guy we need to be looking for no they were still looking for the guy they were still trying to find the malachi 4. when he was even telling them his name was telling it even showing him mathematically everything was correct do you think they'd believe him oh they believed him while the guest was working right sure he was a prophet guest was working but what about like wade was talking about the other day what about when he began to tell that catholic church and all that there was not one whole church converted you know what i'm saying nobody no age no people got converted to those things what are you trying to say brother dale i'm trying to say one thing church somebody has got to make this message live when are we going to start believing it that's right and believing it's us and accepting it to being that simple yeah but i i don't believe we'll ever be nothing like that well then where are you and what are you expecting who's going to do it could it be that you don't have the new birth cause the new birth is supposed to teach you that you're a child of god adoption is not the new birth the new birth is to realize you are a child of god born into the family of god then adoption is to positionally place that child into full authority when are we going to rally around the message of the hour if not we're going to keep on dying and going by the grave you can say what you want to but that's what the lord spoke to me about 40 years ago and i never had no references and never have any references to anybody or anything but the reference was the one thing the biggest portion of the bride of jesus christ is going to die and go by the grave because they cannot come to the adoptional stages that is required for this age to be done why because they will not accept it they've got their own ideas like one man said said that statue of a perfect man he said that's deep we said that that uh um ii peter that's simple that's the same thing but yet to him see that meant something what are you thinking about what are you thinking while i'm talking what do you mean brother dale if you think that we've got to become the word if not what are we here for let's go home it's raining out there you shouldn't be like that well why somebody's going to stand on it and believe who they are now that'll be just like maybe what the prophet said he said the people would come to a place that they'd say you know the tribulation starts falling and things start going wrong and they'd say but we thought we was to go in a rapture that we was to be go and leave out of here before the tribulation but we thought see come on direct quote if you need it people would come to that basis of saying i thought the church is left up to me and you that's what i'm that's bearing on my heart more than anything in the world because that's why i just picked to go this way this morning and not not go with the notes for one thing we have got to stand upon what has been brought to us and we haven't played six and seven little messages along the way to try to get you to understand we've been talking about this for 50 years come on how long have you been here how long have you been here brother ray 20-something years some of you been here 40 50 years brother colley brother daugherty 50 years you know for one thing for sure that i've hollered and screamed about this ever since you've been here at least like that brother was saying there the other night he said you know that you talk about brother uh ron spencer when he was at one of those meetings preaching that we needed this we needed that we need it isn't that but see where did it do any good for the ministers where did they pick that up and start preaching that we're around this message have they picked it up and and tried to teach adoptions and their things oh they're beyond that oh yeah we're beyond that we've we've already we got the new birth well that's what your prophet said now listen i've got them laying at home and some with me your prophet said that's where your pentecostal people thought that they got the new birth and that was and he said and they did right he said and they thought that that was the end of it that that was all that was required i'm telling you to be changed and go in the moment between requires more than a new birth of luther's way age or wesley or zeus or street amen if it's true that the life stage of adoption is to wit to understand the redemption of the body the prophet said that'll take place at the resurrection [Music] well if it's true then that's what's going to take place but you know what your resurrection is inside of you by the baptism of the holy ghost you have with inside of you the thing that will take you in a change that's why there's no fear i'm not afraid of all of these viruses or whatever takes place because we're not supposed to be here under a tribulation like you're trying to make it but we can be here when this thing becomes so physically bereft until we don't even have food to eat well now god's not going to let that see there's where you've got your pity pattern without you thank god you think your god is not able to handle all of these things god knows how to separate what tribulation is to tribulation that work with patience he knows how to bring things upon you and i that can even take members of our family i'll quote it to you from the prophet but i can read it to you you just got your notes you just run through it and you'll find him saying that the holy spirit said i even took their families i made them sick and said they stood on the word and still believe me to be the healer the deliverer the thing then now take them out and adopt them the one thing that i've never understood of people the prophet said he'd take you out on the back side of the desert um he said preach you would give something all right out on the back side of the desert he said then you'll come forth to be a child of god the way that he wanted it well one brother said one time he said because he's been a little bit sarcastic maybe i was too okay he said something about you know the the like that the authorities and the things you know and he said well you know you're just saying that you've got it and we ain't i said ain't never said nothing like that because i believe it's for the entire body of jesus christ but i believe i'm a part of it i'm a part of the body i'm a part of the fifo ministry and i believe that you say does that make you no don't make me nothing see because he is the fifo minister adoption is sonship coming into being now i don't know where i have it let's see let's see if i can find that yeah let me just read you a few things from other translations beside the king james romans 8 and 23 speaks of to wit the redemption of our body listen to what one translator says longing the adoption that shall ransom our body from its bondage these are other translators you know while we eagerly await our full our full adoption of sons the redemption of our bodies full adoption redemption that's some good thought as we wait for full sonship in the redemption of our bodies as we await that right of sonship that involves our bodily redemption what we'll write for a redemption of our bodies which will mean that it at last we have realized our full sonship in him for the eager outlook of creation ardently awaits the revealing of the sons of god for the longing of the creation looks eagerly for the time when the glory of the sons of god shall be revealed this is what other translators i got a book that's got 26 translations in it and it's wonderful to talk and see what they were talking about i don't go by that i still use the king james i don't know you doctrine but but i still read some of these all creation is yearning longing to see the manifestation of the sons of god for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of god for the creation waits impetuously or what he pronounces for god's sons to be made known waits for the revealing the declaring the sonship the whole creation is at tiptoes to see the wonderful sights of the sons of god coming into their own longing for the adoption that shall ransom our body from bondage so you get different ones eagerly awaiting our full adoption the redemption of our bodies await the right of sonship that involves our bodily redemption sonship sonship will end with a bodily redemption you're not wanting to do that you're not wanting to have that part you're not thinking about it then in the age that we're living that this is our time where else is there anybody to come forth where is the promise in the bible for another group of people to come forth we might not be that people well i don't know but i'm part of it i'm glad of that that what little bit i can understand i like but a bodily redemption the lord jesus christ body was bodily redeemed not because he was sinful but because he had a beginning see our bodies are going to be changed one day into the glorious image on our body like unto his glorious body that's sonship you know how you like you you know you're proud of your children when people brag on you as a man was a friend of ours at a bank there at home he told me one day he said sam he said you and your wife must have done a good job said you've done a good job raising the kids well you know i like that you're patting on your back yo that's good i like what he was saying because that meant more to me than it would if a joe blow off the street walked up and just said you you've i'm talking about somebody with full authorities and things that understood something had to bring forth into manifestation in a life or whatever for him to be able to fully say those things and i enjoyed it are you not proud of your children oh yeah sometimes we'll beat the daylights out of them you know scream and holler at them and everything in the world but you know what they're still their children but you know what i like about god in his ways i'll get back to this those who do not come to the point of a full adoption are going to have to go by the grave that's the point i'm making because each one of these relationship was to a bodily redemption is the life's part of adoption is your bodily of den redemption right did you follow that and the last thing is the bodily redemption all right see then if you don't come to full authority you're going to go by the grave well then was the lord speaking to me and telling me what the truth was when he said the biggest portion of people will not be able to come to the chains of the body and you know what i may be the biggest one of all of them i'm not i'm saying that's what he said i'm not trying to say i'm not going i'm going to be there i believe i'll be there i hope i'll be there at least i'm confessing that i'll be there and i'm not sitting around dilly-dallying waiting on something else or blaming you for what my troubles well brother dale brother so-and-so preaches so much greater than you if we can just get him to come preach to us name him we'll get him name him we'll get him no problem because you see i'm wanting to get out of here i am getting tired of this old 80 year old fella that i'm living in right i'm getting tired of that but you know what i'm saying thank you lord for letting me live this long i do you ever thank him for me i thank him for him letting me live as long as he let me live and to see what i've seen through the opening of the word come on musician through the opening of the word of god be able to see god made manifest in the way that he wanted it to be he's waiting on you and i adoption time when he can pour in his fullness in the baptism those are direct quotes 50 years quoting those things to try to get people to see it try to get them to understand that we have to come to a position to be manifested sons and daughters of god because what does manifest mean what is the word manifest you ever looked it up it means to make known it means to make known the making known are the sons and daughters of the living god what a wonderful hour what a wonderful time that we have that we can rejoice and and be happy in all of it and to do it let's stand together anybody have a need the altar is open we try to remember one thing as long as we're around here we will need bodily redemption and in doing that the sick we get well but thank god for the healer thank him for the deliverer thank him for loving you and me what we got brother that sounds like [Music] there'll be no tears [Music] he's been having a lot of trouble since the wreck as we see and we believe you that by your stripes we thank you we committed all to you now we send this work off in amen anybody else that sounds like [Music] we've heard of all these great glorious things i want to go see it [Applause] i want to go see it you know you give me something you say well it's up here in new york you got to go i want to go see it i want to go and see it [Music] but the main thing i want to see is my brothers and sisters that have preceded me [Music] i remember sister clena used to say it this way she said i'll just beat you up see what she was saying was the dead in christ she'll rise first so she has to go on see the cities raise up what a wonderful day in an hour that we have time to think about [Music] jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's here for all that we have leo there's no need to be afraid of anything as if you're afraid then
