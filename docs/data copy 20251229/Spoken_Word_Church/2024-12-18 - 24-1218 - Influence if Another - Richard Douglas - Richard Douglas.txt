church and we either we'll either leave better or we'll leave worse but I'm so glad he always said we can always leave better and the only reason we'll ever leave better is because he's here and I'm so thankful that he's here he's come and I appreciate what the prophet told us he said ever since the day of Pentecost when two or three have gathered in his name brother B he's here amen it's humbling it's humbling to know that we serve such a God that would love someone like us it humbles you because you realize that you had nothing you could give to him you nothing you could offer him nothing could you trade for what he give you even your own life is not worth what he did but that he loved you so much that he he became your sin that me and you might become the very righteousness of

something I keep telling people you better get ready see you ain't hanging around for no reason amen we sure love you can't say enough about you I won't keep you standing much turn with me to the book of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6 you pray for him put on the gift I know God will give you what you have need of nothing I could give you but he's already going already give it to us amen he G he said he sent forth his word and it healed them amen Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6 start at verse one I'd like to take a little thought tonight the influence of another the influence of another says in the year the king Uzziah died I also o saw that I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the serpens each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth think about this is full of his glory and the post of the doors moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the syrups unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he said and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this have touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me oh Father Lord what a trembling EXP experience Lord to be in your presence here this evening Lord father realizing that Humanity has no power man has no ability he has nothing he can do nor nothing can he say father so father I Surrender myself Lord to you Lord You're the great speaker Lord You're The Interpreter of the word Lord you're the one that comes Lord and speaks through man Lord you made that choice you said I'll speak through man father we're your I'm here being your agent Lord father I pray father now that you Lord just move Lord move me out of your way Lord in such a way father that the people would not see a man but see God speaking through a man God that's what we come for Lord we're so hungry for you Lord we're so desirous of you Lord father we don't want to just send out just a mere invitation to you Lord we want want to make you welcome Lord we want you to be welcome we just don't want you to be a spectator we want you to take preeminence Lord now father move Lord come and speak to us Lord that's what we've come to hear Lord that we might receive Faith to press the battle Lord to keep going father we love you and we thank you for this opportunity father we ask you now Lord to help us in Jesus name I pray amen and amen you may be seated I like how the scriptures begins to read this and as I look at this I as a first verse in chapter six I look at this and it says in the year that King Uzziah died I would like to ask us a question tonight what king in your life do you need to die come on what king needs to pass away that is influencing you from being what you should be in Christ is it anxiety is it sickness is it discouragement whatever it is though it it took this because this King was such a holy king such a righteous King but it took this King Isaiah had his eyes on that King more than he had his eyes on God and when that King died then God was able to get him back in where he should be back on his Focus which is God as every man of God we must keep our Focus On Christ as Christians he is the preeminence he is everything in mine in your life he must be the complete focus of our life and it says and and when we get out of that it wasn't that Uzziah wasn't a good man but he got out of place he got to a place to where he was so exalted in himself God had blessed him in such a way that he thought he could do whatever he wanted to whenever he wanted to and whever you wanted to but you can't do that you still have an order that God has and God orders us us to follow in that order that's why God had to send us a prophet to put us in order that we might be able to be spoused to Christ as a Chase virgin there had to be an order there had to be a restoring back of the word it had to come back to the place had to bring us back to the faith of the fathers it wasn't that Faith was gone it's because brother Terence man had had moved us away from it right and moved us to his ideas just like Uzziah did he had an idea that he could become a priest but you know what he wouldn't he couldn't do that because that was not God's order and that's why he become with Leprosy which the Bible tells us that that's brother B told us that leprosy is not only a natural leprosy but a spiritual leprosy through the his Disobedience God tried to tell him you cannot do this and God had to take him away but I love how the Lord does I look at how this how we as we begin to look at this and he talks about all the reverence and coming into that presence and a lot of times we sometimes we come to the house of God just halfhearted and and just you know we just drag in and and drag out but we need to come with that expectation because we're not here the because of the building we're here because God's here we've come here for the purpose that God might speak to us and change us from what we are to a new and a better creature than we are than we are and I as I begin to look at this I begin to look at this and the power and the reverence in his I believe that's lost a lot of times around the message I don't know what a lot of people make the messages but the message is Jesus Christ if your message ain't Jesus Christ you missed it you missed it because brother BR said I come for one purpose I come here to build a platform that he might stand on brothers and sisters he didn't come for himself he come to point us back to Christ that's right back to the original word which is the Original Seed which brings the original life amen and as we look at that I like what it says that it says that when there was Angels was flying around there they covered they was covering everything in respect because there was such oh glory be to God I'm about to shout up here this morning this tonight there was such an influence of the Holiness of God that they covered themselves as in reverence to God amen oh hallelujah amen brother and they begin to say they begin to cry holy holy holy is the Lord God of host and it said it and it said when he spoke when his voice when this the doorpost touch power and the voice and the authority of God that's the way this word is amen this word is not a man this was God speaking through a man to us right said that the doorpost even Shook at the power of His voice and I believe that's what happened to me and you this message came out brother Terence and when it heard it hit the doorpost of our heart and we shook and it said wake up this is your call it is your time Rise and Shine for thy light has come glory be to God and then when he got into this when Isaiah got to this place he began to repent brother brother Brown said you can never go before God and not and talk about your brother or talk about your sister because when you get in the real presence of God you see how bad you need him and how dirty you are and how no good you are then you start praying oh God help me God help my brother God help my sister God help me he said woe is me he didn't say nothing about the children yet he said woe is me I'm a man undone with unclean lips among an unclean people he BR it back to himself but I love how the Lord was reing after the influence of Uzziah was there he come God sent an angel oh glory be to God did not we get an angel that was sent to our Prophet amen did he not do the same thing and bring him to that place he had to re there had to be an angel come and bring the restoration of the voice of God back through a man oh Hallelujah don't you love the word don't you thankful for this message people say I can take you just we just take the Bible you don't know nothing about the Bible I don't know nothing about the Bible God had to restore our knowledge and our understanding and bring us Revelation in the scriptures now the Bible brother Bob has become a new book amen amen glory be to God that's right so he took the with the tongues and took a coal the fire remember BR said a man should not be behind the pull pit unless he's met the pillar fire for itself that's why there's such a mess around the message is because men have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but see God had to set him in place in such a place that we could receive we could receive God in such a way oh Hallelujah see and when he did those things he said he said I am a I am a man of unclean lips for my eyes I've seen the king the Lord of hosts he said then one flew from the serpens and said unto me having a live Cal in his hand which is taken with the th with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this have touched thy lips and thine iniquity has been taken away it takes God to take the iniquity out of a h out of our heart and out of our mouth remember James said the tongue is an unruly member he said they can't even the whale can't bring out sweet and bitter water but the tongue can curse and bless out of the same mouth and so he he needed to be Pur not there only there he said taking his iniquity away and thy sin purged though our sins be as Scarlet they're white as snow look at that then and then look God put him in service there had there had to be a there had to be a call he said in verse eight also I heard the voice of the Lord that's what brother Brown said that's what moves the bride she won't move unless she hears thus sayith the Lord said I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go forth he could not receive his Commission in being service the proper way until he had went through this transformation in his life then the commission become very Supernatural important to him right then he could walk in like God wanted him to walk in he could speak like God wanted to speak he could live like God wanted you to live and I love how he said that I remember that as the Lord was dealing with me stepping into the ministry and the Lord kept bringing this scripture back to me about going you know and you always claim well you know can't talk I'm I'm always nervous around people and I ain't a good speaker but he don't want to hear none of that that's right he just wants you to surrender to him he wants you to get in there and get the Holy Ghost in your heart he said I'll put words in your mouth Richard I'll speak through you you don't need I don't need you I need you to surrender all I need you to do is completely trust me put your whole confidence in me then he said who'll go for us then Isaiah said I'll go send me see in order for us to complete the Commission in our lives there must be a death there must be a death there must be a dying out there must be a killing to bring us to that place and he had to be kill that influence that he had and that influence that he had over over Isaiah listen to what the prophet said and the prophet said a lot of good things about uzai but he made some mistakes look at what I love how the prophet in the message influence of another he said now influence we find out that uah's life influenced this Prophet right until until such a place that uzzi rather built walls and strengthened himself and took back grounds and possessions that belonged to them from the Philistines so forth until his Fame went all the way to Egypt and I tell you of all the all the chronicles of the Kings there was none of them outside of Solomon that spread forth like Uzziah did then he puts a question he says why why was this because he was doing what God say when we do what God says God abases and God exalts and man he said because he set look at this brother and sisters as Christians we are here to set an example to this world that Christ is still alive he says because he set the example he stayed with God no matter what his people thought what anybody else thought what he what the politicians tried to influence him he stayed directly with God and God blessed him it was a great help to the young Prophet cuz he was learning he was being influenced by obedience Hallelujah and that's what that we need to be influenced by God ask us to be obedient and as we look at this in the same message brother begins to speak says now but when this King got to a place there's a place brother Bob sometimes we get to a place there's a Crossroads come on there's a place where we follow still follow God or we start following our own will we get get to the place where we're so lifted up we get to so place where we think we got so much power brother Aaron so we think we can do whatever we want to say whatever we want to and God will still back us but he don't do it he only backs his word he said got to got to a certain place being such a great man and influencing Isaiah and the righteousness of course of his kingdom listen to what Welly this is I love this little I love these little nuggets he said he got to a place he got to feeling self secured come on that's right brother that's where we mess up we get to the place think we're all right I've got so far I'm all right now I don't I don't need no more ain't that what this age has done Satan wants to get you to that place where you think yourself secured that's right you know what self-secure means feeling secure in oneself or one's position dangerous place to be I'm realizing that we the reason we are righteousness is because we're in him he became our sin that we might become his righteousness he said listen to this and there is where you make your mistake when you get to the place where your self secure he said there is where so many righteous men bite the dust of Shame preachers prophets teachers sons of God Daughters of God we get self-secure get complacent satisfied well I've been in the message 340 years that don't mean nothing Satan wants you to get secure in what you've done how long you stay you ain't been here that long God has kept you here that long God has secured you God has kept you amen he said bite the dust of Shame bite the dust of defeat is because they begin to feel self-secure you begin to think that you have lived so long in Christ that no matter what he presents before you you'll take your choice whether whether you want whether he wants it or not that's right choices choices see Jo Joshua come to a place he come down there told him he said you got to choose today who you going to serve you're going to serve the gods of Egypt are you going to serve God he said ask I love how he did that he was so personal to him brother he said ask of me in my house will serve the Lord amen y'all all walk away y all go on the websites that's all right none of these things move me glory be to God he said you've got to continue to serve God no matter what you was back 10 years ago he said it's what you are now the king got to a place that he thought within himself that he got lifted up listen to what brother Bram says about this Pride got in his heart ain't that what caused Satan to fall yeah iniquity proud brothers and sister we got a lot of proud people you know what I'm proud of Christ amen I have nothing to offer him except my surrender to his will complete obedience to his word he said and that's what happens to us he said if you'll pardon this expression that's what happens to our church throughout the Country Pride what is pride pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfactions in one's own achievements ain't that where Satan got to oh yeah Satan got power he said look at here look boy I'm telling you a can't nobody play music like me ain't nobody get this worship service going better watch it better watch it you better be getting your bringing your worship to God Amen not to yourself we're not here to put on a show we're not here to show our abilities or our talents if we bring any other worship than worship to God we're in trouble we see this in festing the message bringing in worldly music worldly beats take it from a man knows I was right in that stuff and people say sometimes I'm too hard on people say you harp on I said I'm not I ain't got a problem with worship if it's worship God if it brings you to the see the word the music comes to get you ready for the word amen amen it don't come for no other reason amen amen It prepares you for the word To Go For It prepares you for the battle it gets your what it does it drives away your self-will and your self ideas that you might enter into God's word amen amen we realized that every every everything is motivated by spirit amen that's why he tells us in 1 John 4 beloved believe not every Spirit brother man said you can have everything hey I've been to ball games and there's anointings there amen anointing there's an anointing for that stuff went to concerts there was anointing there wasn't anointing to God but it was anointing you could it affected you brother's parents it affect you right does it but it didn't affect me to serve God it affected me to sin right it affected me in such a way I thought I was okay but the when the real true worship come comes and the real it gets you the place to start to repent and saying God face anything going on right now before the word comes cleans me that's right make me whole amen I don't want nothing to hinder this service somebody might need healing God somebody might need Deliverance father let there be nothing between me and you but the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they're of God or not because false prophets are gone out into the world brother Brown said anything that's anti- word is Antichrist and you know what I love how the prophet Mak so simple to us brother B he said you want to know where a man stands give the word to us I've never seen so many people brother they get mad when you tell them what the word says you tell them what the prophet they get offended by I said how how can you tell me you've been born in the spirit of God and the word of God offends you right I said either you got a wrong Spirit or you've never had his spirit either way you need Deliverance amen glory be to God and see the Lord showed me this about music first thing that Satan did was his music changed brother Terence then the worship changed when the music changed the worship changes brother B and then when the worship changed guess what his Doctrine said he said I'll exalt myself above God I'll set in the synagogues of God and be worshiped as God and said iniquity he was found in his heart he was Pride he was such a preacher and so influential imagine that here is onethird of the angels that never knew nothing but God and here's an here's one here's another angel that tells them you need me if you don't need God right ain't that the way a lot of Ministries get you need me in order for you to make it you we we need a pastor we need a Shepherd we need a man but we follow him as he follows Christ when he gets away from the word we have to get away from him amen no try every spirit I like what the prophet said in the German Spirit 1960 he said you're trying to achieve something a true prophet of God a true teacher is trying to bring the church to a Unity of spirit a Unity of spirit that they may recognize God boy I love that right don't you same message he say so if you see a person with a great gift gift trying to do something to glorify themselves he said your own discernment of the spirit tells you that's wrong it's wrong if any man gets up and tries to bring glory to himself right he's motivated by the wrong Spirit he's influenced by something besides God because hey he even when they come to when they come and tried to worship Paul and Barnabas like said they were some kind of gods or you know they stripped their clothes said hey humans only worship god brother said a true man of God will never accept worship that's right and that's the biggest thing Satan tries to do with this man he tries to tell people brother brother Bob brother he tries to tell people they're following the man they're worshiping the man see that's what he makes them think they're doing but you know what they're worshiping something to S and don't even realize it they're worshiping Satan and don't even realize they think they're worshiping God you only there's only two Spirits you can worship that's God or the devil those are the two influences if anything influences you anything to worship anything besides God you're in trouble sometimes PE some sometimes people's job becomes such an influence oh yeah I get tickled at people sometimes they'll say boy God give me this car but you know what I can't come to church on Wednesday night no more cuz I got to work to pay for this thing I'm having to work workover God never pushes you out of church when he gives you something God gives you stuff without stipulations yes he does anything to go contrary to his word because the word of God says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even more so not less so people are getting where they only go to church once a week now around this message got one man got one church service sad amen I stared to death eat one time a week and see how long you last right same thing natural is just spiritual sir amen that's why you got so many people that's deprived because they don't and man and one thing why don't you eat during the week too amen he said you want to get close to God read your Bible and pray people say oh god brother pray that I'll get closer to God said just follow what he said yeah I'll pray for you but just read your Bible and pray am I can't be your Holy Ghost amen you got to get it for yourself amen you got to have a hunger in there if there's something influencing you not to read your Bible and not to pray that's not God because the Holy Ghost feeds off the word and the Holy Ghost loves fellowship with his father that's right amen listen to this same message influence of another she could see they live no different life than what she did well what about that it says it takes influence it takes the power of the resurrection of Christ amongst the people that they see that Christ is not a statue hanging in a building he's a living being in the form of the Holy Ghost living in men and women bringing peace not worry amen not doubt not discouragement bringing peace he said I'll give unto you my peace oh my sister D what about that my peace that the world knows nothing up you can't get a pill that'll give you what God gives you give me peace that surpasses on what are we going to do next year when all this I don't know I don't know what tomorrow holds you don't know what tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow he said take no thought for tomorrow I've already got your tomorrow planned glory be to God he knew you he said Jeremiah I knew you and chose you before the foundation of world I called you predestinated you elected you for this hour amen he built you to be here in Leo deia and do you know what I heard one brother said you know if we had know the hend of this thing we'd have volunteered but brother Bob I believe we did volunteer come on cuz I believe just like Isaiah we was there in theophany there in the thoughts of God and he said who go down in Leo to see you we said we'll go we don't remember it but we're starting to remember we come from there we're going back it's coming closer and closer see what it is is Satan has stole our identity because we come the wrong way in the natural birth he is blinded us he stole tried to steal our identity he still tries to because we battle this thing to make us doubt who we are but the word of God says who we are it don't matter what this says it don't matter what Satan says we're Sons and Daughters of God now Paul said you are now not going to be not might be you're now when you've been born to God you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God Amen then we got crazy people run this message say oh well you know God didn't become God till he went in the water ready that's right that's as crazy as a bat out in the football game as a man trying to run around with a football and another man chasing him with a bat it's crazy it's Insanity when the B that's the Bible

ain't seen them open no blind eyes only thing they open is their mouth I said show me right here brother Brown said show me show me he was so so influenced by the word of God and it was so true God had designed him with such an influence he couldn't even stand if his gun missed just one little bit he was so determined and it made it tore him up he got nervous he said God why am I like that he said because I know you won't let the word do the thing either that's right prove it prove Serv say wrong can't do it you tell why look at your flesh you wouldn't get sick right you wouldn't get old huh that's your greatest battle hallelujah oh my a you thank for the truth turn with me I'm not going to try to hold you too long and then again you never know I know like but CH I love like brother Terence said you go a little bit over then you ink starts but that' be all right I always appreciate brother Terence he comeing back and tell me that i' laugh I thought that was all right turn with me to uh Romans chapter 7 let's start right here and let's just see what the influence Paul's talking about beautiful the scriptures testify what we batt amen let's start at uh Romans chapter 7 let's start right here verse five listen this for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit of unto death right he said but now we are delivered from the law being dead wherein we were Hil that we should serve in newness of spirit that not in the oldness of the letter what shall we say then is the law sin God forbid he said nay the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covet boy I love the word I love this message I said you know what made me love this message come right out of this Bible you know what this message made me do fall in love with him I'm so in love with him I don't want to do anything to bring shame to him that's right or to be a stumbling block I want to be so salty that somebody will get thirsty for the true and living God he said but he said but but sin taken occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of consensus he said for without the law sin was dead what about that for I was alive without the law once he's talking about the inward man right here now he's going to tell you you're still going to have troubles oh I love this beautiful he said but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died oh Hallelujah by one man's Disobedience we died but by one man's obedience we live glory be to God he said for sin keeping occasion by the Commandment deceived me and by it slew me I love that brother B he said wherein the law is hell is Holy and the Commandment is Holy and just and good he said was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid he said but sin that might appear sin working death in Me by which is good that sin by the Commandment might become exceedingly sinful showing us that we was dead in sins and trespasses nothing did we have to give him but Obed Obi total surrender glory be to God listen to this he said for we know that the law is spiritual boy I love that people say oh when Jesus come he done away with the law I said my good you he said I come to magnify to show you you ain't got a chance unless you come through me glory be to God oh how what about that he said for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that oh I love how he does this I love this is helps me so much knowing where my struggle is between this and the inward man there's a war there's an influence oh yeah the one you feed you feed that black dog he wins you feed that white dog you can't lose amen he said for that which I do I allow not love about that for what I would that I do do not do I not he said but what I hate that I do well don't you just hate it when you act up and you know you ain't supposed to makes me so mad I said Richard you bumbling idiot why don't you quit acting like that but you know what it is sometimes we don't pray enough this old boy said oh he's giv me a chance to jump up we got to be careful now he said if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that is good he said now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me he said for I know that in me brother ball that is in my flesh not here in my flesh dwelleth no good thing brother Aaron for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not that's showing you got to be born again yeah you got to have something you theyy when you was born again you was a raving blooming Beast brother BR said a man the Holy Ghost is no more than a brute Beast look at what they're doing they killing people don't even think nothing about it don't bother one bit they oh God help us he said for the good that I would do I do not but the evil which I would not that I do he said now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me talking about that contrast that Warfare between them two dogs he said I find that then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me it wasn't talking about Silas he wasn't talking about Barnabas Paul's talking about his flesh amen your greatest enemy is your flesh brother Brown says William Brand's greatest enemy is William Brandon and people want to worship I said why would you want to wor brother Brand's greatest enemy his flesh we worship the god William Brown oh hallelujah what about that when I when I would do good evil is present with me he said for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man boy I rejoice in it brother I said oh boy I keep looking in the mirror brother B I'm said get the best of you want one of these days I'm going to starve you to death boy you ain't getting nothing that's what we get in trouble we feed him then one why we got trouble well you don't have to get him but this a Crum boy he'll raise up he said oh I love this look right here he tells us that he said for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members he's talking about this now he said oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death of this death oh he get the answer right here don't he he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord woo so then with the mind I serve myself I I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin amen and then look what he says right there after he tells you all that right there in the next chapter in chapter 8 verse one what does he tell you telling you you got the victory this man's coming under subject one of these days that's right he said therefore there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not Oh my he said my eyes messing with me he said therefore that now there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen ain't that the truth what is our greatest adversary mine's Richard Douglas Aron is Aaron Roberts Bob black is Bob black his worst enemy that old boy you look you wash him you wash that pig all the time he still oinks pinch him he a squeal people say I got my subjection mask your finger and act like an idiot it don't sound like it to me hey it's spiritual ignorance really only thing brings him under subjection is the Holy Ghost that's right keeps him got got a Bridal in there you I love it when you go to say something go say don't you do that boy and then when you do he said you know better than that I said Thank You Lord I know better than that but look at the influence remember Abram talked about that when he remember you remember we got influ we got we're striving between there's two Spirits yeah it's the spirit of Richard and the spirit of God this is the spirit of Richard oh my goodness hallelujah it's a Warfare you're influenced by another I'm glad the influence of God overriding the influence of this amen he said therefore now there is no condemnation to them who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit this man must die Paul said I Die daily he didn't say he was dead yet he said I'm dying daily he said when I was a child I thought I was a child we got people in church they get mad at one another won't even speak to one another Jesus said unless you come as a little child you going come remember we get mad I know you and Aaron rich they used to fight like cash and dogs I can tell them cuz I remember but you know what they're still brothers that's right but you didn't jump on one without having to fight the other that's right hey you think God's going to let Satan jump on you without having to fight God if he don't get permission he can't jump on you that's right don't fool yourself he only does that because he gets permission satake can only do anything to you brother Paul unless God lets him to it yes got perit we don't understand some we'll say oh God why is this happen I said God you allowed this to happen but God give me Grace to get through it give me Grace not to Grumble complain and murmur and all that right but there's a Warfare between those two two Spirits see when you was born again that Spirit of influence in your soul that wrong nature that old Spirit of the Beast that lived in there with that thing died but this thing didn't die yeah you know but still you got that brother Brown said the greatest battle ever fought he said that spirit is now gone from in here control but it comes back up to here a place of influence and he's still talking oh Bob you ain't going to make it man you fooling you man who you trying to you a hypocrite Bob knows I'm not piting up I'm just using that's what he tells me he says you ain't going to make it but you know what I got a word for him brother Terence whatever he says is a lie what God says the truth brother said whatever Satan tells you you take the opposite he come to a place of influence he talks brother said right there he said God chose this because he lives there now amen the Supreme control he said as a man thinketh in his heart man thinks oh my God how can a heart think by they prove now that it can there's a little spot in there that there stops in and the only reason you're overcoming because that voice in there that has quickened that seed that's telling you greater is he is in you and he is in this world greater is he that's in you than he that's in this world oh my but he lost that place of influence can I read you something I'm going try try to finish that know time's flying stomach's growling it's raining that's all right there still in the house of God listen to this this is in the revelation of Jesus Christ the church his book he said he can cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true Revelation right of the true church and what she is see Satan don't want you to know who you are because when you know who you are you get in your position and in your position Satan is powerless against you he don't want you to know that he said and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits can I do it like this right here in this framework God Satan God Satan the two Spirits working with the framework of the Christian what's the Christian church is this no you're not you're the temple let's go to spiritual brother BR said everything natural tou spiritual amen this is you're the church he said no you're not you are the temple sister Dale you're the temple that's the temple Le right there look at that he said in the framework of the Christian church and by God's grace discern between when it's Richard talking and it's God talking brother ter Satan don't want you to realize that he said and discern he said by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her yeah amen what did what the prophet tells he said in the Millennium Satan will be powerless he'll be bound by change he said not change he said he won't have nobody to work through I'm asking God brother ter Lord let me not be worked by Satan that's right let me do you know brother said you get to a place where Satan don't know what to do with you think about that he don't know what to do with you because you ain't listening to you no more Discerning between your feelings and your desires and God's spirit when you when your feelings come against anything God's word says that's not God that's Richard and when you can say oh Richard don't you try that no more huh so you're not feeding him no more you're the one we're the one that gives him power cuz we when we obey him who you serve you're you're a slave to that's why Paul said I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ Christ amen I don't care if they locked me up I don't care if they beat me I'm still Jesus's I'm a love slave to Jesus Christ ain't that wonderful what about that as we stand when we get to the place that we can discern between those two Spirits working in this this church this is his church he come back for a body what's his body we're his body when we can realize that brother Aaron he's work Satan's working too that's why Paul said when I go do good Evil's pray has it he's saying Paul who shall deliver me from this old Wretched Man that I am amen amen a born again holy spirit of God Quicken that sea can deliver you from this man ain't you glad you wouldn't have discernment that's why when your your flesh would do something your heart say that's good I like that when he wasn't born again but now when something like happen you say man I'm getting down repent that flesh said I didn't I was nothing wrong with that I said oh yes it was you said something wrong you got to make that right no I don't want to you're going to hey have you ever noticed when you go to read the Bible you get to sleep as you ever been or you put on a tape you sleep like he never slept before but I learned how to beat that you know what after when I wake back up brother Bob I said oh boy you rested now guess what we going back and read now we going back and pray now I got you some rest guess what you're going to start obeying cuz you ain't going to eat nothing but what I want you to eat we got to overcome amen that's right he said we'll overcome by the what the word of Our Testimony and the blood of the Lamb amen we got to discern when it's me and it's God and when we do that I ain't got nothing to work I talk to his flesh all the time he tells me get away from me said resist the devil and he'll flee that's right I tell him you ain't my boss no more guess what you don't tell me what to do I got a man in here tells me what to do now every head bow every ey close who will say God help me to be more influenced by your spirit than my own God help me to come under complete obedience to your spirit God my hand goes up oh God I want it father I want it more than bread and water on my table I want it more than anything God to bring my desires and my ways totally
