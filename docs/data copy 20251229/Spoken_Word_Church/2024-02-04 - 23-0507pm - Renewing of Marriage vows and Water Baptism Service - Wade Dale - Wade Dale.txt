you would not be [Music] denied denied what listen in this day and time the only denied is what you do everything's open seals have been open the way to redemption's been open the way to live has been open the way to do things has been open the way to even run our life is open and it's U an open book is as we know that we live in the age of the open book um there was a time when man lived in a clothes book they couldn't see they looked through a glass Darkly even Paul and um he couldn't see everything but remember they had one consolation they saw Jesus they look to the Cross they look to the author and finisher of their faith and so do we we look to that we look today to um to the word of God As I said this morning there's nothing else to look to there's just nothing else to go to everything fails except the word of God and the prophet of God tells us there's every answer you need in the word of God every answer you need there's not anything you go through life where you can't relate back to the Bible and say oh that's what it saying or that's what that's how to handle it or that's or that's what happened to whoever Abram um Noah Moses all the different ones they they live their life and I like what someone said maybe brother brother um uh Willie they they went through their life and and I don't think Abraham went through his life and said they're going to talk to me they're going to talk about me 6,000 years from now God's going to call me the father of Faith No he got up went to work did his job yes amen Noah sure Noah had a job Moses they had a job but still they weren't they weren't sure they were led by God but they didn't have the vision to see they knew there was something greater coming and they were a part of it but they just really didn't know the part but you and I know every part they play and it's and it's connected to the part we play because it was given as the Bible says the all all the Old Testament was given for an example for us to use as examples to bring us closer to God Amen you love the Lord let me get through with these announcements and and um remember that today we're doing the vow renewal and um if you have a baby or a child you want dedicated or you want to dedicate yourself we'll do that secondly after the vow renewal the vow renewal will be you'll get your spouse and come up here around the The Altar and we will say our vows okay all right and you going you got to say them you said them when you was married you going to have to say them now we're having water baptism so uh L not here nope okay so we have at least four being baptized anyway so anybody else water's really warm it's 105 degrees in that thing right now so it's it's comfy real comfy I did that for y'all it was about 63 when I got in it the other day yeah make you speak in tongues for brother Aaron to be speaking for us Wednesday night May the 13th which is next Saturday we'll have prayer meeting from 5: to 6: and from 6:00 to 8: we'll have questions and answers here at the church everybody got that next Saturday then Sunday will be Mother's Day we'll have one service we'll have regular service but I may not stop at 12:00 I may try to continue on a little bit and then we can all go visit our mothers and and have our dinners and what more then may the 20th which is the next weekend Bob you're going to be preaching the weekend I mean the Wednesday between that okay all right I don't know what exactly day that is but it's like the 17th or something like that anyway that Wednesday just show up y'all show up too what y'all laughing about show up too so may the 20 May the 20th which is the next Saturday we'll have a new youth service brother William Boron will be here with us and we're expecting a really good crowd uh to be here so we will have some things to do there plus we'll get ready the food ready and we'll discuss that in the next few days uh then may the 21st that'll be that Sunday there'll only be one service um that Sunday morning all right also remember Sister June is going to have her hysterectomy on the 24th of May and um I'm going to have some teeth my surgery done on the 15th of May so just remember those and remember Sister Jill fle um just I pray for her every night every time I see this little band I think of that lady struggling to make it struggling to get up out of her chair struggling to make sure her two kids got married and and and and stayed a mother to him and and her husband Anthony he he struggles too cuz he can't go he said I would love to come to y'all's church every Sunday he said but I can't because of the Jill and his I say is that his dad or her dad her dad the Grandpa's there he's he's in his 90s and he falls so he has to stay keep him so he's keeping both of those just pray for that whole family all right but the kids are married and off and they're they're uh starting their new life so let's just continue to pray for them and today we're going to do our vow renewal but we're going to speak a little bit about that just for a moment and bring out a few points um this was not done to to to I hope you don't feel Ed Ed it's just something we did it's something that Dad did and I said it was not too long ago but I think we figured out it was like 15 years ago so some of y'all were not even married at that time some of you were not coming to church here at that time but we had a vow renewal everybody come up around the pull pit and Dad we all recited our vows and repeated our vows and I have a scripture for that too and I'll read it talking about doing renewal because that's what we're going to talk about is renewing our vows and repairing some our relationship with each other that helps us with our relationship with God Amen we're still humans if things don't go right at home what happens things don't go right at church we're humans it affects us everything little something affects us and I want us to be where we get at least we can chisel some of the little things out of the way so that we can talk to God better or he can talk to us better amen he's always there to talk to us we just say well we ain't got time to talk about that right now well you do the same thing with your spouse so maybe you ought to take some time and I'm guilty take the time to listen to what they got to say all right so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for the day you've give us and not just a day a 24-hour day not just a day called Sunday but this is as you told John this was the day of the Lord and it's a day that has been like no other day as the song says there's never been a day like this day Lord Lord we've come into the end of time of the of the Gentile dispensation and and we're part of it and Lord we don't want to be left here we want to go home we want to as Revelations 19 we want to be that wife that has made herself ready and Lord to be able to do that we're going to have to listen listen to you listen to what you've got to say in the word listen to what you got to say through our prophet and the five-fold ministry Lord and then not just hear it but not be hearers as the Bible said but be doers that will do these things that the scripture tells us to do father and do it not with not with a not begrudgingly but do it with a with an honest heart as today we say our vows to each uh to our spouse Lord I I pray that as we're going to read that it be a renewing that it be a bringing back together of maybe certain things that's got in between Lord between us and you and and us and our spouse father I pray for the ones that don't have a a a spouse yet or has one and they've passed on Father you're the only one that can give them peace you're the only one that can give them understanding there's a purpose behind everything you never made a mistake so whatever we're any of us are going through lord it's for your honor and glory and we give it to you father in the name of Jesus Christ amen so let's read this real quick and then we'll then you can be seated Genesis 2:18 the Lord God said it's not good that a man should be alone all right so he's starting out right off the bat he's made everything he's made it all he's G he put Genesis 2:7 he's put man in in a body a human body and said hey till the ground work on the work on the work on work on the Earth all right you take care of the earth I'll take care of Heaven I was lonely and I made you all right now he sees that the man is lonely so there's something inside of the man that's got to come out it's kind of funny that she came from his rib cage she was caged up inside of him and she had to come out and like and we'll say We'll look in the vows um that why was it here why didn't he take a bone from the foot or a bone from her head we'll find out in just a second and the Lord God said it's not good the man to be alone I will make him and help me for him and out of the ground the Lord formed every beast of the field and every foul the air in other words male and female and brought them unto Adam to see what they would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was his name and Adam gave names to all the cattle and foul of the air beast of the field in other words Adam was doing some work he was working he wasn't just sitting around he was working and then and then Adam says well Lord there's a a a a female lion and she's laying there with her mate you know and they're just cing to each other and they you know they're everything's in Harmony and they're and they're um they're there together and I'm just here by myself there was something inside of him there was a desire there was a Genesis 126 inside of that man that was caged up that needed to get out and that by that desire of Adam through the desire of Adam Eve comes into being through the desire of Jesus Christ a bride comes into being amen so cuz we were caged up inside of him till they stuck your side all right and Adam gave every name but for Adam there was not found an help meat you know brother Dale knows we know that that's not helpmate it's help meat it's a co-equal and and remember when we get started Adam and Eve were co-equal before the fall co-equal right and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam the first anesthesiologist was the Lord and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord had taken from man made he a woman could you imagine standing there you you know it you see a rib you see Adam and you see this thing opening up you see God pull a rib out everything closed back together and then he kind of sets that rib over into the dirt and it's standing up like this and all of a sudden Here Comes This Woman here comes the DNA of Adam inside that come on people the DNA of that rib made Eve but it was Adam's Rib praise God these types are are perfect and beautiful and the rib which the Lord God took from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man that's why the man has that's why the father has to give the bride away the heavenly father brought the bride to the groom brought it to him and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she's was taken out of man what a revelation therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed you may be seated in the Lord that his Blessing to the reading his word you see the order now they they come together they they come together as husband and wife and then the man is going to cleave to Adam and Eve are going to cleave together and even God by his is for knowledge cuz remember Adam's father was God Amen so God is telling us right here he's telling us therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother so he knows they're going to propagate Even Adam knows that something's going to happen there's going to be fathers and mothers all right he's telling them what's coming up now they don't exactly know right now what's going on and they were both naked and man and his wife and were not ashamed all right right we can say something about that but you just be comfortable with your mate all right okay Titus 3:3 I want to read this right here real quick I was uh looking at it back here and I'm going to read it and then we'll uh we'll continue on Titus 3 says for we also ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared in other words after we come to the new birth after we come to a knowledge that we're that we need salvation all right but look not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost now you say well what you know why do we need to renew our vows right here is where we're going to renew our vows we get married right here we live our life we're going through our life we're learning how to be God hello somebody amen we're learning how to be each other husband and wife now natural but spiritual we're learning how to be God but then we come and we got right here and we got to renew oursel by that Holy Ghost all right so that's what we're doing today we're renewing our vows but we're we're we're renewing ourself listen today you've been most of you have been married more than 2 or three years at least she's not your bride anymore she's your wife okay but you still even being the wife of God we have to renew our vows renewing of the Holy Ghost now that renew looks what does it mean renovate complete change for the worst oh I'm sorry complete change for the better right the better not worse amen you went through that better or worse thing when you did your vows complete change for the better so today I don't want this to be an embarrassment I want it to be a a wonderful time if you don't participate that's okay if you can't participate that's okay but if you can do like sister Rachel just go all out get the veil back out and and uh you know get everything together and and and smile and make Joe say will you marry me she probably shamed him a little bit but yeah yes but he's waiting on the honeymoon no numbers 30 verse two now here is and I don't want we're not one day maybe we'll talk about marriage and divorce and bow and a vow but we'll do it maybe a little bit later but not today but we have to bring why do we have vows cuz the prophet of God told us I didn't pull it up but you know as well as I do as many of you know the message of the hour brother R says The Vow is what marries you it's not the coming together it's not the having the Intercourse it's not has nothing to do with any of that it's The Vow amen The Vow is what marries you when you vow a vow numbers 30 ver2 if a man vow a vow unto the Lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth so we need to be careful with our conversation if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth now this is a story but I'm going to back up to it in just a second now listen if the father hears her vow that's why young men you go ask the father for her hand in marriage it's not your girlfriend coming to ask your daddy come on somebody this listen this world is just so perverted that women are asking men to marry them now that ain't right right ain't right it ain't right by biblically it's not right but let's go by the Bible so let's do it right if I woman vow AOW unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth in other words still living at home cuz remember until the until the girl or boy gets the Holy Ghost you parents are their Holy Ghost is that what is that correct amen your parents are their Holy Ghost all right you're the girls Holy Ghost and you're the boy's Holy Ghost until they decide that they want to leave or continue to stay all right everybody with me and bind herself by a bond so it's to vow you see when you when we do a when we do a marriage just just to give you a pointer here dad's always taught me this from years and years and years and years and years and years ago that The Vow is what marries you all right so when you're when you're counseling with with two people and you don't ask them what's your past and and how many times or you know how many girls or boys you've had you ask them one question have you ever betrothed yourself in other words have you ever vowed yourself to a man if they say no not a problem if he says no not a problem we can marry them now listen if they have a problem besides that that's for them to talk about not me we as ministers let me just be plain we don't get in the bedroom amen whatever that that's your business all right if you two agree that's your business but in this part the father can hear that vow and that's why you got to go ask the father if the father has any issue with that he can stop it right he can stop it he can say no and he can tell you why I don't want them you know father's I I got a grandbaby back there de she's 14 be 15 in a few days well let's get off of that I'll kill him her father her father hear The Vow though her bond wherewith she had bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace in other words the father says yes you can marry her you can marry him then that vow stays right everybody with me that vow sticks if the father agrees holds his peace says nothing and on other words not say nothing but he says yes you can marry my daughter you can have my can I have her hand in marriage yes you can well that's the vow all right so so then you go ask the girl when I see when you ask the girl she's got a choice back and forth the vow to say yes or no because the girl can say no and that take her away from having any part to do with you've got to marry but if you say yes if you say yes I'll marry you brother Brown said you're just as good and married right there as you are any other time it's just the law of the land gives us gives us the right to give them a piece of paper to live together legally all right everybody with me and but now if the Father scripture five we won't get into that but just for a moment but if the father says no then it stops right there if the father says no you can't marry my daughter it stopped now whatever she does after that is her business but if he says no then that's it now and then you can continue on there's some confusion in that people have but some say if the woman vows a vow and and um the father hears it later and all that but let's don't let's don't worry about that right now we're all grown up so we we're getting married today all right and her father hear her vow and her bond see the bond and The Vow is the same thing so wherewith she has bound her soul all right let's just be honest a lot of men and women get married in the flesh not in the soul they don't bind theel together and say this is the re this is the real person I want to marry that's why brother Brown said you need to have the Holy Ghost cuz then your soul will speak it'll be that in side guy that'll speak all right and we see train RS we see we all we've all had our conversation as Paul says in times pass in the lust of the flesh we've all made mistakes which we should have went back and had the if we had the Holy Ghost it' have been all that different and we wouldn't have so many scars but we didn't we here to tell you don't do it do it this way do it the biblical way and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond that she's B bound to in other words shall stand everything will stand if the H if the father says yes all right father says yes you go right ahead you've got his Blessing what they call it you know you get the blessing of the father when you get the blessing of the father then you're free to marry and you are just as married now listen that doesn't give you a right to run off and and have the honeymoon let's have the marriage first let's get that let's get the legal part out of the way all right thereby with me I hope I'm not hurting anybody I know some of us got married different ways just of the peace this and that and the other and I hope you're not living together I hope we're clean enough in this church not not be living you know like that right even though well we vowed a vow that was three years ago we vow no you got a problem no you need to be married by whatever so Matthew 19:4 everybody understand about the vows so The Vow is what marriag you so when we uh the reason I'm telling you this is we're going to come up here and we're going to State our vows and you know what the vows what gets me more than anything you you look at the statti statistics the statistics tells you that a marriage only lasts about 5 years 50% of marriages are over in 5 years out there five years divorce five years some of them pay for $50,000 weddings and 5 years divorced see but that's when you to put two people together by the flesh they vow by the flesh they don't vow by the soul they don't vow they don't they don't really think about what's going on all right Matthew 19:4 says they asked Jesus that this all this question of marriage is always come up it's come up in every generation there's been a question of marriage and divorce but we're just going to talk about marriage today Matthew 19 says Jesus said he answered and said unto them have you not read I mean he's talking to the scribes and Pharisees he's saying you should know you should have already read this you should read numbers 30 you should read Leviticus different 20 something or something something same thing you ought to know this but you're testing me cuz he knew the Bible says somewhere he knew they were tempting him CU remember the question was if a if a girl if a sister dies and or I mean if the brother dies dies and and she's still alive he's got seven brothers and they all have her and they all die who she married at the when they come up in Resurrection well who cares he told them he said none of them he said it's not like that anymore he's telling them there's a new there's a new part coming when we come to the other side and there's a lot to say about that but we not but Jesus said he answered and said have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female that's a lost revelation in this day and time that woke group or whatever you want to call it made them male and female if you decide I guess is what they're saying see how messed up this perverted this world is and he said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put us under Hebrews 13:4 tells us real plain marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without Covetous and be content with such things as you have for he say for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee Revelations 19:7 and we'll get ready in just a minute we'll we'll do our vow renewals Revelations 19:7 said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready remember we get married here we get married here then we renew our vows right there then we go into this this listen folks listen this right here is the Son of God Revelation right this is the son of man Revelation right the son of man Revelation is listen they they were married and giving in marriage here come on yes married giving in marriage but this right here the son of man he didn't get married we were inside of him we were not a separate entity we were him she is him that's why brother Ram came to that headstone say she is him she is him not a part of him she is him that's what Adam and Eve were she was literally him right but since the fall remember it got separated but hey whatever that was before has got to come back together and it's a it's a it's a portion listen it's a portion we got people like Mom and Dad 65 years 65 years married married 65 years wow that's a long time am I thank God cuz I'm 63 that they've been married 65 years but you know what they'll tell you real quick that it hadn't been easy it's been fun June and I 44 years coming up this year so I I don't know if some of y'all been married he married more sister Trudy how long you've been married hone it's not a trick question you don't know it's been 60 years though probably at least okay so you and Mom and them are 60 and then then it trickles down to just a few years but we all have our conversation that we we say well we made it through this and we made it through this and this is how we made it through this well see you can that's why the Bible says that the older can help the younger if you'll listen this younger generation just don't listen are some of y'all not listening okay it's like we you know I I told Dan one time I said don't shake your head it's like you know we Papa went from 5 years old to 50 and never had no in between that you know we never went you don't know what I'm going through yeah we do that's right yeah we do in our own way we know what you're going through now you may be listen we didn't have the internet where everything is just splattered right there in front of you okay but we had stuff splattered there in front of us anyway we were able to find whatever we needed to find it didn't have to be on a computer we found it that brother Donnie say we found it so it's the same thing same devil same problem same issues but listen it's the same God it's the same God that 65 years they can live together and 44 years and all the different ones that you can live together in harmony Amen Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the L has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God that's what God said we don't have to we don't have to it's not James doson not not William brandom it's God what he said it's what God said this is what God told us and he told us to renew ourself by the Holy Ghost and I believe today now now I I I'll tell you one thing about me and Jim we didn't have the Holy Ghost when we got married okay but some of you did and that's wonderful but listen as we come up here today I think we all got the Holy Ghost so you're coming up here and not for a different purpose but you're coming up here a different way with a different with a different view of what's going on like Rachel and and and Joe you know they she says you he got to ask me you got to ask me you got to ask me well he finally did he didn't get a black eye for it but but would you marry your spouse again would you cuz I I read your scripture was to be content be content in what you have be content with such things as you have amen everybody does not have a husband or a wife that makes $250,000 a year okay 50 maybe but be content you know what if you put the whole the whole thing is Brother John is like you you got to plug God into the whole thing yeah if you don't plug God into the whole thing it doesn't matter if you make $250,000 a year I promise you you will Swindle it away or whatever they call it you will make it disappear amen right so we're we're now as we're coming up here and just a few minutes we're coming up here as Christians and as Christians we're telling our our spouse we love you and we continue to want to love you more now I love you more now now than I did then if you don't then you got a problem if you don't know her more now than you did then we got a problem there's a communication problem somewhere really big communication problem but we are now the wife so the wife and husband are coming up and they're going to look at each other and we're going to stay our vows just as Lauren looked at McKenzie yesterday and and he meant what he said he really meant what he said and she was just she just she just was an ooze of Joy just Joy just went everywhere out of her you know she was just so happy and uh cuz she was getting married to the man that she loved and I know each one of us the same way put God first always put God first because what happened in the Garden of Eden Eve didn't put God first she didn't even put Adam first right she put herself first and you see how that ruined the human race and it's going to ruin your marriage if you put I I me me uh come on sorry I'll clap myself and do we do that I mean listen we we're going to do our biows right now do we really and June and I don't do it all the time do we really hold hands and look at each other like brother Bown said get over the do folds anybody know what a do aold is no mama does so the older ones know what to do it's it's kind of like an ottoman kind of like an ottoman something you put your feet on or something that's in the middle of the middle of the room like a coffee table but it's got padding on it all right it's a Duo something to sit on brother Brandon would tell remember he said we'd all as a family get around the duo when he was getting ready to go overseas or make a decision and he had his wife there and they would what pray we don't always do that Jun and I don't always do that and we need to do that you need to pray about everything you do cuz prayer does what changes things not if you don't pray you just may happen to get something changed but if you pray about it stop for a minute we this world is so crazy so fast everything you can you know get get on your phone and and right now you can order a brand new car on your phone oh it's so easy there's no money exchanged listen to Brother John there's no money exchange that's what the problem is now we got credit cards there's no you ain't got to get the cash out like like um Dave Ramsey said he said it hurts when you pull that thing out and you open it up and you got to hand them the bills but it's real easy to go I think I'll take three of them four not tell my wife about it till ask ask forgiveness in the 30th day at the end of the month right yeah so but anyway all right is everybody ready everybody got their where's the where's your everybody got them all right get your spouse and come forward and then we'll talk a little bit about water baptism and does anybody need want to we're all going to dedicate ourselves to the Lord but if you have a a child that needs to be dedicated I'm going to let brother brother Dale's going to do that for us if any children you have SM [Applause] [Music] that [Applause] okay you remember [Music] that your SP get where you look at them just

today in the sight of God to join together this man and this woman in the holy matrimony marriage is Honorable instituted by God himself and commissioned from the beginning and as I said God was lonely so he made Adam Adam was lonely so he made Eve and then we know what else happened but from but right at that moment there was perfection in the Garden of Eden it was two people come together as one all right and remember he took it out of Adam's side he did not take it from Adam's head because she's not to be his head okay did not take the bone from Adam's foot cuz you're not to stomp on her she's not to be under your feet used to be at your side right there brother Ram said fifth rib Down Under the heart heart's right here and that's where the rib was and that's where the rib cage was so we know that's why God did that so in Genesis 2 God instructed man to leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh cleave means to stick together cling together stay close listen each one of us has had our time time where we got mad at our spouse and didn't talk to them maybe it's just me and June pray for us but but try to fight that fight it because you going to fight about it but fight it you listen you share everything with your spouse you should share everything with them no secrets everything all right that's why this cleave means to stick together stay close this is why this Union should be entered in with all reverence seeking advice from God through prayer and communication with each other marriage is not a union of two bodies it's a union of two minds and two hearts through this marriage you will be making a commitment to face your disappointments accept each other's failures but also be able to realize your dreams and reach your goals together so today as we stand here before God we are honored to be here today as a witness of this vow renewal all right repeat after me guys and I'm going to have to I got to repeat this and then repeat this again all right I'm going to ask you a question and you're going to answered do you men take your wives as your lawfully wedded wife men you say yes or no yes baby I love you

reminds me Lord of a of a time when when you were you were way back into the eternities you were lonely and you were a father but you were also a husband you were all these many things and you wanted something to communicate with so through your Providence you formed Adam a part of you and didn't as the prophet says many times you didn't make another creation you took something from that creation and made Eve and Lord when you hung at Calvary you wanted a bride but she was inside your rib cage she was there in your heart but you had to do something to let her out so your side had to be pierced and water and blood came forth the prophet of God said that's where the Bride come out and Lord now we're standing here together with our Bride As Grooms and and and grooms as bride Lord many of us have been married a long time some have not some's been through many deep trials and some's not been through so many but Lord I pray that we all together today that we bind closer together that we

you know yeah you might get something throw at you but listen you know as well as I do as brother Dale the same way we're we're human beings guy told me yesterday you know we were just kind of cut we

they had issues with I just want to be somebody that makes mistakes I live life I'm happy if you can't take that sorry this is the way God made me and he loved me this way and I do I do love each and every one of you but I don't want to be somebody that y'all put up on a don't ever put somebody on a pestal I'll promise you God will knock them off cuz he'll not share his glory with nobody right so this is the church family this is not a church one person all right so let's keep that in our heart and our mind does any anybody need dedication we we're going to stand in DED rededicate oursel to the Lord alt together but does anybody want their children dedicated or rededicated if you don't that's okay that's okay we don't have no little babies we need some little never mind I'm not going to

want to red theirself or they tell Michael oh my word cool go ahead yeah there you go thank you Lord bless father just be with each one thank you Lord everything thank you bless Lord a brother or sister or a mother and father but they're dedicating themselves to a living God Amen that made them pure yes they are yes yes in Jesus name yes Lord amen you know a lot of us sitting here um our our kids and grandkids were all dedicated by Brother Dale I mean I I think probably everybody sitting here pretty much if you've been here while brother Dale's pretty much dedicated everybody so uh we want to uh um we want to continue that amen amen all right let's talk a minut about water baptism and then we'll go out there I know there's now four that want to be baptized if you want to be baptized what we'll do is is we'll finish here I've got a change closed the uh pool is already hot and ready to go so we can take the cover off of it and it should be ready to go and uh but I want to talk to you just a minute about water baptism in Mark 1:4 says John did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance this was something new what didn't happen in the Old Testament this was something new and John was bridging us into the New Testament to bring us something new baptism was not in the Old Testament it's in the new test Testament but I mean you know John was in the Old Testament but he was bringing us into the new he knew that testator was coming to make a new testament so John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and they went out unto him all the land of Judea and they were Jerusalem man this was this was you know this was an item they' never seen anything like this before Here Comes this guy walking out of the Wilderness with just a loin cloth on you know and he come goes in and 9 comes out at 30 and he's just setting the world on fire you got to repent they ain't heard anything like that before most of them had heard go to the temple take a lamb take this take that you know Turtle up he said no come be baptized and they were all baptized of him in the River Jordan confessing their sins and John was clothed with camel hair and with girle of was skin that was loins and he did eat Locust and wild honey what a diet and preach saying there cometh one mightier than I after me the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose I indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost cuz John couldn't do that right only Jesus can do that and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John in the River Jordan and straightway coming out of the water he saw the heavens open in the spirit like a dove amen descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased when you get the new birth that's what God says to you I am pleased to dwell inside of you amen just like he did as our example Jesus didn't need the Holy Ghost but this is an example of an anointing that comes on Jesus that was visible John could see that and God told him said whatever you see the one the Holy Ghost come on and remain that's the one that's going to baptize you right that's right not many days well you know three and a half years later he baptized his disciples he didn't baptize anybody else Jesus baptized his disciples he didn't he didn't baptize anybody else so Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake un them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you all way even un the end of the world Amen so acts 1:4 says being assembled with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem this is Jesus but wait for the promise of the Father which sayith he listen he said promise Jesus said there is a promise coming if you do this right but wait for the promise of the Father which saith you have heard of me for John truly baptized you with water in other words baptize you physically but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence what a promise and when they had heard this this then it comes over and and comes to the to the upper room and and Peter and all of them are assembled 120 and Peter preaches them about a 15minute sermon and they're pricked at their heart when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said Peter to Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do what's next then Peter said repent so today if you're getting re-baptized or you're getting baptized for the first time repent yes repent every one of you and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive there's your promise the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis isn't to you and to your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call look at it start the ball rolling amen start the ball rolling for the promis is to you and to your children and to all that are far off even as me the Lord Our God shall call do you know your kids your literal children your flesh and blood benefits by you having the Holy Ghost now that don't seem that way sometimes when they're so contrary and they go out in the world and they go do their things in the world you're like Mom and Dad's crazy they don't know what they're saying but years later guess what they were right I want them to be my example that's right amen you come back you know amen teach a child in the way it should go what when it's older right it'll not depart from you that's a promise yeah so This Promise is what a baptism the children see it listen our kids are not dummies they may be kids but they watch everything we do everything and sometimes they emulate the things that we do and do you want them to emulate everything you do no but there is a promise that you get baptized you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you pray for your kids they receive the Holy Ghost they pray for their kids it that's the way it's been since since 2,000 years ago that's the way it's been it's been one praying for another yes you just don't get the Holy Ghost cuz God just pours it on top of you brother Brown said some Grandma right may not have been right then said said some great great grandma yeah could have prayed for you and got on her knees and said God save all my children my grandchildren my great grandchildren and that's what God honored was that so listen you say well I don't have any well if if the time goes on you sure probably will have some kids and grandkids and great grandkids so start praying for them now as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exort saying save yourself from this untour generation and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to we're trying to reconcile oursel back to God as we were talking about this morning and that word reconcile means repair our relationship amen reconcile come back together you know even and let me just say this for a minute for us that are married that even the Bible tells us that if you can't live together that you can separate for a season everybody with me no divorce you can separate for a season and then what reconcile back together all right so you can do that maybe some you know you may need to use that brother Joe's looking for the honeymoon and June's leaving me for two days so go figure she's going to see her daddy she's leaving me for an older man then they then they gladly received his word look they that gladly received his word were baptized so that their attitude is what brought them to where they were going their attitude they were gladly they received this the ones that were pricked in their heart that was 3,000 could you imagine we're going to baptize four or five or six every how many 3,000 take a while but you know what if 3,000 wants to be baptized I'd have to quit my job but I wouldn't care the Lord would do so I'd stand right there till the water run out of that thing see that's that's what we look that at what was added to the kingdom was not 3,000 people Souls you say well that is people well you got to remember those Souls were born again and added into the kingdom you can have a soul and live into this Kingdom and never get into that Kingdom so 3,000 Souls were saved amen and they continued steadfast in the doctrine Apostles Doctrine in fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayer they had all things in other words they had it common now we know and there's nobody here that doesn't that's not in the message so we know that we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's the name that Jesus told us that was his name name of the father name of the son name of the holy spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ and that as we were talking up here you know we were reciting our vows we didn't called somebody else's name we called our spouse's name so we identified that June is mine and I'm hers she didn't say I I I vow husband well that's 6 or 8 billion people husband but when she said my name or when I said her name it it took it all down to one person so that's the same way with baptism it takes it down to one person you baptize in the only person that can save your soul a nobody else can save you but the Lord Jesus Christ a father can't save you a son can't save you and the Holy Ghost yeah but you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost and die and go to hell amen right all right in your spirit realm but you can't be born again by the Lord Jesus Christ himself and take a part of him in your soul you can never be lost amen praise God what a that's a promise you can never be lost you you you attach yourself as brother Ernie says you attach yourself to the Eternal we attach oursel to God by by not a father not a son or or a title it's the very name of God which is our husband the Lord Jesus Christ that's who we're marrying let's stand to our feet if you want to be baptized uh sisters if you want to be baptized I know we have one or so yes sir yeah sure come on sure it's right now listen we we don't do things wrong we follow the word of God when I took the boy and the girl that was mother and son right that was not trying to find a way of Av you of O that wouldn't that wouldn't it now right it was the fact that he wanted to be dedicated cuz he was not dedicated when he was 3 4 years old he wasn't dedicated he wanted to be dedicated everybody understand CU you come up there and you you start pulling little little things you'll come back here and answer to this little thing because I tell you the truth amen the truth has been told you today and we get on to to the marriage and divorce and we can stay on it for months but yet never run out because it is the word of God and the word of God is true amen so we stay with the word of God we don't stay with men's ideas no see someone could take what was said that well they was doing what was they doing with a a a child no no that was long years ago that was not not in that Avenue that was just like we're fixing to do now there being people going to the water and being baptized you know maybe young ones maybe old ones you're just making yourself straight amen showing what you are and we are the Bride of Jesus Christ not father son Holy Ghost right that's out of the picture right see but the Lord Jesus Christ is the word of God Amen and it is set by that as to this line of the church and it has run from that line of the church do everybody understand you go and go go somewhere and tell tell the truth because that's what happens to like this you go somewhere you tell the truth and it's okay if you don't tell the truth you cause kiss them that's right so that's up to you I just want to make sure to get that right where it wouldn't be no no questions about what was happening and what we were doing of the the boy and the girl or the man and sister Mela and the boy you know that was just she she was bringing him to be dedicated that's right to the Lord herself amen all right she said back her shaking her head yes that's what she was bringing not bringing a whole church to be able to back up what it is we're not trying to prove prove a doctrine of marriage and divorce we're not trying to prove it we're trying to prove the word of God and it'll line up correctly amen amen okay all right sisters if you want to be baptized uh if you need to change you need to go downstairs and go to the back room very back that back here where Michael Sunday school class is and you can change there and men if you need to change you can go into men's bathroom or you can go in the steady and change your clothes um and even afterwards we can instruct you where to go to change out of your wet clothes we have towels um and we have um um somewhere where you can dry off so we can take you downstairs or men like I said we can come I'll probably come up here to change when I'm finished but I appreciate each and every one of you thank you for for for participating and thank you for being a church body without without a church body I mean we're just not what's a lodge but like brother Dell said we're trying to line things up right make sure every little crack cuz you know who's going to get in that crack you know who's going to stick his foot in that crack but if we put no cracks seal that thing up seal it by the Holy Ghost renew our vow to the Lord himself then guess what we will move forward yes

come out of that water it wasn't the water that washed me it was you father and you just totally saturated with just a tingling feeling all over my body and when I came out of that water I tried my best to walk in newness of life I failed many many times but Lord I made a commitment to give myself to you I pray today the Lord that everyone that commits their s to be B baptized that they'll know it's a death they know it's a burial and a resurrection and the newness of life and may they walk today forward in you father leaving all the things behind I know as human beings The Devil Makes Us
