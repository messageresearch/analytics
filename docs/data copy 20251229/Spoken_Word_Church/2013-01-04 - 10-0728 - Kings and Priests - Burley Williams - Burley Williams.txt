scripture we'll turn to the Book of Revelation chap 10 we'll go to verse 8 and 11 8- 11 I kind of start off a little I appreciate brother brother Samuel now pre Brother D allowing us to even be up here to be able to share the word of the lord it's been a long time since I've been up this way cple couple years amen like brother Dell said y know we just become buddies right amen that's right the sharing this it's good you know you can got somebody you can call here and there and talk about the word of the Lord be open-minded openhearted amen and not ashamed to talk about what you believe and I just appreciate friends like that you see I always even sometimes I ask young people I always ask them think about all of their friends and write their names down and put it on a list and then look at it and ask them why is that person your friend say why why is this person my friend praise the Lord it got to be something about you're attracted to him that that your friend and I just like Brother D because uh we got he got a Zeal for God Zeal for the word to see people be drawn closer to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I just appreciate everything that you thanksful God is doing up here for the camp sharing my vision with me by God grace I appreciate it I really do brother Dale just called me said brother B we going to do this we're going to do this and and uh it really just lifts burdens it really does and I believe the Lord is in it and I believe it's going to be a blessing amen let's go to Revelation 108 It said In The Voice which I heard spaking to me again and said go take the little book which is opened in the hands of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went to the angel and said to him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly biller but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it it became and eating it my belly was bit bitter and he he said unto me th I must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and kings and you may be seated amen the thing I like to point out here which we know John types the bride that's right and I like what John did he said give it to me said give me the book he didn't have to force it on him he himself wanted it amen and then when when it was replied back to him take it and eat it he didn't say I didn't want it he just took it and he ate it praise the Lord you know I believe that's the type of the Bride of Jesus Christ we want everything that God has to offer to us and he don't have to force nothing on us we want it with a free and open heart amen praise the Lord I also want to turn to Revelation chapter 1 we go to verse 8 and the reason why I read Revelation chapter 10: 8-1 because that's you and me amen Revelation 10:7 has been fulfilled now we got to recognize our part that we have to play in this great Plan of Redemption so many people they can preach Revelation 10:7 all day up front backwards crooked sideways all day long but then not seeing Revelation 108 which is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right and he said thou must prophesy again how many of you believe to find the voices in The Bride amen sir I believe that with all my heart which in the time we're living in you can get out kicked out of many pull pit saying that but still it's the truth amen because God got people that he's going to speak through and that is the Bride of Jesus Christ you know I was thinking you know brother Brandon was saying in the message um uh ah can't quite remember the title right off my head oh yeah he said he he said in the message he said let us see come let us let us Ser we would see Jesus brother Bron made a state in the message that was real uh profound to me and I was just thinking about that and he was saying something when God gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and which you know Jesus is not a God is not an Indian giver right when he gave Peter the Kings to keys to the kingdom right Peter was not converted right he was a straight raw hot sinner amen but he gave him the keys right and God is not an Indian giver so it goes to show you even after he gave Peter the keys Peter he you he he cursed he denied him God still didn't take it from him no that's right so that goes to show you brother and sister regardless of what you doing it's not going to change your destiny what God has already pre-ordained for you but you know because Peter had those keys brother Bron begin to make statements and I and I just really just it just kind of just really blew my mind just reading it uh he he said that them Keys was first used on the day of P when Peter preached amen because he had the key he had to open the door on the day of Pentecost because you know Peter what the Bible tells us they went through the same stages that Jesus went through we know that Jesus he came to his own his own received him not and we know that he went to uh the woman at the well amen and then he also went to when the Gentile woman come to him and he told her it's not uh meat to get the children bread the dogs he went through the three races you know which sham and and then the Greeks Jews and Samar he he did the same pattern he said the gospel had to go the same way right so that's why when Peter he used the same pattern that Jesus went through not nothing premeditated it just had to happen and what Peter did when he used that key on the day of Pentecost only he had it he one had to use it is that right and then when he used it they was able to receive the Holy Ghost that's right and then we find out in the scripture uh when Phillip went to the Gentile amen and Philip preached to him you know what brother and sister though philli had a born again experience with God when he went and preached to them they could not receive the Holy Ghost right they couldn't receive the Holy Ghost to Peter came right pet Philip prayed for him he done all he could do for them but they couldn't receive the Holy Ghost so he called Peter Peter turned that key for the Gentiles and they received the Holy Ghost and of course we know then he went to Cornelius and the reason why I'm saying this that right there was in the hands of one man right back there in that day could nobody else do nothing they could preach whatever they want to preach but God was not going to give them the Holy Ghost until that one man used that key to open it up right and you know God done the same thing after Peter used those keys then it was a many member many member bride going out preaching the gospel doing their part because the key was used and that's the same thing today I hear ministers talk about I had a revelation of marriage and divorce before brother brandom did I had a revelation of the serpent seed before brother Brandon did I said I don't believe you because that was given to one man to open that up Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall be getting to sound all the mysteries of God shall be as you know you know you know the scripture but you know that's why now he done his part the same as Peter when he done his part it became a many M People now brother Brandon done done his part Malachi for is fulfilled now it's so many member bride you and I we have a part to do it's more than just coming to church hearing brother Samuel hearing Brother D it's more than that it's it's about you identifying yourself in the scriptures you're able to see yourself in this message you're able to see this message being fulfilled in you is that right remember the message can't be denominated but people in the message can be in the denomination praise the Lord they can sit right in church and live a denominational life just like they do out there in the world see it's more than that for you and me the Bible the word is life amen amen and I was I made a statement at my church I said until you come to a place in your life that it bothers you when you don't pray it bothers you when you don't read it bothers you I said you're not going to get nowhere with God this have to become a craving amen and the only way I can give you that craving is the holy spirit because the Holy Ghost feeds off of the word is that right that the same with a woman when she get pregnant amen she begin to Crave things she normally don't crave but the thing of it is it's not her doing the craving it's the child that's inside of her it knows what it needs but it have to receive its craving through the mouth of mother is that right so the same thing with you and me when we got the receive the Holy Ghost God sent us a mouthpiece today to feed our crav he stored up the storehouse he stored up the food for you and I can go gather from it amen so that's why we can't say we're starting right is that right because the food is already been stored up you just got to be willing to do just like J he said give it to me he took the book he ate it give it to me amen and that's where we got to be in this day and hour and say God I want all that you have for me I want it I'm not I don't want nothing less I want everything you have for me is that right but you know say of God uh I see sometimes around the message people are losing their Vision right they're losing the vision of the message amen and getting relaxed go back to an Ephesian stage getting relaxed amen not pressing forward being content be become complacent we can't this not the time in hour to do it it's the time to keep pressing on Amen by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ I really believe them things with all my heart but I want to talk about you and me our place our position our office what God has called us here to do and us to be cuz we were redeemed for a purpose amen and I want to just read the scripture in Revelation 18 and just bear with me it says right here uh Revelation 1 verse 8 it says I'm sorry I want to go to verse six it says I just start at verse four John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven Spirit which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and until him that loves us washed us from our sins in his own blood here's the verse I want verse six and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen that's what he made you and amen this is nothing we ask for he said he have made us Kings and Priests now what I want to minister on tonight I want to minister on Kings and Priests but my subtitle is disqualifying factors right Amen on Kings and Priests subtitled disqualifying factors I want to share now I want I want to just get this straight now when we're talking about Kings and Priests that does not mean just men amen amen I want to make sure we get that right there straight cuz you know a lot of time we talk about Kings and Priests people just put it to Ministry man no no no no Kings and Priests that's males and females we are the bride he made all of us there the same thing we call ourselves the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right amen which a bride is a woman but the Bride of Jesus Christ is mixed with male and female we're feminine in destination amen amen so I just want to make sure we that clear so it won't just say oh disqualifying fact of a Preacher a preacher no no no it's for every one of us because we are Kings and Priests brother says listen to this right here in the church book he said he has made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose amen he bought us for a purpose you do you believe you've been bought for purpose amen you know what you're not rental property you're bought property amen cuz one thing about a rental house when you're renting the house you ain't going to do much to it because it's not yours you're not the owner it has a landlord but when you're buying a house you're free to do whatever you want to do to it and you work on it amen is that right so we're not rental property we're bought property so Jesus ought to be able to do with these houses whatever he want to do with right that's right is that right judas's C was rental property right bam was rental property just I'm just giving you a few little examples there but we've been bought with the price okay I thought it felt a little funny there amen praise the Lord but I want you to notice here he said you been bought with the price he said bought for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings all we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on the throne he said but now we are spiritual Kings and we ring over a spiritual Kingdom God said you ring over a spiritual Kingdom I ring over a spiritual kingom we ring over a Dominion right that's what he's giv us going right back to Genesis 1 when he said have dominion over these things and God has placed that in your hearts and mind right you are Kings and priest we want just read what I'm saying that Kings and priest you know they keep working with what certain words that'll stick there because that's what we want to focus on Kings and Priests what do they supposed to do amen and I want you to notice what we said he said made us priest yes priest unto him notice offering spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips right thank you Lord spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth now listen to this interceding and petitioning preach and keys to our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us but we are peculiar people zealous into good works we have been recreated in him to be children liking into to our father now notice what we supposed to be doing offering spiritual praise with Sanctified lips unto him and he also said we're supposed to be interceding and petitioning don't you know brother and sister you by being the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody can get out of their place you can intercede for them with God that's right there's one mediator between man and God but you are also called interceder and petitioners somebody get out of their place you can fall on your knees stand in the Gap and say God have mercy on them you can pull them right back to where they need to be that power has been invested in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen believe with all of my heart and when I think about these things friends it humbles me it makes me think about make sure I have the right attitudes make sure I'm thinking right make sure I'm at always at peace with God and I can be a service when somebody need help somebody need counseling amen that I can be in a position with my heart not being condemned I can give some good counsel come on Amen cuz I'm going tell you right now you can't canel nobody if your own heart condemned that's right because when you be doing the Cel you going to be condemning yourself more Hello praise the Lord God God knows how to do things to work on a preacher right I'm just going to be honest with you he know how to mold us you know sometime me and my wife might see not see things eye to eye and we begin to go back and forth not seeing things eye to eye then the phone can rain said brother B we need you to come on we need c me and my wife ain't seeing eyee to eye come amen Amen Brother come on okay okay now my wife going to sit down Watch How I cancel them that's why you got to live right right make it right at home for you can make your mind can be free that when you canel you can't be like man she going to get me no open your heart let it be open Let it Be Free other words live right amen confess daily that's it amen check your life daily amen right because you got to be ready for service for the Lord Jesus Christ right interceding and petitioning that's what he called you and me to be now flip with me over here to Leviticus 21 we're not going to hold you long this this is a this message really means a lot to me bless in my heart it really does it make me just make me look at me not putting my finger at somebody else but really really make me look at me right say God this is what you called me to be come on right Kings and Priests now in Leviticus 21 we know it's talking about the natural ironic priesthood that's what we get ready to read about the ironic priesthood now you know and I know uh the ironic priesthood die at Calvary that's right amen we're under the priesthood of M chesc but it goes to show you that what makes you and me a royal priesthood Jesus is our high priest but he didn't come out of Levi come on Amen is that right priest comes out of the tribe of Levi but Jesus come out of the tribe of Judah so that goes to show you and me he's God over all right he's Lord over all right but now what we're going to talk about here is the disqualification of preach naturally hello now we cannot apply that naturally the disqualification of a priest to us today right you can't do that but what we can do find out what the natural mean find out what the type is spiritually and then apply it to you are you with me now just watch just stay with me on this but I want you to notice when we talk about a priest being disqualified I want to put out what is he disqualified from notice right here Leviticus 21:16 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron saying whoever he be of thy seed in their Generations that had a blemish y let him not approach to offer the bread of his God I want you to notice that word offer comes up again now what did I read earlier in the church a book we Are Spiritual Kings to offer that's our job to be here is to offer so we're looking at offering again right here and listen what he said for what whatsoever man he be that have the blemish he shall not approach n going to begin to name the blemishes a blind man a lame he that had a flat nose anything Superfluous or man that is broken footed broken handed crookback dwarf or that have a blemish in his eye or be scurvy or scal or has his Stones broken no man that have a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come now to offer the offerings of his Lord made by fire he ha a blemish he shall not come n to offer the bread of his God now it Nam the blemishes but notice that word that keep popping up offer offer offer so was he disqualify from all from doing listen to the next verse it says this he shall eat the bread of his God both of the most holy and the holy see what he's disqualified from is offering right but not e right now listen God will let him eat of the Holy right and the most holy permitting him to eat the precious things of God that per man permitting him to eat it but would not let him come and make an offering right amen amen that's right don't you know that applies to you and me right God will not stop you and me from coming to church eating the message of this hour he'll let you eat it he'll let you sing he'll let you testify he'll let you give prais he will not stop you from doing it but what about your offering come on exactly he said who brother b y oh yeah oh yeah amen it's going to get a little bit of tight but it's going to be right I promise you that but I just want to tell you the truth right amen offering now according to what we read in the church a book he redeemed us for a purpose and he want preach to be able to offer but now this guy is disqualified for offering because of his blemishes now if we are disqualified from offering it ruined everything that he said what we supposed to be doing is that right oh ba you said brother I don't know I'll tell you what come with me to Matthew 20 Matthew 5th chapter before we proceed in the further sometimes I think people feel they a been Christians so long who where they can do whatever they want to do oh my say whatever they want to see say have any kind of attitude they want to have and Justified it don't work like that God does God is Holy the holy spirit is timid he will not accept anything amen let's just go ahead and just use the scripture right here Matthew Chapter 5 I want you to notice verse 24 Len how how look listen what Jesus said right 23rd verse therefore thou bring thy gift to The Altar and thou rememberest that th brother have an ALT against thee leave thy gift before the altar Altar and go thy way first to be reconciled to thy brother and then come off with thy gift other words what Jesus is plainly saying until you make that right I don't want your offering right that's it but God I mean I praying I got everything L out a beautiful offer he said so right amen that's the word that's the Bible God said I don't want your offering and you know why I like how he put it he gives no way of Escape no most of the time we say if they repent I Repent yeah right that a on true repentance he saying right here if you even know he got a problem with you right that's a pretty hard scripture a't it when you th that's why you now you condemn yourself when you say I think that brother got a problem with me right there and there right hello read the scripture right there and then you got to go to it anybody El said that that's right amen I know they got a problem with me I know they got a problem with me I ain't going to say nothing about them I know they got a problem with me but you I just read you what the scripture say if you remember this y they got all against you and of course that means husband and wives too am yeah cuz you know I think seem like in marriage life we think that we could exclude certain scriptures oh my huh come on now praise the Lord the Bible said do unto your you do unto other as you have them do unto you that's a scripture to live my friends right amen do you want people to gossip about you no then then don't gossip about them right because if you gossip about them you plainly saying that's what I want them to do to me right hello that's the Bible but you know sometime people be like you know my wife we coming to each other we just say thing like that to each other that's the problem right there you're coming right yeah that's right that's right I'm leave that one alone just get real quiet I want you to watch something go back to Leviticus 21 okay this is really really it's heart searching time that's right right to really make you just say look at you and what I want to point out brothers and sisters you know not condemn nobody but get sing how God is receiving our offering right how God receiving Our Praise right amen cuz you don't accept anything what we going to do in Leviticus 21 we're going to go down through a list of the blemishes you remember I said disqualifying factors which is blemishes right now these preach naturally in the Old Testament if they had any of them any of them blemish physically right they couldn't be they couldn't offer right they can eat all day but they couldn't offer but God want you and here me and here more than just to eat right he want us to be able to offer he want us to be able to stand in the Gap let me just give you a quote for we go on you remember the prophet of God when he told that eror right man he go pray for a man child what did the Lord say you're not worthy you're not fit to lay your hands on this child this man will come a long way for you to pray for the child and you're not fit y he said other words he said I don't want to hear what you got to offer right he said you going to make it right he sir excuse me I got to go make something right he went go make it right came back said the prayer Deliverance right now do that right there means that that don't apply to you and me oh they just for the prophet right right right right no that applies to you and me too because remember he said he's an example every Messenger to each age is an example of the people that live up under that messenger that was an example for you and me God has a a title wrot on you and me than anybody in the face of this Earth righten is that right when you was a sinner a lot of time when we were sinner we live careless life right amen if we didn't pay our bill that didn't bother us but now because you're a Christian something comes up you even L it bothers you right is that right because why you're thinking I don't want to offend nobody I don't want to make no mistake I want to be a perfect example I want to live a life in front of people I want to have a good report I don't want to bring a reproach right see that that makes our conscious and all thing we be conscientious of the things that we do and what we say because we supposed to be living Epistles right amen is that right right can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord but I want you to know we're going to go down we better not get all of them but we're going to walk down through these factors now the first one is a blind man that's pretty easy the blind leave the blind they both going to fall in the ditch right I mean if the man blind how you going to make an offering anyway he might stick his hand in the fire right right right right so I can see naturally why he was disqualified right but now let's take you to the spiritual side spiritual side if we are blind if we are blind how can we Le somebody else right right if you are blind to your own ways you are blind to your faults you're not seeing them how can you Minister and help somebody right brother right spiritual blindness the song that we saw Open the Eyes of My Heart cuz this is what we see from right here Open the Eyes of our heart amen so we can see so blind is friend if you can't not yourself see clearly you're blind you cannot minister right to somebody else right amen right can we go a little further the lame man I want to talk about the lame man for a minute I looked all these things up and I studied them the lame man is a person that was born naturally they might have one leg longer than other right and what it actually means they are unbalanced right they don't have a balance and the Bible tells us in the book of Psalm a lame man is unstable in all of his ways amen but now notice work with the spiritual lame man the natural he don't have a balance but what about the spiritual lame man right let me just talk about him for a minute a person that is spiritual lame they don't have a balance right amen a long leg and a short leg they can lean long in one area but they'll come short in another area they got no balance let me give you an example you get the preacher start preaching he start preaching about Daniel 70 weeks the trumpets and and the vows you get people in the church yeah amen praise the Lord glory to God and then all a sudden he come back the next seron he preach you must be born again ago yeah come on brother that's right Amen to that oh my amen he ain't got no balance right then by the same talking you get the other one sitting there preaching on the fire they send there that just so deep we don't need all of that yeah then he come back he preach on you must be born again amen praise the Lord one them got a balance right come on the Holy Ghost feeds off the word whether you hearing deep whether you're hearing sh right it's C it's the word you say amen amen amen that ain't deep enough ain't deep enough I mean what that mean yeah come on you can't go deeper than no by Soul the Bible tells from my understanding when you are born again you got everything inside of you right there and then you need for the Rapture but you got to grow into a statute of a perfect man I understand all of that but we'll keep growing until my brothers and sisters amen praise the Lord that's just too shallow friends let me tell you I hear if I hear a minister preacher on you must be born again I said glory to God cuz I start thinking about when he touch me amen it still be just that fresh and that much real to me right lame man no balance they got no balance they lean long in one area come short in the of that'll be the one too you get them kind in church you know what you get them kind in church they bun complainers right with quotes oh yeah a bunch complainer with quotes they'll be the one you see I dress too short heal too high mm quote prophy right no I'm tell you but you know what happened did that be the one always late the church then you give them a quote about being late to church then they Justified they got no balance right bless praise the Lord po man can I go on we just got about 10 more of them bless come on bring them on keep going I'm just trying to show you the spiritual side right disqualifying factors amen now the next one it said flat nose now flat nose poor fellow naturally he's done but what does that mean spiritually why would God look at a person with a flat nose and say that's it no you can't offer right yeah but when it comes spiritually what does that represent my friends friends when you know a person with a flat nose they called up their sinuses and when you and I a man got a sinus problem when you're eating food you can't Deserve The Taste yeah you cannot deserve what you're eating so what a flat nose represent is discernment right amen people don't have the right discernment a lot of people discernment am man it ain't discernment it's suspicion yeah right they say they deserving something no it's something that they suspected all along and just happened that's not deserving friends the Bible tells us we understand that the church ain't book that's when the church becomes an invisible Army when she's able to discern and withand the two spirits in the framework of the Christian church we got to have the right discernment in the hour that we're living in many people designment is based on friendship oh my because they know the person or don't know the person then they say oh yeah they make they judgment make they deser that's not deserving no it's not discernment that's right brother it's amazing how people can hear something go over somebody Church oh man they need the Holy Ghost that's why they did that then when they friend do it they get up to the church with prayer request pray for my brother he just need some help and he done the same thing why you can't tell me he need the Holy Ghost bless discern it today right oh my my my my and I think that's kind of falling on somebody evangelist come on I'm Discerning somebody in here need some more finances oh my yeah giv don't we all where is the deserving in that man look at the economy that's not no discernment I'm deserving right now somebody got a back problem and then somebody help him out to go he see that to I picked that up person just help them out yeah it's me if you really deser it you'll be able to walk right to that person and tell them right that's right we talk about spiritual discernment right we talking about spiritual discernment that when you're talking to somebody amen when they trying to run a little game on you or something God will tell you exactly in their heart that's what I'm talking about spiritual deser friend I done experience that many of time people tell me one thing but I know what they're saying right there in their heart God will show me exactly what it is right but today it ain't deser it it's suspicion help us Lord good Lord amen amen let's just go little for I ain't going hold you long the next one is a broken foot what a broken foot represents spiritually that's a person because broken foot that deals with your walk right amen now it what it is it's a person that's able to teach and instruct somebody but they themselves can't walk in it right that's a broken foot right hello can he stroke somebody else perfectly but they themselves can't even do it right can't even walk it right can I give you some examples on I'm going to give some without permission no perm I'm going give you get a man get a man instruct another brother how he should treat his wife and instru them so eloquently eloquently just just lay it quote after quote scripture after scripture the brother said man thank you he said brother just be gentle with her kind with her live a life in front of her just let that anointing be in your home let her watch you brother the love of God and grab her speak patient with her be kind it'll work thank you brother thank you then he goes home what are you doing to him I'm my patience is running out with you woman I'm tired of this now you keep me I'm a Son of God oh my oh broken foot he did instruct it very well yet he himself cannot even walk in it right amen bless him disqualifying factors for old crookback this is the one I have a problem with right here a crook back what it is the person with a defected spine he has a defect in his spine his backbone is deform his character is not straight it's crooked he cannot stand up straight if you question his stand on the gospel he will agree with you then he allow the straightway of the Lord to be bent just like his back bone that's a person they only agree according to who they are with right right right me and brother D can be talking about something a certain subject I said Brother D that exactly right you ain't nothing but the truth then I get brother Samuel we talk about the same subject he say something contrary to what Dale said and I tell Brother Sam that ain't nothing but the truth you're exactly right so crook back it depends on who he or she with how they going to make their stand but praise be to God I like to see some people they'll stand on what they believe regardless who it is when they can see it in the word they'll stay right there and rightfully divided and won't move God vindicate that God himself will vindicate that's right amen can we go on Father amen a dwarf praise the Lord where my little shk sister God bless sister not talking about you but that's what a dwarf is a short ver well we want to talk about the spiritual dwarf amen a spiritual dwarf what it is a little man there's a person that started growing but they stopped let me tell you something friends if you've been in this message five and 10 years and you got no father when you first came in it come on you a dwarf that's right you are not growing into the stature of a perfect man and if you're not walking in Father light how can you lead somebody else in it right let me tell you something friends what brother Brandon you we got to understand a prophet's office a a lot of things he preached is being fulfilled now amen back in the time when he was preaching people thought he was out of his mind going crazy but we are seeing the results right now because of the Prophet that look way ahead now you and I are living the prophecy it don't change from the prophet to the prophecy am and that's where we're at in the hour that we're living in amen but if you're going to be a spiritual dwarf you'll just sit there right will not grow will not move how can you minister right how can you serve God's people if you yourself is not moving can't do it right how often do you pray come on how often do you sit there and read your Bible right how often do you listen to tapes do you only read your Bible when you come to church come on do you only to pray when you come to church come on and then you get in service say I didn't get nothing another service blessing blessing you put nothing in you get nothing out that's right amen I sure hope he got a good sermon tonight wake me up and stir me up oh no you came to church woke up and stir up amen let me tell you something friends what we have done in the hour we living in we have subject we have caused our bodies to become subject with our thoughts right y when is the service tired yes you know brother Joe Green I asked this church this you know brother Joe them for what 30 years had service on Tuesday but now they changed their service

that you leave right there they be waiting on yout around a little bit sometime amen but you know how people are in church now let's visitor come visitors come and sit in their spot they come in the church be smiling at the door they Dam sh that's nonsense that's nonsense that's right you'all be free to sit any way you want to sit Ain't No Name PS on these seats wow brother on help us Lord help us amen can we go on amen that's right I'm not going in depth on all I'm just hitting the highlights the next one is the blemish in the eye now the man with the blemish in his eye is not like the blind man because the blind man can't see right right but the man with the blemish in his eye he can see y but his vision is distorted right uhuh other words he can't see clearly right God don't want us to be like that man no no God want us to see clearly Open the Eyes of our understanding amen praise the Lord Paul talks about those things he want us to see we be tossed and turn like children tossed and turn he want us to be rooted established in present day truth that's what God wants but the man with the blemish in his eye he can see but it's just started Vision right amen here he is husband is the head of the wife oh my Clear Vision oh my man is the head of the house Clear Vision man is responsible for the house Clear Vision right you g me distorted right that's right amen everything he said was true but now he trying to make his wife do it right that makes his vision distorted right right praise Lord amen sisters I know the prophet said man is the head amen I

weed either no you won't you won't y' just the same only thing going be different you got new equipment right that's why we really need to look on the inside right look what's going on inside of us

Amen Brother Sam I hope you have me back back soon come on you doing good that preacher coming around we ain't going to church want to hear all that but it's the truth amen if I wanted to be arrogant friends yeah I can just really blast this if I want to be real arrogant but I'm I'm not here to be ar arrogant I'm here to show you what we are we're Kings and Priests that's what God called us to be and I'm not a comedian I'm not here interested in getting you laugh and jum I'm not interested all you got to let s right down here and say is that me until then you ain't going to move you ain't going to go nowhere you just going go right around in death serm right amen it's all you going to happen got to be a change we're examples ambassadors of Jesus Christ representatives of Heaven everything that heaven has he'll back you up right and that's what God called you and me to be can't live any kind of life just can't do it praise the Lord scurvy scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C right and vitamin C is CA Oh I think I moved it okay here we go can y'all hear me and the lack of vitamin C is caused by eating a lot of canned goods dried food Salt food in other words it's a lack of fresh food right fresh food have plenty of vitamins and minerals a balanc diet will provide enough fresh food and thereby sufficient vitamin C yeah to prevent scurvy the man with scurvy I'm just giving you the definition he will not eat fresh food he only exist on Old books old sermons old lessons old understanding from the past oh he just won't move come on just just to make it a little plain he the first and second poor preacher Oh my he the first second poor believer will not go into the opening of the word I'm sorry put it that way but that's the truth and by having the scurvy it causes scabs which is the next one yep and you know what scabs are scab is a itching disease right a festering sorce that's what scabs are yeah and the person that got scabs they're always iterable oh yeah uneasy unsettle y very easily to get offended yeah yeah hello oh we got a lot of scabs let me tell you something friends this is one thing I learned about life I learned it a hard way but I learned it one thing my pastor always tell me when we work together we mess up on the job sometime things didn't work out right did we finally get it fixed he said brother B what did we learn tell me what we learned right he's CU we didn't learn nothing we got to go over it again right that's it and that ain't nothing but the truth right right and one thing I learned since I've been pastoring five years it depends what's inside of that person is how they going to receive your counseling make no difference what you say how beautifully you put it it depends on what's in them but if you got a person might got all of the problems in the world but they just got such a desire to be right right right that's the one you can deal with right but if you got one that got a lot of problems the only thing they want to do is talk to you about the problem don't want to change you might well get ready for four and five hours of canceling with repeats saying the same thing over over that's why you know I think I might just do this one day right when I canel a certain couple I'm going to write everything down write it all down everything I say what they say and when they come back the next month they walk in the offer and say here read this right here they say what it do I say it's your biography cuz you going to say the same thing and I'm going to say the same thing we're not getting nowhere but when you got somebody want to make a change but it depends on what's inside of them let me give you an example me and my son do some demolition work in my house and uh he had a one of his friends with him I told him to go tear a wall down let's go tear that wall down I didn't show them how to do it cuz I want to see what they were going to do you got to find out what person is at and then you can help them right now you know anybody in construction I know you in brother Samuel you know and I know when you de when you demo a wall a drywall you don't go just bust and pull little pieces off you just just creating a bigger mess it's going to take it longer for you to pick it up amen that's the only thing you created so but that what and and you know what they was doing they hitting the wall sweat pouring off of them dust flying everywhere making a bunch of noise I'm just looking at them and all of a sudden they got about do much done but they just exhausted with a big pile laying in the on the floor and I just look there and now I got to pick all them little pieces up I said all right I said come here what I did I found where Jo was right I just got my saws all right went right beside the Jo stick my fingers behind it and I just start see big old peie come out I picked it up I sat it down and I was like no sweat all I got to do now just pick it up and chunk it on the power now they got to get sh I said son I said work smarter not harder right and because he wanted to learn you know what he said he said Oh Daddy I see but you know what if my son already got complexes in his heart uh no self-esteem already just feeling down about himself when I made if he was feeling that way and if I would have made that statement work smarter not harder you know what he would have repli you just call me dumb no I didn't right that's the way you received it because what you already in you what you going through I did not call you that amen right see it depends on what's in that person how they going to receive that's why I one say he called me a buzzer I'm saying he called me Amen on what you're going through what's in your heart bless brother bless the Lord we're almost done that's all right good scab another thing about scab it also represents unforgiveness bitterness that's another thing scab causes unforgiveness and bitterness and that's one of the things I find so many saints of God it's an unforgiving spirit and they know very well Jesus said if you don't forgive that's right neither will your father in Heaven forgive they know it very well right Unforgiven I remember what you done to me yeah anybody in here good in history when you in school history anybody history history history anybody let me explain something every one of us should have raised our hand cuz all of us is a bunch of historians right soon as somebody make you mad I remember you done this I remember I remember I remember I remember oh yeah historians I talked to a brother one time him and his wife was debating she said it was such and such such he no she said it was such and such he said mm I said brother fair warning I just leave that alone you going to lose I you going to lose what no no no I no no no no no I said you got to remember something brother a woman a lady they can tell you what color pants you had on they can tell you what hours on the clock they can tell you where you were they I they can live it just like it happened I said brother leave it alone you're going to lose that's just to way a female is made up I'm not saying that a netive that's just the way you're made up right praise the Lord and the Bible tells us Brethren dwell with your wife amen with knowledge right realizing that they are the weaker vessel give honor to her she is the weaker vessel the Bible said give honor to her that she not a strong vessel M right she's a weaker vessel that's what the Bible say so you know what that mean brother you know you know what that mean it mean exactly what it said give honor so when she I'm just being honest cuz sisters there's certain things you can't control and it's called hormones when they decide to just they just do it and that's what the man got to be give honor be patient and realize that's the daughter of God Amen regardless of what she say cuz when the hormone go they can say some of the strangest things that can really hurt your feelings but it's not them and please brother don't you dare you are supposed to be a holy ghost Christian and you acting like that you just ruin everything you just throw some more gas on the hormones that's the only thing you done just throw more gas right on there ain't no wisdom saying stuff like that let her finish her course the Bible say an offended Man is Hard to win hello hello praise the Lord and since there ain't no LIC to make you do wrong either cuz sometimes they don't me the hormones don't get a chance because of you you do it hello now but those come the time in life you got to have an understanding that's my husband MH that's my wife because a man let me sister let me help you out this is what this is what ladies do a lot of times a man might do something in his house just knowing you're going to appreciate it that's why he's doing it for you knowing you going to appreciate it right he go to do it whatever it might be and then you you walking there he wants you to see what it is and you walking there you go he said look honey you go that's crooked you ruin everything right there you just ruined it it hurt him he might not tell you that he going to be like Here I Am Lord trying to do something get it appreciate look how she going to say it's that's I'm trying to do you you you just ruined it the best thing for you to do I don't care how crooked it is you say thank you honey thank you that is nice and then when he leave you fix it that's all you got to do that's all let the man have some Glory that's what he want praise the Lord give him some Glory thank you Lord but the things we do oh bless it just ruins it it just ruins it friend it shouldn't be like that oh my my my I hope you young girls are listening you going to get married one day aren't you I hope you're listening I really do so when you see your husband coming in on a sweaty day he don't cut grass and he walking in the house he might be putting on making it look like he just really do something best thing for you to do say let me get you something to drink honey thank you go ahead you don't don't be like when you see like you ain't even finished undergrass yet why you AC like that oh Bo I'm just trying to show you how to help the brother out that's the only thing I'm trying to do try to help the man out that's the way a man is praise the Lord is that right and I'm going tell you something brother if your wife ever go shop and get a dress oh Lord she trying it on give her some praise cuz if you don't oh she ain't going to say nothing you might be like she be like you seeing this and this and this look nice she and I got this yeah it look nice okay when she walk off and don't say no more you know you're in trouble then Here Comes Satan he don't appreciate you he sure don't he sure don't he didn't even tell you how good you looked in it he sure did Brother take that opportunity regardless of what you doing to give her some praise let her know that she look good and you appreciate her cuz if you don't 6 month down the road she will remember yes she will remember it she'll tell you exactly what happened it tell you everything you said cuz it ref fresh in the memory that's right and it's not right don't get a chance to destroy all marriages we do it he don't get a chance to call problem we do it right we permitted to happen when we should be walking with wisdom understanding one another amen amen praise the Lord it's the truth it's the truth you know sometimes sometimes people see little old C just holding hand and then little young C be like I wish you like that look how he is so nice and gentle to her just go ask him how long did it take to get that that's right trust me it didn't perfect marriage that didn't happen like that trust me it didn't right L cry lot of praying lot of understanding a lot of patience amen you know what one sister did to her daughter well the daughter told me about it what her mama did to her I think her and her husband live about 4 hours away 2 hours away her and husband they was newly newly well got married young in a marriage they got an argument she drove two hours away and went back home knocked on the door early in the morning Mama got up walk through the door you know how you back in the day you had little chains on your door you open the door little chain yeah so she unlocked the door and her daughter when she opened it the chain was still on it she hey mama she yes she said it's me she mhm she Mama it's me she she said let me in said you and your husband argue she said yeah she said go make it right shut the door and you know what she said that was the best thing her mama could have ever done for her cuz her mama would have let her in right every time the argument came I got somewhere I can go you know what I told my daughter and you can your HB for all you want to I don't taught you right I I know I taught you right right I said don't you come here I don't you come back here yeah don't come back here I said you and your husband get the argue try to come back here you want to you know what I'm going to do I'm going open the door wide enough to squeeze the grandbaby through am now the baby ain't got to hear what's going on y'all can deal with it go out on the head oh yeah I told her that praise the Lord the Bible say when a man join to when a man leave his mother and father leave he said leave and he said I hang around leave I told my children I do not train you to stay home I train you to leave that's right that's what I do we train you to leave right and I hope you get the Holy Ghost then leave show me a scripture where a girl can leave home and she ain't get married come on it ain't one right some girl like you so you telling me I'm stuck here guess what if you got the Holy Ghost your parent got the Holy Ghost you'll be happy to be stuck there because you do not realize what's going on out there that's marriage and divorce should never even have to be mentioned amongst our Young Generation that's right exactly she even have to be mentioned that's right but look at all the young people in the message getting divorced but say he choosing the bride why is this so it's because people has gotten away from God that's what he said praise the Lord Jesus the last one is the broken Stone our this here A lot of people don't like to mess with it but it still is the word I'm not afraid to mess with it cuz I understand what it means naturally what broken Stones is if a man cannot produce children right right he cannot offer right now what they got to do with us spiritually right now I heard some preachers preach if a minister ain't got the Holy Ghost if Pastor ain't got the Holy Ghost can't nobody in this congregation get it I have to disagree with that and I want to tell you why reason why I disagree with that because of what he said and KN it one in time a man can preach you a Holy Ghost full of message and yet he himself be lost oh my that's right oh my thank you he sure can well let me read about the broken Stones I didn't mean to put that up bless cuz even Paul himself said he said there's many instructors but few fathers right right right right right so broken Stones this deals with all of us right he says in church book the order of the temple servant is very revealing they are first of all priest who was Unix the sterile priesthood PRI the sterility the St of a people who Drift from the word for a people who claim to know God apart from the word are bearing a life as a sterile unit right y hello amen that's you say what that mean that means this right here and you say you loving God and serving God but the word ain't there right you're bar right you will you won't bring forth life you can't bring forth life cuz the word is just a seed but you're going to need the spirit the water that seed to bring forth fruit that's right that's why we worship God in spirit and truth you can't separate spirit and truth no more you can oil and wine right they all run together praise the Lord that's right that's why friends we want birth to take place we bring an atmosphere that's it it creates an atmosphere right somebody might need Deliverance create the right atmosphere they can receive the Deliverance even as the word is going forth we got a job to do amen we have a job to do amen disqualifying factors what about your offerings right come on is your heart condemned or is it free right what about your offering I tell you what I screamed out through the years to the young people preaching my heart out preaching preaching preaching you know sometimes this is Ministry you see things you get discouraged right right like god wow this I'm hearing this got done this and this and they probably was the the one that seemen the most Sint of all of them you see them do something last sometimes get so discouraging but it don't stop me from keep moving on that's right I said God I keep moving on I'll keep preaching I had a young Minister call me the other day brother brother ain't nobody in our church coming to the camp I said no problem he said what is wrong brother Bon with our young people and because I kind of know that area I said it ain't them what I said the parents he said what what I said H I said brother I said what don't happen I said y'all don't watch movies DVDs so long of entertainment I said now you come to church and expect entertainment oh my come on preach I said the children ain't seeing a a preacher act like a clown every now and then church don't even interesting I said cuz they won't entertainment I said you done that you put this garbage front of your children so long I said that's what they want you done it I'mma tell you being parents whenever you drop your standards you might always times that by a thousand for your child cuz they going to drop it even lower that's why we have a job to live in front of our children amen that's a job right praise the Lord because all these things now that's going on you can see more and more every day why it's going to be such a small bride such a small bride Le the seal right remember we are in the bride age but we still live in the Le of seal right in the coldness of Le of the seal you can see it creeping amongst the people right I said God we going to have to be like Sams say oh Lord just once more cuz you got to remember friend Samson did not backslide when he got to DEA right he backslid way before he got to the the just had the Detonator in her hand pushed the button right praise the Lord and one thing about backsliding whatever God convicted you on something you was wrong if you never repented of it and ease over you'll forget about it and your life will start going down right so repent quickly right make things right quickly and move on by God's gra right God bless you Saints it's going a little too long may the Lord bless you can we just bow heads father I thank you for your word oh God simp a little thought tonight father and I asking right now God that your Holy Spirit would just let these simple little words penetrate that we would just look in our own lives and say I
