and I know there's many needs among us we're a needy body but we know tonight that our Lord is a way maker and he is a miracle worker and maybe on this final service we just take a moment and speak to him Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon on this final service of the Year these final moments of this year Lord no doubt we can sit down and begin to take inventory of this year father father thinking about the things we've been through the situations of Life Lord no doubt this year has held many uncertainties for many of us but Lord at the end of the

myself out of the way Lord that your word could come forth in power and demonstration and Lord may you anoint these Believers oh God to pull up on the word and to receive Lord father may we close out this old year and go into this New Year father with a refreshing from your presence Lord now father we invite you among us tonight heal the sick Lord Save The Lost father Lord if there be any empty vessels here tonight oh God I pray you would fill them with the Holy Ghost and Fire and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to go to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 15 uh 1 Corinthians 15 this microphone's not in my ear if it's possible to put it in there would be great if not I understand uh 1 Corinthians 15 and we have a few places we want to read tonight and uh brother w told us to take our time and speak to you tonight so we pray we just take a few moments here in the word and amen I I do want to say that we uh sure love brother Wade and his friendship and amen there's one thing about it uh he's never changed amen he's always he's there it is brother thank you Amen brother Wade has always been a real friend he's always been a real buddy to us and amen I know you all are enjoying his ministry here and have for many years and amen to see the word of the Lord continuing on under the vision started here we say God bless you brother Wade and sister June God bless you amen is that how you wanted me to say that about oh okay amen amen he forgot I got the last word oh wait he gets the end of the service 1 Corinthians chapter in verse number one okay 1 Corinthians 15 verse1 amen and Paul here writing says now moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein you stand which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I have preached unto you unless you have believed in vain now watch what he says here he says for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scripture now I want you to watch here Paul is speaking of the life of our Lord Jesus and what is so astounding to me is everything that he did he did it according to the scripture amen he was born according to the scripture he lived he died and he rose again amen according to the scripture now if we could turn to St Luke chapter 24 St Luke chapter 24 it's a very very familiar reading uh to us as Believers brother Rand will use this many many times in his scriptures and in the sermons that he' preach about when their eyes were open scriptures and sermons on the resurrection in St Luke chapter 24 and I want to begin reading uh in the 30th verse and it came to pass as he said at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them now watch this and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another now did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way now watch here and while he opened to us the scriptures so he was born Liv died and buried and rose again according to the scripture but here he's actually walking with him as the resurrected Lord but he's still referring back to the scripture now we believe that word speaks of the bridegroom right well if it speaks of the bridegroom it must also speak of the bride and St John chapter 14 let's turn there and then I'll give you our subject and let you be seated St John chapter 14 and verse number 19 amen a good feeling in the house of God tonight amen St John 14 and 19 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me now watch here because I live he shall live also brother BR stopped and said see he was speaking to his wife amen because I live ye shall live also we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I could and if I would take a title tonight I want to talk to you here on this thought of walking in the precious light of his resurrection amen walking in the precious light of his resurrection now now you all uh know tonight that we have been sent amen a wonderful message amen amen we we believe that the message of the hour amen is the the truth and it is the revelation of Jesus Christ and as we studyed this I was just reading some quotes here and I want to if I can tonight to just lay a foundation here in 1958 brother br's preaching a sermon I know my redeemer liveth he said now dear God we are grateful this morning to be the people that is called called by thy name he said we are so glad that we do not have to just imagine anymore of a great resurrection that is to come he said because it has become a reality to us as we read it in thy word and see that thou H has promised this and filled it within our souls amen That Jesus Lives oh we are thinking this morning the many heartaches it's been in life and the many sadnesses that we went through the experiences that is torness and thrown us to the wind of the Earth how we have buried our loved ones and we have mourned at the grave and our soul seems to almost perish within us amen but we can think of today oh what it means that Jesus raised from the dead he spoiled every Power of the enemy when he rose up amen triumphant he took all the Shadows away he says and now we walk in the precious light of his resurrection amen that's a very powerful thing to me that we are no longer looking amen just for a resurrection in the future amen or this is some future event or something that's going to happen or it's a million miles away from us amen but we can say as job said I know amen that my redeemer liveth and at the last day amen he will stand upon on the earth or after the skin worms destroy this body amen yet in my flesh shall I see God said now he seen the resurrection would be brought about by a man someday and the sin question would be settled when that righteous one the Son of God Amen came to die for sinners now there was no man on the earth at that time or no man s amen they could ever Bridge the way between a holy God Amen and a sinful man he said but job here 4,000 years before his coming amen he saw his death his burial and his resurrection amen and his justification that come by the resurrection now watch and the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer amen now see it is a comfort to know that these things are true amen and that it's not a fiction story so job amen 4,000 years before amen our Lord was ever born or was ever slain upon a cross amen he saw that he would be the one who would bridge the gap amen or would be the one that would bring reconciliation between a holy God Amen and a sinful man and he would be the one that would also bring a Resurrection to the church but now watch job did not just see his resurrection he said but he saw an absolute guarantee amen of the resurrection of the believer now when you start talking about Resurrection you automatically know amen that we're speaking about the gospel right amen and the gospel amen is the birth it is the life the death the burial amen and the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen and the promise of his second coming right amen and the prophet of God will say this he said now see there is no other gospel he said if there is another gospel as Paul spoke to one of the groups I said I'm so surprised that you turned Amen to another gospel which there is no other amen but a make belief gospel Amen to a denominational fiction turning from that good news amen so the gospel is the announcement of the good news amen that Jesus was born amen that he lived that he died that he was buried and that he rose again amen but don't stop there that he's coming a second time amen and you are a part of that Resurrection amen because I live ye live also and I live in you amen and the works that I do amen I will identify myself in you he says now what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology listen but in the evening time amen there shall come light again we've had a world of dark theology amen but in the evening time there shall come light again listen there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light about the evening time again it is the rising of the sun because I live ye live also speaking to his wife amen what a resurrection that that was amen and what a resurrection this is see amen what a resurrection that was amen but what a resurrection this is Amen to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus amen by God's quickening power my he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost he said the word made manifest now and as I say it is to be waved again in the last day so there is a promise that the word of God Amen would be restored to the church amen and if it be restored then it would be wave to the church let me say this as gospel preachers amen we are not waving a fiction story amen we are not waving some man's idea before you or waving some tradition or some Dogma amen but we are waving the word of God and the prophet of God said now this is not a fiction amen this is the Bible it's God's truth it's his promise he said I've tried it and tested it and I know you can take God's word and he will make it right with you he will bring it to pass now we know by a prophet's teaching amen that there would be an absolute in this generation right amen and he would take time to identify amen what Webster said an absolute was he said see it's perfect in itself it's Unlimited in its power it is primarily an ultimate see it is Unlimited in its power it is perfect in itself amen and it really is an ultimate amen so an absolute is perfect it's an ultimate it's unlimited see he said therefore I think everybody amen should have an absolute how many agree amen that every body should have an absolute he said every great achievement that's ever been achieved there has been an absolute behind it no matter what it was it's had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something has to First have the absolute he said now that's the final wind back through this that through the other amen till you come back to that absolute or the amen amen or the ultimate see you've got to have something Amen to tie to in other words amen it's the final tying post now watch what a prophet says it's somewhere it might wind amen through many different things till it gets to that TI poost amen but there is an amen to all of it see you cannot go through life without having an absolute now I also took time to look up amen that word guarantee because the prophet of God said amen that job seem the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer that word guarantee is a very powerful for word it means a formal promise or Assurance amen that is typically in writing yep now that's that's a very powerful thing it is a formal promise or assurance that is typically in writing and it is that certain conditions will be fulfilled listen it is something that gives a certainty of an outcome amen so if you have a guarantee amen it's not something that's just on somebody's mind or it's on somebody's heart amen but it's actually been put into writing amen therefore nobody has a right to change it amen nobody has a right to say well it should be this way or well it should be that way now come on church amen I'll just say this the only absolute guarantee that I know of Amen is the revealed word of God that has been brought to this generation by a Vindicated Prophet amen listen it was written in the Bible amen and it was interpreted in 100 or or 1,200 books and tapes but let me say this don't just leave it in the Bible and don't just leave it on the books and tapes amen but now that absolute guarantee has been manifested in the flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why Paul would say Amen that you are a written epistle amen written in our hearts and you are known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with think but with the spirit of the Living God amen not in tables of stone amen but in fleshly tables of the heart again in Hebrews 8:10 for this Covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord look I will put my laws in their mind amen and I will write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people what is this speaking of it is speaking of a generation that will receive the absolute guarantee amen but will not be diluted it will not be watered down it will not be hybridized amen but it will stand and it's full Authority and it will stand in its full effect listen I say thank God Amen that we have got a written guarantee amen and we got our books and we got our tapes and we don't have to take what some man thinks about something that a prophet taugh we can go back to the written guarantee and we can see exactly the way a prophet taught it and that gives us the right to say it exactly the way he called it in the face of every unbelieving devil listen the prophet of God made it very plain he said therefore the man's spirit is Blended out Y come on now now there's a very important key the man's spirit is Blended out amen and God comes in and takes over he said then they got Fellowship one with another and the Very God that created the heavens and the Earth that wrote his word dwells in you listen and you'll believe everything that God wrote is the truth somebody say well I got the the Holy Ghost but I don't believe that scripture well you don't have the Holy Ghost to the Bible amen because it was a promise that the Holy Ghost amen would come into the flesh redeem flesh and would cause you to believe everything that was written in the word of God now we all have to agree tonight that the Bible is more than your grandma's Almanac amen it's more than just a history lesson or it's more than just some educated something the Bible is wrote by inspiration Paul said it this way he said all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof and for correction for instruction and righteousness he said now listen modern events make clear he said the Bible is the word of God Amen it is wrote by God himself amen through the lips and instrumentality of man listen God can write himself God can speak himself God can do what he wants to amen but he chose man to do it because the man that wrote it Is A Part of God listen the man that wrote it is a part of God he said the man didn't even know what they were writing in their own human thinking they might disagree with it amen but they wrote it they couldn't help but write it amen because God moved their hands he moved their eyes in the vision they could say nothing but they were looking at they could speak nothing listen cuz he had full control of their tongue of their finger every organ of the body amen was in full Sway With God no wonder the Bible said they were Gods amen they were a part of God listen that's how much God was looking over the word amen being wrote to you amen if he looked over that much being wrote amen then how much more did he look over when it come time to interpret the things that have been wrote amen amen I tell you it gets it gets in you if you really get to looking at it amen that God so took care of the writing of his word that there would not be one idea of a man involved amen there would not be one there would not be one uh uh there would not be one thing brother B said like this he said see not even the punctuation amen would be out of place amen now think about this if Moses was writing or Abraham was writing or some of those were writing amen now listen they had to write about their mistakes right amen they had to write about their failures and their blunders and their shortcomings listen they might have not wanted to write about it amen but brother Bob they didn't have a choice amen because they were in the full sway of the author so they had to write what he was moving them to write listen I'll say it this way we have seen a direct manifestation of that Amen in our age when a prophet stood there and he said listen I'm God's mouthpiece I'm God's voice to you amen y'all remember that I'm God's voice to you right amen he stops brother Aaron he says it like this he says now I shouldn't have said that he said I felt you kind of resent that he said but I'm God's voice to you he said but that time was under inspiration he said it wasn't me it was him in other words he didn't want to say Amen but God wanted somebody to say Amen you're my voice on the earth when those prophets were writing these scriptures what they were doing is they were writing prophecy amen of the coming Messiah which was none other than our Lord Jesus Christ now in St John 5 and verse 46 I love the Bible Amen in St John 5 46 Jesus said this he said for had you beli Moses amen you would have believed me for he wrote of me look at this word wrote it means to describe to write to commit to writing amen things not to be forgotten it means to record I love this it means it's used of those things which stand written in the sacred books of the Old Testament it means to write Amen to give information or Direction so that when something is coming it will not be missed amen now watch here in verse 47 and Jesus looks at him and he says but if you believe not his writings amen then how shall you believe my words amen now look Jesus amen was the manifestation of the writings amen that Moses wrote about Amen brother said like this he said this baby down here illegitimate birth in a cow stable amen how could that be amen this guy didn't go to any school he had no credentials he had no Fellowship card he didn't belong to any organization amen how could this be anything but it was he said see they failed to see it but Jesus looks at them I love this and he says listen the works I do amen they testify of me search the scripture amen for in them you think you have eternal life amen and they are they that testify amen they tell you who I am listen what he says he says they are my testimony amen so Jesus's testimony amen was scripture if you believe Moses you would believe me amen because he wrote of me so in other words they've got the Scrolls amen and they're reading about these things amen and here's Jesus and they're saying but you're not the one he said but I'm the one that Moses was writing about in other words said like this he said they were so dark and still they couldn't see it look he didn't say it was dark he didn't say around them was dark he said they were so dark amen I wonder if that couldn't repeat amen it's prophesied to you know amen you say in this day oh yes now what was Jesus amen Jesus was the scriptural light of the day amen the prophet

intellectualism he brought it by manifestation oh Church of the Living God he was the manifested word amen there was a time that God thought about his word amen that God spoke his word that God had his word wrote amen but now was the time the thought word amen the spoken word the written word would become the manifested word and when it become the manifested word it would be Vindicated amen by the interpretation of the one who wrote it my goodness amen the scriptures cannot be broken amen the word must be fulfilled that's why Jesus said amen that heaven and Earth shall pass away amen but my words amen shall not pass away he said and God's word is so real amen that's enough scripture right there Amen to take all the communism out of the world and to convert the entire world it's an invitation to South ation it's an invitation to Healing listen it's the guarantee of eternal life glory to God Amen listen you got a guarantee amen of eternal life amen let me say it again you got the

and spoken by God himself he said it's the guarantee of eternal life here's what I love he says oh means so much if it be received in the light that it's wrote in it means so much if it be received in the light that it's wrote in can you say that with me it means so much if it be received in the light that it's wrode in you say in the light amen let me say this before I go any further eternal life to a Believer is a guarantee yes amen amen it is a written Divine promise you say where can I find that 1 John 2:23 whosoever denth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son amen hath the father also listen let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you shall continue in the son and in the father and this is the promise that he has promised us even eternal life amen I pray to God that the Holy Ghost tonight amen will so change your focus as we close out 24 and we go into 25 may we go into 25 with this confession I am a possessor of eternal life I am a possessor of the revelation of eternal life when brother come there in 1963 and he begins to breach to begins to preach the seals in the first seal in his prayer he says we are thankful Amen to be alive and to have this great revelation of ET etal life dwelling within us he said we've come tonight father to study Thy word together these great Hidden Mysteries that's been hid amen since the foundation of the world Amen and the lamb is the only one that can reveal it to us he said so I pray that he will come among us tonight and will take a hold of his word and will reveal it to us that we might know how to be better Servants of his in the end time listen whatever was in this written guarantee what's going to equip you to be a better servant unto God in the age that you're living in now I'll just say this friends amen this Bible to me is more than a book to debate about amen it's more than a book to just look at ever now and again amen but this Bible is full of promises and let me say they're not man-made promises amen they're not Church made promises amen but these are written formal guarantee of promises Amen to the believer amen now as we start talking about promises Amen brother brother brother waade you know we don't have time to preach all the promises in one night amen but there's one promise I want to take a few moments on tonight amen that I'm thankful for amen and that is the promise of light amen not artificial light amen not Cosmic light amen not man-made light or denominational light amen I'm thankful for the light that was prophesied amen from the Bible which I'll call Bible light because it's what a prophet called it in Zechariah 146 he said now listen it shall come to pass in that day so this is a prophecy right it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day or night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light now look here in modern events he said the the evening light promised by the prophet of God in zecharias 14:7 May again open the true believer's eyes Amen to the events that's taking place today amen that's proved by the prophecies that we're at the end time listen Jesus is coming another paragraph but the prophet said it shall be light again about the evening time the s o n The Sun Will peep out again it shall be light amen what the same son s o n listen that was revealed in flesh at the morning time back there will be revealed again in the evening time amen can I say it to you like this amen it's the same sign the only difference brother Bob is the flesh that is being revealed in in the morning time it was revealed in the flesh of our Lord Jesus which is our bridegroom but in the evening time the prophet of God said amen I challenge you to believe amen that the son of man revealed again in human flesh amen through the brid's body listen I think it's time Amen to take all the emphasis come on church for years we've had guys that won't go no further amen than God sent a prophet and then we get some guys who will come a little bit further and say well God sent a prophet and he was Vindicated and they'll fight you amen like a junkyard dog over the Vindication of this Prophet amen but they'll never go in Amen to what he preach I say well the third pool was just for a prophet and the spoken word was just for a prophet and John 5 or John 15 uh John 5:24 amen he that believeth on me hath passed from Death un life they'll say well now listen that's for the bride amen but now but now John 14:12 that's just for brother brandom because in John 14:12 it just says he well let me ask you how far are you going to run that amen because if John 14:12 that he is only brother brandom amen you could very easily say the he of John 5:24 is only brother brandom as well so you've only got a prophet passing from death unto life but I propose to you tonight upon the authority of the written guarantee of the message of Malachi for that there is a bride in the last days that has been redeemed from the hand of the enemy she's been Sanctified she's been Justified she's been filled with the Holy Ghost and the Greater Works are being done through her flesh as a prophet said they would be done and then you say well you're getting out there I'm only going where a prophet went and he said the word of God the works of God will be revealed Again In the Flesh of the Bride what light are you talking about preacher I'm talking about the evening light amen or the Revealing Light or can I say the prophetic light in in Isaiah 60 y'all like your Bibles and then let's turn to Isaiah 60 in Isaiah 60 chapter 60 and verse one I love what the Bible says here Isaiah being a prophet he begins to prophesy and he says now arise and shine amen for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon me so there's going to be a Darkness upon the Earth amen but listen there's going to be a worse Darkness upon the people that's upon on the face of the Earth in Shalom 1964 hold your place there he says now good morning which means peace he says the darkness is gathering amen what's it gathering for to show the light amen Isaiah 16 verse1 Rise and Shine for the light has come that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you see God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world Amen they called out and ordained to that look at verse three and the Gentiles amen shall come to thy light and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising now amen I know amen it's a it's a Tuesday night so we might as well just preach for a second amen cuz it's an age Amen brother W where people go and they do their DNA you know they go on ancestry.com or they'll do some type of DNA and they'll get their results back and then all of a sudden they got 2% of 2% of 2% of Jewish or Israelite blood and all of a sudden they're Moses and Elijah they're one of the prophets to take the gospel back to the Jews amen they're they're come on they quit acting like a come on well I'm I'm might well just preach amen they quit they go back to feast and and and traditions and and washing pots and not eating pork and am and and just because they found a little inkland amen of some Jewish blood somewhere but according to my Bible amen this light was to come to the Gentiles listen I don't I hate to bust your bubble amen but when it's all said and done yeah I felt that Spirit a prophet was standing there on the border fishing to fly over to Israel and preach this gospel to them and the angel of God come down and said don't go it's not time for them to receive it you know why because there was the 11th Hour people which was Gentiles who would receive the cross of Calvary when the Jews rejected the Messiah there would be a bride on the earth who would have eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to receive what the Jews had rejected now listen I'm not one that don't believe it's not going to go back it is going to go back and when it goes back the door will be closed amen but let's just let the rubber hit the road we're Gentiles and the Bible said the Gentiles shall come to thy lightam comes along in Shalom and he says here it is the light Vindicated again amen it's God's word so that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age see these promises that's been made for this day these promises that was said by the prophets and by Jesus himself y now when were they spoken in this day now you can take that to Hebrews 1 God and sundri times and diverse manners amen they spake to their fathers amen through the prophets look but in this last day amen through his son Jesus Christ now let me just say this Jesus Christ testified that he was the True Light in St John 8:12 he said I am the light of the world see he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life said like this without light amen nothing can live so the reason they're living under traditions and under Feast is because they don't have no light amen but the reason you're not living underneath those traditional Feast is because the Gentiles amen shall come to the evening life that was promised to return and to bring a resurrection in the church age book hope it's okay to preach from it he said no one could deny that Israel had light amen they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it amen but in the homes of the Israelites there was light amen here it is church amen Darkness shall be upon the Earth and a gross Darkness upon the people but in the homes of those Israel lights there was light he said but now True light has come for the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets amen they brought the light by the means of the scripture which was relevant to the Messiah thus Israel had light amen but now the Fulfillment of the light has come so when Egypt was in darkness there was light in the home of the Gentiles you know how there was light because there was somebody reading the Scrolls that was speaking of the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah but Jesus came upon the Earth and he said well you had light in your tents and you believe me back then amen but why can't you believe that what you was reading amen is standing in front of you oh church of living God we've read these books for 40 and 50 and 30 years but can we come to a place that we can realize the things that we've been reading about we've been preaching about we've been studying about has come into the Flesh of the bride and is in fulfillment today listen somebody say well there's a bride coming I say there's a bride here somebody say well there's an invincible Army I say there's one here somebody said well there's an overcomer coming I say there's Overcomers here tonight hey because the word has been revealed according to the spirit and what was but the glowing word has now broken forth into the brightness of God manifested among his people I love this the sunshines amen for a seed that is gered to life and this Bible and his word in the hour that we live is shining it's shining brother it's shining upon those Amen to catch the eternal life amen those who are predestinated to see it can I say this Isaiah prophesied in chapter 42 but the prophecy was fulfilled in Matthew chapter 4 the Bible says in Matthew 4:16 that the people amen which sat in the darkness amen they saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death amen Li is sprung up now look here they sat in the shadow of death Isaiah 9 and2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light listen and they that dwell in the land they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the life shined oh think about it church amen notice what he says here they are dwelling in the land of the shadow of death so in this land everything is affected by the shadow of death now come on church amen our politics are affected by the shadow of death our educational system is affected by the shadow of death amen our po I don't want to get too too bed down here but let me just say it am our our our churches our religions amen they are bogged or they are covered by the shadow of death Matthew chapter 4 the prophet of God said amen bring light to the Gentiles who were possessed and they were condemned by God in their Idols amen but he come as a light listen you was in a land and everything was under the shadow of death Idols had possessed you now come on Amen I'll say it like this people say well I never was an idolator amen that television that should already be gone come on now well I know it ain't popular but it's the truth anyhow amen amen I guy told me one time he said well I'd come I don't get in trouble sure as World guy got saved he told me brother Andrew he said the day I got saved he said on the way out the door the preacher said well he said I'll be back he said I'll see you tonight he said I won't be here tonight he said why won't you be here tonight he said well cuz I got my television program he said what's your television program he said Andy Griffith comes on at 5:00 and nobody stopping me from watching Andy so the guy just got saved but the television going to keep him from coming back to church on Sunday night so he told me he said I went home and I sat down and he said why I sitting there he said it come about time for it to come on and he said I turned on he said all of a sudden he said my wife was playing a tape over in the other room she's getting ready to go church and he said I heard a prophet on there say if you got the Holy Ghost you take a shotgun to the thing he said well I looked down and realized I'd have to do that when I got home cuz I didn't have the time to do it before church he said said but I got up and went to church amen see what it was he was underneath a controlling spirit and we laugh at something like that amen but what about today church amen what about around the ranks of our message when we got teenagers that don't even know what a prophet said what about today when we got Mom and Daddy putting kids in sports and missing the house of God come on church amen you know it's the truth amen all year long to go on vacation amen but wait till a special meeting and it's time to go to the beach can I preach a minute are you hearing me and and it's it's the age we're living in the shadow of death has covered everything but thanks be to God he prophesied that he would come as a light and the light would bring light to the darkness and the Darkness being exposed would bring a condemnation upon your heart and you would fold the thing down and say I'll follow God and the freedom that the light has brought me I know that ain't I know that ain't popular preacher but it's still the truth somebody say well I don't know well I do I know today we got kids around this message that don't even know the sound of a prophet's Voice come on brother well we don't want to force them well you ain't you you oh god well we don't want to put too much pressure on them you know we don't want to no amen but you don't mind putting pressure on them with the world and you don't mind them knowing the the the latest sports star and you don't mind them knowing the latest education amen I say this amen I guess I may be 28 years old but I guess I'm just old school I Still Believe We ought to stand by what a prophet said I still remember when we preached Holiness and people shouted instead of pouted right I still remember the days when a man could come to a pull pit and just read a scripture and read a quote and stand there and just preach what a prophet said amen but now we got to sophisticated we got to have some intellectual come along and tell us why brother said it and how he meant it and the way he should have said it and why we can't and can't preach it well listen listen I have not forgot what the prophet said I know I'm Just a Nobody but this nobody knows what the prophet said he said there would be a bride and she would be so on fire with God until the devil don't know what to do with her she ain't going to be lukewarm and she ain't going to be formal and she ain't going to be questioning everything a prophet said she's going to be walking in the light that has condemned the idols of her life and brought her a Deliverance today the light of God is the word made manifest now I'll just say this I love what the Propet God said he said they say now look when you say in the dark shadow or the dark Valley of the Dark Shadow he said no it's the Valley of the shadow of death he said in other words it's a scarecrow to the believer listen just to scare them enough there's enough light mixed in it to show that there's light somewhere another place he said let me say one more thing there is a man here that can turn on the lights those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer some of them under death of denomination some of them under Creed death some of them under traditional death and them all kinds of death but they have seen a great light the man that flashed the light then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light and that same God yesterday today and forever he is present today right here now amen don't you get scared he can turn turn on the light he said there's one here today he's the only one he's got the light switch in his hand amen don't reject it receive it in the name of the Lord what is this light doing brother way this light has brought a resurrection into the church in other words the evening lights he said was the manifestation of the Resurrection when they didn't know he had raised from the dead although they loved him they believed him but they didn't know he had raised from the dead they argued against it amen but now here it is in the evening time and he's going to reveal himself that he is raised from the dead and how did he reveal himself by opening the scriptures to them in the prophet's message Ephesian Church AG Church age book he says he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit sath in the church how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to Spirit instead it listened to man amen but remember there was a resurrection in the morning time and there'll be a resurrection in the evening time he said but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up am come on church amen what did he do on the third morning he got up he rose up there will in the last days there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit and in that day of grow Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ my so he rose she's going to rise am amen somebody shout hallelujah amen if that if that if the word of the Lord offended you amen don't let the word offend you just kick that devil out of the way and move on come on church amen I tell you what we ought to do is we ought to stop letting the correction of the word stop the services yeah come on brother amen oh God Amen everybody shout their shoe heels off as long as it's blessings Heen they start preaching some correction and they'll bring a little repentance in there and everybody gets all somber and they get all tore up cuz somebody said something amen that ain't the time to shut down that's the time to kick the devil out of the way come on if you've been missing Church repent of the thing and get back in the house of God I heard it take the other day I'm going preach a sermon on it the pr of God said like this he said repent of the thing and go on he didn't say sit there and water and cry repent of it and go on and church I say sometimes we're looking for a Revival and what we need is a repentance and a repentance will bring a Revival listen if the word condemns something we're doing we ought to be man or woman enough to say God that's me but Lord I Thank you for loving me enough Amen to send a man of God behind the pull pit to tell me where I was wrong I don't want to be wrong I want to be right hey come on church amen let's get back to repenting of things and going on somebody shout amen amen repent Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm the one I'm wrong but I'm going to let it go I'm going on with Jesus come on I'm going on with Jesus I'm going to serve him I'm going to love him I'm want to let him reveal himself to me listen because light comes but as always though people love Darkness more than they love light the Bible said this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil look here but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be manifested that they are roed in God so the prophet of God said see he said the son is the king of all livs on this Earth in the naturalites he said then when the word of God Rises all superstitions let me back up here for a second he said when the he said the P Su n naturalite King he said now listen no matter how much artificial light we have how many electric ray we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out when the Su in Rises come on Church what's more powerful amen the lamp by your bed or the Su in in the sky come on what's more powerful your little flashlight or the Su in listen because a flashlight only has the ability to reveal so much I remember one time I I I think of this often when I get to reading these quotes I remember one time we were hunting one time in and my uncles and we went out real early you know how you go out there before the daylight comes and you got your flashlight you know and you only use it as much as you need it cuz you don't want to Spook anything off so we get over there to our to where we're hunting we get set up and while we're standing there brother way I'm looking out across the across the ridge there and I see this big you know this big lump or something there on top of the Ridge and I leaned over to my uncles and I said that's a deer well they thought it was kind of funny because here it is pitch black dark I mean well it's starting to break light but it's still not shooting light still dark and I look over and I said there's a deer and I never forget it they said oh that ain't a deer and I said that's a deer guys that's a deer up there so about about 30 40 minutes later the sun come up and all of a sudden we're standing there and what was laying up on top of the hill stands up and it's a little deer or not a little deer it was a nice it was a good siiz deer and it turns and my Uncle Andy already had his gun up to shoot it and when he saw it I looked over him I said it was a deer wasn't it now see I could only tell them that come on now because I somehow had the ability to see it but they could not see it until the light shined upon are y'all hearing me and church Living God a Prophet come among the church and he had the ability to see some things but people wouldn't believe it but when the S so n Rose they could see for themselves he said see when the word of God Rises superstitions and denominational fanaticisms and those things spread away and it shows exactly what it is and the word of God made manifest always separates the light from the darkness he said his word is superior over all men's words over all anything his word is light now let me just say it to you very plainly therefore Darkness and Light will not mix he said because light is so much more powerful it just puts the darkness out amen can I say this to you if you're living in darkness if you're going to church under Darkness if you're listening to tapes under Darkness hear a prophet don't sit in darkness no more oh amen did I read that right don't sit in darkness no more the light has come and the great conqueror is here B said what does the light come to do he said the light comes on to reveal something is that right amen what good does you do to reveal if you haven't got asked to see what's been revealed he said what you going to reveal he's going to reveal Malachi 4 he's going to reveal Luke 17:30 he's going to reveal John 14:12 John 15:24 John 16:13 and to also reveal Revelations 10 1-7 the opening of the seven seals the seventh Angel's message to open up to reveal when the evening lights come when the evening light comes Church it is bringing a season of Revelation to the church listen in other words the word will be resurrected and we will be walking with Malachi 4 we will be walking with Revelations 10 we would be walking with Luke 17 we would be walking with John 14:15 and 16 oh God what are you saying preacher I'm saying tonight friends we are reading the word in light we are reading the word in light we have received the word in the same light it was rode in Exodus 13:21 the Lord went before them by day and a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night and the pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pill of Fire by night from before the people calling Jesus on the scene 1964 God is light we know that Pillar of Fire oh church I'm feeling good unveiling of God think of it the same Pillar of Fire that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible amen what a comfort what an identification identified in that word where the Shak of Glory and the Revelation lays the pillar of fire appear invisibly Among Us identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount SII listen friends before Moses brought the Commandments he was Vindicated by the pillar of fire and the pro of God said listen before those seals were brought in God come down and Vindicated by a pillar of fire oh in this last day to see the same Pillar of Fire right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpret it by making it manifest and proving it is the truth oh somebody shout amen can I give you another one notice the same Pillar of Fire sent to Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible somebody say is now sent is now sent is now sent to reveal it the grace of God the unchanging God fulfilling the promises of Matthew 28 Lord I'm with you always fulfill in John 14:12 the works I do you also fulfill Luke 17:28 to30 in the day the son of man will be revealed revealing Malachi for fulfilling it behold I send you Elijah the prophet that will restore the faith of the people back to the original word listen you say preacher why are you shouting why are you so happy about it because Church finny look for it Luther looked for it Wesley looked for it they knew it was coming but brother tonight I can stand before you and say we salute the return of the pillar of fire to the Church of the Living God we're not looking for the pillar of Fire come on church I'm looking at the pillar of fire you say looking at the pillar of fire well my Bible says that there was a rainbow over his head and his feet was as it were the pillars of Fire come on Church brother said on the day of Pentecost the pillar of fire come in the upper room and it begin to whirl around there and it begin to break apart and a liqu went in one and a lick went in another he said then when they all get together the whole Pillar of Fire comes Among Us what is it there it is can I give you another one that same Pillar of Fire that same light Among Us bearing forth the life it did when it was in Christ Jesus doing the same thing in the bride church today come on church I rebuke that ungodly death that said it's only on a prophet right amen come on now I rebuke it I rebuke that ungodly devil that says the only Miracles can happen is if a prophet comes back that is a lie that c up out of the pits of Hell there is a bride only Earth today who is underneath the influence of the pillar of fire and the same things he done she's doing amen what did he say he said I come from God and I must go back to God he said that same line is coming to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day the manifested light of the day can I say what a prophet said he said the darkness is darkened yeah come on friends you think it was bad in the 60s what about today the darkness is darkened the darkness upon the Earth has darkened the gross Darkness upon people has darkened but there's a bride on the earth who has received the message of the hour she has received the evening light she has received the Revealing Light she has received the prophetic light what are you going to do with it come on Brother come on what are you going to do with it you say well Heen let me just say this don't you ever get in your mind you're better than somebody that's under Darkness because if it wasn't for the grace of God it would be our babies out te with pink hair on one side and blue on the other if it wasn't for the grace of God God who knows where it be tonight but God who is rich in Mercy so loved us Gentiles that he sent us a prophit in this age to stand and to condemn the darkness and by the condemning of the darkness he was preaching an exit to the Gentiles to walk in the light of the Resurrection hallelujah hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I'm a son God who has been given eyes to see this light you say what do you mean by what are you going to do with it well y'all remember brother tells that story about the about the B the Burge remember they went up the Statue of Liberty he said we was up there we saw them sparrows laying around the big glass there he heads and beat off I said to the GU I said well what was what what was them there he said well

something he said know they used it to beat their brains out when they should have used it to lead them amen listen I've met preachers they're nervous wreck and I've left out F I've left out knowing why they were a nervous wreck it's because they argue with Brother brandom on everything thing he teaches well brother brother BR said this well brother I tell you why you can't say it the way he said it because I Y y'all been there don't argue with the message use it said infidels rise sure they will Creeds will rise sure they will people saying the Bible's not right they're always going to do

light amen not try to beat it out not try to say this is right or this is wrong and that's not right and that's not right oh God don't let me beat against your light let me accept it in my heart and say it's right Lord and I walk in the light as I see it in the scripture that's light it's God's word now watch a prophet let me walk in it Lord Lord let me walk in it and never never never try to deny it listen Church before you can walk in the light you've got to step in the light amen I'm turning a corner now amen the pro of God said brother if we'd ever come in the presence of God like Moses did why it was a revolutionary to him it would revolutionize in the light of the angel of God that's standing there on that mountain that day everything that he once had or thought would never happen it come to be a reality amen amen can I can I take the can I take the breaks off and preach a minute amen I think you men and women today would ever step in the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and let the light of God's word everything that God has promised listen will illuminate to you and be real again come on church I say this to you it used to be real to you yeah come on now there's some of y'all you're shaking your heads you know what I'm talking about amen there were things used to be real to you but they're not real to you no more you know why they're not real to you it's cuz you got out of God's light and you got out of a man's light or a Church's light amen but I say on the final three hours amen of of 2024 I invite the pillar of fire I invite the angel of God to come down in this Sanctuary tonight and I pray every son and daughter of God will spiritually stand up and will step into the light of God's word hallelujah amen get back in the light of God's word and let the promises of God become real again hey well God's going to heal me God's going to heal me God's going to heal me and then all of a sudden I don't know if God will heal me or not you know why you believe that cuz you got out of God's light and started walking the doctor's report come on church amen well my baby's coming back my baby's coming back my baby's coming back and you believe that as long as you were walking in the light of God's word amen but the men you saw a new tattoo on them or you saw them drinking or you saw a picture amen that didn't look appropriate all of a sudden all the faith left I say that ain't a Time Amen to step out of the light of God that's a time to stand there and say devil you may take him as far as you want to but I've got a but bound promise I'm underneath a covenant and the word of God says it will happen amen hallelujah I say it's time to stand up against that devil reason Moses failed in the first place here's what was the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush had that's right and what's our failure today is the lack of having what the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all good things for us amen and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible come on church not only possible but they are promised to us ask the father anything in my name I'll do it if he in me and my words in you ask what you will and it will be given to you see listen can I say what the prophet said when we step into the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it brother The Impossible becomes little things then see then when God's word his promise becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel of the Lord Stop Moses now he is on his Road right come on Church what did the pillar of fire and the burning bush do it puts some walking shoes on Moses amen well I might as well just preach I feel good it put some walking shoes on Moses you know what it did it took his running shoes off the shoes that caused him to slay an Egyptian and then take off running as a coward the pillar of fire brother Wade Hallelujah it took those running shoes off and put some marching shoes on what are you saying preacher I'm saying how many tonight says I'm going to step in the light am how many tonight says I'm going to step in the light I'm going to step in the

prayer request listen I am done standing underneath the Shadow and the influence of darkness and death I am a child of God I have been liberated from a gentile mentality I don't serve an idol I serve a living God I've got a right tonight to take the word of God and stand in the presence of the angel of God and say Satan give them back Satan give it back you say preacher well I'm up in the light

telling you tonight it's time to walk church it's 2024 we're fishing to go into 2025 it's time to quit sitting on the premises it's time to start Standing on the Promises and walking as Sons and Daughters of God footsteps means possession right you say walk look at 1 John 1:7 look what what the Bible says the Bible says but if we sit in the light is that what it says let just say if we if we if we just kind of hang out in the light brother Bob but if we walk in the light look at this word walk it means to make one's way it means to progress come on church are you ready for this to make do use of opportunities if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin you say well preacher I would love to walk but I can't amen because of the sins of my past and the iniquities of my past amen I come back tonight to tell you there's a blood young man there's a blood young lady there's a blood my brother and my sister there is a blood if you're letting the devil hold your past over you and telling you you can't walk I tell you that devil is a defeated being brother Aaron that devil is a liar and you got a right tonight to walk not a crazy man it's time to walk amen I'm going read it to you from the Amplified Bible okay but if we really walk in the light that is live each and every day in the Conformity with the precepts of God as he himself is in the light we have true un broken fellowship with one another righten that's he with us and we with him are y'all ready for this and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin here it is by erasing the stain of sin did I read that right by erasing the stain of sin and keeping us cleansed from sin in all its form Ms and manifestations look at this word opportunity it means a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something it is a chance for success or advancement occurs let me say this as plain as I know how spoken word church we are not going backwards no we are not retreating we are advancing in spite of dungeons or swords or storms brother said God's Church es forward onward and we're so happy amen oh the Glorious thoughts and the joy amen that sweeps through our souls when we look upon these promises and the Holy Spirit bearing us record that they are true amen somebody say this with me God's Church God's Church moves onward mes onward and upward said Mama walked in one light you're walking in another Luther walked in one light Wesley walked in another Wesley walked in one L Pentecost walked in another but we're walking on higher than that today and if there's another generation it'll go beyond us what are you saying preacher I'm saying this is the hour this is the advancement of the Gospel come on Church it is Advanced amen from the birth to the death amen come on it is Advanced from the birth to the life from the life to the death from the death to the burial from the burial to the resurrection but Church of the Living God it is gone just beyond the first resurrection it has advanced until there is another spoken word seed rde upon on the earth who is in position to resurrect and change but this is the thing today he said the church grain don't want to mature it wants to stay back in Moody's time or sanki or fny or Knox or Calvin they were all right that was light of their hour but this is another hour this is another day this is another hour this is another day this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we cannot live in what Luther said or Wesley said or the rest of them said we're living in the light that's predicted for this day we're in the seven Church age not the third or the fourth the grain should be able to receive it come on church if it doesn't it falls off and it means nothing to it can I say what the prophet said he said the grain is matured with the light Amen brother Wade the grain is matured with the light if if it goes ahead with a l amen my goodness church that tells me then we ain't got no business judging situations the way reformers did yeah right brother I know guys will'll dismiss what brother Ram said and judge the situation by what Luther said yeah come on or they and I'm not trying I'm noty trying to meddle but I'm just preaching a second here amen that's that's like a brother told me one time he said now when you preach for me he said don't don't quote brother Bram too much he said we don't do that here I said okay so I I got talking to him and I said well don't quote brother brandom I thought this GNA get real good so I said let's see who he quotes when he goes up and he got up and said you know this morning I was reading Spurgeon and he said something really good and I said Spurgeon who was a who was a cigar smoking preacher well you might as well say Amen we're here till midnight are you hearing me amen don't quote a prophet of God don't quote a cigar smoking Spurgeon listen oh god well glory to God I'll just go ahead and say it amen they say no amen don't quote brother Brandon we're just going to we're just going to quote the Bible amen can I ask you all something how do you quote the Bible without preaching what a prophet said that's righten can I ask you something amen how do you preach Israel leaving Egypt and not mention Moses how do you preach the children amen of Noah getting on the ark and not mention AR mention Noah it's impossible therefore church we are grain seed children we don't have to live on what finny said we don't have to look to what knock said we can stand here tonight and say the bridegroom is made a cry get up out of your Slumber and sleep and say what a prophet said put on the armor of light redeem the time in other words Paul's saying redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself amen no I'm not going to skip over it I'm going to say it amen Matthew 25 there were 10 virgins there were five wise and five foolish I know people say different things but brother B said the five wise was the bride he said while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept but at midnight a cry Goes Forth in Romans 1311 you know what Paul says he said knowing the time that now it is high time to awaken out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the light is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light Redeeming the time because the days are evil Redeeming the time look at this Redeeming the time buy up every and each opportunity look at this word time it means the Supreme moment brother Aaron it's the golden opportunity in other words Paul is saying little bride Church redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself Church you are the first ones that is not in the stalk you're not in the tassel you're not in the shuck the shuck has give forth to the seed and the seed is in the presence of the Son and the son is none other than God himself oh amen can I can I can I unload my heart on you right now why are we wasting time in the presence of the son you say preacher you're bringing it down serious I am because the prophet did he said don't you never fail your opportunity you know what he said in the Easter seal right before he goes off the scene he said oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunity St Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities Enoch and Elijah and all them never had the opportunities we have now now you say preacher you're getting pretty bold I am getting bold because you're the first generation that's laying in the presence of the son that's right now I'm going to close on this right here we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah never had the opportunities we have now you know I think this is very powerful that Enoch a type of the Bride type of the believer do you all know in the Book of Genesis 5:21 I'm going is it can I have a few more minutes Enoch lived 6 and5 years and begat methusa and begat and now watch here and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat Sons and Daughters let me reread that and Enoch built a pyramid after he begat methusa 300 years and begat sons and daughters and I'm I'm doing this on purpose so just stay with me and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch built a pyramid and he was not for God took him let me read Hebrews 11:5 and just see if this reads right by faith Enoch was translated he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God Amen okay now I just read to you Genesis 5:21 and most people don't even realize that Enoch built a pyramid but brother Bob you know what's astounding to me is anytime Enoch is mentioned you know what the first thing people think about they don't think about the pyramid he built on hello they don't think about the pyramid you know what they think about they think about his walk nobody gets up and says glory to God Enoch built a pyramid do they they get up and say glory to God Enoch walked with God yeah you know why because the outstanding thing about Enoch was not what he built right I got here too late but let me just preach it to you come on but it was how he walked have you ever sat down and looked at Enoch's pyramid just sit down and look at it there is so much revelation that Enoch built in that pyramid that brother it almost blow your mind if you start looking at how Enoch built a king's chamber and he had they they had a downward path and an upward path all these things if you break open the pyramid you see what Enoch put in there and all of that was by Revelation come on church all of that was Revelation but nowhere does the bible say that go ahead that Enoch built a pyramid and it pleased God it said he walked with God some I know where guys go I know where people go with that they say there you go bless God we don't need none of this Revelation glory to God hallelujah we just need a simple gospel no because let me show you something Enoch's Revelation that was in that pyramid brother Aaron it got into his walk Come On Church you don't have to go look at the pyramid to see what was in it you could see what was in it in Enoch's walk because he was a direct reflection of the Revelation that was in the pyramid what are you saying preacher I'm saying what the prophet said he said Enoch just kept walking in the light and one day he felt his feet getting light he said so you know what he did he just kept on walking and he walked on into Glory without even Dying God took him away because he was walking in the light with the testimony that he walked in the light of God he just kept on walking can I say what the prophet said here it is direct quote let's get on our walking shoes church let me say this to you tonight friends light has come now it's time to walk in it come on Church we've got the Seven Seals we've got the Feast of trumpets we've got Daniel 70 weeks we've got the stature of a perfect man we've got the seven Church ages we've got the Holy Ghost series we've got the adoption series we've got the written guarantee it's time to let that become our life and let us begin to walk as a reflection am I don't know about you but this is my prayer for this new year Lord Lord let the Revelation that I'm studying the Revelation I'm believing the Revelation I'm preaching let it reflect itself in my walk light has come now it's time to walk in it amen amen here's the secret are you ready how many likes a good secret you do amen two of you amen oh yeah here's the secret the light does the work are you ready for it we don't that's right right remember AB told that story about the man he said come go home with me he said how do you figure that he said come go home with me and we'll we'll talk tonight I said I can't like to where do you live he said we go over this mountain here I said how you going to get there you don't see your house uhhuh yeah well he said well there's a path runs up over the hill I said you don't see the path' he said' well I got a lantern I said' but the lantern won't show the light right on the house oh no but the path will lead to the house but the lantern but the message come on now but the lantern will only show light for one step at a time right he says this we'll walk in the light the beautiful light one step at a time Children of the light accept his word keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says you stay right in that and just keep walking with it amen somebody say walk in the light walk in the light let me tell you this because the light is the anchor amen probably God said it's walking into a light you've never witnessed before it's an anchor of a Divine faith that cuse anything contrary to the word of God is who it wasn't brother said this it speaking of the light it puts new life it gives hope to the dying it gives courage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessings to the unfavored how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence listen friends in closing tonight we've come out of different walks of life said you took father you took the alcoholics and the prostitutes you've taken the dope fiends you've brought them out of every Walk of Life and made ladies and gentlemen out of them Exodus means called out called out means the church and now God is calling his people out of every Walk of Life to come and receive him but said like this God called us out of different walks of life can I say this to you into the believer's walk and he said the believer's walk is if we only walk by sight we would be Children Of Darkness sure enough but I'm so glad to know there is a light that shines in every believer's heart until that Eternal day when Jesus shall come y Children Of Darkness walk by sight amen but children of Light walk by faith amen can I say this to you we are to walk like Enoch right for 365 days all the years of Enoch's life he walked with God can I just share something with you amen Enoch was a married man Enoch had children Enoch had grandchildren Enoch had Family Y Enoch had a lot to do in life Enoch was a busy man but he walked with God Amen there were days that Enoch got up and Miss Enoch probably didn't do what Mr Enoch wanted done yeah but he still walked with God there were days that the kids probably got on their nerves but he still walked with God right there were days that things happen unexpectedly I'm trying to show you something Church said like this he said see walk unconscious of fear walk walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ if something comes up in the church stop and talk about it and gossip with everybody about it and pick sides and divide everybody and get everybody on your side is that what brother BR said if something comes up in the church oh walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God walk with God the doctor says you're going to die walk with God doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with with God you'll have your ups and downs you'll have your Brier patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs down on the hillsides up to the mountains over Waters but walk with God Amen but it's now the Rapture you grow older and you begin to form making your first couple steps Tod and fall get up and try it again then you after a while you get so you can walk a straight line that's what we have to do as soldiers of the Cross now somebody say now now it's time it's time to walk a straight line amen are you ready for this right down that highway to glory amen brother Wade I'm gonna give y'all my New Year's message right now you ready amen here it is keep walking right you say well that wasn't very deep it's deeper than some of you realize yeah got keep walking no matter how it looks you just keep walking anyhow if God said do it just keep on anyhow that's the way you do it amen I'm I'm I'm closing on this that's the way you get well amen amen glory to God that's the way you get well see is just keep on walking say yesterday I couldn't wiggle my but that much today I can't wiggle at that much praise God tomorrow

long as you're climbing on the tree and when you get as far as up and you go no further step over on the tree of faith and just keep on walking because it has no end to it somebody say Keep On Walking found this very powerful today I was studying this today I was looking through the message and you'll find it in there I just doing a search brother wait on keep on walking I'm I'm I'm going leave you this keep on walking and while I was reading that you know what stood out to me brother was the majority of the times brother Bram used that that that phrase or that term just keep on walking was in prayer lines amen and you know what he would say brother Bob he would say oh I see you've got this cancer You've Got This Heart trouble this arthritis this kidney problem this nervousness this stomach trouble he list these things and say I see this you got that and he'd say oh but God makes your out just keep on walking amen one lady come to the prayer line I read today she come to the prayer line he stopped he said you got this condition he said but Jesus makes you well if you just keep on walking amen and then it dawned on me they were walking from one condition into a better one brother they were literally going from a sick body to a well body and a prophet says the way you get well sister June is just keep on walking and a prophet said it's time to start walking the straight line right right on down the road to glory you know what tape he says that in he says that in the Rapture brother how are we going to get out of Leota sister Dell how are we going to overcome all these things

this that God Will Make A Way when I get there Church of the Living God I know I know maybe you were looking for something more wow but this is just burning on my heart he said I've never come this far all this distance I've come I have trusted him and he has never failed me can I say this to you friends God will do the leading if we'll do the walking just keep walking don't stand still you'll

Darkness at all amen what if I told you tonight he's already in 2025 he's already there and if there of 2026 he's already there and if there of 2035 brother Joey's already there if you'll just keep walking he'll keep bleeding and after a while you're going to walk right into the manifestation amen amen amen amen I'll just say this to you and and it was burning on my heart today as I was thinking of these things several years ago we were there and was preaching for brother Roy we were there and helped helped him there in the church for several years and was associate our brother Ro away in the church there and had a had a major decision and thing in my life I come to a time of transition and I went down to the church one day and I met brother Roy if any of y'all knew brother Shrewsberry he was a praying man man I mean that man that man lived to pray I mean 9 three 9 12 and three every day praying I went down there and I met him I said brother Roy I said I'm dealing with something a transition from the Lord and I said to be honest with you I said I really don't understand it I said but all I know is there's something in my heart and it's leading me and I said I just I just got to follow it and he said brother Andrew he said as long as I know you he said ever since you first come here he said I just 17 18 years old he said ever since you come here he said I've always known you to preach what a prophet said in the of other people telling you not to and he said I know it's cost you a lot and he said I know you followed God when it was difficult and he said I have a he says I have 100% confidence that you're following him right now I said but brother Roy I said it don't make sense when I don't understand why to just go just follow the leading he said let me tell you this brother Andrew and I hope pray it's okay to share he said years ago you all know brother Roy was actually in World War II he's a World War II vet Purple Heart veteran brother Roy told me he said when I was in the war he said I was on the battlefield and he said I got injured and he said when I got injured he said I got shot or something something hit him he was injured in his arm and he said it was cold it was rainy he said and there was no Aid stations around there he said nowhere no aid station nothing he said I was bleeding and he said I just wanted to cover up my arm and he said I wanted to find a tree and I just wanted to lay down there next to that tree and he said I went over there and I laid down next to that tree and he said a voice spoke to me and he said you know what that voice said it said if you lay here you'll die get up and start walking he said I didn't hardly have strength but I pushed myself up off the tree and he said I started walking he said my head was down I was hurting he said and I would he said I'd make some fast steps he said then all of a sudden I couldn't hardly make another step but he said that voice said just keep walking just keep walking he said finally I stopped and I said to myself I said this makes no sense to keep walking when I'm dying and there's no aid station around here he said this is ridiculous he said common sense is telling me to sit down here and get this and he said all of a sudden that voice said just keep walking and he said I said you know what I'm just going to keep on walking he said and about that time I lifted up my head and he said I saw an aid station and I was standing right in the middle of it he said if I laid down I died he said if I would have followed common sense I would have died he said but I just kept walking and I walked right into what I needed Church don't get mad at me but you don't need a raise you don't need a bigger boat we don't need a newer suit or a newer house or a better car if we can get by from a car from point A to point B thank God for it we got a nice place to sleep thank God for it what we need is a body changej I want you stand to your feet with me tonight what we

to last through the greatest flood that ever was on the face of the Earth that changed a whole course of of rivers and continents and actually tilted the Earth 12° pyramids still stood Enoch built it and then he walked off the Earth brother bam said he looked and said when Enoch took a Rapture he knew that judgment was coming amen when this bride leaves this world I'll promise you judgment will strike this place amen we're the only people that are left that's holding it together nobody else is the word of God in a group of people is holding this whole thing together and I believe that I
