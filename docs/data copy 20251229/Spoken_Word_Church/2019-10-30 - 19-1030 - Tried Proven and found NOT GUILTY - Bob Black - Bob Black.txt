for Japan [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] Amy and I started desire tonight good to see you all this tonight I know it's a rainy cloudy dreary night but everybody come out to get a little a little midweek pick me up and hear from the Lord hey by the way I didn't know you feel here tonight I know all right praise the boat so that's the bus turn over to second Kings chapter 5 and I know just a little topic we were having a little family devotional one night in the last weekend and I was kind of going over the scripture and so I just wanted to talk about this tonight with everybody second Kings chapter 5 verses 1 to 14 but before we go into the word let's go to the author first well God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word once more and be able to look into your word Jesus and see a glimpse at who we are now and and what's taking place and we asked Lord Jesus since you'll just come up on the scene for us tonight Lord and we just make you welcome Lord and ask that you would come and for taking the service Lord Jesus and quicken the word to us Lord and let things be said Lord that would help your people we know Lord tonight that many people have journeyed from from your people of journey from from miles around or God through through all the rain and all the dreary weather Lord Jesus and come in the middle of the week after they've been working hard Lord and I pray God that you just be merciful now Lord and speak something little help Lord God and not to hinder Lord Jesus but to be a blessing and we ask toward God that you'll come and just just fellowship with us now Lord God we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let me take my shackles off and this is a little story I know you're familiar with it of naming no and it says now naman captain of the host of the king of Assyria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliver us unto Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the Land of Israel a little maid and she waited on name his wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the Prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his Lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel and the king of Syria said go to go and I will send a letter under the king of Israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment and he brought a letter to the king of Israel saying now when this letter is coming to thee behold I've therewith sent naming my servant indeed that thou may us recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said and my God to kill and make alive that this man descend unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he seeketh the quarrel against me and it was so when a lash of the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent that clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel so naman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elijah and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and I flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naman was wroth and went away and said Behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord is God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not abana and far par rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I'm not watching them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage and his servants came near and speaking to him and said my father if the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing would esand out what us they'll not have done it how much rather than when he saith to thee wash and be clean at the end when he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like under the flesh of a little child and he was clean you can be seated the Lord is a blessing to the world now that was a long little story longer reading of that read and and you know one thing I find that it's very interesting is is there's so many little nuggets in the in these little these are all the Old Testament stories especially I really love second Kings there's so many good good little stories you know that an evangelist or somebody could take and really preach from and like this story and this story it starts off with a very peculiar description of a little unnamed lady a little maid that it says that she had a testimony and and you know maybe so maybe I'll start with that this morning as you know a lot of times you can get into the position where you think that you your life is just kind of you're not very important maybe to the to the message as a whole you know or maybe sometimes ministers even can kind of begin to think well I don't have a worldwide ministry or something like that and you know we get to a place where we want a name we it's human nature you want you want somebody to know your name and to have a have a name for yourself and all these kind of things but but in this story it starts off with a little unnamed person little maid that nobody maybe even really regarded it doesn't even say what her name was in the Bible but she'd made a testimony and she her word that her testimony God all the way up to the king of Syria I got all the way up to naimans house and naman began to wonder I wonder what's going on down in Israel I hear tale of a prophet I hear tell of it the word being preached maybe I should make my way down there so that I can so we'll say it like this so that I so that my body can be changed because I got something wrong in my body I got leprosy in my body I'm sick and I need I need a body I need a body change so naman he after hearing this little testimony of this little uh unnamed person he begins to go down to Israel to hear the word of the Lord and and we get when he gets down there he says Elisha doesn't doesn't even come out to greet him doesn't even come out to and and so that's really what I want to I want to preach up on the night is the topic of how God will try you to see what your reaction is on his word he will give you a little incident or thing or give you things in your life to to give you a little test and see what your reaction is going to be now Elisha when he hears when he hears the prophet and sees that he doesn't even come out to his he says he never got so upset he's got wroth and he went away and he said behold I thought he would surely come out to me and call on the name of the Lord his God that he thought that he would come out and make a big to-do and make all this grin show and he thought that this church service would operate in the way that he wanted it to do he thought that everything that he wanted he wanted let's say the pastor and and and the ministers and everything to operate in the way that he thought it should work but a lot of times God does not do things the way that we think it should do the way that we think it should work and he said he said and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper that he would make a great big show and strike the place and and maybe have a big a great big grandiose prayer and all those kind of things but it didn't happen the way that he expected and furthermore he was he was asked to go down into the muddy Jordan River and dip seven times and you know you know that you could you could take a look at seven times seven times a lot of different ways yes it's been a long hard journey from the death of Christ all the way through seven Church ages it's been a long hard journey through through seven messenger seven all seven things seven seals Daniels 666 fold purpose and a lot of times we can begin to discount the thing that will actually bring us to our body change we can begin to devalue the thing that will actually help us to get to the end goal you see what God is doing is he's trying us to see whether we what where are we where we place our treasures our treasuring the things of the world is our treasure our pride is our pressure a great big old egos and having a name and all these kind of things or is it actually going or let's say almost like slogging through the the breeding and studying and seeing them the word slowly unfold he because you see with many times we get to a place where we want somebody like a minister just come over our house and just kind of download it right into our brain and explain it all to us but it's a long slow process and and I want to maybe just kind of compare the dip in the seven times into the River Jordan dipping in that muddy water something that seems undesirable let's compare that to maybe maybe like Daniels 70 weeks where it where it seems it's very laborious and all of these things but you realize tonight what Daniels 70 weeks really is Daniels 70 weeks is talking about a six fold purpose whether whether the Jews rejected their pardon but now they're going to get a chance to receive their pardon and not just to receive the pardon that they reject it and not just not just be born again but actually all of the worship all of the tabernacle all of that will be restored everything will be restored back to where they have the original worship back again does that sound familiar does that sound familiar to you and and and you begin to think maybe well I wonder if we really Daniel's 70 weeks so much of the same thing maybe with the seals it seems so complicated and everything to really understand the seals at first of all you've got to understand Daniel 70 weeks because when you begin to understand Daniel 70 weeks then you can begin to see the pattern you can begin to see the timeline you can be seen again to see the same way that God has dealt with the redemption of the Israelites he will deal with you he is dealing with you right now because God it's just he keeps repeating cycles when as the seals open up you can begin to see the whole plan of redemption you can begin to see how God redeemed you how he's redeeming the earth how he's taking you through a process of a justification and sanctification the baptism of the Holy goes to all of these virtues being sealed in to make you the full stature of a perfect man and that he's revealed to you that he has justified your flesh and sanctified your reflection so that he could come and live inside of you and and make reveal to you Colossians 1:26 27 that Christ is tabernacled inside of you he's broke that he's brought the bride through a complete but he's bringing this now through a complete plan of redemption and and all of those things maybe a seat might seem to us kind of like muddy like dipping down in the river Jordan but it is the process by which God will change your body it's the process by which God will make your body clean just like naimans now now naman didn't see the seals and all those kind of things but yeah yeah he was tried just the same way as you and I are and many of us today we're sitting in the church looking at me and and wondering what we're doing here wondering if it's maybe worth your time and and all of these kind of things but you see what God is doing is he's trying you to see where your treasure is your treasure laid up in earth or is your treasure laid up in heaven do you value the struggles and the trials and all the different kind of things knowing that God is molding you into his image molding you into the statue of a perfect man and the that he doesn't see as you eat the word he gives you trials to come and test it he'll have somebody say something nasty to you or many times like a name in this case it might even be a minister it might be somebody where you think well this person should be above that this person should not treat me in this way I expect them to do that do more I expect like he said I expect Elijah to come out and greet me I expect Elijah to do all these kind of things but it didn't work out that way in naimans case because what's God doing he's trying is he's testing us to see whether we will stay with the word whether we value the word enough to keep moving forward in Luke chapter 4 verse 27 jesus said in many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elizabeth's the prophet Elijah and none of them was cleansed saying naming the Syria you think about you think about the rarity are all these lepers in Syria and it was only one only one that went all the way down into Israel because you see it's a personal walk it's a personal individual walk as I look out upon the congregation this evening everybody is going through their own individual trials everybody's going through their own individual struggles and some people will come all the way to adoption some people will not be able to do that it's an individual walk and you can't force anybody to do what everybody's going if they're their own pace and God's dealing with them in their own individual characteristic way and that's why God will give you it's a different kind of trial then he gives other people it will give you a hill he's molding you and somebody that's a little baby will get a different kind of trial that is that is a more adult level because adults adults KITT can handle more God well you know brother that the Bible says that God will never give you more than you can handle and then the door can handle more than a little baby or no adults should be able to adult an adult should be getting close to driving the car and can deal with deal with those kind of things dealing dealing with all the the things that go with well let's say a little baby a little baby is more concerned with who's sitting in my spot when you're driving in the car they're in the backseat in there and get out of my spot stuff like that who stole my lollipop but an adult has problems like like the IRS audit or somebody tech not how to pay your taxes and and and and maybe a speeding ticket you see the bloo-bloop of a car pulling up behind you because a little baby doesn't have to deal with a speeding ticket but an adult will have to deal with with a different set of requirements that you have you see so you're gonna have a different set of trials as you grow up and so when you see somebody reacting like a little baby you may not have heard of a i'ma quote somebody that's not I don't know if a Christian or not but they're like a well-known philosopher Jordan Peterson he said the ugliest thing there is is is an overgrown baby and and that's true in the gospel to the ugliest thing there is is as what's supposed to be an adult acting like a little child acting you know crying over spilt milk and doing little things like that because you you look at somebody and you're supposed to be an adult but yet you're you're whining and crying and boohoo and over somebody stole your pacifier or whatever and you see but see everybody has different trials everybody everybody goes through different things and and what's big to one person might be small to the other person and vice versa let me read this Matthew chapter 6 verse 19 21 says lay up for yourselves lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves did not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also now in naimans case where his treasure was his treasure was he wanted to get that promise of the Prophet that he wanted to get the benefit of the Prophet at all cost if of course in Italy it got him a little upset and everything and his service had to talk to him and everything but he did eventually go down and dip in the water but where your treasure is will your reaction to the word a lot of times things that that happen in church and everything honestly it's it's rough I say this to my family all the time you think you think initially being a Christian is just a flowery better visas a flowery but just a bed of roses that nobody has any disagreements and everything is just wonderful and everything but when you get really get started it there's a lot of tough time being a Christian is hard walking this Christian walk is hard that God has given you a power in the inside of you to walk to be able to walk this journey and when you when you can grasp the treasure of being able to take a body change of eternal life of all these things that are included the benefits that are included in this message those are greater than than any kind of worldly pleasure any kind of worldly thing the early disciples they devalue their life so much that they were willing to be crucified upside down eaten by lions sawn asunder to all those things because their treasure was in heaven where your treasure is is where your heart will be where your treasure is determines what your reaction is so just just keep dippin just keep just keep watch seven times make a little cake like that all these different people in the Bible that that they just kept moving forward tarry at Jerusalem Jesus total go tear your Jerusalem weight up in that ripple room until you're in do with power on high do the things that are required by the word March you seven times around the city is what they're worth the word of the Lord that Joshua would just mark keep marching around just do it do it do what I said eat the little book to John and you know a lot of times these are the things these are the things in the Bible that are so difficult for us to actually fulfill to actually we say you know when you read in Revelation where John eight that little book it was easy for him to eat the book but then when it began to be manifested in his life it was bitter in his belly why because this it's like birth pains it's like something coming forth and when that's when you people begin to ridicule you and mock you and and and those kind of things are it's not easy like we were when we went on vacation a week or so ago we were we were kind of walking through a little exhibit on the side of the road well I got one of those little villages that you can you can see and we were shocked to see that somebody was taking pictures of our family like we were I don't know Amish or something that were so amazed at us and you know you have to kind of you go through things in life where one day we were walking on an on a walking path in the city where we live and there was this group of girls that began to porn and laugh at the way that my wife and my daughters were were dressed and it's like people now that nowadays it's become to the point where they openly mock you and those things are not easy it's not easy but our treasures are not in this world and that's why we don't dress like this world because we dress where we're going to when you're going to bed you dress for the bed but where we're dressing for our eternal destination that's why we dress differently because we're not dressing for the things of this world you see we we're not we're not called just it just to understand the thing all these deep things we're not just called just to understand the letter and everything but we're actually called to fulfill it to be there written to be the the the vindication of the word so you say you can say well you know I I'll keep moving on I'll keep moving on as as long as it's not muddy like name and as long as we don't get into the mud as as long as I find the journey pleasing as long as I'm as I'm treated fairly like the way that I think that I should be treated then I'll just keep moving on but maybe God is trying you maybe God is testing you a little bit to see how much you value the word because jesus said in looking at chapter 9 verse 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God no man having put his hand to the plow and thought I I wonder if this is all really worth it I wonder if maybe like Lot's wife we begin to put your hand to the plow or you didn't have a plow but she turned by to remember all the things our family I think there's a quote where brother grounder said she began to think about the family that she left she began to just kind of yearn to go back and sit in front of the fire and all those kind of things see how her heart was not in it her heart was not her treasure was not in the word the word was not her treasure you see the Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 to 24 says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you paid tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have emitted the weight of your matters of the law judgment and mercy and faith these all you have done and not to leave the other to other undone because you see so many times will put more weight will put more weight on on these big things of the Bible understanding the mysteries and everything and and will just what kind of leave undone the smaller thing or the weightier things that seems small to us of actually fulfilling the word of actually fulfilling it like actually instead of you know just understanding that we need to love our neighbor actually loving our neighbor actually instead of just maybe understanding a deep understanding a deeper revelation of the mysteries but being merciful to one another with somebody wronged you to be merciful to them and and and listen to this judgment mercy and faith judgment being able to judge right from wrong and be end up being able to judge one another being able to fairly judge one another and see that these things these are things that Jesus said we we kind of get all out of whack we strain an ad out and we'll swallow a camel we'll spend all this time in this area but not so much in this area and when I as I get to the closing of the message later tonight what I'm getting it really is that you know we're striving for our body change we're striving for for all these things for a greater anointing from God for the greater opening of the word but there's these little things of just forgiveness to one another and just living with one another and loving one another that our requirements they must be done to take a body change and and they're all part of the word and they're and they're and part part of dipping down in the water into that muddy water but they must be done it is a requirement it's not enough just to say that I believe it but you must actually vindicate it you are the vindication and the vindication is when the word comes alive and it is proved because the vindication of the word is the interpretation of the word right so when the word is interpreted in your life it is vindicated I'm gonna skip over there let's say just kind of moving through this pretty quickly a job chapter 23 you talk about somebody that knew about being tried Jobe knew by being tried and he said in John chapter 23 verses 8 to 13 behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doesn't work but I cannot behold him he hided himself on the right hand then I cannot see him but he said I when I go this way I can't I can't perceive God everywhere I go I can't receive him but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot has held his steps his way have I kept and not decline neither how about going back from the commandment of his lips I have esteem the words of his mouth more than my necessary food now that's somebody taken taken the Word of God and really a value as there was a treasure more even than his necessary food is the way that Joe valued it so let's look at bring up that Hebrew lexicon of the word try there because the word tried is talking about to examine to examine try prove to test to test it out and and see what's really there in other words what God is doing is we say we're born again so he'll come and and test what you think boy being born again but being born again Diaz he'll give you a little test you say you've got knowledge you you know send a little trial on you're waiting and test your knowledge you've got brotherly kindness you say I believe I've got brotherly kindness and he'll see that he'll give you a little test to see whether you actually have brotherly kindness or not and if you don't don't despair go back and and begin to pray and seek after God and study the word find out what the true definition according to the Word of brotherly kindness is and keep keep moving up because these trials are given to us by God to see to help us positionally know where we are and to move us toward the goal the trial is actually helping to form us because because without that external pressure you won't grow into the correct image you won't be able to manifest the word in the right way so God sends you trials but part of this growing is as an examination part of the examination is that you need to examine yourself Psalm 29 26 2 says examine me O Lord and prove me try my reins and my heart second Corinthians chapter 13 5 says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates I think this is really the age where people do not examine themselves as much anymore there's no moment of self reflection and self meditation and self-examination we does so many people are just more concerned with how they appear on Instagram or Facebook than to actually sit in a quiet moment of reflection I think did I really need to say that to that person is there something may be wrong with me as my attitude right it's my spirit right within myself am I am I am i treating others the way that I should do you know let's be honest I even when I'm done with a point a sermon how many times I'll go with my wife knows this cuz I think what it was I too harsh did I just because you're examining yourself was I did I beat the people am i approaching this with a right spirit do I have the right attitude when I get up behind the pulpit and you know you sometimes you'll hear people say well I never think about what I say to people and you begin to wonder is that person really approaching things with the right the right mode of and objective because there should be a time when when we get along through ourselves and maybe when you're driving in the car the way to work or whatever and you begin to think about your life and you begin to think about where you are and examine yourself so I know maybe this is maybe this is not a very deep teaching or whatever about these things I believe are needful because we're not predestinated just to understand the deep mysteries of the word but we're predestinated to actually fulfill it to become it we're we're predestinated to love one another and to love the world to love our neighbors as ourselves and to fulfill all of these things in the scripture that that see mama when brother Brennan preached the seven seals and all these things these were not preached just to dangle them out in front of us and give us like an unattainable goal but these are things that somebody is going to attain to somebody is going to become the living reality of these things that he preached somebody's going to have brotherly kindness that seems so unattainable almost where you can love somebody so much that you're ready that you're ready to give your life for them you're ready to drive across the country form you ready just to do whatever you're ready to lay down your life but I believe now is the time but we should be getting serious about things and examine ourselves to see whether we really do have the new birth or not whether we really do have the things that we're talking about whether whether we really do mean what we say even it won't Paul when he was explaining what communion was in first Corinthians chapter 11 he said but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup eat drink and eat after what after a period a process of self-examination not just flippantly not just like well you know what waiting until you waiting until at this the day of communion and you're at 30 minutes out and you're just kind of quickly well yeah I think I'm all right but I believe we should be getting serious about things that really begin to meditate on where we are with God and get along with God sometime and let him speak back to you I you know I believe that's one of the things that you can accomplish in prayer is when you get along with God sometimes he will identify things that are lacking in your life that you may not have even been aware of because God is trying you and see God will allow allow Satan to bring fiery trials to test you he will allow the devil he'll allow things to happen to you in church he'll allow things to happen to you in your workplace and and it'll allow as you grow up and maturity will allow the pressures of life to just squeeze in on you and it's God permitting it to tipper you as brother Branham said and three kinds of believers he'll do he'll try to tell you these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment on you it isn't so no service Satan doing that and God permitting it see God's allowing it because he knows that it will be beneficial to you the devil can't do one thing to you without God allowing it God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you if you are tied to this earth by the earth cares of whether your treasures is in heaven in other words how much do you really value the world do you value the word so little that if somebody rubs you the wrong way you're just gonna throw up your hands and and just still pitch a little tantrum do you value the word so much that maybe Menino I believe if if you really value the word sometimes you just have to press through it you just got to take it by force you just got to endure to the end you just got to run the race and if nobody else is willing to run the race well you be the one to run the race well because the prize is worth more than anything it's worth more than anything you can see the prize is worth eternal life it's being able to fellowship whether your brothers and sisters in eternity forever being able to live with Christ forever being able to sit in that New Jerusalem forever and ever and ever throughout all eternity the price is worth it all it's worth more than all the pleasures of young people it's more worth more than all the movies and all the comic books and all the different things that you can get in trap with and and caught up with all the pleasures of this life this is eternal life we're talking about store up your treasures in heaven brother Brahim said in three kinds of believers he said sometimes believers put to the test not sometimes every time he said forever son that cometh to God must be chasing tried child train remember the trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats that material till she was ready to go into the mold God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the Word of God living through them see the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand they tested try every son that cometh to God Jonah went through the trials and the tests his children taking everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret center and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirements he know there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job will but when job one struck that revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it listen many of these kind of things the statements that brother Branham makes and things that are in the Bible you know you get to a place in your life where you can look at those things and you say I've been there before I've been I'll tell you a little example of a little thing my you know sometimes the devil will put in your mind a born-again believer can get mind trials and mind sickness and just after my son was born and just before my extra was born my wife began to have this mind sickness thing and and you know the devil putting all these thoughts in her heads and it was just a really horrible time it was the devil just kind of putting all these all these thoughts on her and just it was it was absolutely terrible just to kind of illustrate how terrible it was one morning my little boy got up and he he came over to the breakfast table and he said daddy is mama gonna die because he could see all the turmoil and all the things that we were going through and how horrible it was and different people would call us on the phone and they would say what brother branham just said you must have a secret sin in your life but I new I didn't have a secret sin in my life but just to be sure I went to God and isolated prayer just to make sure that everything was alright and I stayed in prayer before God and I labored and she would go to churches and people would pray for and then people would call me on the phone and they would say why don't you just cast that out why don't you just speak it and I was oh God was there something wrong with me is there something wrong but you see God was molded me into a place where I could trust him into a place where I could just blame everything on God and you see after you go through trials like that you begin to look at the little things with a different perspective because there are big things and they're little thing God will put a trial on you to form you into the right mode and in the right way that you should be and I began to pray and to call out to God and to ask him to come and move on the scene and one night we were sitting there on the couch and I was speaking words of encouragement and combatant whatever the devil the lie of the devil and I was speaking words of encouragement and it was like through the window and when just just annoying if Holy Ghost came in and she began to jump up and praise God I forget to jump praise God and just give glory to God and it was like slowly and surely over seven days the thing left until she was completely delivered and never has had any problem with that but you see God God equips us for those things that you see I was equipped in that hour because I had also gone through that thing before before we were married where the devil will come and put all these lives and you and tell you it's too late for you to be saved and all these kind of things he'll put you he'll put you to the test to see whether you really value the Word of God or not and I'm sharing these I'm sure this is a very personal thing I'm sharing with you to encourage you to bolster you up in the faith to let you know that that you might feel like you're all alone that nobody else is going through trials and the things that you are I believe that God allows these things to happen so that you will turn aside from all other friends and let God be the only love of your life he'll get you along with him so that you'll know that there is a God in the pride he'll know that there is you'll know there is God in Israel and you'll be confident of him you'll put all of your faith I'll say like that you put all of your eggs in one basket because God is everything I believe that this gospel was sent so that we would not just learn about God but fall in love with him fall in love with him and know him on a personal basis first Corinthians chapter 3 says for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what it is the fire is what you will try your work to expose it to reveal it the fire is what will try the three Hebrew children when they testify that we will not bow to this idol we will not bow to this image that you have made of the Prophet the prophets message is all good and everything well that we will not bow down to this and they went into the fire and the fire exposed that their faith was real and genuine the fire exposed that the fiery trials is what is maybe the most beneficial thing in our life you know I look back at so many trials that I've gone through and I I just I II they were hard to go through but I just thank God for allowing me to go through them I remember when I was laid off Skeeter when I was laid off from my job they gave me my final paycheck in my pocket and I I took it back to the car and I drove to take one of my children to go to the doctor and I I began to a around and it was gone and it was a cold wintry wind it went windy day and I looked around and I was surely it had blown away in the wind and I began to call out to God God I that's I don't have a job now I don't have any I don't have any income you now that that only the last paycheck and I had has fallen out of my pocket and has blown away in this gust of wind and I turned around after I said I said God you've got to do something for me now and I turned around and the wind was still blowing just as heavy as it was before but there on the pavement was my paycheck and it was it was moving in the wind like that but it wasn't going anywhere and I walked over and picked it up off the ground listen God is a real God this message has been given to you so that you can know and personally the message is not just so that you can understand it by the letter but it's got to come off the page and becoming a living reality in your life because God is real and it's the fire that will make it manifest in your life if it wasn't for that moment I would have never realized that God was able to do something like that if it wasn't for that moment in my wife's life I would never realize the grace of God to come down on the scene and deliver all these things that God has done to prove that he is real to us let's see there's got to be in evidence that's what God is trying us because there's got to be an evidence when someone accuses you there's got to be an evident when you go to court there's got to be an evidence there's an evidence of whether the thing is right or not there's got to be an evidence the Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not saying that is the evidence that you have the new birth that is the evidence that Christ is living in you that is the evidence when when you lose a paycheck or lose a ring or whatever it is that there's something that thing will actually reach out and grab it and make it put it back there put that knife in your pocket it will actually it is our actual evidence but see there's God to be an evidence and this is the day in the hour that we're living in where when nobody really wants an evidence anymore we don't really want proof anymore I was thinking about about how so easily people are deceived by but all of these these telemarketers are whatever they'll call up and say your sir your computer is infected and they don't really we'll seek evidence to see if that person on talking to them on the phone is really knows what they're talking about my next-door neighbor did that here and he's lost his house now and I bless his heart and all kind of things that happened to him but somebody called up called him up and said you've got a computer virus and he didn't go through all the process didn't really think - I need to prove this out I need to prove out whether this person actually knows what they're talking about there's so many times you know people will go to churches and they won't actually prove out whether the pastor knows what they're talking about or not they won't actually prove out the thing you've got to prove out whether or not you know what the Bible is saying you've got to even prove out the Bible study the Bible to see whether the things that in this part child with that part proving out like the brains did study the message prove it out and it's so examine it for yourself so that you are thoroughly convinced I think so many people in the message today or around the message and maybe that's the wrong way to say it but I apologize if I offend anybody so many people around the message they then they don't look for the proof of what they believe they don't search out and get an evidence state they don't really search things out to see what they believe first Thessalonians 5 xx 5:21 says prove all things hold fast that which is good prove all things prove what you believe 1st John chapter 4 says believe beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby no you the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh in the flesh is of God so in other words prove things out don't just take it at face value but prove it out and you prove it out it and all aspects of your life prove out before you enter into a little young women and boys before you enter into an engagement with someone else you got to prove them out prove it whether they really are a genuine believer or not prove it like first John said prove all these things out to prove prove you won't you won't and I know a lot of these young people they're willing to proof that God is still alive and that's why so many times you you want to see the pillar of fire you want to experience an anointing you want to see these things you want to know whether whether you want to see the word interpreted you want to know whether God is really real but after God shows you the pillar of fire after I know some of the young people in here have seen the pillar of fire you have actually visually seen it and we've got the picture that hangs on our wall that shows that the pillar of fire was real and it vindicated the prophets message after you actually felt the anointing and you know that God cares about you after you've seen all these things and it's been proven to you the word has been explained to you from endian and even if you don't understand the whole thing from beginning in the end you can surely understand enough just to see that God loves you and that he is able to forgive you of your sins and and just the bare minimum another thing enough to prove to you that God is real and that this message is true enough to prove that you should put everything in God that that this is something worthwhile enough to put that to lay up this kind of thing as a treasure in heaven value this is this is worth valuing more than anything else in this world it's been proven out I'm skip over some of these just to save time excuse me I'm not trying to breathe hard see you invest in what you know is sound for the brand preach that message investment because yeah a businessman will not put all his money into a stock or something unless he had actually proven it out and he knew what he was getting into why would you invest any in the stock market or invest to anything in your business or invest why would you invest time in a church unless you were you were convinced that they were preaching the right gospel you had proven it out and you knew that it was the right thing you knew that it was sound brother Jesus talked about this in Luke chapter 14 and he said all these people giving excuses for why they couldn't come to the wedding supper knees he said he sent his servant as supper time to say that him that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all were the one consent began to make excuse and they were all about proving things all about proving things out of order the first said to him I bought a piece of ground and I go and see it I pray that you have me excused I need to go prove it out after I've already bought it and another said I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them after I bought them I go to prove them that's that's out of order you want to prove things first become convinced and so I encourage you examine the message and prove it out to see whether it's true or not and another said I'm married a wife and therefore I cannot come he got it all out of order but you see this message has been vindicated the Old Testament believers had to be proven you see Jesus had to be tried and proven he had to stand before Pilate where Pilate let's say I find no fault in this man your faith in the word must be tried and proven the preachers have to be tried and proven the word has to be proven do you know how the word is proven the word is proven by the word now y'all don't get tired of me now I know [Laughter] the harvest time brother branham said in 1964 he said watch now as we hurry up when the spirit of truth is come he will teach you all things whatever I taught you and so on it goes forth he says God has obligated to take care of his word down the bottom and so when they did this the word vindicates itself the word is what vindicates itself and the message identification he said that's what I want you to trust the merits of him and then how you know you're getting there is when every word is you punctuate it with an amen amen down to the read because it's the word itself trying to vindicate itself and if we deny that word how can it vindicate itself and then let's go on to the next message the the message you must be born again he says when you're born again God vindicates you that's how God vindicates to all of his nature what by their fruits that's the way I believe that's the message that was just playing before before I come out that's the way he vindicates his ministry that's right all of his servants are vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree because it brings peaches how do you know us an apple tree bear and apples see it's not enough just to understand that we need to be apple trees or peach trees or whatever we need to be the broad tree you must actually bear the fruit of the broad tree you must actually produce these things that we're talking about you must actually prove that you are who you say you are because if you are the word the word vindicates itself and if the word says that you will be a certain thing or do a certain thing act a certain way then when it's expressed through you it will vindicate that that is what it is how do you know us a Christian Christians Christian signs bear from it Christian life comes out of it how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from him how do you know he's a prophet the word comes through him bears record vindication it proves itself how does it become that it dies and becomes one that's right mm-hmm when we die have become a new creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling the fruits of the spirit follow us when we are his service when we are born again the fruits of Christ life follows us that's right how do you know as a peach tree it's got peaches how do you know he's a Christian he acts like Christ he walks like Christ he talks like Christ he lives like Christ above sin victorious what does he do say see what I done Christ didn't do that he gave all praise to the Father now let's do it let's just keep reading on let's go the next one is your life worthy of the gospel now the only way to live a life worthy is to let Christ and His Word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word yes because you see there's got to be an evidence there's got to be a proof of the thing let's see where I'm going appointment that I'm getting to is you need an evidence because we are being tried in a spiritual core of law we are being tried and I must skip down a little bit everybody doing all right don't get tired on me I'm not nervous so don't be nervous we're being tried in a spiritual court of law where where Satan is accusing us constantly he's accusing and and saying you did this and you did that but we've got to come to a place and what other this is a process that God has bringing us through where he can look at us and you can look at yourself and say I'm not guilty sin has been completely purged from me until you can look and you can see by the process of of trying and battling it out and dip it over and over and the mud seven times over / until God can look at you and you could look at yourself you can look at your flesh and see that it's been changed you can look at your experience and see that you've come through a baby form of justification all the way up to where the real you never did it in the first place but you see it in a courtroom there are players there's there's players and you've got you've got the plaintiff the accuser and that's the devil and the devil is constantly accusing you and saying you did this and you did that and what the devil does is he'll bring evidence he'll bring he'll bring to God he'll bring but before you to be your remembrance he'll say remember when you did this and remember when you did that and and he's constantly accusing you and you've gotten the defendant which is which is you whether you did or you didn't do it and you've got the judge God and you've got an attorney or an advocate to represent you and and I believe this is this is one of the most amazing benefits of being a Christian that when you begin to realize that place in the position that being born-again puts you in that you've gotten an attorney that represents you that is God himself so you see as you're being tried and as the devil brings his evidence to you you've got an attorney that that is speaking on your behalf and so that God is looking to you looking at you looking at the evidence through the blood so he doesn't even see it at all he can't see it we've got a we've got a mediator we've got a mediator to look at us even though the devil comes and he accuses us you're guilty you're guilty you did it you did it but when we come and we confess our sins and lay it all before God and say I God I'm sorry I repent and turn around and go the other way then God is looking at us through the shed blood of Christ through that sacrifice and he looks at it and says I can't even see it anymore it's gone it's not just forgiven but it's gone you see and and job chapter 33 I know I'm throwing a lot at you but y'all just hang on just for a little bit I'm not gonna keep going on for much longer in job chapter 33 when the lie who comes on the scene he says behold I am according to thy wishing stet I also informed out of the clay in other words the lie who says I'm gonna speak to you on behalf of God and then the lie who begins to tell job after job's going through this great trial he's telling job that there is a there's somebody to speak on your behalf and if you can just catch this revelation it'll open up something to you and he said if there be a message or let's read job chapter 33 verse 23 to 31 if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand the shield under man is uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a child that sounds like naman doesn't it he shall return to the days of his youth he shall pray unto God and He will be favorable unto him and he shall see his faith with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness he looketh under men and if any say I have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these things worketh God oftentimes with a man to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living because we see when we come to God when we come to church a lot of times that we look it's like looking into the mirror of God's Word that we begin to come into a knowledge of our guilt that there's something wrong in our life and then we confess our wrong to God and and God has given us an advocate to speak on our behalf you see because first John says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and 1st John chapter 2 he said my little children these things write I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteousness the righteous and you know what strange is that word advocate is the same word that is the same greek word that is used in the New Testament to say the word comforter if we look in the Bible says in John chapter 15 but when the comforter I just hit the wrong thing where did I go when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me so now the comforter the Advocate is doing is the one doing the testifying of whether whether there is an issue or not but you see I think this is marvelous that God when he looks upon a believer that has confessed their sins there's no guilt anymore he can look on you and when you confess your sins God has given you his righteousness so he's looking at you through the price that he paid and he doesn't see anything and he wrote anything amiss anymore and I believe that's what the thing that we're coming to is where if we can just if we could just accept that I believe that God has paid the price for us and accept that God has has made us as righteous as he is that there's no more evidence of your sin and I'm just gonna read a few more quotes in Emma I'm a winder and the visible year of the Bride of Christ brother brother Branham said but the word justified is though you never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God you are justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place the old union is in the sea of god's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world and in verse and paragraph 262 he said he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as you as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every Amen every jot and tittle you're standing complete justified you like you never did it in the first place but you see that's what God has done by bringing us through this process like Niemann dippin seven times over and over in the mud through all of the trials and all the accusations and all of the devil pointing his fingers what he's doing is he's taking our sin away he's bringing us through a process of complete Redemption until we can look into God's Word and and it goes back to us and we can recognize that the word is so vindicated in us do we never the real you never did it in the first place we can look back and say that I like brother Branham said to Charles and Ella Brown were or not real I didn't really come from them I really came from God I've been born from above and God has so justified me until I can take a body change there's nothing in this world that's holding me down you know I believe I'm gonna kind of skip over my notes but I believe when you can really begin to see that kind of forgiveness that God has forgiven you of all these weighty things that it will change your attitude to your brothers and sisters I believe this is what I believe that brotherly kindness is breaking forth in the bride right now something is happening what we're beginning to see the grace that God has shown to us didn't it wasn't the word of the Lord is a rouble grace grace grind to the headstone it's not by our power about Mike but by his grace that he's given us His grace why can't we give that same kind of grace that godly love to one another to forgive one another when we do wrong to one another to put our arms around one another and say I love you and godly Christ they love to love one another so much that we're willing to lay down our own life for one another that's that's the kind of love that I want to see I believe it's now being exhibited and the bride did to just say they say it and the purity of the gospel I forgive you I forgive you that the parents to say to they're killed or not forgive you if I've treated you wrong different and wives just say I forgive you of all the all the the mean words and all the fighting and the feud and everything it's time for us to just lay down all these weights that's so easily beset us and just say I forgive you and I'm going to close on this scripture in second Kings we're gonna go back to the story of name and as the musicians come his service came near to name an inspecting him and said my father if the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing that's what we think we think the message is some great unattainable thing instead of just the simplicity of the word of the hour being fulfilled in us wouldest thou not have done it how much rather than when he said to the wash and be clean how much rather when when I maybe say tonight how much while instead of doing just some great thing that we cook up in our mind sometimes why not just go to your brothers and sisters the other people in the church that maybe have offended you and done you wrong I just tell them tell them and godly love I forgive you I forgive you from that just like God has forgiven me God has forgiven me of so many things that I can look back in my life and say I wish I hadn't done that I've done wrong so many times I well I I've even told my children before I've gone up to their rooms and got down beside their bed and say I'm sorry for the way that I've treated you because I don't want to speak to my family harshly I don't want to speak to my children harshly or in a way that would cause him not to come to me with their problems and not to come to me would and tell me and get this seek advice listen I believe it's time for us to get serious with God and serious with one another and patch things up and get rid of all the bitterness and all the enmity and strife so that there's nothing weighing us down so that we can get out of here forgive my brothers and sisters and love one another amen let's stand to our feet [Music] now [Music] amen Jesus come for learning are not anybody having a the owner go for the great masses now come and reap the benefit [Music] knowing
