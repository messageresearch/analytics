good to have her with us today she's a friend of esther sisters and uh sister olivia so good to have her with us today and just make yourself at home good to be at home good to be in the house of the lord hey man uh we'll greet you from brother dale he said tell everybody love you he's on the mend he's doing doing better every day getting his strength built back up eating very well so that's good and uh terrence is doing good he's uh he's getting stronger on the men he'll be he'll be back uh should be back wednesday maybe if we'll i don't know about getting tested but he's 10-day quarantine and then lisa has the corn team for that long or a little bit longer so just keep us all in your prayers it's just one of them things you know you just that's what we're kind of going to talk about a little bit today we're going to get out of the norm of it is still going to be not in the series of the two spirits that we've been talking about because we're battling two spirits right up to the end anyway but we're going to talk today a little bit about why do the heathen rage david brought that up and we're going to kind of go back into david's life and and the way i got this thought was and it's really strange you know how brother branham one day picked up a pack of cigarettes or a pack out in the woods that somebody throw down and he preached a very profound sermon from that a thinking man's filter uh kind of strange but you know what that's what god used so i was thinking the other day about all the sickness and all the stuff everybody's going through and i look out at the world and and you know you you go to these places and we're all trying to be good and we're trying to wear a mask and we're trying to social distance and then here goes a guy walking by you smoking a cigarette and you know beers fall out of his car and he's just living any way he wants to and he's not sick it makes a human wonder if it doesn't make you wonder then you're not a human but it does make you wonder why do the heathen rage why can they do what they do yet the little bride seems to be suffering but we'll show i believe what the bible told us how to take care of this because remember this is not our world this is not our home unless that guy gets regenerated and gets born again the cigarette smoking guy he's not going to make it past just white throne judgment he has no other future but you and i we have a future it's not even really a future it's here if you have eternal life today it is here okay but but we do have a future home something we can go to right because of maybe sometimes of our little sufferings that we suffer but um brother aaron i'm sure he's downstairs because levi didn't drive himself to church so thank goodness but pray for brother aaron will be speaking wednesday night we're going to keep on this line where the brothers will be doing wednesday and i'll be doing sundays till we get the until we get the plowmaster back we want them we want the brother they're plowing again amen and i know he's watching in and i told brother bob and this is the way this is the way god works i believe because brother dale and i we don't discuss a lot of things because you get sometimes you catch each other's spirit and and i'm i'm i'm praying that's the holy spirit that we catch and but you get something may pull you off one side or the other brother claude always said that would be stealing your fire so the other night i was staying with mom and dad and i was thinking about this sermon and and just kind of putting it in and and kind of not being in the framework of the two spirits and you know how dad cuts and paste you know he literally cuts it out and paste it on the on the piece of paper well he was sitting across the room there and him and mom and and i was sitting on the couch and i had my computer up and i was getting sermon ready and he little did he know and he'll know it a little bit later on little did he know all not all but every he just started preaching so he's ready to go we just got to get his body but i'm sitting there typing almost what he's talking about and he's not we're not i'm just going uh-huh and i'm just doing this and he's you know he's talking away and preaching the way and talking about death and how that you know we suffer this and we do go through this again i'm just sitting there putting quotes in writing left and pulling scriptures up and cutting and pasting them in what you're going to see right now it's basically what he was preaching on so i i kind of figured this is in a good line if he was thinking about it then you know and brother bob there he was wednesday night and brother louise everybody's kind of been plowing in the same same field so we appreciate that you ought to appreciate that because that's god that's not me and bob and and louise and aaron and dad get together and go now what are we going to preach on no no we kind of let god talk to bob god talk to brother louise different ones you understand what i mean so he'll he'll probably smile when we start reading some of these scriptures and quotes that that he was talking about uh the other night sitting at the sitting around the uh in the living room so but he's getting that he's getting on the man next sunday we're gonna do the same thing so just keep doing the same thing we've been doing for a little while and uh may the lord bless you and keep you and we're just gonna preach today just a little bit and talk about a man named david so let's go to the lord in prayer the heavenly father thank you for this day and hour that we're living in as the scripture said there brother callie was reading the day of the lord this is truly not a 24-hour day lord this is your day this is your time this is your bride this is your word that you give us for this end time you have equipped us for everything we need lord all we have to do is put on that helmet grab the sword put on the shield all the different things lord that we need to do and and go out to battle because we've already won we've just got to have faith to believe that it's happening now and it's not coming in the future father we pray that you bless the ones that are sick the ones that are not here today father we pray that you'd be with them be with the ones on the highways be with the missionaries lord be with all them in the foreign field lord they're everybody's kind of uh on their own now and not traveling back and forth so much so i pray that you would lift the people up lord and take care of them and lead them in guide and by your holy spirit lord we know you do the work but you said you would do it through human beings lord so we pray that you would touch all of us here in the building lord use me for your service bless this day in jesus name amen now here's david the great king in psalms 2 verse 1 right at the very first of the psalm he says why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord now there's your two spirits and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us but watch what david said he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision in other words whatever they got god's already up there he's already got the plan worked out he already knows what they're going to do and he already has provision made he didn't have to create a standard he just raised it up now man because he is the standard you may be seated in the lord as blessing the reading of his word like i said today we're just going to preach a little bit we'll just kind of take that subject there why do the heathen raise and i want you to keep that in your mind because it does go through your mind why in the world i know uh sister ruth sitting here you know and i thank god for her being in that covert ward helping us to find out the different times we i don't want to say lost him but um we didn't lose him like that but you know the hospital kind of moved him around so anyway it's good to have friends in in places like that and a good sister to take care and may god protect her to take care of all these but she see like she said today this morning she was talking about a 90 90 year old the older lady 90 year old lady that had coveted and she's walking around bouncing off the walls trying to get out of the hospital has hardly any symptoms at all but yet you see a 30 year old or a 40 year old come in there and they have to put them on a respirator well why does you know you why does all this happen i i've and like i said before you know you you try to go into walmart you try to go to these different places and and you walk around and you're trying to keep your lungs clear and you're trying to do the best you can do and the first thing you do is you walk through this cloud of of cigarette smoke right yes you see the guy laughing with the beer in his hand and he's just having a good time and wow i mean you know it just makes you wonder and i believe that's what happened to david because here's david now let's take david just for a minute and then we're going to read on a little further in the psalms in psalms 18 in just a minute but look now david as a young boy was anointed by samuel to be king amen so he knew he believed what his prophet said that sounds familiar we believed even though before he even set one foot on the throne samuel anointed him the prophet of the hour anointed this boy but the boy had to mature but he anointed him nonetheless and so god sent us a prophet in the end time and he proclaimed an anointing on you and i that we were going to what we were going to mature or come to maturity like no other age has come to maturity amen and that you and i are going to come to a body change that no one else has come to except the lord jesus himself no man is reaching immortality except what jesus christ amen no one you say what about enough see you go asking ques i i don't worry about that god's got that i'm just going by what i see that the prophet of god told us that we are going to someone is going to take a body change in this hour that death is going to be destroyed death will be just like a toothache or brother bryan said cancer would be like a toothache well look at what's going on now look at this how it affects people like we were talking this morning you you just can't figure the thing out that's the problem it kind of bounces around all over people and we're talking about this covered but let's go back to david he was anointed by his prophet of the hour at a very young age remember he went through all them brothers nope not the first age not the second age not the third age not the fourth he come to the seventh he come into the seventh church age and he said oh you are now anointed to be king and no doubt david probably realized it but you know what david went right back out into the field and was watching sheep the very next day why because he was an obedient child but in his mind he got a revelation now listen this is what i'm asking you today do you believe what your prophet anointed you with if you believe then it doesn't matter that's why i said about david david went through all this adversity even as a young child he killed a bear he killed a lion and as a very young boy he killed a man named goliath those things were just bumps in the road for david because he that seed had been planted in his mind in the womb of his mind that he was going to be the king you know why because he believed samuel and i believe while he was swinging that thing and he was he said got to get through this this is my next battle i got to get through the next one because you know what my throne is in jerusalem my throne is down there that's where i've got to go and this is what i got to get by this is what i got to get through as brother bob was talking about uh wednesday night sometimes and we do we get we get caught up with circumstances and we get caught up with in our mind why does this why does this person that seem not to affect and why we don't need to worry about that david didn't worry about he didn't even worry about saul and saul became his enemy he didn't worry about king saul he he knew that was only temporary he knew what he was fixing to do to goliath was only temporary but he had to do it he had to go through it he had to kill the bear he had to kill the lion he had to kill goliath he had to do these things in his journey but what was the end result david did sit on that throne and became i this is what i was thinking about yesterday david was so blessed as a king god thought so much of david he said your throne is going to be all the way into the millennium now remember david's not going to sit on the throne but the son of david jesus christ is going to sit on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel in the millennium as the throne of david that's how much you thought about that man that took what his prophet said and just kept walking doesn't matter the adversity that david had david had many opportunities to to just say i quit i'm done i'm finished but he killed goliath now watch then he made saul mad then he had to depend on god to get by saul because saul was a king no doubt saul had spies it wasn't just one man saul trying to kill david no he had a counsel that he i'm sure he said all right guys first time you see this man right here i want him dead so david had to take that into account every day something was trying to kill him something was trying to end his life be it coveted be a cancer be whatever you want to talk about every day of your life something is right here remember there's a shadow of death but remember what brother brown said thank god for a prophet brother brown said there had to be a light to be a shadow yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death so there's got to be light there but that shadow is what's cast behind us and that shadow was cast behind david pretty much all his life but he believed what his prophet told him and he sat on that throne just exactly like samuel said he would now remember there had to be a saul there at first then you had david he won many battles folks remember the mulberry tree david said god should i go now well now the first time he was with the felis he was fighting the philistines kind of strange he started fighting with him at one time you read that he started fighting with the philistines the philistines that he had killed the the big the big giant and he started fighting with him but hearing one time i was reading last night where he comes to a place he says god how many times do we do that see that's why david was the apple of god's eye every time he come into a battle he didn't just force his way into the battle he said god should i go up today god should i put my feet on the ground and go to work and fight the traffic and fight the heathens god says david go up for the battle is yours wow you say oh i've never heard that voice in my head you got the word that's right what do you need anything else you got the word to tell you what to do it's already been spoken all right so then you got another time where david says okay god here's the philistines we've got them in we've got them in this and we got them in that and he says wait he said go sit under that mulberry tree he said when you hear the going or the rushing in the mulberry tree he said then the battle will be yours see now what would have happened if david would have just took off he'd lost that battle why because he went ahead of the plan of god amen amen god's plan was now you say well why did god make him wait obedience god's looking for obedient people that you want to try to rush in something or try to take care of this situation yourself yeah i owe myself too how many of you are guilty of that if you don't raise your hand i'll raise your hand for you amen okay all right it goes up just like this because every one of us have been in a situation but what did david do david didn't say now lord i think we can get it right now right now is when we can get it he said okay lord i'm gonna go sit under that mulberry tree i don't know what you got for me but they're right there he said david the battle is yours when you hear the going in the mulberry tree he said you take up arms and he literally run him out of the country amen so that's what the devils in our life that we've got to do in our everyday life is listen for that going of the mulberry tree what what brother brown say about elijah uh elijah had a lot of things on his plate but he waited for that still small voice he had all the shouting and all the glory and all the different things but he was like david he went and sat under a mulberry tree and said okay lord what's next and why do the healing rage why lord do we sisters have to have this long hair well we we were somewhere the other day and i saw this woman she's an older lady bless her heart her hair was as short as is that and i thought man all she's got to do is get up in the morning and just kind of do like we do shake it off and you know don't even have to brush your hair kind of like tempo back there you know it looks all messed up all the time but see that's easy but your sisters have long hair you can't just go out the door am i y'all with me today um see the things that we're this is the light suffering or the small suffering things that we do we're looking at it all wrong because i'm going to read you many many many many scriptures and many quotes today brother brown said character is a victory not a gift amen we have gifts of the spirit that god will give us these gifts love joy peace long suffering even these but now re remember that is character amen that's right character is a victory yes not a gift what a profound statement i have a few t-shirts that i wear that i wear proudly because i enjoy it that's a wonderful quote i do have quotes by brother branham on my chest and quotes by whoever amen amen so here we have david but now remember david comes to a point he comes to a point and he says lord i we kind of messed up the other day you know what are you what are we doing we we lost a few men and we we might have lost a little battle here so what what's going on david just didn't realize that he was fixing to get drove off of his throne by his own kid and i believe that's when i believe that david in the stillness of the night just like you and i all have doubts and fears and you go why lord does the heathen rage david says god i know i'm an anointed king and now i don't even have a throne to sit on but you know remember though what david did david didn't he didn't complain he just made a statement lord why does the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing i'm your i'm the king he had the whole of the of jerusalem or israel behind david but he had one little problem and when he did he got thrown off the throne and i'm sure he sat up on that hill and just like jesus sat up on that hill and said jerusalem jerusalem how oft would i have hovered you under my wing why but you would not because they what rejected him remember david was a rejected king amen so i and david but now remember david didn't have a pity party because he knew still even though he was in the valley even though he was a king in exile even though he only had about 600 men where he had 60 000 but i promise you one thing i'll take the 600 david had you imagine three men fighting for two miles through the philistines just to get to him a drink of water you think that's how much they thought of that man david and david took it with so much honor he said i'm not even worthy to drink this and pour it out on the ground now he didn't pour it on the ground for anything he remember the bible said he poured it out for an offering to god that them three men fought their way two miles through the philistines to get that for david they thought that much of him but he was driven out of his kingdom and i'm sure he sat up there one day and this is where psalms 2 comes from because we're going to read down if you pull up psalms 18. because there's a time when david had victory over all of his enemies there's a time when he come to where he said look this is to the chief musician the psalm of david the servant of the lord who's spaking to the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul and he said i will love the o lord my strength now remember david it went through a whole lot amen giant bear kicked out saul's trying to kill him david's got the enemies and on every hand the lord is my rock in my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler in the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies the sorrows of death compassed me wow pretty close why because saul was going to kill him and he sent people every day to try to kill david so i'm telling you folks if you have the hand of the lord on you if you're born again believer the footsteps of the righteous like i said are order of the lord you will not go until god's done with you and when he's done with you i'm ready to go amen amen when god's done amen circumstance whatever it is the sorrows of death compass me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid we walk out in this world and don't tell me we don't have a certain amount of fear i said a certain amount we're supposed to walk by faith but we're not going to walk out here in the middle of this road and say god you're going to stop that 18-wheeler now if god gives you a vision and god gives you an anointing you can walk out into the end of the road and god will save you like you did the prophet with the bull and all the different things but listen he hasn't done that to me now if he's done it to you that's fine i'm not going out there because there's danger and i'm afraid that's going to hurt me but what are we going to do though folks when it comes see it's come personal to all of us now everybody has been impacted whether it even be not covered but now it just feels like i don't know if it's with you but there's just a sickness in the air it's just a fog brother donny's daughters are dealing with stuff you know and all everybody's even got people and he was dealing with stuff it wasn't coveted related but it's all sickness it's all seems like that you know lord where are you and that's why david why does the heathen rage who was he talking to he's talking to god why do you why do you let people prosper that are seem to be evil men have you not ever thought that you know i ever wondered like sister ruth said well never wonder that you know you got this just a i mean just a vile person cursing and smoking and drinking he walks in and he might have a little case of cold and they give him a couple of shots and out the door he goes then you bring in a godly saint or a godly saint of god and they have problems and it's they seem to struggle with it i mean in your mind today you we all struggle with it but david asked that one question why does the heathen rage and the people in other words bring a vanity vanity of vanities folks listen we're living in this world temporarily just realize one thing's for sure if you're born again today doesn't matter what god let's allow happen to you it's for your benefit [Music] i'll clap myself it's for your benefit we don't know it's like brother bob said those what sparked some of this sermon is that like david david now listen we're not prophets that we know what's going to happen tomorrow but we see road maps and we see signs on the way signs follow the believers okay so you look at the signs and david looked a sign he said i killed a bear that wasn't too bad killed a lion who is this it's just another bump in the road it's just another something that i got to get through because i'm going to be king now why are you and i we're in revelations 5 we're told we're to be priests and kings and that will rule and reign on the earth now it doesn't say that you're going to have a flowery bed of these it doesn't say that you're just going to one day pop up and no the bible says fiery trials afflictions we'll read those in a few minutes we'll read what brother brown said about it but i want you to look at david though the sorrow of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord now remember remember the end of this story where did david end up he was on the throne he died the king of israel amen and then he had solomon of course we know that but anyway david is restored just like job look at job circle none of us just went through what job's went through boils all over our body our wife telling us to curse god and die all your kids died your house was destroyed you're setting on the ashes of your house but what did he do with job job said i know in other words i know i've been anointed for some purpose and this journey is yet but a light affliction because remember he was restored double you and i are restored double you know why because we get we got eternal life now but we're going to get eternal life in this body this body's going to be eternal job didn't have that joe said oh i know joe said i know i got to go to the grave because i see people go down they don't come back up he said but i know my redeemer liveth and in the last days in my flesh i shall see god amen amen in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god and he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears look how personal it is god's got ears yeah god's a human remember then the earth shook and trembled this world is going to tremble and shake when we come to what bob was talking about the manifestation of the sons of god we're getting a little piece of it every once in a while now but when this thing starts coming together which i believe it is now we come into speaking condition listen there's one thing for sure the anointing that's on us is going to israel in those two prophets and they're going to take that sixth seal and they're going to pull plagues as many as they want to pull earthquakes as many as times as they speak well don't you think you and i are going to have a small temporary amount of that on this side because it's the same anointing and to get us out of here to get david listen what protected david from saul killing him god and the belief that he was going to sit on the throne same way with me and you why did the heathen raise lord why why is my neighbor why is my brother that don't even serve you no i'm not talking about mine but you know you know some of you don't have brothers who serve the lord why is my sister why is my kid why why cry why cry listen i preach every sunday with the promise that my children are going to be sitting right here all of them have one back there but i'm talking about my daughter i don't i don't go home oh yeah in my humanity i do i go home and i as the old saying is kick the dog no i don't kick the dog toby i don't kick toby he's too little but you know you kind of you kick the table and you go what in the world is going on my kids are now abraham didn't do that abraham just kept walking that's what you and i got to do keep walking and you will walk into it but do not stop walking amen circumstances is what's killing us but listen circumstantial evidence will not stand up in the court of law our evidence is what the word told us what we were going to be in this hour not not luther not wesley not pentecost this hour this day of the lord then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down in darkness was under his feet you know why he came to judge but if you and i have already been judged we don't stand there we've already took the fiery judgment of god when christ went to the cross and took that judgment i know this is elementary and i know this is going to be simple but i want you to build yourself to where you can see that it's not god has not left us and just because the little things that we do or don't do or have done or are the light afflictions as paul would tell us how many of y'all been stoned how many have you been stoned how many have had 39 lashes twice i'm talking about bent over tied to a post and i'm sure they're not going no in it like 39 and 40 they say it was kill you or something you know he got 39 twice paul said these light afflictions and we got problems this light affliction he wore those stripes his whole life psalms 37 the steps of a good man now remember we always quote it the steps of a righteous man that's not in the bible this is the scripture we're talking about the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall we're going to he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord what upholdeth him with his hand i have been young now this is david now david's in the psalms i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread listen we've never been hungry we've never been hungry i went to kroger last night and the place had millions of dollars worth of food in it and i just bought what i needed we're not in any kind of tribulation here okay we're still able to eat what we want to but you know what satan knows that our body is weak because we're getting stronger and stronger inside that inside man's getting stronger and stronger and stronger and satan cannot hinder that except through your body and then he can get in your spirit realm and he can give you a memory he can say oh don't you know that that pain i'll get you how many times you ever had somebody a little voice in your head say you're gonna die about once or twice every hour i'm going to get you today devil told me one time he said you'll never see your wife again i spend months ago months ago he's a liar if he does get to you he's got to ask god's permission that's right amen amen he's got to come to god and he's got to go can i do something to him please can i do something to him and god's like touch his body but leave his soul alone that's what he did with job right right right he said you go ahead but god knew what you would be at the end that's right and what we've got to believe is is that we believe the same thing god believed we got to believe the same thing god's already believing about us right because he's going to have a bride that will make it he's going to have a bride and speaking condition but the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord psalms 27 verse 1. this is a little bit of long reading but i want to read this right here anyway the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh now remember you got to use the metaphors not eat consume satan has consumed this flesh because you know what we're getting older and older and older but that remember we have an example abraham was 99 years old when god produced the promise we know he was changed back but abraham had to say as mary said be it unto me according to thy word he had to take it up here and he had to just keep walking right all right when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh uh-oh they stumbled and they fell you say bring it on devil well you better be careful but they stumbled and fell that's right though and hope should encounter against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident listen i'm not trying to preach the power of positive thinking but it sure helps rousey wounds you woo brother jewel one thing have i desired of the lord one thing david said that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord now not house we're not talking about a house we're talking about the household amen we're not talking about the house and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever the prayer is and i will dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life what the economy of god amen the domain of god all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple now where is the temple at today though right here for in the time of trouble i believe this is brother brown didn't he read this on in the um rapture message i believe he did i just want to know if y'all caught there or not for in the time of trouble he shall leave me alone and take off and go on vacation that's the way we read it sometimes amen why does the heathen raised lord for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion if you could look beyond this veil of flesh you would see an innumerable amount of angels taking care of you even while you sleep they're taking care of you god has pronounced to you and i priests and kings and he's going to see it but we need some help because we're human beings and we have human thoughts and human ideas and i know you've all thought this that's kind of why i wanted you to i wanted to come through this and see that that we're not left alone and we know that but we got sometimes we got to be given a little bit of you know come on david that's it for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a revelation that's what a rock is right he shall set me upon a revelation and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me hmm how positive this is therefore will i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of what joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises unto the lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy all upon me and upon me and answer me when thou saitest seek ye my face my heart sent unto thee thy face lord will i seek remember this is obedient child verse 9 hide not thou face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsook me amen then the lord will take me up i'm not the son of charles and ella brandon brother i'm saying i'm a son of god teach me thy way o lord that's what we've been for 50 and 60 years god has been teaching us how to get deliverance from what we're in in our daily right now today not six year months ago or or who would have thought this a year ago we're coming up on a year almost but who would have thought this a year ago right teach me thy way o lord and lead me in plain past because of my enemy because now look look we're gonna we're gonna look in just a few minutes why does he keep saying enemy you got to have an enemy to be approved you got to have an adversary to build character if it's a victory it has to be a victory over an enemy it's not a victory over the victorious it's victory over that number two spirit that we've been talking about so look that's why i kept i put in the word enemies and boy look at all the stuff comes up but you got to have them jesus had an enemy everybody in the bible had an enemy it was an enemy somewhere in the picture so you and i why are we different we ain't different that's right same enemy different tactics though because what he's done now he's moved into the religious realm but see if he can't get us in the religious realm if we've been taught well if we're sitting together in heavenly places he's been taught well and we know how to handle what's coming the shots that the that the devil's taking what's the next thing he's going after this guy because he still knows he has a little bit of hold on your flesh and he for sure can run into your memory reason conscious effects and imagination deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemy for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed in other words i was going to faint i'm getting faint but i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living amen wait on the lord yes that's our problem wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart the very heart of you wait i say on the lord now he said that twice so we better do that if he says something twice we better listen to what he's saying isaiah 59 18 this is very familiar but we're going to read it again according to their deeds according he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense listen folks you and i even though what all we're going through we're not going to go through what this world is going to go through when we leave here god has took us in that pavilion he's put us in a rocket ship and he's going to eject us out of here and then all hell is going to break loose this ain't nothing compared to what's coming to what god has protected you from even though you fall over the day without a breath in your body you're more alive that way than you are sitting here today because today you're dying but over that sixth dimension you cannot you are eternal amen according to their deeds according he will repay so don't worry why does the heathen rage don't worry we are we are the same as the lord jesus we want this whole world to be saved listen i'm telling you if you walk through that listen i didn't walk through that cloud of smoke saying god strike that man dead that's not the right attitude to have god give that man my sickness no what'd jesus say give it to me jesus said i'll take it i'll take every sin you did i'll take every sickness you'll ever have that was enough for just one person he did it for the whole world think of the circumstances he still got scars yes that's right for your sins and my sin amen according to their deeds according he will repay so don't worry you and i have already been judged so it does not matter what happens to this flesh that's right it will come back 100 yes as job says as a flesh of a baby but folks they don't have a hope it's going to be horrible when we leave this place the bible says your flesh will run off of your body and the birds will eat your flesh while you're still alive and we go home and go oh what was me i got up light affliction temporary if you don't look at it that way folks it's going to drive you crazy recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the east and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood which we know they will the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard now remember he didn't have to build it he just lifted it up it's already been built right he's just going to lift it up if satan goes higher he just keeps going higher you know i sat there and i got a bit boy here's colby i didn't know about was coming up so i got no already done yeah before the foundation of the world and the redeemer shall come to where zion that's you and me and to them that turn from transgression in jacob he's talking about the jews as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord now look my covenant does god ever break a covenant never as for me this is my covenant with them saying the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of your mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed from henceforth and forever god said it that settles it henceforth forever micah 7 verse 7 therefore while i look into the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall rise now you that's what i mean you you look at those people out there in the world that has absolutely no hope you want god to help them but you know what they can't even help their self they can't help themselves all they got to do is do what you did because you was in the same shape they were we weren't born with a silver spoon in the mouth our light brother we said um brother but we weren't burned when they turned on the eternal life in our soul we were born with an eternal gene that was in god and god was waiting boy how patient god was waiting on you to say i want that amen and what god do mary did not carry around this literal seed to bring jesus christ she wasn't born with it she had to receive it same way with you and i we weren't born with jesus in our soul we had to receive it one day you had to stand here or wherever you were and say be it unto me absolutely according to thy word you said if i'll be baptized in the name of jesus christ if i repent and be baptized that you give me the holy ghost there's your seed because your seed is a word amen not a little seed so see when you make even the seed is the word you weren't born with the word listen you weren't even born by the word natural remember you had to be born by the breath of god spiritually that's why you look i don't see why these people in the message don't believe they look at they look they're just like um nicodemus jesus said you must be born again nicodemus should have said i was born right the first time no nicodemus what'd he say have i got carnal have i got to go get back into my mother's womb and be birthed again if i was jesus i'd say no that's what's killing you now he said no nicodemus you got to be born from above amen you got to be born from above and he didn't understand any of that but you and i do nothing in our natural birth but in our spiritual birth is what regens us or regenerates us and takes us away from all this not from pain and sorrow and sickness not please rejoice not against me oh my enemy when i fall i shall rise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me i will bear the indignation of the lord that's what i said before we all it's nothing we gave up god took it away from us i cursed i drank never smoked cursed i drank god took that away from me he took it away he didn't just suppress it no he took it away from me but when people look at you and you you talk out in the world and they try to hand you a beer it's like a poor you people that don't understand christian life they go how poor are you what do you mean you what do you mean we can't go hunting on sunday i don't have a problem going hunting on sunday if you're out where you can't go you understand what i mean i don't mind that the prophet didn't either but usually if you know me and my daddy we find a church somewhere to go so anyway but anyway come on man you don't want to go well you used to drink we used to have parties we used to have fun oh man we used to cuss that guy out when he cut us off in the in the row we used to you know give him the first finger wire the second finger wave right what what what kind of fun do you have well i go to church on sunday all day well we used to we were getting

said just one day out of seven not counting wednesday night but just one day to glorify god and to come into his tabernacle to come into his pavilion and let him tell us what he's already said about us that's a privilege damn i have to put on a pair of shorts and a tank top because it's hot and then go walk down the beach with my wife with a bikini on but they look at you and they go we feel so far sorry for oh oh you know james jim's family and you know other families even if they don't say anything or they do that extended family that can't understand you they go oh poor poor sister gin bless your heart she wears dresses all the time and oh yeah i bet it's just i bet it's horrible um having to fix that hair and uh at least you don't spend two hours in front of a stinking mirror putting makeup on that's what i don't understand lord you're going i'm just gonna preach you go in at some of these places and you go you know centers and you go and you go to the bathroom or whatever they let you go you're sitting there talking to them your family or something you walk in the bathroom you go they can't be that many kind of eyeliner they can't be that many colors of whatever that stuff they put on rouge and all that eyeliner and stuff it's just everywhere it's like a max factor factory you open it up and you go what and you look over here and it scares you to death you think you're spiders but it's in my eye it says eyes extenders eyebrow things and all are eyelash extenders but you see what they go through and say that it's good they say this is normal right go ahead it would scare you to death in the morning before she put the stuff on yeah it's fake yes this is original this is the original that god wants [Applause] thank you they think we're crazy saw a guy walk out we were living in gainesville you know when the kids first started wearing their pants way down to here you know this is no joke this guy walks out of a convenience store and this is his comfort zone because he didn't bother me to go buy a beer in the store or the one in the restaurant why because they weren't born again i had a familiar spirit like they did so birds of a feather flock together but here's this guy he you'd see this he's got two 24 packs a bud light because it's in blue he comes out the door and he pushes the door open and i'm getting gas you know i look he's got him right here and and he has to walk sorry he has to walk like this because he don't have nothing to pull his pants up with so he's walking and i thought what an effort he just spent 40 dollars to get drunk and probably destroy something marriage somebody's property say something he ain't gonna want doesn't want to say you hear what i'm saying this is normal though and he can't pull his i mean his are down to here and he's going out to the car and i thought dude that's normal you know his friends are going whoa he carried beard he can't be pans pulled up that's normal but that is to them and then here you go up and pay for your gas and get you a coke or whatever in a pack of crackers or something and then you say god bless you and the guy behind the counter i almost have a heart attack because mostly they'll look at you and go what god you talking about that's right right right they don't even know god listen folks you and i are the most normal people kids you go to school you are the most normal person in that school cause you took a stand for god that's going to last for an eternity not just for 12 grades they can't even think eternal they only think 70 years and i'm done where am i going i don't know what kind of god am i going to meet i don't know knowing what you know now could you live that way i'd go crazy i'd go crazy i mean i'd go back crazy i wouldn't know what to do even though the things we go through that we walk through every day just like david we walk one step at a yes time the world calls you weird amen don't worry they do don't worry but when you walk through walmart sisters you know what if somebody ever turns and says well oh granny you're going to be the judge of that person at the white throne judgment you're going to stand there in judgment and that person's going to have to give an account for berating you living a christian life the saints will judge the earth how you going to judge them by the short hair by your short hair and your prance and no you're going to judge it by the word of god which you are living all right kids i know this is i know it's hard to believe but this one this is only temporary anything you do you watch i watch deanna go through things as a young kid that she would just get all crazy about she's 12 now and they don't even bother you go through things as kids you go i'm never going to live through this oh my friends don't worry about it just keep walking just keep walking just keep walking because i'm telling you when you get my age and some of these other brothers age the things even at 20 and 30 and 40 that bothered me that's right why call it's temporary yes that's right amen but you know what bothers me is when i'm not right with god and i don't mean by going out doing what i used to do i mean by not just studying more and praying more and but you know what god knows that that's why i'm going to read to you in just a little bit when i get to it that's why god has to put us through this yes amen yes he knows what you need as an individual if you're a child of god and your footsteps are ordered the lord brother zach don't look at what some other brother's having to go through you look at what you got to go through everybody look at what you got to go through because it's an individual affair with god i will bear the indignation of the lord that's what i said before that's what we're bearing we're coming to church on sunday y'all stay all day i got a lot of beekeeper friends and lord bless them but they do there one sunday morning and about 12 o'clock they're home so when i would you know be second service it's about two o'clock they'd start me calling want to know what this and what to do buying sugar and buying honey and all this stuff you don't have to keep the phone cut off and i'm like i answer if i'm like i'm in church or i'll say i was in church you go to church all day yeah and i enjoy it yes sir you can go enjoy what you want to i enjoy this yes i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteousness then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame folks let me tell you something the most shameful people are going to be is is that person that shamed you down here and they're going to stand before the judgment bar and they're going to have to look at you because remember you didn't shame the lord oh yeah you did but you shamed the lord through that person wow then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me where is the lord thy god in other words people ask well why why we're we're supposed to be this great christian you know bride of jesus christ why in the world are we getting this dreaded disease it's for mine and your perfection can't come no other way won't come no other way it's what you're going to do with it it's what's going to determine your journey it's your it's the journey that's right okay mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets how many times we read that scripture where it said they're talking about satan that he would be just something laying on the side of the road and we're going to look down and say is this the man that wrought destruction on kingdoms that gave me all that torment that's what we're gonna and listen i believe we're gonna look on him now right amen because that is the last enemy is death physical death is the last enemy we got to defeat and where does that come from satan it doesn't come from god that's what brother dale was talking about and i was writing i was getting quotes and we might get to them we might not so so let's go to the first quote listen to what brother brown said in the smyrna church everybody all right say amen all right just a little bit of encouragement here unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him oh brother what him well he's reading the bible he can't he's reading what the bible says all right unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign now you say oh now god is no he knows if he lets you go what you'll do he's a good daddy but he's a just daddy you have to suffer the rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering you got to have an enemy gotta have one right got to have the two spirits you got to have the enemy yes but the enemy just doesn't know that god's using that enemy to push you closer to god not closer to the enemy if you're a child of god character is a victory not a gift so god's not just going to give you a gift of character it's a victory something you want he that overcometh a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic have you ever thought about this god is all-knowing he has no limit right if god doesn't have character look what he could do he'd just destroy us all he could do whatever he wanted right he still can but he doesn't want to his character forbids him because satan has no character so he just kills everything he sees right perverts and in that way it dies a man without character can't reign so now if you and i have the mind of christ supposed to be having the mind of christ we're supposed to be having the character that is the character of god right there then how are we to act the same way power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne he's talking about revelation 3 about us sitting in the throne on the same basis that he overcome and has set down with his father's throne that we have to overcome to sit with him all right see they didn't know he's in church don't they and say and since he wanted to share even a strong a little temporary look a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that be will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that detroit you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through it amen so we're not immune folks the church that is not suffering now this one's hard to swallow the church that is not suffering and is not being tried it isn't of god we believe our prophet now no we believe what he said good about us back yonder yo no the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god whoa all right keep going hebrews 12 6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and score just every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers no one's excluded then you're bastards and not sons now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god keep reading it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind he goes to matthew 5 11. blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven we're so persecuted they the prophets which were before you this is where i want to come here i may just close right here and i'll pick up the rest later bro joe just hang on i've got many many scriptures that we'll read but let's just read this and we'll close 11 40 now the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval you can't measure what's going on in your daily life by that that is not a measure the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither when you get up in the morning and the birds are singing and a butterfly lands on your finger when you go outside and you think oh the lord is with me today i got so much anointing on me so nothing can bother me you go get in your car and you go whoa are you getting going down the road cass in your motor goes boom four thousand dollars worth but you still got that butterfly on your finger neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval what do we got to base it on right here his approval of any of us is only in the beloved who is he that's jesus christ his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so not the cloudy skies not the sunny days not the trials that we're going through now all the different things but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself you ought to be so glad of that that that takes care of everything else that you're going through and gave us of his spirit placing us his sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and conducting myself with what anger no and conduct by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass what a quote what a quote i want to read this one more if you'll take this quote down to the layout to see in church age brother joe just go scroll through that go down let's read this one and then we'll finish i love this one all right look this is us to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i am overcome and i'm sitting down with my father he had to overcome too jesus christ had to overcome the devil just like you and i do hello and did you do it with signs and wonders no he told the devil what the bible already said to him that overcometh while grant has sit with me in my throne in not on even as i also overcome and i'm sitting down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome we'll stop right here all right what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here why does the healing rage why do i have to get up and and say my prayers and if i gotta listen to one more tape today no it should be a joy for that to happen that's what lights your fire not turning on the news and watching the liar's channel and all them other things i mean come on you're gonna sit and listen to a lie for an hour and then instead of listening to a tape or listen to or listen to or read your bible that's life to me that's normal it should be normal for you now that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we overcome it remember i always talked about a laundry list don't write a laundry list because you're going to be going well i don't do this i don't do that i do this i don't do that god don't love me because of this uh god i did this somebody did that no it's not it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we overcome it wow a quick look of those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan what by the word and by the word only in each of three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden remember the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life anybody got that remember it's in two spirits in the beginning it's them two spirits standing here right now in this and then us look this one i want you to read he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word okay second eve what are we supposed to do then use the word we're the second eve right first he fell by not using the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this that that is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you're an overcomer because that word can't fail now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion and here we talk about the two spirits two religious spirits now when he was repeatedly badgered we think we have problems listen they hated jesus they didn't even want him around they didn't want him in the synagogue they hate him so much they killed him you're right i really would like somebody to hate me that good why didn't you say he's like jesus if we don't get persecuted like jesus did then i don't know that we're of jesus that's what he's saying when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused boy by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god what are you and i supposed to have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and the love of god which is agape love they were not a time when the world was not utterly confused that's the same thing they are with us when they question us as they're if they're they're in a confusion musicians come they're in a confusion they're confused that well this this this is normal listen even the religious realm of people if you even meet a real good nominal christian and you start talking to them about water baptism or about no eternal hell or about all these great doctrines that we've been re that's been revealed to us they think you're strange not just in people out there that smoke and drink and don't go to church i'm talking about church people i'm talking about people that walk around they go to church and have on their you know the women they have women preachers in their congregation are in their pulpits and all that which is totally contrary to the word of god amen so see as we get closer can we be in the ranks of the message the same way because we teach daniel 70 weeks the way it's supposed to be taught i'm just going to be truthful here the seals daniel 70 weeks the great doctrines has been preached from this church and been preached in truth the people in the message do the same thing to us oh be careful don't don't let them in your pulpit they may they may preach something that yeah yeah when you got preachers in this message that has a sign in their office that says please don't preach on marriage and divorce we got a problem and that's the truth i haven't seen it but i've seen people that have seen it so what are we up against now we're up against the two spirits now that's so close that it's your idea it's what's gonna kill you listen god don't have ideas oh i got this idea oh he's already got it as soon as he thinks it it becomes manifest the devil has to think through these things i'm sure he does because he's not a god you know satan is not i'm going to say this satan is not as much of god as you are if you've got god in your soul you have a creator inside of you that by your own voice you can create satan cannot do that i mean how many up listen how many of us let's stand to our feet how many of us think all right here's god now we know there's just one there's not three of them sitting up there there's one god then here's the devil and then here's us god don't see it that way he created the devil and the devil went wrong now you and i came because of that wrong but he created us in that genesis 1 26 man and satan does not understand that and cannot touch that because that is god a peace of god satan is not a peace of god no he's a created being he's not even human brother brahms he's not a human he can't create where does he get his power from fear and being your enemy but let me tell you when we finish this next sunday you'll see that enemy is what's driving you to the homeland the two hundred thousand thousand demons that got in eichmann and hitler them same demons when eichmann and hitler died they came on me and you through persecution of government and everything else and even somebody even your neighbor but what brother brown say he said it'll drive you to your homeland which is this message of the hour to me then we can be settled come what may we will win we will overcome we will win and i didn't get to i didn't get to the part where dad and i were talking about talking about death but even now you know death's all around us it's just become a normal thing so when it comes up to me and you what are we going to do because it's always that great big enemy it's that great big goliath it's that thing that stands up that really when death comes up you really can't see nowhere it's just all around you but remember yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil because i'm looking at the light i'm not looking at the shadow because remember what is a shadow of shadows behind you if you got this if you got the s-o-n in front of you your shadow's back here put your cares on jesus yes i know this was simple but i it spoke to my heart the other day when we were talking about you walk through life and and we do as human beings and you know what don't have a pity party you're going to have one because you're human but don't have a long one shake yourself devil you're a liar god's word is the truth and just set your eyes toward home because that's what this is not our home yeah we're coming back to this but i'm talking about this cosmos this world order is not having it's nothing for a christian to be in but god has protected us though being in this age he has put a dome over us and protected us because you and i would go crazy literally crazy if we didn't know the truth that's why they're going crazy out there they don't know the truth well what's going to happen if i die i was thinking another day one of the greatest things is bro god let brother brown go across that curtain of time you know to me that destroyed death for him i know he had to physically die but that destroyed death because he know he said what am i afraid of i don't even want to go back there look which one was the greatest i will go back there right but he could come back and tell me and you don't fear that don't fear death that's just a tool to get you from here to god into your manifestation of who you are then you got to wait on somebody that's right somebody's got to stand one day and say saints don't worry we've got death handled on this side now maybe dying all over the world but we've got it handled in this bride of jesus christ so come on over on this side get your physical body come on over here and let's rejoice for about 30 or 40 days and then we'll be changed and then we'll get out of here amen god bless you let's sing a song we've been made more than conquered if you have a need we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this life thank you lord through the blood of jesus christ saying that course again we've been made more [Music] now i confess wither to lord so two or three witnesses are standing here today lord knowing that your word is true lord and these prayer cloths will do exactly what our sister said it would do lord we thank you for these promises and truths that you give us lord in jesus name [Music] amen don't be afraid you know it's not like before don't you give in don't let it bring you down cause you don't have to worry anymore we've been made more than conquerors [Music] we've been witness that these prayer clubs do exactly what we say they'll do lord so i pray that by the voice of our brother lord that what he is going to say when he places these cloths where they need to go lord that they will absolutely do exactly what he said lord in jesus name we pray lord amen [Music] just lean on him and then we will all say we've been made more than conquerors overcomers in this life lord our brothers made a confession that he wants his wife to be healed lord so i pray that when he lays this cloth on her lord that that revelation of manifestation will come lord and that that thing will go away in jesus name again amen you're speaking you're just walking and saying one day [Music] we the bride we are victorious it's through the blood of jesus christ first verse now troubles may come knocking at your door don't be afraid you know it's not like before don't you give in don't let it bring you down cause you don't have to worry anymore we've been named more than conquerors overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus [Music] amen we're getting stronger every day when you take these things and you take these prayer claws when you lay them on that whoever you give them to you pronounce it in the name of jesus christ your own understanding that's your authority just lean on not just the anointing that's just a cloth but your mouth your confession you put that confession in the airwaves and see if god will not do what he said he would do lay it on there and pronounce it in the name of jesus christ satan hates that name [Music] of jesus christ let's sing it now we have been made more than conquered you believe that overcomers in this life [Music] oh we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus and guess what we had a prophet pronounced one day he said the bride is the blood by the spirit so that blood that covering we have become that the bride is the blood by the spirit so by the spirit of god that's inside of you listen it wasn't the physical blood that saves you the physical blood just kind of went down into the ground and it's kind of gone but the life the power that laid in the life that flowed through that blood that's what you need to accept but the bride is the blood by the spirit what a quote think about that that might says can't vote [Music] where's the dna come from yep you say oh no it comes from a hat your hair is what makes you look i mean your blood what makes your hair your blood's a lifeline right without your blood you don't have anything but that life in that blood it's the life behind that makes the demon tremble satan thought he had him he had him hanging on a cross the blood was coming out of his body but he just didn't know that he released the most powerful force that had ever been released that somebody said let there be because he released it out of that shell and the first thing satan knew he was standing looking at him face to face satan says what are you doing down here he said well i just paid a price and i've come to claim what's mine give me the keys [Music] give me the keys and while i'm at it i'm going to stop by paradise and all them that died in faith i'm going to take them with me satan you don't even know where i'm taking them and on the day of pentecost there was 120 little jesus is born and satan's going crazy and been going crazy ever since he has no power unless god allows him and if god allows him it's for your benefit i'll read it next sunday it's for your benefit when god releases the devil on you because satan thinks he's going to turn you some way he's going to try to turn you back to serving him but what is there there's an anchor there's something in there satan cannot understand he can't understand why you can't go right back to what you were doing because he don't have that thing in him but you do you hold on to that trials tribulations whatever it is sickness death sorrow pain we got to go through it we must suffer the rain but you know what the reigning is for an eternity this mile that we're going through now it's just mild but that rain will be for an eternity and you'll never have to worry about sickness death sorrow pain no more that's why brother we were talking about you know you can't kill a christian [Music] you can just separate him from this dimension but you can't kill a christian you're actually more alive when you're in a city like jesus jesus was trapped in the body like it was 50 years old but it was only 30 right but when he died on that cross and released that life there was that 20 year old god that satan said didn't i meet you back where are we didn't you create me or we he's looking at that 20 year old guy again the creator that's why you and i are gonna be changed back to a young man and woman because jesus our god has always been a young man because we were created in his image not this image we were created in his image so you're right now we're all the same age 18 20 years old inside of you it's what's going to carry you out of here if you don't have it in you folks it's not going to carry you you're going to you're going to suffer a worse fate than you ever think a little bit of suffering of not doing this and not doing i can't go to do this and i can't have a beer with my friends come on people just hold on hold on hold on to god forget about the world hold on to what god said because listen if you grab a hold of satan's hand you know where he's going to take you he's going to take you to hell he can't take you anywhere else he'll start with hell on earth and he'll take you to hell in that other dimension but if you hang on to god i like what a preacher said one time he said we have attached ourself to the eternal amen and that's what it is we've attached ourselves to the eternal so how can we lose we can't lose god bless you let's buy our hands still heavenly father thank you for this day thank you for the overcoming power that you give us lord it's not something we have to go to school for basically or or or try to learn and memorize lord it's that tie post that's down inside that when you had a prophet one time lord we were gonna get into this later on but i'll i'll say it now you you had a little prophet in the early 1900s and he had a sweet little wife had a little baby named sharon rose and he was doing all he could to preach the gospel [Music] and lord his wife lay dying his baby died a few days later lord that would rattle us and it did rattle him and his humanity but somebody asked brother branham said oh said did you hold on to your religion he said no he said my religion held on to me and that's what we must do lord we must suffer some of these temporary things so that we can reign with you lord your gracious father lord i pray that you would bless us now as a church bless us now as a people on our way home on the highways we know one thing's for sure satan is mad [Music] but he can't touch us father you've put a hedge around us but you know what we need for perfection and you know what we need to overcome with lord that's the baptism of the holy ghost lord i pray that we'll get a refilling today let it create a revival in our heart as we've been preaching on the lord back when several months ago lord that we'll look to you the author and finisher of our faith [Music] not depend on anything else but your word lord go with us lord be brother dale brother terrence all the different ones that are coming out of this and lord it will gather back together as one and lord even though we may be scattered we are still one one body the beautiful unmatchable white is snow body of jesus christ thank you lord for telling us these things thank you for sending a prophet lord in the end time that could tell us these many secrets lord and that the bride will become all those things that he's saying father we thank you for that we thank you for giving us eternal life we pray that you'd be with us now until we come back on wednesday night be with brother aaron as he studies lord to minister to us father give us strength for this journey in jesus name we ask these things amen god bless you i'm going with [Music] we've been god more than conquerors overcomers in this life we've been victoria
