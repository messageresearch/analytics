feel I gave him the level of black I didn't ever want to fight me all the time you know I'm gonna give it back to him tonight so that's kind of all speak on the nut and let's go the Lord and in prayer and opened up and we go to very very familiar scripture mark chapter 16 and I entitled this power to cast out all the powers of the enemy because you know we do have the power right but you know either even where brother Branham said the church doesn't need the power said it needs the faith to operate the power and that's what we need we need to have that faith Amen god bless you let's all just bow our heads tonight speak to the Lord our Heavenly Father we thank you another Lord we thank you for just allowing us to be back in your house Lord ins to fill your presence and we just pray that you just come tonight lord help us get out of the way or just speak to each heart in each life Lord you know Lord what we have need of Lourdes it's not what what I have in my notes or whatever but Lord you just come and speak to just be a yielded vessel Lord Jesus just open Lord just just like a microphone or Lord as brother I'm sent home at a microphone Lord there has to be someone to come and speak Lord because it's totally mute and what we just pregnant that you come speak Lord help us just get out of the way Lord anoint the ears to hear Lord Jesus Lord I've done all that I can do I know the people have done all that they can do Lord but it takes you now to come put it all together now Lord we just commit it all to you the Lord for each need that's represented tonight Lord each hand Lord each spoken request Lord you know the need and all we just pray that you come on the scene and Lord just bless the bride around the world and what we just commit all these things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen mark 16 and verse and verse 14 says afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they said it meeting them braided them with with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had hurt has seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye and all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and then we'll go to chapter Luke chapter 10 verse 19 and Jesus says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy nothing shall by means hurt you hey man god bless you tonight and be seated I feel like for like I've been in a whirlwind you know that's wait go them sometimes the life of a Christian you know we don't understand why things happen the way they do but the Bible tells us that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who are the called according to his purpose so we don't understand the purpose behind everything but you know what it all works out in the end and so you know I lost my laptop and so it's been really been real fun to try to study and they also stole my SD card out of my tablet they didn't steal the tablet but they stole the SD card out of it hey they they they like I said they open to console the truck they moved the tablet yeah they had to open that they had to open the case to pull the slide the slide the tablet out to get the card out left the pistol in the floorboard but generally took all that I thought you know so interesting I had all those sermons that are on that SD card and they took it had the laptops got all the messages everything and they took it but they left other stuff well maybe that's what that's what we said the other day maybe they'll get saved me tapes maybe somebody somewhere maybe there's a lot out there maybe the words come to somebody you know there's like that like that man overseas he found half of message book the bottom half of the message book because somebody used the other half and the bottom half of it had voice of God's address on and he wrote cuz he could only read half the book but the half that he had was just so amazing what brother branham said that bottom half of that book that he had to write to voice of God seeking so he could get some more word because that just stirred him up comes a half hadn't been told me he got it got enough in the half that that just just three old him just at one house so and tell you what you know and we have when we have you know 1200 sermons you know we ought to we ought to be over joyous and just overfilled because what we have but you you know in the in the beginning brother Brent says this is from the message Queen of Sheba and and brother Branham says I'm talking about the great things he said he says the Bible says in the last days that the angels would turn themselves into ministers of light he said look at the very first sin that was ever performed was Satan wanted a greater a brighter kingdom a great thing and went over in the North and set up his own kingdom to outshine Michael it's always those bright things cuz that was the first one there brother Branham says in Christ the mystery he said the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build a United Kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more culture to greater Kingdom the Michael Christ head I said Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven then Christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of Christ and you know you know he had he had a perfect place because he was placed by God in the place that he was supposed to be but you know he decided he had to have something greater he thought he could be bigger and they have more than than what what God had given him and that's the reason that he was cast out because he rose up and said you know that I'm gonna make myself higher than God I'm gonna make my kingdom higher and you know murderously a more cultured a greater a bigger a brighter thing than what what God was but you know God with who God is is the God of light and he and there's there's nothing that's ever gonna be great or nothing ever gonna be brighter than God but you know Michael had this or Satan had this great idea what he was going to become bigger but you know in the in the process of him raising up and going against God you know he was cast doubt you know he did not hold this first the state and even Jude tells us about the angels that held not their first estate you know they're they're held until the time to be cast out and there goes you know they're turned over to for damnation but you know there's a time you know those that didn't hold their first estate and you know here they they're they they've raised up to this this to do this great thing but you know Satan did not hold his first place and he was cast down and you know he's never and he never can get back to the place that he was but you know as many times as Satan is went forth he's tried to come back and he's tried to overcome the the work of God and everything and all the way down through history we see that even from the beginning you know because he went from there and then he went into the certain brother I said he went into the serpent and he went to even you know he started trying to get into the human race and you know cause all the problems but you know the thing is the devil thinks he's got something working but the problem is he doesn't know he's right in the hands of God that it's going to be the victory of God that's gonna take places you know so he's already been defeated from the beginning and no matter what he does he's always defeated he'll always be defeated he's never he's never had a victory and every time he thinks he's got something you know because every time that he raises up and he thinks he's got something then you know what he had always miserably fails just like when it when Jesus was in the tomb you know there on the cross he thought you know here here he is that's the man that he claims to be the Son of God to be God manifested in flesh in areas and you know now I'm going to have him right where I want him he's going to be in the grave now and that you know he's not going to raise any more and you know he'll just pass on and then he'll leave me alone and you know I'll have this great victory over him you know he's set there in there and that time and he laid in the tomb but he did not realize that you know that when when Jesus went down there get her then he went and preached to those that were lost in in prison and then he went and went to paradise and he went by and he saw those that had lived I had lived what they had saw all the way down through history there was Abraham and Sarah and Isaac and all the other ones and you know Ezekiel and all the ones there because you know when when he came by Abraham said that's the one that we ain't calf with that we sat under the tree and he was the one that spoke to me and told me when I was in my death that the body was dead I couldn't have children yet he was the one that come and told me that I would have a son that you know when everything looked impossible he was the one that said it's all possible why because if you can believe it'll time to pass you know he didn't even it didn't even you didn't consider you know what what Abraham had to say it was it was a Word of God that was given and you know there was Ezekiel sitting there and speaking he said and there's the will in the middle of the wheel there there he is and benefit station that Hebrew children said there was the one that come walked in the fiery furnace with there he is and you know he come back and he come back and he come up out of the grave and he stood there and you know and he told and he told he told him I said and now I have the keys of death inhale there's a they don't even have keys to his own house he doesn't he's power absolutely powerless why because everything he's tried to do I've taken the power away from him he's absolutely powerless the scripture tells us that every power is permitted of God and so you know and so everything that comes and goes has to be permitted by God to allow so whatever he does he's only allowed to do it because God allows him to do it because he has to work according to the laws of God and you know the thing is is you and I have to work the same way and the only power that Satan ever has is the power that you giving you know we were we've been listening to the seals you know the young people and and you know we were talking about Satan being a bluff you know he's just a bluff you know the Antichrist when tried now with with his bow but you give him the arrows you know he was just a bluff you know Jesus said there in Matthew 24 he said do not be deceived by any means why because you know he's a bluff but he's there to deceive you he's trying to pull a fast one on you but you know he has no power and the Britain that thing is is do you have to believe that we give him the arrows we give them one because the words as we speak are spirit in life and we are the ones that are more armed the devil against us why because it's just like we have to stand fortified behind the word and if we're not fortified behind the word to take every fiery dart of the enemy you know because if we don't that he wins but I'm so glad that I've been given the power you know it doesn't matter what comes my way or what goes because God has made a provision for me you know it you know brother Brennan was talking about and you'll have to forgive me this everything but you know brother Adam was talking about you know what what is the problem with people and what's why don't what is going on because you know God done all that he could and you know when he rose from the dead and then he told the disciples you know here here I'm giving you this power and you know they went out and they they had this this power and you know he you know it's not that you know it just went to Peter and Paul in the 12 and you know the hundred and twenty but you know the power was and the promise was made unto everyone that believes if you believe in the powers under you because because the promises in the Bible are to those that believe whatever God promised is you take him at his word because whatever he promised to one person then he has to fulfill it with everybody if you meet the same conditions if you're on the same qualifications to make the same then then he has to honor his word and so you know if we look back to what the great things that happen in the past and and you know we think of all these different things but you know what it's the same God today but you don't think is you've got to have the same faith to meet at the same requirements on the same ground and he'll do the same thing for you if we can if we can do the same thing you know because you know so many people talk about how wonderful it was way back when but you know what there's a lot of people that wouldn't want to go live back then you know there's so many people that you know they talk about what God had a great move back then well you know life was a lot different back then you know there's a lot of people that you know and my job you know if if the temperature changes to degrees I hear about it you know you can have all kinds of air conditioners running but boy I tell you what if he just gets a little bit or the humidity goes up just a little bit they're calling me I gotta go I gotta go look at it and lots of times there's nothing even wrong with it they're just calling to complain and I go look at it it's like I'm just gonna I just walked through it's like hey I'm looking at the thermostat it's exactly where it's set it's working like it's supposed to be I don't know what the problem is I go on the roof and I look at him I lay hands on the machines and I see air conditions right but people will complain but you know what how many of y'all would like to go back to the days when you know there wasn't anything like that you know there was a time that mister when mr. carrier hadn't even come up with the idea even had the concept of air conditioning hadn't even come up with the idea of refrigeration the only kind of refrigeration that people had was cutting ice off of the lake and storing it up you know there's a lot of things that people we go back and look you know and you know all the way through life all the things that all the comforts that we have now but you know there was a time people didn't have those things you don't think about Susanna Wesley racing 17 children and spending time and praying with each one of them and trying to take care of them they didn't I mean you had to build a fire in the stove to cook food and lots of times they were raising it or you were I'm for it and now everybody you know the first thing to do first thing comes to mind is hey we're just gonna whip through the drive-through everything is instant you know and you know and there's this like brother and said we got more conveniences we've got more modern technology anything and we got less time for God than we ever had why because that's the plan of Satan is is to take up your time with nonsense with things that don't matter but you know people people to spend all their time you know the biggest thing that everybody happens is the first thing is you know they have their phones and it's so funny at work and I know y'all probably never see anything like this before but you go to work and you see people standing in the corners you don't know what that you're working on an assembly line and everything like yet people walk by and they're watching for the bosses and they're going or they go stand over in a corner somewhere and everybody you know and everybody's like hey do you know what happened on the news what happened this that happened that happened you're the first thing everybody's got to tell you about what's going on what scores are everything you know everybody won because everybody has to be fed by that instant gratification because everybody's got to know everything we got to have our pulse on the world everything that's going on in the world you know every time what person bought you know what per this person's wearing or what they where they went and all these different things and everybody's got to know and you know everybody's gonna I got people at work and you know they sitting there checking the stock market they want to know what their what their 401k is doing how much they got they got invested in this and that and they got to know what's going on here and they gotta know what's going on there what's going to take place over in the world you know and it's like well I guess what I'm gonna tell you up front and give you the headlines ahead of time I'll let you see and I'll let you hold it's all gonna get burn up it's all going away so you can put all your faith in all your housing and all your money but there there'll be a day that it won't be worth anything and it won't even exist there'll be well you know you know what there won't be any more cars I don't mean or air-conditioned and there won't be any more lights there won't be any more of those things long because it all be done away with but people spend all their time and you've got to get a stay on top of all this stuff and then you know the everybody's gets wrapped up in entertainment and all these other things and they're just so bound by things that have absolutely no no worth in this world at all I preached one time in Oz that's telling everybody you know you got all these people that that are so wrapped up in sports and you know that you know everywhere they go they got to have they got to have their sports team they got to have everything covered up you know we have this thing at work now on Fridays everybody gets to wear their sports team you can wear your jerseys and your hats and everything we're going to everybody got to come in deck from head to toe in sports stuff everybody got to tell you what team they're for and who they who they're rooting for and you know and and they get people getting these great big arguments over because the NBA Finals or whatever are going on right now you know everybody's playing about pro ball and you know that's what's going on and this one's getting by with that and this one's you know they're there the refs are hard on this team and you know they just arguing over stuff and it's like it don't matter but you know you got some people they're so wrapped up that you know they won't ever go anywhere unless you know I'm preaching up brother Jing Williams church one time to us you know everybody is orange up there boy they they're Clemson fans you know I said you go up through there and you got people up there and they got big Tiger tails hanging off the back of their car they won't go nowhere with a tiger tail hanging off the back of the car and they got to let everybody know that they're a Clemson fan got to wear the orange and the purple and they got to have a big tiger paw on everything and they got to have everything just so and you know they just can't leave home without their orange with their you know and then you got people that are Alabama they got to have that a and you know I there was a man that they drove an RV that was an Alabama fan and I told him that he was so why he was so addicted to the Crimson Tide that acrimony if the Alabama played on the moon he'd drive an RV to the moon he'd be on the moon upper coast he would have to run for Alabama because that's where they're playing ball you know some people are so addicted to stuff you know they they get so wrapped up in this antenna just conned consumes their whole life but you know what you try to talk to him about a living god that came down that spoke out of out of nothing he spoke everything into existence and you know what he wants to come and talk to you it wants to bring you eternal life and once it wants to make your life worth living he wants to touch you and minister to you in a special way and you know what they ain't got time for it ain't got time for it you know if we if we could just see his brother band said if we could see into that other realm if we could see in the other dimension to see what's going on we look and see boy is so pretty is so pretty but you know if we actually could see in that other realm you know what we wouldn't touch things with a ten-foot pole one because the spirits that our own things the spirit center around things we wouldn't touch him we wouldn't want to have anything to do with them but you know brother branham said if we could see in that other realm we would see that he said that the angels are walking up and down the aisles of the church the angels are here why because he said that he would be where two or three are gathered in my name he said there I'll be in the mids he said the angels of God are here he said one because they're ministering spirits and he said what are they come to do he said they come to minister to you see sometimes we just think well let's just come because you know it's just gonna be brother down he's just gonna sit here and he just go read its own quotes but you know what if we could look beyond this realm and look beyond the flesh you know what we could say Almighty God trying to speak to us you know it's you know because sometimes we get wrapped up in the veil we look we get wrapped up in the flesh you know because you know this person does a preach a certain way or this person - preaches that we don't like this person the way the way they're present things or whatever you know the thing is if we could get beyond that if we could get in the same spirit that you know what God could speak to us and it's not looking at flesh it's not looking at people but you know what we hear from Almighty God said ah I don't want I just don't want to do a church service just to be a church service because you know what we could just make it it's coming sit go home just go through the motions and you know what and then you know what in the end there's we don't we're not in closer to God then with us when we came we don't we don't get anything from God but you know what if we come here and expect God to come on the scene if we come expecting you know it's just like when that wouldn't when Friday rolls around you know everybody expects to get their paycheck or whatever time of the month the government decides to send you your money another thing is you know I thank God people are getting money from the government you know why because if you spent 40 or 50 years paying in I think you want to get something back people act like you like the government's giving you something no the government's taking your money all these years and used it for all kind and some of it's absolute foolishness you ain't got no you've got nothing to show for it and now you're trying to get some of your money back and they act like they're doing you a favor but you know the thing is is if we get something you know we come we expect to get money within you know what if we you know because you know what if your check they will make it on in the bank on Friday you're calling somebody hi you're supposed to hit the bank at midnight if it ain't there we're looking for it but you know what we don't do that in the house of God you know some people don't even show up well if we don't if you don't show up you know it's just like saying hey you know what I don't care if the company gives you my money or not but you know people people would get out there yet are they looking for their money well you know the thing is if you come to the house of God expecting it the same way you know what those people they pay a lot of money to Amazon or all these other companies you know what they expect their packages they look on their phone and it says hey you know your package got delivered you know when they get home they expect the package to be on the front door well you know what if it don't show up you know what they're out there call hey where's my package well you know what if you come to the house of God and you we're looking for God to speak to getting it on you come in say well Lord Here I am I said why don't you spoke to me well you know sometimes the reason is is because God never turns you away empty unless you're full of yourself but sometimes the problem is is you know just like when when we had that prayer line there in Louisiana for the young people you know when you go before God and you start praying and there's a problem you know what the gods obligated you come and speak to you to find out what the problem is maybe issues maybe there's something that maybe there's unconfessed sin maybe there's something you've got all to get somebody or whatever something needs to be straightened out but you know what if you get before God God will tell you what the problem is let's get before God and find out what the problem is you know God told God told Joshua to go before go into the land and set the people in order and they went in and he said you know what nothing is going to stand before you nothing stands before you you're going to go right in and take the land but you're the first time they lost a man God called a halt Josh gonna call it a halt talking you got to stop he said we're gonna find out where the CNEA is you know what people don't want that in their lives people whoa somebody come speak to them and tell them what their problem is why because say they hold onto some kind of little something that they've held on for years and they don't want to get rid of it and they think they want to be free but they don't if they don't want to be free then you know God can't help you but you know God is but God can tell you what your problem is and then you've got to react to it you've got you've got to make your decision whether you're gonna change it or not but you know we just was called a halt and to find out what the problem was you know and then when they found out we're Aiken Aiken had stolen the Babylonian garment and the gold you know there it was that was there was the sin you know what and it worked all the way through until it will come right down to Aiken and they can finally confess you know I'm the one I wasn't supposed to touch any of that stuff it's cursed God didn't want us have anything but you know what I coveted this and I took it and you know what then it caused the death of all those men and then because when that when the death came into camp then you know what the sentence was death you know what they don't kill they just kill a can they killed his whole family they killed everything they destroyed everything the man ever had thanks for trying to destroy every semblance and every remembrance of him why because I want to get that completely out of the camp and the thing is is you know we don't we don't need to have any who abstain from every appearance of evil make sure we try to stay far away as we can of anything that even remotely looks like a problem some people got a hold of something so well this won't be a problem this won't be a problem just said looks like that little story the man finding the rattlesnake and it's almost froze to death and you brought it in the house we were so well he was so afraid that thing was going day brought it in the house and left it won't let it warm up and that's saying you know the thing met him and he's like I can't believe you made me after I brought you in here and warmed you up saved your life he said you knew what it was when you brought me through the door he said I only done exactly what I am I'm a snake and I beat you well if you if you're gonna play with the world me that's what you end up with and it's the same thing you end up with the same kind of thing you give a place to the devil the scripture says we're not even supposed to give him a place to the devil but you know if he doesn't you know what he just steps right through the door well thank you very much I think I will then we wonder why wonder why the devil's call some problems in Arras well because you let him come in you know everybody's like we're gonna put him in this little box right here we'll let you have this little box right here you can say right here no like they say you give him aunt she takes a mile the next thing you know like what happened well you open the door we host lots of times we think well you know I can handle this I can handle it how I handle this no you can't you can't handle it you got it you got to get fortified behind the word and follow exactly what the word says because you know there's a lot of people that as brother branham said in birth pains he said there's a lot of people they only sympathize with the word he said they sympathize with it but he said they don't die out to it he said they don't get behind the word they sympathize with it he said that's the reason why we don't have many genuine new verses because people want to sympathize with it you know because you know well I think it's right and I'll try to I'll try to go along with it the best I can no you're an utter failure the problem is is you've got it you've got to go by the word and the thing is is the word requires a death because you know what there's a sacrifice that has to be made and the thing is is to receive that sacrifice there's got to be a death and yet what it is it's the death of you and I yes be a death of the old man the old erin roberts has to be gone there can't be any any any part of him they kept many resemblance of him semblance nothing it's all got to be gone and the old man's got to be gone why because christ can come in but you know the problem is is that's what's always going to be warring against us is because we're not allowed we've not allowed him to come in and take complete control to absolute kill us destroy the old old parts of the old man Oh effects of the old man and then that he can come in why because then it's not long no longer I'm living but Christ living in me I want him living in me let him come on the scene Brent said that's a lot of people that you know they just want they just want to have a they just want to have a carnal understanding or a concept that you know they want to have this mental concept of what's going on you know and you know everybody it's so it's so starchy and all these type things and you know because they they want to have this great intellectual understanding but you know brother Brahim said you know that's the problem he said the problem is and he said they're trying to bypass the new birth he said they're trying to go around the new birth and he said that's the problem is they got to come back he said why because they're scared of it he said they're scared of new birth why because what it takes place one because it takes a death he said why because the new birth is a mess and people don't want to come to a mess and they don't want to die out but because it messes up their way of living well because you know what because you've got to get rid of everything because they sometimes you people and they have these they have these concepts of what what really takes place but you know there was a teacher I don't know some of y'all probably read the story about the teacher that you know she wanted all the students said to write old potatoes every problem and everybody that's insulted them or hurt them or anything like it you write it on a potato and stick it in your bag Oh grudges we're stuck in the written on the potato and stuck it in the back anybody read this story has anybody heard it nobody okay well good well thank you they started putting all this stuff down well you know everybody that harm them yeah I don't let potato stuck in the bag take your said okay from now you got to carry that bag everywhere you go you got to put it beside your desk and you set it beside your bed it should carry that thing everywhere so you know what they start carrying them sacks around everywhere they went you know what happened after a while then things started rotting and you know what they've become big bags of slimy goo yeah and they started carrying it around and you know what and some of those kids after a while they got tired of carrying those bags of goo because you know what they like to be Footloose and fancy-free But Here I am carrying this nasty bag around yeah and then everybody keeps looking at me like why are you carrying this bag well you know I'm carrying this bag because I want to and after a while she finally told him and she said see this is what happens when you hold grudges when you let memories influence your life when you let all of these things that have built up over time it just becomes this great big bag of nasty goo and you carry it around and you know what you and I have the same problem if we allow sin and if we allow our past to get in our way we're carrying that stinky nasty bag of goo around with us while we have somebody that wants to relieve us of that bad one because all of that can be put under the blood but you know what we will still carry that thing around well because the problem is is you think you hold a grudge against somebody well I'm going to get them no you know what you're carrying it on all of that weight on yourself and you know what you're not bothering them if I got a grudge against brother Dale you know what it won't bother him cuz I'm the ones holding the grudge I got the chip I got to deal with it but you know other thing is if we come to church you know we can get rid of that well because you know why wonder why are you holding on to that you think that's gonna benefit you what is it that you're holding on that you're going to get something out of but you know what the devil wants you to carry around your nasty bag of goon why because he's the one who tried to give it to you and you know what somewhere along the way you agreed to it you thought it was a good idea and people people have held onto stuff for so long and they've allowed the devil to whip them and beat them and hold them down and they stay around the press and they don't even realize that the grace of God has come to relieve you of all of them now I'm gonna get to my point sometime people will know well how's this have to do with getting rid of demons well that's what it is we're carrying around people carry around things like well they say well you know what my daddy had a temper and I got a temper and they say well this oh yeah I got you know what my grandfather had diabetes my dad's got grant got diabetes my uncle's everybody's got diabetes so you know what I got to have it too well you know what I'm gonna testify tonight you know every time they tested my blood I ain't never had diabetes so they said well you might have diabetes I was like well I don't they say well you're pre-diabetic no well you know what if I'm pre-diabetic you know what that means I don't have it that means that means that the devil is sir is trying to circle around but he ain't got here yet and you know what they tested me one time and say well it's up and it's down it's up its down but you know what they never been to anybody come along and said you got to take these little pills and you know what I mean it's all it's all the same whether it's whether it's heart disease or whatever is it that you know that you come through your family whether it's cancer whatever else you know just like brother and said do you fear cancer well do you have fear it's fear on you do you fear these things because people wonder about you know well I wonder if it's gonna happen well you know what I got I got nothing to worry about you know Lazarus was in the grave three days and God brought him out of the ground if I end up with cancer or some other thing like that you know what God's more than able to meet me because you know what I ain't in the ground yet you know it's what the Lord told me that day when I was riding in the pickup truck and I was praying for brother dick when he had had prostate cancer you know I was I so burdened about brother dick I was praying that's driving down the road you know what in the Lord totally said you know Lazarus was in the grade three days and brought him out of the ground they said you know what brother Dick's not that far along you know well praise the Lord you know what I like that you know I just I just perked me up you know why because you know we look at things so bad you know brother Ernie always tells us you know we try to pay the toll twice because we're paying trying to pay a toll on something we never got there yet you know you worry about - crossing the bridge when you get there you know people people you know just like anytime you have some little twins or some little ache or pain and everything like that well you better watch it that's heart attack that's an aneurysm yeah whatever it is you know the devil's come along and try to tell you everything in the book you know that you know that you know that person that you know you know they got sick had a headache one day next thing you know they're dead you know some people live on that more they like WebMD becomes there becomes a becomes their friend let me look when I look through this list of all of the symptoms that I have well according to WebMD I should have died three days ago but you know what my my Bible says that my God heals all diseases all all afflictions and no matter what it is because he give and you know the thing is this not only does he do it because he said that he gave me the power he gave me the power over all the powers of the enemy so the so whatever he has it he brings against me I'm the one that has to sign for it you know and if I want to come and say you know what I know get it I'm not going to accept that I'm not accepting that whatever it is you know I don't have to accept those things and you're the first thing you do is you got to come to a place where you accept that and you got to confess that then the next thing you know when the when your temper raises up which you don't supposed to have or whatever comes along then you know what then you're you know then you say that's that's contrary to the word and I don't have that then you got to pray lord help me get through this because you know what I die you know I don't have the strength to get through this and sometimes we know we know what's going to happen before it happens because sometimes situations arising you know what we know what's gonna happen before we get there and you know what and some people you know they don't pray before they get there and I don't pray before I get there sometimes and things happen and you know what we get bent out of shape and it's you know if we were if we were to pray through ahead of time lord help me get through that I don't know what to say but don't let me say anything that's gonna be contrary to the word don't let don't let me say anything that's that's gonna be a hindrance if we could say that you know the Lord can come on the scene and move but you know we have to be able to lean on him rely on him Lord let us come and and get what we have need of help us Lord because you know he give but he's instilled he's giving you the power you know all the all the things that that's happened in your life all of all of the powers of the enemy whatever he's done you know he give you the power to overcome it and then you know what the thing is is you've got to be the one to come and and and claim victory over that it's got to be you taking victory over him because if we don't you know then we just allow him to take to have the victory we need to be and you know whatever whatever you have need of you know many people you know I'm convinced you know just like brother Brent said there's so many people the problem is is they've gotten to the point where they they think then they're okay you know and the problem is you know there's so many people that they don't have the new birth they're not born again you know there's so many people that you know it's it's just well I believe the prophets message you know and you know and and I and I do this and I do that well you know what you know if you've not if you've not had a definite experience in justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know the thing is brother brother and said you can have a definite not experiencing that and and everybody's like you know everybody's well you know it's all about we're gonna speak in tongues so we're gonna run the aisle and you know people come out of Pentecost war you know what I think speaking in tongues but you know what they just blows there it just blows their experience out of the water it's like well I don't know I don't know what my experience is because you know what because I know it ain't speaking in tongues because you know I've seen people come and come the altar and you know they get slain in the spirit and fall all over the place and and you run the aisles and do all kinds of things and great things happen to him and you know and the next thing you know they get up could fight a buzzsaw and the next thing you know they don't they denied that even their brother branham was a prophet claim claim to believe this message and then they walk out on it and say brother Adams Falls and the next thing you know people run around and and women sleeping with with other women's husbands and it what's so funny is because you know what you know years ago they wouldn't even dare think of that and now they think it's okay well because it's the spirit age that we live in everything's okay just do what you want to that's the reason I get so tired of hearing people say well god knows my heart you know well I just love the Lord you know it's just what I feel down on the inside well the problem is God knows your heart but you know the problem is as peoples had their conscience seared one because God's tried to deal with people and try to point them in the right direction but you know what they just done whatever they want to the problem is you know the world's full of religious demons you know that's that's that's what makes up message churches people people don't want to believe that but you know it's religious spirits got people that do or do you know that would know it stab you still you're blind do all kinds of stuff and believe brother better to be a prophet there's there's people if you cross them if they had half a chance they take you out back and they beat you bloody and they are I believe otherwise be a prophet you know I you know I'd be I'd be ashamed to stand up I'd be like brother Billy Paul said that time when he's down there in the pool hall and they said hey this is brother this is this is Reverend branham's boy hey guy come here Reverend Bridals boy down here in the pool hall shooting po-han Oh only ungodly people down here and he said no sir he said Reverend Branham wouldn't have a son like me you know I'd be ashamed to go around and talk to some people because yeah and you try to live that kind of life you know the thing is is people you know and people wondering why the churches are in the condition they're in why because this is what was supposed to take place what did what did brother bet him say he said he said those fallen angel said came he said what they do they come to the message this he said he said fallen angels where he said Luther what was in Luther's day the fallen angels Wesley the Pentecost was all messed up why because those fallen angels came in why because they had to come in and and combat and risk and fight against the Spirit of God that was moving some one because he brought that spirit to a good rebel against them but what one came in our day what does that are they won because it's the same spirit he's come to fight against you and you know and not only that we got people you got people in this message they wouldn't they wouldn't hurt a fly they're just good moral people man they're wonderful but you know the problem is is you can't get them to see that they're not born again they they they they live a good justified life a good sanctified life but you know what they born again they born again but you know what they live a great moral life you can't put a finger on their life and you know what you know those people oh I believe brother and I love all that all that he loved and all that loves him be there we enter one that's a wonderful statement and it's what brother Branham said that's what the angel the Lord told him but you know what didn't change the fact that you got to be born amen [Applause] and you know what sometimes sometimes I think you know years ago people used to have means even brother branham talked about in the message why is the why is this the holy you know what was the holy ghost skin for what is the holy ghost you know he said we're opening the tabernacle he said if you don't want to come during this time and pray for people that are seeking the Holy Ghost nowadays if you talk about siccing the Holy Ghost in the message they want to kick you out if you get up and say well you know what it takes three processes there's three steps of grace that it takes to get born again it's justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and some people want to throw you out how in the world can you preach those three brother Branham said it was all the way up until I think it was November of 1965 the latter or October of 65 the last time brother brother dogs about it it's like oh well he changed it after the seals well he didn't changing my message can't change the Bible but you know the thing is is people want to throw yeah well you know hey you know it's just it's just receiving the Holy Ghost well you know the problem is a lot of people have received the Holy Ghost they've got an anointing they've got anointed but you know what those spirits are still there those same religious spirits are still there still binding the people but it takes the Holy Ghost he takes a dying out it takes well because you a lot of people that they didn't they've gotten away from that you know we don't we don't need we don't need laying before God but I think I was brother down talking about was it buddy Robinson he was telling about the other day you know he'd done it got down in the cornfield or whatever he said Lord he said I'm gonna be right here till I get to Holy Ghost be right here be a back of bones and gonna be right here why because people don't get that serious with God people don't want to get to that place you know there was a man one time they told me that he said I got down you know I'm just I'm just gonna stay home and I'm on prey and he said I'm not gonna do nothing now gonna eat and do nothing he said until the Lord comes speak to me Lord I want the Holy Ghost I want to know what the new birth is I want it so bad he said I'm gonna stay right here till I got it he said I ain't going to sleep hang onto it and you know what the Lord come and spoke to him he said the Lord come to him you know why because he got serious you know many times we get wrapped up in so many other things but you know we got to get to the place where we're we sell everything out we don't worry about nothing else is an important center life until we hear from God and then if we can get to that place then you know what then we can hear from God then he can come on the scene but you know that's what it takes it takes the Holy Ghost because you know the Jesus in jesus said and that day people will come to me and say Lord Lord did we cast out Devils in your name did we do all these great wonderful mighty things in your name and he said depart from me because I didn't know you you know what you can you can heaven you can be anointed of the Holy Ghost and do great things but you know what that ain't the new birth that ain't that ain't where you need to be but you know some people they've gotten to the place where you know they've got it all figured out in their mind and if you try even when the Holy Ghost comes and tries to deal with them you know what they've already they've already been sealed off they've already been seared they're conscious that God can't even speak to them anymore and the thing is is have we got to that exact same place where God can speak to us you know and find out exactly where we are and it takes going beyond just the new birth but you know because there's there's a higher Heights and God besides getting past the new birth but you know what if you hadn't got that far then that's where you need to be because you know what the thing is is if you have them if you have the new birth inside of you then he the spirit of truth comes and he said he will lead you and guide you into all truth he's going to bring you to all truth and you know what the thing is is the one thing is is whatever Satan says is not the truth you know the thing is is just like brother I've said you know the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's that dove he's a dove and he comes and he lands on you but he said you've got to have the right nature the lamb only come I'm sorry the Dove only comes to the lamb he said if we don't have a lamb nature than the doves not coming he said when we get beyond that he said then he flies away and he waits for us to get back to that lamb nature he said so the Holy Ghost can come back I think the thing is is we need to just like he said you got to be sensitive to the Holy Ghost because he said he is a gentleman and see the thing is is do we get so sensitive in our in our spiritual walk that we know what's going to take place can we can we just because sometimes we get so desensitized to things in life that we miss what God is trying to tell us and if we can if we get to that place see then you can cast the devil out well cause he's got no place to stay you know like I was telling about having the prayer lines you know people what people say well you know they what they want to have a prayer line and they won't they want to cast out Devils you know the thing is is then you don't cast them out the people do there's no preacher going to cast them out the preacher can come and pray for you and the Spirit of the Lord can come down so you can cast him out you've got to be the one that does it and that you come and they come they can pray and the Spirit of God because everybody binds together that you can cast him out you've got to be the one to speak the word for him to leave see there's no there's no one person that you know that well I I got to wait for brother Dale to pray and then when brother Dale speaks the word then the Devils gonna leave me well you know what the devil's gonna stay right there because you've got to be the one you've got to speak it because just like just like he was some of the people in the the man that fell over his feet you know that had that spirit you know that spirit never would leaving hey he was so bound to that thing he was so connected that he couldn't get rid of it but that's the same thing with you and I we've got to get to the pole where we can get you know let the Holy Spirit come whatever whatever you whatever you're fighting whatever you're battling the thing is is he's here to meet your need hey Sarah he's here to show you that you're equipped for it because you know well the thing is is like you said we gotta have faith to operate that power the power is given to us the way that we have the power is ours the thing is is you got to have the faith to operate it to believe to make it work you love the Lord tonight Amen god bless you now let's all stand amen just got to stand fortified behind the word the word has been given to us God's called us to this place the thing is is now we got to stand there take what God has given to us and claim it god I want I want what you got for me I want I want to be what you have me to be all right but just like brother Jill always says you know you can't talk the devil's language and you know you can't you can't dwell on the things that are contrary to the word because you know that's what the devil wants you to do you know people think you know certain things happen you know just like like at work with they've had they've had some changes at work and bosses and all kind you know different things changing and everybody's like well this ain't gonna be good this ain't gonna be good it's terrible I don't know what I'm gonna do and they just and everybody gets all worked up about all this stuff is like well you know what the Lord knew about it before it ever happened and you know what no matter no matter how much they you know they bring my way you know what I you know what where the devil does you know it happens whether it's good or bad you know what I'm just gonna praise the Lord and go on but sometimes we get we get so wrapped up on these things and you know the you have you have family members and you know whatever whatever it is going in on in their life you'll have family members and you know they come along and they've got this problem and that problem they won't drag you in on it and you know your children and and all these things you know they they're there and you know that's just the way the devil works that he's gonna try to stir things up but you know the thing is is is if we have the token if the token has been given to us if we're sealed then you know what the thing is we can apply the token to them and you know the thing is is when that when that token has been applied then the thing is it's time for us to take our hands off it we just need to leave it alone let God move and so well you know lord I give it to you you know what I'm done you know and everything well this happens or that happens you know what Lord you know if if it if it's your will and that's and that's what it takes to get them then just give them a double portion egg and you know and sometimes that's the hardest thing to do but you know sometimes sometimes you know that's what God wants us to do to realize you know I'm in control and if we understand God's in control then you know what we can take our hands off it and say Lord just move just like that just like that lady it was read around talks about I think it was in letting off the pressure you're talking about that young that lady looks so young had grown sons and you know he couldn't leave she was that old and say well you know when I got say years ago Lord said that he'd take care everything and so you know I've realized that if the Lord couldn't take care of it I serve the couldn't take care of it so there what no need of me of worrying about it and that's the thing they do not worry about it but you know what don't give a place to the devil right find it wear it wherever is in the word whatever it is and find and find your answer and then you take that and you fortify yourself behind the word and let the devil flee because he said if you resist the devil you flee from you Amen god bless you brother sing a song all in him amen the mighty God is Jesus everlasting
