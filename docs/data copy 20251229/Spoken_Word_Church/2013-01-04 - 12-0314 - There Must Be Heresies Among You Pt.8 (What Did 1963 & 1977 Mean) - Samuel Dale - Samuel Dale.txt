========================================

man i open the eyes of my heart shining is foreign holy turn where we've been reading in first corinthians 11 and first peter three and remember the lord willing this come in saturday 3 30 will be the fellowship meeting in brother gerald hughes will be here preaching not only the fellowship meeting but for the rest of the weekend so remember that that he will the lord will bless him and everything and now terrorists had already announced about the the uh easter time down it and there we always have there at the chicken house in guildsville and just remember that we'll be having the bible study on that night too so coming it's on general questions so it'll be good to uh you know just take that away so remember that remember all of the announcements the lord willingness coming wednesday night coming wednesday night brother richard wilson will be here with us so just pray that the lord would bless him uh wade and and johnny took me down today and walked me around on deer hunt land hoping that they would be able to shorten the message down tonight you know trying to wear me out for about three hours of fast walking but i can always sit down you know and not have any problems but we will not try not to be too long now i want to try to end up tonight if i can with the uh talking of the doctrines of the message and things and if you have anything that you've encountered you've heard of doctrines that are going around because there are new ones every day right you know that it's appearing every day among the message and what i've covered is nothing like uh all of the doctrines but you know just trying to cover major ones and but if you know of one and you want to want it to be discussed just give me a note we'll see what we can do and if i tell you i don't know then that's the best way to tell you know that that would be the answer that we do brother george quinn sent us a notice for us to pray about him and his journeys he's now in thailand and he will be going into vietnam and laos in the next coming week so he asked for us to remember him but the lord would bless him and during all of that time give him a safe journey all right amen any other announcements that need to be made okay father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us now without understanding because the prophet of god said questions makes a strong church and when doctrines comes among people then as we read in your word there must need to be heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest so it's for our benefit that you allow these things to come among us because that way we will dig down and search out the truth in that way then we can know the truth we love you and we thank you just come on the scene tonight and be with each and every one of us bless the sick among us and remember the sick around the country the people that have requested prayer and things we ask you to be with each one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen we've been on this scripture but we'll try to get through tonight and you know like i said if there's anything that you have and you want to be covered just give me a question and we'll try to um to get started on that okay uh first corinthians what am i in my second corinthians 18 19 okay i'm going to get into chapter 11. i'm going i still got my bible set where we had the communion okay i'm not going my marker i'm going the other way but i have a marker where the communion was at okay 11 okay 18. well first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you all right it must be in other words it'll be there so you know we can look forward to things happening but we don't look forward to uh it coming that away but we know it will come because it is spoken in the word of god all right first peter 3 verse 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear that's right amen you may be seated over that is blessing to the reading of the word now on these doctrines i've tried to do the best that i could and i will try to end tonight with these couple of thoughts and uh as i've said to each one of them i try to base my answer up on the basis of what i have heard or know of and doing the best that i can of that and also the number two part of it is to always know that there are many different versions of these doctrines all right you you go and just say two souls well there's all kind of versions that goes with that and you know that these this group don't even agree with that group of the same thing but yet linking it to the same doctrinal point you know but you know so i'm just doing the best i can to answer to to this point now so tonight what we're going to cover we've already covered uh two souls two lords river jordan seven thunder virtues no holy ghost doctrine did brother brown come to john patlas uh do we believe right around was deity then we looked for another prophet to come would get adam injected seed into eve to save her like the tent doctrines and the things we've covered these and the reason i bring those out is if somebody just listens the message tonight then they can back up and and review and and listen to some of the things to the comments and i'm not the one with all of the answers you know my definition of a smart person is not one who has all the answers because their mind is so full until they got a lot of problems it's the person who knows where to go get the answer right that's the smart person all right so that's what we try to be in that form you know all right now there was a doctrine started back that was a matter of fact when we came into the message in 67 there um you know there was a doctrine around the people of the message that said redemption was over in 1963 that when the lamb left the mercy seat come and you know took the book and revealed the word of god to the prophet that redemption was over and uh you know that was a big thing and i'm sure people still to till today believe it that way you know they still believe that it was over and all like that but what i want to do tonight is you know i'm not going to argue with anybody about it especially like with redemption over because it's like i told the people then i said well according to my bible redemption was over for the foundational world and then you're coming down here telling me it was over in a 63 or over in here you know and i said uh just go on because see and at that time what was the odd part of it was i was having to argue with people about the basis of where the redemption was over in 63 and really was not born again at that time because it was 69 before i received the baptism of the holy ghost well then in 1969 they couldn't argue with me no more i wouldn't even listen to them i didn't listen too much before they right but i surely wouldn't listen after i received the baptism of the holy ghost and i had a personal experience right or something and you got a personal experience it's kind of like you walk out in your your front yard you know and and you look out there and there's an elephant in your yard well you go back in the house and you tell your wife said honey there's an elephant in the yard she says you're crazy ain't no elephants in this part of the country and i don't care whether one in this part of the country or where whatever it is everyone's standing out in the yard come on i'll show it to you you know so then that way you have something that you can link it all back to and then that way nobody can argue with you about it they just count you a nut and forget it and see that's what i said i'm not gonna spend much time on the basis of that i'm just going to make a few points why would brother brown give altar calls after 63 if there was no possibility of redemption that's right amen all right now you're making him a false prophet that's right you know by your your doctrine in other words you're making him a man that doesn't know anything and that's what a lot of people is trying to do today you know is to say brother ryan was wrong on this and brother ryan was wrong on that you know and uh you know they say the son of man this was one of the doctrines that the son of man came in 63 to straighten brother branham out well now i would invite you to go back into the message before 63 and you'll see that brother branham was in the office part of the son of man because he was having that son of man ministry now i know that it developed in higher form yes we agree but he already had the sign of the son of man that's right right right before the seals broke before the the 63 that people would all be talking about and seeing the son of man come to straighten the prophet out now if he didn't have it right who was it in the world to be able to come see those doctrines are brought by people that really in a background point in their mind and eventually they'll tell you what they're thinking and they'll run it back to where brother so-and-so was able to straighten out the profit well see then you're they're putting it on the basis of building themselves into the realm you know trying to be the son of man you know and all the different things like that so but that's this part beside the point my point's always been one thing it's damaging to tell young converts to it a message wouldn't it be something you're you're trying to convert somebody to the message wouldn't that be a situation you know i mean you're talking to somebody about the message and you say uh would you say 463 but they don't even talk to you you know because you can't be saved now i mean that's what you'd have to tell them but wouldn't that be nice you know how would you like somebody to slap you in the face with that right when you first heard of this message well i wish you could be saved but you can't because redemption was over the prophet of god said don't you say those things that's right should we give older calls should we you know should we have uh missionary work and that he said why would you get the wrong idea about what i'm saying right well the lamb left the mercy seat the lamb left the mercy seat before the foundation of the world according to the bible but see this you know seventh seal brother said we're standing here watching what took place in glory 2 000 years ago why don't people quote those things but see it won't fit in their doctrine all right but now the main issue that i want to cover with you is what happened in 1963 and then we have time we'll get to the 1977. what happened there everybody want to argue about this and argue about that you know and see it was saying that the rapture would have to come by at least somewhere in 63 uh because the prophet would say that the end of the world will come by 1977. so they got to get a three and a half year period of tribulation to the jews to come in so they would say it had to take place in 63 and it's like i told you this brother called me and he said uh what do you think that was before the 63 before the easter sunday or good friday before good friday on 1963. he said what do you think about this uh rapture coming you know about easter sunday there in 63 you know and uh i said well i hope so he said well you just don't sound like you believed it i said well i'm just honest i just you know i'm just saying that if it comes praise the lord if it don't i'm going to be ready he said well they do have it figured out that they could be 40 more days in there because of the bible i said now you sound like you don't believe he's coming in 63. so you know people don't like me i'm sorry but why not just be plain and at least you don't have to worry about it that's right now it's on record here in this church and we'll get back to it after a while that i preached in 1974 that we could go past the year 2026 and not tear up what the prophet of god had to say about it and his own record has been there ever since but i wasn't looking for it to last that long no i was wanting it to come in a hurry but i was just saying what could take place yeah so then let's just get down to it you know and see that what is the mayan calendar supposed to run out this year you know everybody is i'll give you a little key you know that and i'm not making no doctor and i'm just making a statement in 19 and 16 what was that i just checked this out to find out in that you know a tape in louisiana in 1962 which was 11 27 62. brother branham said that that was the coming of the jubilee now i know he mentions jubilee of coming up like 1906 in 1956 all right but he said the holy ghost fell in louisiana in 1962. well now you just add 50 to that and where are we at anybody counting that feist i'm not making a doctrine i'm just telling you what what's there this is 2012. according to my calculations if you added to 62 1962 you had 50 that bring you out to 2012. is that right you know i'm not making a doctor and i'm just saying that people don't even know how to count a lot of times let alone study it in a realm but see i'm sure that probably somebody's thought of that and beginning to break and in no way am i saying it i'm looking for the coming of the lord any moment that's right even billy graham said i go to bed at night looking for him to come he said if he don't come i get up looking for him to come now if that man could have that much how much more should you and i yeah all right now let me just say this to you about redemption being over in 63. run around let's pull that one up go ahead brother anderson let's pull that one up this was 1963 720 8 which is after which is christ the mr god revealed after the opening of the seal and look what he says i don't say they're going to be eight saved now don't get that all wrong i never said that i don't know how many is be going to be saved in that that that's the that last moment to rapture the little bride it'll be a small group then frustrated again 1963 now after the opening of the seals he's saying that he don't know how he's going to be saved and he puts it to rapture but what what is matter with people's minds and i'll get off of this you mean you you've got children born and they're coming up and they're getting the age of accountability well john i'm sorry redemption's over 63 you can't be saved now isn't that some more gospel well that's really enthusiastic isn't it you could really get overjoyed by yeah yeah i like what you said in the old testament when a man's prophecy and prediction didn't come to pass you ought to be killed right and in no way did i say that it had to be i've even extended it now that we can go to the year 2050 or 2000 or 3050. and i'll get to that in a minute and just tell you why i believe it that way you say well let me be on here that'd but it's like i told you about the brother you know he went and preached it redemption was over in 63 nobody couldn't be saved after then he went back one year later never sister in the church even the pastor's wife had either had a baby or was pregnant he had a quick revelation you know he said you'd be saved because you've seen your parents pretty good that's even better in the catholic church yeah at least they make you want to do something you know but now look church listen let's get down to sensible things what took place in 1963 right they say that was the coming of the lord now brother branham said on the seventh seal quoting he said it's gone from you or maybe it might be questions and answers on it right you know he says it's gone from you and there's no way of you knowing it right but he said right around the coming of the lord now if you need that quote i'd be glad to get it for you he had no thoughts or anything in his mind of thinking as i said if he was given altar called after he believed redemption was over then that'd make him a false prophet because he'd be giving false hope to people of salvation see it just don't make sense but see everybody says well the lord came there's a lot of doctrines among the people of the message that the son of man came uh the lord came you know and all like that and i agree to some of what said because the son of man did step into his ministry right but like i said he had the sign of the son of man way before 60 before the opening of the seals right all right now you were to consider that point but now listen brother around's message didn't begin until 1963. it was not the years of preparation that he had to do the work of restoration the faith of the fathers had to be restored to the church or at least the gospel of the faith of the father before the seals could break all right that's just like when i get to it down there while then people throw it up to you about the 70 weeks of daniel brother rounds when it said it in the 70 weeks of daniel he said if you don't understand these daniel stephanie which you can't understand the seal now that's what he said but you don't hear that i mean all that was when he didn't understand and it's just like lord told me one time you know he said yeah we islamics we believe the bible's right in some places i said yeah in the places that you want to agree with right but before you don't want to agree with it you don't believe that's the truth right then because that's that's just the way it goes but now see you get into it so what happened in 1963 the only person in the world who knew about the coming of the lord in 1963 was brought around amen now i mean how could it be anybody else right if he was the prophet you would have to come to him first amen now but the only way we can know the coming of the lord exists is for the coming of the lord to be an experience in our own lives so who had the experience back then that the prophet had when he says it's gone from you how can you claim an experience or something are we like the bad disease most of you would never know that and think about it but i tried to explain it over and over i walked there they said we got the holy ghost and you asked them how and they said cause they come over to the pentecost you know then come on that pentecostal i got it well where's your experience of it oh i just believe i i just accepted by faith i accepted my faith and he come on the deaf pentecost well where's that in the experience of a new birth right that's not an experience of a new birth that's right that's an intellectual conception right that's what people are doing they're saying that that god came and said the lord came in 63 but when we have that experience that happened to the prophet in 63 then we can say the lord has come he then we'll say like the brother said blessed are they that believe the lord has come in this right what in our own experience one of the big man in the message said the third pool is for brother branham and the lord jesus and not for us well according to my memory brother brown said that the third pull was for the bride and the church and to the totally lost now that's my understanding if you need that quote be glad to find it for you which is the what took place in 63 sure god came to the prophet that was through the opening of the word that's through the those seals being broke but it was broke to the prophet not to you and i we wouldn't even most of us saved at that time or whatever right but see we claimed like i said we say like the baptist will i got it you asked most people where where they are in the pyramid and what they say oh we're right here oh this is the lady ocean age and the prophet of elijah they say we right here in this brotherly kindness how can you be there unless you birthed up to that right that's all i want to explain but you see that's where we just take something but the bible says no man can call jesus of christ what except it be by the holy ghost the prophet of god said by the baptism of the holy ghost is the only way you can say that jesus is the cry other than that you're just blipping what somebody says you're just quoting somebody else well the seals broke me because he broke the prophet now you and he read the book i don't need to read the book they broke cross the prophet broken i know see i know what people don't like me i understand that right but i have to be honest to you as a church amen that's right you know to tell you what i believe in a way the reason i believe it that's right i should be ready to give a reason to hold this within you see if you believe the lord coming 63 and he's never come to you that's just lip service that's just saying what somebody else says when god has broken their seals to you then you can say the seals are broke until then it was just broke to the prophet right well we don't have to understand them things we we're just simple yeah you're simple all right simply idiots yep right that would be nice wouldn't it you know i always have which there would have been three gods huh you don't get my eyebrows over there because i might be able to pray to one of the three and get by you know i might get one of them on my side but that will work so we don't believe in three but just because that god came to the prophet didn't make god come into me and you right god comes to you and me by revelation god uses the prophet right now the only way it can come to you and i is by way of the prophet amen all right i found by being all about two or three weeks now that you ain't helped my throat at all saying don't worry about it never have and i thought when i would clear it up a little bit maybe i'll get better and i kind of believe it by not using it it got worse you know anything else but that's okay don't worry about it i whisper but now do you see what i'm talking about see in 1963 was a great thing that was when god came to the prophet that's right and by that coming of the prophet he can come to you and i because he could tell us what the bible says that's right right he can't reveal it to us right but he's not the revealer holy ghost the only revealer of the woman that's right but he could come and tell us what the word says and tell us these things all right we have the ability now to talk about the coming of the lord right whereas we didn't even have it back in organized religion he didn't have anybody talked about it at all they spoke a little bit of a tribulation coming a little bit of the end of the world they know what it was something happened this way but see then the prophet began to speak and bring forth the scriptures and time together and you could see right there but you see if you if you say that that he come to brother branham without a personal experience then run around and becomes your god right come on well i got a quote where he says he's my lord yeah i got one where he said if you make him jesus christ you'd be better off to make him man you make an antichrist right that's right let's see when are we going to get down to all of the messages we see as i said a moment ago now let me just get this point that rhetoric's message when he came into the world he had to do a work of restoration because we had gotten so far away from the faith of the fathers right it took him 30-something years this is a quote from him now 30-something years to be able to preach the stature of a perfect man took bread around 30-something years right to be able to preach it all right well if it took him that long then you know something was wrong with him or rush one and i know he want wrong lunch but maybe he didn't see it i'm like on the statue of prayer man he said i saw with this tied together just the other day out in the woods but people don't want to listen to those things you know but follow what i'm talking about now look at the next quote because i just put these in the coming he said well what what right are you saying that brother and his message just begun in this opening of the seals because that's what he said now i can find you a lot more than this but go to the rapture message is one real good one listen to it and you'll hear him making almost these statements but look what he says he's coming down to the point the admission to be revealed in the last days when the seven angels seventh angels message when not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to stay on his message right see not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries will be revealed and there they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that now his message begun because the others were the restoration the faith of the fathers was what the apostles taught you agree that's what they call that was the faith of the father that was in the bible so when brother brown came to in his message all of that years of preparation got him ready and sure the opening of the word brought god to the prophet amen it brought god to the prophet and he brought his own message go read the titles of the messages after the seals broke just take one of those little index books and just sit down and go in 63 after the symbol and just read the titles of the sermons across the mystery god revealed who is this melchizedek future home marriage and divorce the token this day this scripture is fulfilled everything goes into eternal life amen why because it was the message we'll get back to it a little bit because he came on the 49th he came into seven church ages that's right to bring the message to you and i that to worthy we would be able to receive the truth in this day would you just say that that i know it because brother brown said it that's saying what somebody else says right i told you before that you know the brother in this message he told me and two more brothers he said i think y'all got the holy ghost one night well i know i didn't get it but you know those two until they left here declared they believe they had it because that he said they had it well i'm hearing some quotes from brother around him where he said people had the baptism and hold up but there's some arguments about some of the things of some of the people he said right you know what brother around said billy graham had the bad feeling or robert said the baptism went on was that of thus saith the lord from a prophet or was that a thought or what was it and just remember you have the baptism in the holy ghost every day of your life when you're spirit and still be lost what was he talking about well i want him to tell me i got the holy ghost that's good i don't know i wish he'd come tonight and just stand here and point out and have all of us tell all of us we didn't have it we could get down and see that'd be good all right but i i never ever wear god done it like that have you could that put your dependence upon a man my dependence upon jesus christ amen jesus christ was the message that came to the prophet turned 63 the fullness of the word to bring to you and i and without that they would have never been a rapture right all right what are we going to say as i said about the baptist i've got it just because it come on the day of pentecost when it comes to the lord coming 63 brother you don't believe that yeah to the prophet i believe that to the prophet i don't believe you come to me and you right and i don't believe he's here just to me and you just because that you could say the prophets you know he come to the prophet we've got to have the revelation of the message it's not willing why don't we just take drunk and be married and go home and forget the whole time right but you see my dependence is upon the revelation of jesus christ amen you didn't say the revelation of william branham and you were earth it's in revelation of jesus christ in a new birth amen that's right this is the birth of the word i believe this message fine for the prophet just said is wonderful but i want it revealed to me amen just because he said jesus was god all right that didn't make me to understand it but we thought that was the baptist church come on baptist doctrine is one god i come from there i don't have to worry about it that was their doctrine but it was god in three persons blessed trinity coequal co-eternal they'll argue to death about one god then turn around and tear down the scriptures to try and prove a trinity yeah but then you know it's not a revelation right you know it's not right see but brother dallas it's the knowledge of it will paul run into a bunch of people that said one day when they had a good knowledge of jesus and he said have you received the holy ghost right since you've got all this head knowledge right right since you believed is that what he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe right that's why i always encourage you to seek the baptism with the holy ghost amen i've always said it and i always taught it i'd rather all of my life be seeking god to come at the end of it and tell me i had it all alone right then they're not sick of it all and come down the end of it he said because of your stubbornness you wouldn't seek me brother said they cried out for a refilling of the holy ghost in the book of acts any kind right maybe the reason we don't get a lot of things is because we don't cry out for it maybe we're not seeking god's heart treatment but donny and wade and i were talking today going down about this video that brother joe made for me about training a horse for my love or by fear and the man made a good statement in there he said the biggest portion of the people of the religious world you know christians we serve god out of fear well is that not what the prophet said most everybody serves god afraid of going to hell very few people serve god because of love right that's right do you love him enough that he sent you to hell you'd love me that's right that's the difference do you love him enough that if he sent you to hell you'd love me right yeah that's a lot of difference see fear will bind you to a set of rules and it's just what i told them i said don't understand i don't understand a human being people that are governed by fear will lay out a church just any time but if they're governed by love they can't wait until the door's over to get here amen amen is that enough so which one are we governed by fear or love you're not going to die and go to hell because you missed one service but it could be the reason you missed that one service might make you dangle to hell come on you say well they don't make no difference i don't have to go to church every service that idea right there in your mind is a false doctrine that's right and that's the devil talking and he's sure not the holy ghost because brother brown said the holy ghost in your heart he said you can't wait until the door's open that's right come on come on do we believe the prophet amen well brother dale you don't understand my problem huh i understand all of our problems that's a problem that's why i stay awake a lot at night and pray a lot as i understand all of our problems because i'm one of them look at all of that okay see people don't think i preach against this any other but they don't hear me when i just inject something and back away and go on because what good is it gonna do you can beat people all you want to you take a whip and hit a horse and beat it so much of the turn walk right straight to you lay his head on you but like brother donnie says for the rest of his life he'll try to wait to a change that he can get brother brown yet never heard him make the statement and you that never mute welcome you you don't know what an order he's talking about but he said i'm you will work for you all of his life to get you kick in the head because that memory is still there we used to have one that you could hook him up just change you hook up one side you better walk around that mule to the other side into a cup that's because you didn't he was going to get kicked he is just like he sounds asleep but you move that arm in the wrong place and he kicked the daylights out she's serving him by fear of love which one is it okay i enjoyed what the brother had to say about it that's what he was saying about training a horse you know because i could see it in my own christian life you want to do it joel would make you a copy of it and you can look at it all right now so everybody understand what i'm saying i believe god came to the prophet in 1963 amen i believe redemption was over for the foundational world but i hate to think that i could be able to raise a family and i have no hopes of redemption for them because of some silly idea that i had in my mind that's where we're going to get down to 77. see people say i don't make no predictions now i just said what the prophet said where are they now we're certainly 19 and 1977 or quite a while right and i happen to know the brother where we first started the church i asked him the per question because it approached me with it about the 10th vision and i answered the question and i said what are you going to do with weekly 77. he said i'll get out of the message then he saw he's in front of his congregation he backed up and he said no i'd say we misunderstood the problem that's okay i gave him medicine without anyone didn't do it but a lot of people turned their books in sent them back and left the message but the biggest portion of the people just that went right on you agree right i mean there's more following this message today never happened that's millions like a million in africa it's man's following this message now what happened to 77 well we don't understand that i agree i see you that's why you wouldn't talk about it but you see people don't want what brother branham had to say they want what they think he said like one brother was telling me you know about the brother and said what not see that what would it the ten commandments or something would not watch it well i know where he told him said you were going to watch the movie will be sodom if you want to know what the world is like but you see the computer has done a good job of quieting people's minds but you know what it had never changed anybody that had that doctrine because they knew they oh they just missed it in the computer they didn't hear what i heard i heard the prophet saying i was sitting there when he said it that's what was told me when i come in the message said you can't understand the prophet unless you was there to see his mannerism the way he spoke and his arms moving in his doings and his mouth was shaped a certain way where he could say this word oh that's wild and good folks but you know what i know i'm a sarcastic kind of a guy and i know that i'm arrogant but i'm playing where's all of this junk that's running around now that was back there in the in the 60s and the 70s and even in the 80s they ought to go back to the denominations right because they're already formed what in this life well we don't want to be deceived my one brother told me he told me he said i'm planting trees you know when that was 1977. he said i'm planting trees to get that spirit off of me i thought you supposed to repent i didn't know planting trees and i'm not making light of him but i thought planting trees didn't get rid of spirits i thought repentance got rid of spirits all right i know what the man meant he had an idea that we were going to get out of here and he didn't want no trees but at his own wedding he's going to plant some trees you know because he didn't understand that's it but like i said i preached it there in 1974 and i've had the opportunity to preach that in one other church i preached a little bit in one church about it but not much but i have a call to one church to preach on that but you see i can stand here today and say 1974 and i got to take back here you pull it listen to it that we could pass the year 2000 we could pass the year 2026 or more most of you that are here heard those messages took brother dean a long time to be able to break it down from real to real the cassettes then we had to get from that down to the mp3 or cds but what did happen like i said something wonderful happened in 1963 right amen you and i are linked to 1963 on the basis that god came to the prophet appeared to him and reveal the word to him amen that's a wonderful thing all of this about river jordan you know brother brown said that on the river jordan that was the greatest experience of all in the bible outside of this end time they don't put that one on there because it was a great thing that's when god came down and join themselves surely in the fullness of the godhead bodily amen amen tell him wait i've read over this in samuel reading samuel sometimes and when you come over with it that saul was going to be anointed and samuel told him he would be anointed and that god would change him to another man it's in the bible you won't take time to go back in there and find it read it to you since you'll change you to another man changed him to another heart when the anointing came on saul it changed him right and the baptist when the holy ghost come on me and you and they changed us come on right come on oh i got the baptism in holy ghost but not a change in my life well he was something wrong right but listen 63 was a wonderful thing 97 was a wonderful thing amen something took place in 1977 it was wonderful nothing calls it i stood back there before then and said it could pass and i didn't make predictions i was reading and showing it from the bible i've heard sermons and you have to that a prediction by prophet is greater than all we could do and i agree that's probably right i'd rather have run around's predictions and all the mind your dust saith the lords if it ain't thus saith the lord but i'd rather have one thus saith the lord over brother brown's predictions okay now you see how blunt i am because a prediction is not a prophecy we're going to read that and i've heard sermons in a prediction with the thus saith the lord will show it to me in the bible but let's read some of the things brother randle had to say see people believe that that as i said they believe that the world the the rapture would have to come in 63 because the end of the world would have to be by 1977. all right and see them that way that's been in man's mind but let's read some of the things brother brown have to say about 77 and i'll be glad for you to find me anything else other than the ones i got on here you know i mean i'll be glad for you to find me anything else he said about 1977 and i would be glad to bring it here and read it because i run it as far as i could on the computer and all that i had in my own computer you know my own concordance of the rope but look what he says look at go back and go to number one on the notes now look what the prophet of god had to say you have to write it all up all right now you remember and i'll give you them in just a minute right around had seven visions and i'll give you between two quotes the seven visions that he had all right and according to the seven visions then he predicts so we the last one was the united states being smoldered over burning over and different things so look what he said this is the message uh contending condemnation by representation 1960 1113 paragraph 35 all right now i see the united states as one smoldering burnt over place it will be the end then i've got it for instance i predict that this will take place now remember the lord that's what the lord showed now if i don't type i'm reading it exactly like he got it in there because it said now the lord in e and he said a word they couldn't make out so they put in e then he stuttered probably is what he's doing or something but he says that's what the lord showed now the lord showed seven visions right okay see everybody wants to bring it on down here and say the lord showed him it was 1977. now let's just read and see if the lord showed him it was 77 the lord showed him the vision we have no trouble with that right that's right nobody has any trouble god showed himself a division that's right all right so look what he said i predicted this that's what the lord showed me but i predict this will take place between before 1977. upon this prediction i base because of the unrushing slaughter that's coming now i faced that it was moving how long it'll take till this nation meets his place right so what does he say he predicts he predicted by 1977. they go to the next one this is a message conference 1960 1125 e7 and he's telling the vision of those americans smoldering over and what and down beneath there i said not in the trance i want you not in the trance he's stipulating what's taking place but i predict remember this i guess this is take two i predict that these things will take place between now 1933 and 1977 which will give us 17 years more years if my prediction strikes right now there was seven things spoke of that would happen five of them have already happened there's two left to take place it'll be that way that's in the name of the lord it shall be that way did i miss reading where did i miss reading which will give us 16 more years let me really know it never need there i said not in the trance but i predict remember this i guess this is take two i predict that these things will take place between now 1933-1977 which will give us 17 more years if my for 16 more years if my prediction strikes right okay i said 17. all right correcting me that's fine okay go to the next one but watch all of these now everyone's got then right okay so now this is the ephesian church age which is church age book 19 no excuse me church age series 1960 1205 ephesians 8 paragraph 46. look what he said he's telling you which age when they started and where they end where they start where they end and all that coming through the dark ages and coming down and telling you the lutheran age and the ancient philadelphian aids western age and it lasted till 1906 and at 1906 the lady was seeing church age set in and i don't know where it'll end window end but i predict it'll be done by 1977. i predict not the lord told me but i predict it according to a vision that was showed me some years ago that five of those things has out of the seven has already taken place about all right now go to the next one that was this is the lady of sin this is the church age series books now when it's got a date on this it's the books individually right but it doesn't have it it'll be church edge book okay so in 1960 12 11 e we believe that the legacy in church started in 18 1906. i predict now remember predict especially you listening at the tape i don't say it will be but predict that it will end by 1977 that the church will go completely into apostasy and she'll be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming or the rapture of christ might come any time now i could miss that a year now what i could miss it 20 years i could miss it a hundred years okay i don't know where it but i just predict that according to a vision he showed me and taking the time the way it's progressing i say it'll be some time between 1933 and 77 at at least this great nation is going to strike a war that's going to blow it to be it's see now that's pretty close it's awful close and i could be wrong i'm predicting everybody understand say amen if you do congregation says amen now all right so then predictions predictions okay i'm going to try to do these with two two parts here where somebody doesn't have it on tape all right so go ahead brother joe pull up number five and i'm gonna read some in between it off of this the churchx book to show you and i'll just sketch read it to give you the visions somebody on the tape somewhere out there might not know anything's ever happened on any point you know do it but look he says the legacy and age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps 1906 how long it lies that a servant of god who has multiple who has had multitude of visions of which none have ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977. if you will pardon a personal note here i base this prediction on seven continuous visions that came to me one sunday morning in 19 in june 1933. the lord jesus spoke and said the coming of the lord is drawing not all right and he said it's seven major things all right now if you'll keep on reading that's taken from page 321 of the church age book all right church age book 321 all right you keep on reading and it gives the seven things the seven things was first was the vision was that mussolini would invade ethiopia that's number one all right now i'm giving you off here so you can have this if you want the next vision told number two all right we're told that australia that an australian by the name of adolf hitler would rise up a dictator over germany number three it was a vision of the realm of political polit world politics it showed me there would be three great ism fantasism nazism communism the first two would be swallowed up in the third all right now number four the vision showed the great advances in science that would come to that would come after the second world war it headed up in a vision of a plastic bubble car you know and driving itself and things like that now there's not up here for you to read it off i'm giving you these coming down number five it had to do with a moral problem of her age certainly mostly around women it showed how women would do things and how they'd undress themselves that that was uh take men's clothing that's number five number six was a was the fact that they would then in the sixth vision there arose up in america a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by the women so we're close to all of that right right we've done had a couple of them around running around pretty close right and the catholic church is certainly here all right the last one or the seventh vision is when he heard a most horrible explosion and he turned and looked and when he did he saw america rolled over okay go ahead with the next one now number six for the job that was in between these five and six all right this is 322 church age book based on the the seven visions along with the rapid change which have swept changes which have swept the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to pass by 1977 and though many may feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man north the day nor the hour i still maintain this prediction after 30 years because jesus did say did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world system systems and usher in the millennium now he was looking for that right well wouldn't we aren't we looking for it now all right but what will it do now these will be out of the city which is dangerous number seven but now remember we've given you where he says prediction i do not prophesy i predict i predict i predict i do not prophesy the lord didn't tell me this i predict i could miss it what 20 years i could miss it a hundred years right now we don't read them because we don't want to hear that we just want to have something to happen you know look look at this one 199 of the 70th week of daniel brings to 1961-806 and you're coming down about a car and a model forward he bought and everything he had just bought his model ford not a 33 model ford what did it look like and i went over there in the masonic temple were some of your old timers and i remember it's wrote down on an old paper at home it's already in print and went out around the world see that was in 1933 and i predict that there would be some great tragedy happen to this united states before or by the year of 1977 and he remembers me saying that look at the hands so a lot of people have their hands up all right go on to the next one this is paragraph 2 12 of the 70th week of daniel 61 806. here comes around and shows and then i predict i never said the lord told me that but standing that morning in the church i said the way progress i go back to one end and what i got back to one end of the wall and i've heard this quote by many people and there it is but around them and saying he done that he done this i got back to one end of the wall and run to the other end of the wall and i said the way progress is going on i'll predict at the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predict that that'll all happen between right now 1933 and 1977 and not knowing it god knows my heart i never know it until yesterday that 1977 as a jubilee exactly the same amount of time run out time running out that he gave with israel and everything at the end so we're at and here we are at the end of the age at the coming of the 70th week all right now he he's made these statements i'm giving them to you that he's making statement and i believe he believed it but i'm trying to get you to see predict predict i don't prophesy i don't say the lord told me this and if you and i have been there we said sci-fi no i'd have been strong okay what's number nine so we'll just read this now i do not want anyone this is 1961 806 the 70th week of daniel paragraph 226. now i do not want anyone to go away misunderstanding this tape's still playing i don't want anybody anyone to misunderstand it don't misunderstand me now and say brother brown said jesus will come in 1977. i never said no such a thing jesus may come today but i have predicted that between 33 and 77 something would take place that these things that i seen come to pass and division would take place and five of them had already took place the way he says now don't say that the lord said but everybody says it stuff saith the lord that's what they said back there of course they're all mouth shut now right you know so i have people run out and finally their tongue runs out on the floor and they get stomped a dozen times you know they don't say too much after that i don't mean that's a joke it's true see people can they'll go out though and what what bothers me you know what bothers me more than anything in the world because i've been out there and heard them when i was in the philippines those brothers said we couldn't argue with the two-soul doctrine because we didn't have no quote from brother brown said we were at the mercy of the people that brought it over here that's why my desire is to try to get the message out used to build churches and do all kinds of things now my desire is to try to get the message out if it's printing books and whatever it's doing get the message out at least they can argue with them what if what if you didn't have the books that's right i remember brought him up saying one time he said that they were sitting at the tabernacle and said brother brown said see there something to this degree something that see look at adam and eve was gone and thrown out of the garden and he said we went months before we heard another tape around said there went adam and eve out of the garden and god made a way so you're at the mercy of what the people bring that's right but you see nobody wants to because you know they don't want you to be able to quote brother brown they want you to go with their quote of what they think when brother stand up in a church and i mean he had preached it over and over and i mean stood right there in a church and pointed right out to people said the women will be saved in childbearing that's no joke after the service went over i asked him a simple question i said brother would you mind quoting the rest of that paragraph the rest of that sentence that prophet said were you quoting this morning what do you mean i said what the prophet said you say to childbearing i said read the rest of it the scripture said if she continue in the faith see he left women having babies well what about women they can't have no babies where are they going to be let's see yeah always somebody like an 83 year old man at the south carolina said you shouldn't have sex with your wife anymore he's 83 years old that's right you would have said that when he's 18 but you know that's right i know that's being sarcastic the truth is true am i right but now what took place he said i never said no such time right i never said no such thing that the lord jesus is coming and said to himself oh brother there no he didn't he said he come and said it's 63. no he didn't but you're not reading what he says what took place in 1977 the greatest opportunity for the bride of jesus christ started taking place in 1977 when people got away from predictions and thoughts and ideas and began to settle down and see what the prophet was saying did you notice that we read there right around said in 1977 that we would have exactly the same amount of time that the jews had in that coincidental he said 1977 we would have the same amount of time a lot took place in 1977. that's when this message come alive to me i think god had already preached that we could pass them but i wouldn't want it to do that i don't want it today i'm standing here telling you we could go to the year five thousand it wouldn't break around the message nor the bible i'll stand all night we can talk on that if you want to i'll show you in a minute why because in 1977 we entered a 50. and there is no limitation to the 50. you've gone past it he said yeah but i thought is why people don't want to know what somebody has to say they can say it right and show the script to see what the prophet really said look what he said he said i never knew i never said no such time look at the next one this is the it's a pair of 196 through 198 of the 70th week of daniel priest 1961-806 now count the time that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the science span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 80 33 until 1977 the science span of time of 1954 years god deals with us the same as he did with the jews see how about that now before any smart epic starts crowing out there i can mathematically count can't you if you take 33 off of 77 you don't have 1954 you have 1944. that's in case somebody comes up you know out there and say well you don't know i know that but i will tell you one thing since 6 30 80 33 and 77 our calendars have been changed three times easily can take up ten years and the calendar changes so don't crow i preached this in 1974. showed with the calendars the gregorian calendar one of them when it came in it only was 200 something days in one year when they're throwing the calendar back to the system making it line up with the stars then we're under what the gregorian but you see that's where people will say we now we know what's the truth mr brown said we got the same amount of time how about that now mark down in your book a little scripture now we should mark down in your little book your bible or turn over there and read it all right leviticus beginning with the eighth verse so let's just read it well i may be late i got 20 more minutes if i can find leviticus mary okay leviticus 25 you don't have to pull this up joel we'll read it from the scripture leviticus 24 25 beginning with the eighth verse all right let's begin with the verse and lord speak unto moses and not signing and saying speaking to the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord six years shalt thy soul ye i feel in six years i shall prune thy vineyard and give her into the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land all right everybody understand that in the old testament that was the sabbath the rest six days you rested to seven six years you were you rested the seven all right watch what's happening but in the seventh year she'll be a sabbath arrest unto the lamb a sabbath for for the lord thy shalt neither soul thy field nor prune thy vineyard that which growth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap now notice not reap you could go by and gather a little bit and eat but you couldn't reap it all right because there was nothing to keep over neither gather the grace of the vine undress for it is a year of rest unto the lamb and the sabbath of the lamb shall be meat to you for thee and for thy servant for what i made and for the hard servant and higher servant and for thy stranger that sojourned with thee and for that cattle and all like that because i could go out and just eat all right now he says leviticus 25 8 thou shalt number seven sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years now what's seven times seven oh 49 we got it now we got it see in the old testament it takes a long time to show this but be glad to do it they had a sabbath there were seven years you went into bondage you could stay in bondage only seven years now that has to be explained because people don't go back and read it is not to ever slave that was bought that is not what it's talking about i'll give it to you be glad to give it to you uh exodus 21 1-6 a hebrew buys a hebrew this is not talking about natural slavery in natural slavery if you bought a slave that was not a hebrew he did not go free because that's the way it is you're not born again right right you're lost he's not an israelite he's not a hebrew it's not all slavery it wasn't that you just it's seven years all slaves went home no slaves that were bought and not a hebrew not of their own kindred he remained a slave because that's where people that today lost with no hope why because they rejected the gospel right but look and i shall number seven sabbaths and years into these seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbath years shall be unto the forty and nine years now to explain in a hurry a hebrew bought a hebrew you got into trouble you needed to go down you worked for your neighbor and you worked for me for seven years six years the seventh year you went home free right that was the law even you didn't send him home empty-handed now i'm sure this is throughout the scripture you didn't send him home empty-handed you had to give him provisions to get him started again because he's a brother he's a hebrew it's not slavery that's right it's a hebrew by the hebrew if you're going into language to your neighbor and you can only keep the man for six years but now i'm quoting scriptures whether you believe it or not and the bible says if a man went into bondage with a wife he could come out with a wife but if he went into bondage and his master gave him a wife his wife didn't go out that's the scripture why stayed with a man because she belonged to that not to him but there was a wonderful thing happened because that would go seven sevens is 49. a gospel trumpet would sound on the 49th year in the rest that you'd go free on the 50. now i'm quoting scriptures people don't believe it go back and read your bible get in and read it read leviticus i mean read exodus uh read deuteronomy 15 exodus 21 read these scriptures all right well let's just read right over here because that's what he's given that's what number seven seven some years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seven thousands of years it'll be under the 49 years then shalt that then shall thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee now this is in the seventh right when it comes to the 49 there were seven sabbaths and there's seven and the seven sabbaths of the 49 represents the seven church ages all right there was no hopes of a rapture in chapter in in the first church age second third fourth field six but there was a freedom a rest in christ heaven but not a rapture in the seventh year you got a very special thing that would take place because through the land went a person to declare that next year everything goes free right now remember what i said if you read those scriptures i give you deuteronomy 15 or exodus 21 and you'll find it in ours explaining if you go into bondage with a wife you come out with a wife under your sevens but if your master gave you a wife the wife had to stay he went out free that's bible man it's also in there that he you couldn't send him home without having him because he's your brother all right now let's read verse nine and that's your cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound when when is the trumpet as you believe a sound on the 10th day october the 10th yep because it don't start in january you know come on the bible don't start the jews in january starts in april right come on the seventh month in the tenth day uh in the day of atonement listen let's see where it happened let's see it's the day of the atonement in other words the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of the atonement leviticus 23 27 read it i told you can you make the trumpet sound throughout all of your land now watch verse 10 and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall reach a prayer turn every man unto his family now everything goes free under the 50 watch it right because it's only way to type a rapture you can't top it with a bondage it'll wipe it too master gives you a wife that won't talk you got to get his family free that's right you got to give them an opportunity for a jubilee show the 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither rick that which growth of itself in it nor together the grapes in it of a vineyard for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession if thy sell all unto thy neighbor are vice out of thy neighbor's hand you shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt by of thy neighbor and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto them and according to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price i shall increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years i shall diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years or the fruits that he sell unto thee in other words you can't raise the price because you can't raise the price of salvation come on we could be here price 12 o'clock but i'm trying not to be because 1977 let's see what the prophet said go ahead brother with the number 10 now that we had up that we were reading look what he said go to leviticus 25 8 and begin god called the jubilee of our 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee we know that we understand that from the first jubilee first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3 430 years jubilee means that going up the release multiply 50 times 70 what is it come on someone give me a math definition what is 70 times 50 3500 won't work you're off multiply 49-70 and see what you got 3430 exactly the prophet gave it right he knows exactly what he's talking about you want some some real truth there's truth he could even figure it mathematically that by 1977 would have about the same amount of time did you get that god had dealt with this exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews from the time he gave abraham the promise until the rejecting of the messiah in a.d 33 with 1954 years and now we have 17 years left we had about 19 30 19 30 something years we've got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the jubilee watching of the going up of the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews when they go out of bondage there's three and a half years between the fact of us going in a rapture and the jews going out of bondage come on get in your bible oh don't you see from all the world and they've gathered there for that day oh my see where we're at we don't know but what time it might happen we're at the end time we don't know what time it might happen but we're at the end time number eleven and the old testament in the bible said this is taken from uh 56 7 15 the mark of the beast um e21 and the old testament the bible said that there was to be a 50 year jubilee that was seven times seven years and in the 49th year that it was to be made ready for the 50th year was the jubilee 50 means jubilee it was 50 is god's jubilee number the word pentecost means 50. it was the outpouring of the holy spirit at the end of the 50 days it was also the end of the 50th year jesus comes to foreshadow it and run into people to come in the year of jubilee he said brother dale what are you getting at 50 million pentecost means 50 without pouring in the holy spirit on today so we come down to the bottom get hurt or it was given forth the warning of the coming forth of the great gusher of pentecost to set it liberty everyone that was slaves to sin and bondage that's what jubilee is is to set you free what are you getting now she was looking at 77 as a year instead of a jubilee 1977 your prophet said it read them you out there on the internet you've read it off the screen you may never seen these before but there they are you you go bring them if they're not in the book come and show me if you can show me anything else he said about 1977 contrary to what i'm showing tonight i'd love to see it but i've been studying it now for 40 something years 1977 you're concerned with a year instead of concerned with a jubilee with these 70th jubilee what's the next jubilee after it it's a 49 49 would come to a 50. 1977 was the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees that's what he said what happened in 1977 the bride that has stayed with the message has been able to do what he said be the growing up of the gentile bride the bride started going up not physically now don't get me carnal bride started elevating throughout the message in 77 you begin to become more interested to the bride people real bright people that was interested in waiting for the day right because that's where it became with me and then in 1979 i preached the seals for the first time i wasn't i saw it wasn't complete or finished and then i waited lady too to preach it again and i had never preached on it again because i finished i preached what i saw what he's talking about right lost one of the greatest friends i've ever had used to eat my home just off and on could have called me to give me he's offered me about his car to go to jeff one time because mine was a thing flew and hit the gas tank he was a great brother but because i said i had a revelation he said he didn't have one he said brother brown had the revelation well he said this is my revelation brother branham had the revelation sounded like he said the same thing i did to me now i know i'm carnal but it sounds like he said he had a revelation and i said i had one 1977 was the 70th jubilee an opportunity but it's 70 times 49. the 50th see then you could add another 50 in 1977 and where would you be i want your mathematician to count it up if you added 50 more to that which you could very easily because there's no limit with the 50. you'd wind up in 2027. 26. and if you're in a jubilee what are you worried about when it's going to be it's 5 000. praise the lord there's still plenty of privilege right i ain't run out yet never had any problems with it but what would happen now let's see what did we finish up on did we finish up on 11 well okay let's read 12 of our women please for just a few minutes now remember in the old testament with man lost his inheritance and a squatter come on his lane he could not hold it any longer for annihilation from the owner until 50 years after 50 years the year of jubilee came by in the year of jubilee when the year of jubilee come along and everything went back to its original beginning again all slaves and went back to the original beginning if a man was hoeing in the field and the trumpet sounded he heard it he threw down the ho and said and say i'm no more a slave i go back home to my family everything was given back it says if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all he got off the ground because why the real owner was coming back he had to give away hallelujah one of these days the kingdom of this world will fall and the legal owners will come in one of these days amen all right look at the next and that's it uh so we get on up into the seal to see what he says about these two believe so this is second seal 1963 13 paragraph 2 14. in the old testament when a man had been told of slavery now come a year of jubilee every 50 years 49 ninth year and then the year of jubilee and when a slave heard this and he wanted to go free there there isn't nothing that can keep him from going free he can throw down his home and say so long and go back home the trumpet sounded that's right but if he didn't want to go and he's satisfied with his bloody master then he's taken into the temple now watch what he says here about this and they take an awful and you know what an all is and they pierced his ear and they put a hole in his ear now come on you sisters into your earbuds and all the things you know look what it means it's a mark that he can never go back put them in your rooms in there it's a mark you'll never hear the gospel unless god i know everything the prophet says that's all i got to say it's a mark that he can never go back is that right he has to serve his master for all the time i don't care how many more times the jubilee sounds whatever happens he's absolutely has sold out his birthright of being free what and when a man turns down the gospel truth satan marks him word at his ear he defends him so he can't hear the truth no more amen now how long can i stop there and talk about the people of this message that they've been blinded by false shepherds your prophet said right and they can't hear the truth they're afraid to hear the truth come on folks that's why we're on internet because i travel around and people say let me have your tapes i said get your password okay and i'm giving to you i can't get my pastor okay if they say but they can travel the country can't you yeah come on i've been around too long i haven't been around and heard the doctrines years ago there was one years ago that if you went anywhere besides listening to me you was committed an adulterer against me and had another husband we've been through all of them the only problem i had then was why was my husband running around because he could go to other churches and preach come on that ain't comical i didn't mean it then i don't mean it now that ain't comical he could go preach around the country but if i went anywhere else i was committing spiritual adultery that's binding you by fear that's right i am only the pastor to the people here that makes me their pastor the rest of you paying the bills i'm saying i've said it long enough you're paying the bills hey keep coming we need your money pay the bills i'm only the pastor of those that have made me their passion that's right that's right come on that's right that's what he said he didn't see him so he can't hear the truth no more in his things he stays with the group that he is with and if he won't hear the truth no you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth makes fruit god marks he is when they come god marks his by vindicating his promised word through them that's exactly saint john 14 12. and another thing if you want to put down mark 16 jesus said these signs you follow thee all right let's just end as i say if you can find any words brother i'm explaining 1977 any other way than what i read to you tonight i want to hear it see i'm asking you for it through your duty mine and you won't offend me if you come and tell me i'll be tickled today but you see i preached this in 1974 that jubilee i thought we believed over in thessalonians that the bible said the lord shall descend from heaven with a shout right you know what the word shout means you ever looked that up come on you ever looked up shout at me jubilee go back there when joshua was telling the people walk around the walls six days remember they went one day at a time no freedom right no walls went down no church age had a freedom of a rapture right when they come to the last day the seventh joshua said go around it seven times right read your bible seven times on the seventh is 49. and he said when you do turn around and face the wall and say you shout look that word up when they shouted what joshua shouted joshua wasn't standing at the walls right he'd give him their order stand up on the hill watching them he doesn't give his orders brother doesn't give us the order he doesn't brought us the word that's right time for the ministry to shout to shout don't look that word up shout there and see if it don't mean jubilee now in the bible i'll give you another key yes you missed this in the bible it's spelled j-u-b-i-l-e now so don't go in the bible start looking for j-u-b-i-l-e-e it's not i'm just giving you that so people wouldn't know where you you stand on it but it's the word jubilee it means shout joyous festivity it means that we're ready we're going out of here we've got the message we're in the message the message what's going to take us out here when the people shouted what what joshua shouted to walter jericho fell down right right man but he walked around seven times on the seventh day and then they shouted we've had seven search engines folks time's running out of you and i i've never been one to make predictions but we don't have to make them now i hope you understand we are in the last days whether you believe it or not that ain't a prediction 50 more years okay no problem but that's still we're in a short period of time right a hundred years would be a short period of time we've written down two every day i said y'all realize in 50 years what we've changed from man that's planning you when i sit in your home out in the field all day i thank god i heard that jubilee man i thank god for 40 something years i've been pounding this thing to the people even in 1977 go to the jubilee instead of the year and see what happens under the 70th then see what happens under the 50. then we get a total release let's stand come over here i like to know i don't know where we hit the second tape here or what we hit a second so it don't matter you had been out there talking for an hour and a half that's right were you at home there's some banana foods or something downstairs waiting on us you think i didn't know that while i was preaching that's why i've been surprised i'm trying to hurry it up or get downstairs to get that banana put i guess it's banana pudding i don't know she said like banana pudding so okay all right then i won't be feeling so bad but listen folks this message is to carry us out of here right right that's right the jubilee is when we get into it and we participate the lord descended with a shout but what about the bride saying the same thing but the shadows man that's right joshua said quote around them seven times and when you do just stop turn around and look wall and you think about it a wall so high and so much they could they could run chariot races around it six horse turret races you know things across it didn't fall over the ground opened up and swallowed it yeah they fed the crumbled already killed all those relatives too and these even a quote wrote a run said it failed okay but listen folks this message to me since 1977 people have always talked about time you know that would come that the bride would have a revival i've been in a revival ever since i've been in this message when 1977 struck i wouldn't want to send my books home but yeah because i'd already prepared and i already said it could pass it do you think anybody wants to talk to me even about it now oh they don't want to talk to me now when i could say that they try to hear somebody that's made all the predictions and was wrong and proven to be wrong then you hear somebody can stand tell the truth amen to me as a human i might run around with if they don't believe you forget it well that's the way i am as a human if you don't want to believe it forget it but down inside of me there's something in there that won't let me forget it and i keep preaching and i keep trying to help everybody to try to get you to see jesus christ because without him there is no hope of any rapture whatsoever we know nothing about the message without jesus christ that's a personal experience in our hearts don't serve god as i say well and go becomes you're afraid you're going to hell get to the point where you said god if you cast me into hell i love you anyway i love you anyway lord one because look what he's done for us look what he's done for the little group at lulu we've had enough healings and signs and wonders no problem we've seen enough of god among us to know he's here we've also just kept on going with the word right down the road god's always made us but to other people when the towers fall before they start rejoicing i heard a tape with some people we've listened to that the last thing he was not servicing in 76 and they were just screaming glory glory just rejoicing screaming and no building just rejoicing we we're here it's time to where's those people now because when it went from 76 to 77 i was rejoicing and i'm still rejoicing i'm rejoicing now today somebody get this is hallelujah you'll be good by what you hear hallelujah he is jesus me nothing but is is oh is oh oh just remember now the service is starting saturday 3 30. be with us and we'll have a good time gerald and all of the people gathered in and the lord bless us and freed our souls because that's what i pray for that's right i pray lord feed me that's right i've had a chance to say i am listen that's wonderful i've always told you faith don't come by preaching that's right faith comes by hearing amen that's right see i sat down and i listened to these brothers and i write notes and i i love little thoughts in my mind and just going over and just thinking that's right what a wonderful day that we have to listen to somebody talk about the god they believe in amen it's not a you know not a fairy tale right the real time amen amen just think about it he died to save you and he gave his life that we might be thankful hallelujah thank you lord now let's give ours that's right they got through and said brother got up since anybody got anything else to say does anybody got anything to say here we go today he said okay he said we'll just turn it over to the coffee pot okay so nobody's got anything else to say we're going to turn it over to the pie that's downstairs and we're going to go in and have a good time one night well some don't know if i'm right or not in one of the folks brother brennan said that he predicted something horrific is going to happen to america between 33 and 7. i see america turning his back on god in 1956 is the most terrific thing that could happen to this nation but at that time i'm having one myself who did they say oh that's right they kept telling me somebody was going to say something and now they're going away so just take on these things be much in prayer for brother gerald as he comes to speak to us for the weekend and brother richard this coming week he hadn't been down in a while so looking forward to coming fellowshipping with us and preaching for us and just having a good time in the lord but i certainly do love sit down and listen yes and you're looking at one man don't know how the preacher's itch i've got a lot of itches because i preach you know my back does all the time while i'm standing here i need somebody to scratch my back while i'm preaching with this all right but just think on these things you love the lord amen that's great father we love you and we thank you we pray that what we've said these through this time lord that we've been on kind of some doctrine things we ask you to just help us to see thank you you let them come among us to trust to see if we fought life here lord we pray and hope that we stood the test to where we haven't followed these things the vain janglings of man as you spoke of in your word but we've stood on the truth and just tried to go on down the road loving everybody don't like don't dislike nobody lord we love everybody we love you and we thank you we commit everything into your hands and we dismiss from one another and go for our way home take care of everybody on the way home give a safe journey be with us this weekend bless brother gerald as he meditates to speak unto us that's all the traveling and all the things that would take place and just have you away with each one of us in jesus name amen is he is here oh yes
