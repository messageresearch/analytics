see all of this stuff you know you get all that excited well my my daddy worked for the government we traveled all over the united states and i don't know that i ever uh until i got married and moved in this house we are in now that we ever spent two christmases in the same house like that you know but you know it was so exciting back then you know a man like me come down the chimney look like me and he's excited you know and you just get thrilled today but i'll tell you right now what i've experienced in my life and you know and it had me for this message i don't believe i'd ever come to the place tonight that i understand today but you know i hear christians preach denominational preachers and they they preach eternitarian doctrine and stand there and tell you they don't understand what they're saying and i agree with them you know they don't really know and then there's some that are dogmatic about it that they really know or what they like him but you know unless you've given birth to the lord jesus christ in your life uh you got something to experience right you know if you've never done it you know when there's people out there i'm sure that they're saying you know that well i'm i've made professional-based i've done it but they don't know for sure i'm gonna tell you what it's real it's real and i want to tell people brother joe and his family brother richard if they were in the car or riding down the road or whatever i know ginger and them they skype on on on the road so they might be listening to the message coming down the road i don't know what to do or this this right here but merry christmas y'all be safe coming home amen let's try number 393 in the red book we're going to be in the g i guess that's what this that and i made this statement last time where it doesn't know this song and these are the hardest songs in the world to sing and play so y'all sing out loud okay but you know you are in a little town of bethlehem you know and another thing you know

hallelujah hallelujah has anybody got a testimony somebody here's got a testimony amen sorry about that sometimes you do things when you think you're called to do it and you find out it's not necessarily so amen i'd like to make this commitment that you know we get so busy this time of the year with shopping and and trying to do all the things that it's ex you know that we need to be doing but i found out at my age you have to live a life maybe the most important thing at christmas or any other time in this year if the year is your family make sure that you love your family that that's all that counts when you get down to this age basically is your relationship to jesus christ and your relationship to your family and i thank god for my family things have not always been perfect and they probably won't be until the rapture but i thank god for my family my children and and the relationship that we have with the people here at this church my brothers and sisters and brother sam and sister peggy what they've meant in our lives and that's my testimony man that said something to brother ray a while ago hadn't fulfilled it as a vietnam war well four nights overnight but you know we on the internet and we on on facebook and if we get an opportunity to use a camcorder or something like that you need to sit down and just give a testimony and put it on youtube and put it on that thing right there there's people out there that they have no idea what's going on but they'd love to hear it from you amen number d and b will change your service open the eyes i want to see open the eyes of my heart shining i live pour out your power and love holy holy you could see about in the house of the lord you'd like to run in your scriptures turn right back we've been reading revelations 1 and then we'll go to revelations 8 and verse 1. remember the announcements this has been made and keep all these things in mind you know we had asked the people if they wanted to services coming wednesday and it was kind of left in limbo so we decided just go ahead and have a service this coming wednesday and then who wants to come can come because that'll be the day after christmas and some of you may be tied up and we understand but we'll just go ahead for whatever wants to be here and then we'll have the service but then there won't be any service here on january the 2nd on wednesday january the 2nd there will not be one because we'll be having to watch night service and then getting over into tuesday you know so we won't do it so remember that remember the brother be with us for the weekend looking forward to seeing him and getting acquainted with him and hearing him preach you know we just appreciate the lord amen to all of you if we don't get to see you anymore we say do you merry christmas and just let christ be in your hearts and lives because that's the whole thing of anything of every day of the year there would be christ amen that's right revelations 1 revelations 8. heavenly father we thank you lord for all things and we know and realized that without you there would be nothing you are the creator the leader the god the everything the advocate your everything that we have need of savior deliver and jesus is your name we just ask you now that you'd come and speak to our hearts and may our thoughts be centered on you in your word lord forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk upright in you and lead us lord remember the sick among us you promised it you said you'd send your word and heal us and we believe you and we thank you bless those that are away and be traveling back and all and richard tomorrow their lord and the different ones we pray that you would just bless and guide each and every one lead us in jesus name amen amen revelations one verse one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him showing to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right we're going out to revelation 8 1 and then when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated look at his blessing to the reading of the word now we have spent a lot of time getting up to where we are and you know trying to express some things and to walk into the light of the evening message but i hope you thought caught what i was doing this morning is putting all of the emphasis we could upon the fact that we have had a messenger in the end time to bring us the word of the lord and so that these things could be revealed but now watch it we're going along this afternoon see then we're dependent upon the word coming to the prophet america now as it would be uh coming to the prophet to reveal see then uh even the written word even the written word now there were some things that could be remain known and etc and all but the written word the mysteries would come to the prophet and we could you know see it because of that and have it understand it but then if there's anything else in there it would have to come by way of the prophet now i do not believe that uh brother brown could bring us anything contrary to the word and i do not believe that he come to add to the word that's the emphasis we're going to be putting on the whole thing all the way through in the case i forget to say it over and over the emphasis upon the opening of the seventh seal if i believe it's written amen you know that's what i was trying to express this morning when you say that the seventh seal was open in their silence in heaven all right now you say it's nothing now right where would be your thought if it was nothing it would just be nothing the prophet couldn't reveal it if it's nothing and see it's not that the you can't do the seals going through the word you know and then all it once you come up to something that not even written at all that's true okay because there's no writing there of telling what it is but if we're dependent upon the and we must be upon the prophets of god throughout the bible to be bringing us the thought of god you know to where that we can understand what god has for you and i like brother random explaining in the seal book about first it was god's thought i said did it become moses's thought right now he said it like this he said it's not the word yeah see because it hadn't been spoken right it was a thought given to the prophet right now see then the prophet gets the thought and then the prophet goes forth and speaks it now it's become the word name that you can listen to and understand all right now in no way will we be covering the seventh seal in the basis of trying to add something to the word but i don't believe the prophet could add anything to the word right right but he could bring us the thoughts of god yes from god's mind delivered down to you and i amen all right now see it's thought by a lot of people that run around and told us this that or the other that the bible don't tell us now i can't go that way i'm sorry i'm sorry i i you know that sounds good but it's i don't believe it's true right because see when it just said they silence in heaven that means there's something there right or they wouldn't be the silence and if it's just silence itself that would still be something so you wouldn't be adding what the prophet would do he'd say and if we get to it this morning i mean this evening i doubt it but he said this is my revelation of it i had the revelation that revealed come on all right then it's not going to be something added to the word right but remember they kept telling him with your ability you could write a 23rd chapter of revelation he said they were trying to trap me right he tricked me he said because you king head too the thunders cannot be added to the word it must be what is in the word amen seals cannot be added to the word it is what's in the word that should be the simple point of our understanding and we base everything then upon we have the bible and we have the prophet's message telling us what the bible is saying so what what do we have to worry about you know right why try to think about something added that's right there's no added revelation right right you you'll find out we'll get to it because it'll be wednesday or sometime next year we'll find the seventh seal that probably tells you what it is he said it's the end of all times right what if it's the end of all things then the end of all things is to sell itself so you my point of view the next few messages is driving down some things that are said about this seventh seal that will be putting us to the bases that we can see that there is something there and it must be revealed if not the prophet wouldn't have said anything that's right right you say well i just can't follow that because well that's true because of our thinking that's right because our minds are locked into certain channels that's right and if we don't uh open up those channels then our minds will stay that way and we're headed to the grave but we're trying to bring the point this morning of what what did we do in each one of the seals as we came down we're trying to cover the point of to see what was dire yeah and you know see what's made known as symbol or people or whatever but at the same time to see what is that revealing to you and i that's right see that's what people would say you know well what's this sixth seal got to do with me that's relation well that's true but then in that is the plan of redemption amen and that's what is to be to you and i right amen the plan of redemption amen all right then we got down to the end this morning talking about how that the whole world is groaning and waiting on you and i yes right everything is dependent upon whether or not you and i can receive what this prophet has broughted to us and not put our own interpretations upon it but to see what the word has to say there's a lot of beautiful things that we can take but when you bring it back and say well tell me what the scripture says that's right that puts a damper on a lot of people's doctrines right because they know they can't bring it through the scriptures right right right and they're really they're not interested in bringing it through they're just interested in a following a group or doings and and that's that's going to be going away so that'll be all right but now get what we were trying to bring this morning and then we'll get up to the point it says a silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour all right now there had to be a reason for that silence something caused that silence to take place and in doing that then we can look at it and see that as i say it this morning right at the end see that there's been silence in heaven for two thousand years he said no no no brother dale you misquote that call brother i said this okay that's what we gave this morning he said this is what taken place in glory some two thousand years ago paragraph 43 and the seventh seal there are silence in heaven all right now it didn't say silence on earth right it's all about heaven the basics of dealing with the first six seals you deal with earthly time yes uh some of it may still yet to be the tribulation you know the difference but it's still earthly things yes all right but we find here that it says silence in heaven okay now something had to cause that to take place and i believe that's what the prophet explained to us i ended up making a statement i'm sure was strange to some when i said to the whole seven seals is silence we'll get back later and prove where the prophet of god said those angels bring me back here for the message tonight and he'll stop talking about city you think see about it all this week something going on see there those seals you said where the first seal was broke it was broken in heaven it doesn't say that it was broke on earth revelations 4 john is taken up revelations 4 and revelations 5 is in heaven revelation 6 what happens under that seal is on earth yes but the seal itself is broken heaven that's where the silences are we don't get to it this evening we'll get to it later see the silence is there because brother run said if there was one movement it might give away the secret amen he said this is something satan don't know right now say don't know anything about the seals whatsoever did you before you heard of the prophet yeah boy let's go and i had this all figured yeah you had it all figured out yeah i heard of the church ages before i heard of the prophet and the guy had some of the things in the correct order but he couldn't fit it all together all right but you see if something took place in glory 2 000 years ago i want to know what that was what caused that silence yes something had to take place all right you say yeah but we there's no way for us to understand well there's where the prophet comes in see he can tell us these things that's right and then we can just take what he says and just go right on and wait for god to reveal although it took place in glory 2 000 years ago it didn't mean it was done right that's where we're looking at it what is revelation 4 and 5 was john taken up into heaven or was he taken up to see heaven which was see if we look at it and say well okay we've got to depend on the profit all right then let's go back now and deal with this a little bit as we're thinking i know i was very slow this morning i want to be slow because i want you to think about the things all right first off when john starts out he was not up in heaven he was on patents right right all right so we go to number five and we'll start from there whoever number five on the quote but it is revelation 1 10. and john was in the spirit on the lord's day he didn't say he was in heaven he saw a lot of things throughout chapter one throughout chapter two and chapter three john saw a lot of things right and wrote about it the church ages and the things yes right but then in revelations 4 1 he was taken up to heaven the main thing he covers and i was in the spirit because that's what he said over here in revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit of the lord's day now in verse two in the fourth chapter he's in the spirit and you begin to see things all right now my point of what i'm saying did john go up no he was laid on patents with me his body was probably laying under a tree somewhere and he was taking things over because actually the book of revelations you could read it in what maybe 10 minutes if you read real fast maybe 20 say you took 30 on but john is there for about two years on the isle of family so it's not one of those things that he was taken up to heaven and you just no was he mortally taken up i asked that question for you to consider was he taken up in a mortal body or was he taken up as brother branham was when he went beyond the curtain of time when paul said that he went to the third heaven was he taken mortally you know what i mean mortal mortal mortal body this 16 elements flesh or was he in the spirit all right so we got that established right john was not a physical translation into heaven someday that'll be valuable to you paul was not physically taken up brother was not physically he looked back his body was laying on his bed all right so is this a physical happening of john no corporal no right because of what he saw there and the things he saw would be future things you and i wasn't in heaven when john went up right right so he's going up to see the future right are you following me you're going up to see the future so he's not in a corporal physical meant a mortal translation they called it souls under the altar for the prophet you know when he said the angel lord or they told him it's a soldier under the altar paul he said well i don't know where it was in body or out of body because he was honest he didn't know but he didn't go there physically because he went there physically that would mean you and i have to be there physically that simple yes that need a lot of revelation to figure that out no it just means it's what it is all right so when he went up he was able to see then what took place in glory okay is that what the prophet said this morning we were reading paragraph 43 take a place in glory some 2 000 years ago all right that means it's 2 000 years before we get there right i mean if it's two thousand years ago we ain't there yet that's sensible all right now there will be a time when we'll be there but we're not there yet okay we're heading that way so then john wasn't over here looking back over there right that's right john was back there looking up now and as he was he was seeing things that would eventually take place that's why it's the top of the rapture see john wasn't taken up physically it was the top of the rapture right all right so john went up to heaven and we by way of the prophet are the ones dealing with what took place 2 000 years ago in glory that's why i said this morning it be a surprise to deal with all seven seals and the silence in heaven for all of the seven seals because at the time john saw that even in his day the seals were not even in physical manifestation upon the earth right all right all right john then sees the throne one sitting on the throne the 24 elders need all kind of things that he sees that will be future in manifestation all right but he sees the breaking of the seals right he sees the lamb coming forth and taking the book now you might not have thought what i did this morning on it but did any of us know anything about these things before the prophet come to tell us so it's been been 2 000 years of silence until it was revealed to the prophet it was silent sure we know that there were many things throughout the first six seals that transpire on earth and if we get to it in time we're going to find out that there were some things transpired in earth under the seventh seal that made the silence in heaven well we're just studying it by what the prophet said took place all right we won't try to go into what our thoughts are we'll just deal with it to what he said but we read one this morning a quote where brother around said that the seals was broke and given to john now even though you're dealing with the seals of revelation 6 there's a few things we better deal with with revelations 10 because the book is sealed the first mention of it being fully open is revelations 10. all right it doesn't mention in revelation 6. or 8 1 that the book was opened it's in the process of being opened revelation 10 it says it's open all right john was to record what he saw what was his reason john you go you see you write you take write it down you bring it back to the church right is that over about chapter one okay so that's why i love to quote from the prophet the way he says things look what he says here on paragraph 299 number seven of the notes on the breach look what happens talk about a jubilee talk about a jubilee when that lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven the book was sealed in heaven it's going to have to come open in heaven before it can come open on earth okay see the book sealed in heaven the mysteries are that's what he said say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation world right but the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book glory opened the book and tore off the seals watched it and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal to his people in heaven name dropping the earth first it was given to john right write it down john the book is sealed it has to be brought to earth to be revealed right there you are what happened the strings were shouting the glory the anointings and old john had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth and everything in the sea heard me hollering you say well that don't sound like silence why not he hasn't told any secrets yet he hasn't told why he's hollering right that's in chapter 5 right chapter 5 is where john is hollering he doesn't know anything at all except one thing the lamb took the book he knows the lamb has got the book and he knows the lamb is worthy chapter five yes he knows he's capable of doing it yes he's already rejoicing before he learns one thing amen come on read your bible chapter 5. the book is still sealed up until you start in chapter six verse one and it says in the lamb broke the first seal but it's handed down to the prophet so without him we wouldn't know these things and sent down to the earth to be revealed to the people you and i all right so now even though the seal is broken in heaven did that take place when two thousand years ago right come on two thousand years ago seen in heaven with the lamb taking the boat that's right that's right but was any of that revealed so it's indefinitely been for 2000 years a silence in heaven yes my brother there let me show all the time you're talking thousand years a day and a day of a thousand years what i said this morning everybody's trying to count figure out how long that 30 minutes of silence is why don't you count how long that 30 minutes of silence he's in heaven with no record of days times or beings or minutes or hours everyone says see there two thousand years he said that's only been two days he said god is just getting up you know he don't mean getting out of bed he's standing up getting ready to do something right and 2 000 years later he does it you see amen but we try to figure all these things out with our intellectual abilities how long is two thousand years in glory john said about the space a half hour the seals broke in glory two thousand years ago all seven of them but they wasn't revealed until 63 to the prophet that's right come on so he's been silenced yes no you have time to get to it so i'll go ahead and stir it up where you can think a little see the reason there's silence in heaven it may give away the secret of redemption right amen that's what your prophet said all right he can't give away that secret of redemption and when was redemption to be brought forth to you and i 1963 through a little prophet right began to reveal brought it down to his angel to reveal 2 000 years between the taking of the book and they're bringing it to the prophet so they've been silenced in heaven yes amen see the prophet of god then would have the ability to be able to look back in this 2000 years to see what went on in glory right right he now the ability to look back before the foundation of the world well that's what he said on christ the mystery god revealed john in his early life in the early part of patmos he saw many many things for three whole chapters then he's taken up he goes through chapter four chapter five then he finally comes to chapter six then he goes through chapter seven writing down and he goes to chapter 8. chapter 5 we find the lamb had to take the book out of the hand of the one sitting on the throne the prophet of god said it this way he said he came from behind the throne where he's been making intercession he said he takes a book climbs up on the throne and sits down see that's the one that's worthy to open the book the lamb which is jesus christ see it would give away the secret of redemption not just the secret of the seventh seal it would give away the secret of the whole plan of redemption not just the seventh seal all seven seals would be sealed up until the end time he said but there was only silence in heaven under the seventh seal we'll get back to that one so i'd write that down you know so he said he's gonna explain this one day do we know anything about these things or did we know anything about them until a prophet came she would give away the secret you can't do that back there see satan for 2 000 years he's been trying to find out what took place in glory 2 000 years ago he's been trying to find some way to destroy that plan of redemption the seals remember reveal what has been what is and will be so they reveal the redemption of the body spirit and soul not just for the body that's the climax he said i don't know about that go ahead and number eight nobody said on the breach 46 8-49 now notice the seven seals hold the mystery of the book now read whitney until we see what those seven seals are sealed in we're only presuming now he didn't say until we see or when we see six of the seals i want you to read he said until we see what those seven seals have sealed in we're only presuming they break six seals you know what unless you sell it's open you're only presuming simple thoughts because if i told you this morning the format of the message of the in clinton bc we are sure to miss the thing unless it's absolutely generalized revealed by the holy spirit and vindicated the same see if the prophet rises and tells you that this that this is just that and god don't vindicate the thing forget it but god in every statement and and everything has to vindicate it to make it right let's see all right his children will watch those things all right notice the seventh seal on the book has the the seven seals has the book sealed the book is absolutely do you see it the book is absolutely sealed i see a book until the seven seals is broke it's sealed with seven seals you say well you spent a message talking about six seals six seals revealing redemption seven still don't reveal redemption seven seal is the end of redemption it doesn't reveal it now watch it now that's a different from the seventh undersea this is seven sealed on the book in a book well the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel you agree with that amen all right so there's 2 000 years between there and over here okay see so we we are presuming now people that say the seventh seal is not broken then you're presuming right sorry about that i'm just reading what he said but the real genuine but the genuine revelation of god we made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word says and the sea of the book is single it's closed look it's closed here in revelations the 5th chapter in revelations the 10th chapter it is open he said we want to see how it gets opened all right now but it's just silence for the deal there's nothing remember all of the seals there's in symbols a reality but the seventh seal is not a symbol but what about this thing 77 seventh seal and the eighth chapter only reveals a scene of the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now it has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of revelation it's the revealing of the seventh seal is perfectly mute but he said it's the scene he said if i would have time i'll try a few places to show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter this seventh seal is spoke of now am i right then what i was saying while ago do you remember what i was saying to start with that all of the secrets of the bible come to the prophets and that the seventh seal to the prophet couldn't add anything to the bible come on would you back there with me a while ago seven seal can't add anything to the bible it's got to be what's in the bible so now we see that it's a scene we're in heaven so now we've got it being something if you couldn't follow the silence one ago you got it being something it's a scene and it spoke off from genesis so that would put the seventh seal in the bible if it spoke of genesis it's in the bible right so it's not something added right not added in revelation it's spoken from genesis but it's a scene webster says the word saying means the place where some action or event occurs let's see let's see if i got it yep so we see that the seven seals not seventh the seven seals has the book sealed and until they are broken all seven is still silence in heaven yeah my brother don't understand because they've been standing out of my place for 3 000 years it's about 2 000 years in heaven it's about to space half hour i said deer hunting the other day and i saw a deer ever seen one stand in one spot emotionless for over 10 minutes it never wiggled a tail it never wiggled in here it stood there i grunted bladed called it and everything snort wheezed at it and everything was booked and it stood perfectly still the hell i'm sure it seems i'll do that right you mean i can stand ten minutes in one place yeah and never move a muscle well that wouldn't be too long for 30 minutes if you was looking at something wonderful remember by the time he gets to where he's at he's seeing the six seals revealed when the seventh comes and something happens there's a scene there what is it saying let's read it go ahead number 10. let's read this scene this in heaven america 241 of the seventh seal i think it goes to paragraph two 2 49. and the four 20 elders stood before god and they're harping with their hearts they quit playing their hearts the angels rushed their sin in heaven they holy cherubim to serve him and isaiah saw the temple with the six winning flying saying holy holy the opposed to the temple would move he said they're doing their presence the holy seraphim huss angels quit singing we're flying in the presence of god sin holy holy he just stopped now i'm talking about a scene i look out there right now and i see a scene in front of my eyes i see people sitting there you know what you see i see you see me standing here a scene you can watch no anger singing no praises no no watercolor no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for half hour all the hosts of heaven was solid for this half hour when this seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke the lamb breaks it they were all by a scene you think about all the the best way to describe it what i'm looking at is like you you've got a um a live performance all right you know what i'm saying what is the word for it you go to the theater and you see a a live performance all right now what happened that what is the life scene of that live live performance he said well when the husbands and my older two they kiss and they are they right off into the sunset on the worst that's not the last scene what's the life scene of a play when all the actors gather back on stage for their final bow live performances not roy rogers riding off the sunset and see they're all brought forth i remember we were down i guess it might have been when we were up in where he saw that the performance of the crucifixion and the thing and you know that when they introduced those actors that guy played that devil so good though i guess he got as good an old of clapping as any of the rest of him because he's done the best he could to portray his part but think about it a scene where everything had just stopped and not a muscle is moved because it might give away the secret he's satan he's watching every move ever thought everything amen and he'd like to know how to try to hinder you and i you've done a good job because he's a good devil he's done a good job that's right but the scene of it now we got some we got a scene for 30 minutes that they're standing in place and nobody moving see because it's the plan of redemption so we know it's a scene we know it's there's something taking place or the scene would not be there now what is taking place all the actors are in place i seen what are they looking at could it be that they're looking at earth if what is taking place could it be could it be that they're seeing on earth in manifestation what they played out the acts of the play in heaven we don't know where it is or not okay what did your prophet say it was i'm gonna roll up a little he said now as certain as i stand in the platform i had the revelation that revealed right back up above there he said i won't tell you my revelation of it now that shouldn't be any problem for him to tell us his revelation of it if we believe that he was a prophet should it should it be any problem for him to tell us the secrets of the bible if he's a prophet right now he wasn't a prophet um yeah okay if he was a prophet then he could tell us the secrets because the word comes to the prophet right that's right but he said i said a threefold man so now we know the seventh seal is what he's in a three-fold manner so if he's in a three-fold manner that means there's three parts or something that's right is that their english wording matter won't do it what's that i will speak to you in the gossip of a full day hold on and then let's go over there first here's a revelation to begin what i want to tell you what it is what happened is that those seven thunders that he heard thundered and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out so now we know that it's a scene and they don't want to give away the plan of redemption we know that don't find out we're picking up a lot of things right all right the lobby says ain't nothing there we're just taking what he said now he said it's no seven thunders now let's go over to revelation 10. all right you got it brother i don't know i guess i told you to put it on there you have revelation 10. i wonder have you really ever read that oh my brother's halfway around we're at it forty seven thousand eight hundred thirty two times already let's read one more okay one more time remember i got a quote after this one where brother around says that revelations 10 is exactly the same as revelations 1 13. revelation 1 13 says one like unto the son of man heard about the pounds with a golden girdle that's finished i'll give you a quote in just a second where does revelations 10 take place and brother ronald said that the seventh seal was part one fold one was the seven thunders and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven this is not in heaven are you with me hiya how are you and how much are ya man you know what i thought about doing the other day i know what i mean i don't know brother gary's not back here but i get it on him he's making some more sunday but he has problems i know that but you know what i thought about doing i thought instead of saying hi you higher we'd say what's the football score makes everybody else you never go to the football game go to sleep they never seen nobody sleeping in a football game we play football okay i know what i mean but once and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven this is not in heaven this is on earth he clothed with a cloud and a rainbow up on his head in his face as it were the sun and his feet his filters are fired brother and said that's christ all right that's why he compares it with revelations 1 13 it's christ all right now watch and he had in his hand a little book open it was closed in revelation 5. revelation 10 is open okay and he set his right foot upon the sea left foot on the earth okay that's christ the mighty angel christ right right now watch this one on earth right cried with a loud voice and when a lion roar and when he had cried seven utter thunders voices the thunders don't sound in heaven that's right got the quote letting here say well don't worry about it i'll read in a minute the thunders don't sound in heaven he said whatever it says yeah it only says there was silence in heaven it don't say nothing about the thunder revolution they want but around them told us what it was right when he had cried there's one standing on earth seven thunders are divorces and when they sally thundered and uttered their voices once he's wrote about the seals come on are you following my thought he wrote about seal one seal two seal three four five six and seven if nothing else he wrote silence in heaven i'm watching now when the seven thunders had under their voices seven thunder uttered their their voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is 700 and write them not out my head's not working he's told not to ride john was never told not to write revelation 6 1 over to the end of it and then eight one he was told to write it then when you get to revelations 10 the book is open it came open in chapter 6 through chapter 8 right the nines on earth what if it is what i saw one ago versus one of them the dead hushly silence in heaven with them looking down here to see what's going on he said don't write it you know that daniel heard the thunders now i didn't give them to put up on the screen but he can probably run it hurry and hurt him and grab a few hundred let's write him down you'll heard because that's what they can do the best is in 1954 719 which is god's provided way of healing paragraph e12 remember daniel heard those seven voices listen to the reading heard their voices and he started to write he said don't write it it'll reveal it in the last days was daniel told in chapter 12 i think it is seal up the book daniel heard the prophet said those seven voices message on revelation book of symbols 56 6 17. daniel was told by the angel daniel heard seven thunders right they uttered their voices daniel grabbed his pen and started to write and the angel says don't you write it right now you read the book of daniel and you'll find not daniel hearing seven thunders so don't go looking for it this is it's not dire and verbatim words but when daniel sees the end time in the 12th chapter he's told to seal up the book and the prophecy i think it might even be the ninth shelter but anyhow i said to book it down you know seal up the book right don't write it until the end the run city heard the thunders division church age 1960 1205 and daniel heard the thunders and forbidden and john heard the voices and this book was sealed with seven seals daniel heard the thunders and john heard the voices but i read just above there that daniel heard the voices 1962 909 in his presence daniel heard the voice as the thunders and was forbidden to write john was prevented to write it but it's still on the back side of the book where does the thunder sound brother branham paragraph three five through three one eight of the is this the sign of the end sir 62 12 30. look where the voices was the thunders not in heaven from the heavens they uttered from the earth and i was about to write when i heard the voice from heaven saying unto me seal up capital s-e-a-l see what those things which the seven thunders and write them not um what is brother brown what is a thunder well it's a blue blue blue finger yep and you remember elijah was in the cave and he heard the thunder and the lightning and the wind but he wouldn't come out until he heard the still small voice that's right do you want all the loud blessings and hollering like the preachers of this message do or do you want to steal small voice speaking to you where does this understand what around this sound on earth amen they don't sound in heaven there's no scripture putting it in heaven in heaven it's a sealed up book and the lamb comes forth to open the book but it's only after the book is basically totally made manifest does he come forth to open the book it's after the 2000 years which means it's already the six seals is already almost completed except for the tribulation period coming on what is it thunder brother brian program 146 first seal what the thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of god that's what the bible said see a clapper thunder they thought it was thunder do you remember that jesus when it was out there with him you know they thought it thunder but it was god he understood for it was revealed to him see it was a thunder i got 148 first steal it thundered as soon as the lounge struck back to seal what did it reveal not all of it said first it was god next is the symbol then it's revealed see he's it's coming from the throne can't be seen or heard it's sealed up the lounge blood paid the pride it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a while horse rider started out it was still a symbol program 152 the first seal the voices of thunder the voice came from blur now you're gonna i hope you can get that milk all right you got it good because see you're going to think i'm throwing you a curve because i just got through saying the thunder's never sounded in heaven they sound on earth your prophets when it said now look at him what he's saying it sounds like he's gonna throw you a curve but he's not the voice is a thunder the voice came from word from the throne where the lamb had just left his intercessor he's standing here to take his position he's claimed but the thunder came from the inside the throne thundered out the lamb was standing out here thunder where the lamb had left the father strong to go to take his own trunk i thought we believed that we were the throne that's right i thought we believe this is where god is at right that's not throwing a curve that's telling exactly what it is because remember in revelations 10 of what it says in revelations 10 it says that what don't try to pull it back up on you and he cried with a loud voice and when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders earned their voices where from from heaven coming down to earth he's delivering the revelation to his prophet so it's exactly right the thunder sounds on earth but the voice is in heaven the one who's sounding it is in heaven the prophet has got to catch it and speak it or we don't hear it do you understand why i put so much emphasis on the prophet he catches it and he can speak it and we hear it the thunder is on earth the one who's hearing and writing but here it comes from glory we're the lamb that took the book he's down here with you and i folks the thunder's the voice of god when the seal breaks it's not in heaven it's on earth daniel was told by the angel daniel heard seven thunders they uttered their voices daniel heard his pen and started to write the angel said don't write it daniel heard the thunders what is a thunder brother brown it's the voice of god when the seal breaks have you heard his voice that's right see those seven thunders seals back up the book only the bride will have the seven thunders even though the angel has broken even though it was written in the word nobody can understand it with the bride he's the only one who has the ability to hear the voice of god what is the thunder brother dale what are you saying the thunder's the voice of god has he spoke to you as he spoke to you by way of the prophet messenger what a wonderful day to be able to stand here and realize before by him that lived forever and ever the time would be no longer but in the seventh verse he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he said begin to sound the mysteries of god would be revealed may i state it this way in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the seven thunders will be revealed by the prophet those seven thunders is what holds those seals if you stay up in heaven where everybody wants to go then you're not down here where god is at not down here where he's revealing himself you're not down here where the seals are really coming into reality you're not down here where christ is christ speaking to you you see that's why you'll never know what that seal is until that voice speaks to you no man can call jesus the christ what accepted me by the holy ghost that perforation that we get around the holy ghost that speaks to you revealing to you what this prophet has said is that not the voice of god that's why it's not seven men like some used to think of the thunders were seven men and they'd name all seven literal men no how long have you got to stay this afternoon the prophet of god said there was an angel met him daily in the room you need those quotes angel met him daily in the room to bring him to revelation that's why he so cherished the looks of those angels when he saw it and the seventh was the one so you know connected to him why he said the one with the seventh seal you're going to find out eventually that there wasn't seven seals to be revealed there was one seal to be broke and that was the seventh to you and i and that's god speaking by way of a mouthpiece can stick straight to you and i and we can see it but without christ in you by the new birth you can't hear what is being said it is only vain jangling of words but if you have the new birth you can say well brother dale you mean to tell me god's been talking to me that's right god's been talking to you and i by way of a prophet i thought that's what we believe i thought we believed he was god's mouthpiece and it was you used to speak god's mysteries to you and i'm see then there was seven voices of the seven thunders that we just read because each one came daily to telling the prophet a voice came to the prophet every day to tell him what that seal was then you could tie together the angel of the lord it would meet him in the room you could tie together the holy spirit that would be in the room you can tie together a lot of things when you say it and that's what we're going to do when we finish one more message we're going to go through the seventh seal to see what it was to the prophet and see that that's got to be in you then you'll find out he wasn't talking about himself he was talking about the word of the lord amos three and seven i'll do nothing but i'll show my secrets to the prophets we've had a prophet to come in our day to deliver a message unto us that's right and that prophet would be the voice of god you remember in a tape where the random voice would be talking god said this is not brother this is not william brown or brother brown or whatever this is god speaking that i'm just using his voice brother brown and when he gets over in the seal book he said look it's been the angels of the lord not been a man bringing us back here for this message tonight have you heard his voice go home put on a tape put one on going home and listen to the voice of god yeah lord i found where he made mistakes that wasn't the voice of god no problem right when he said holy ghost and you know instead of saying antichrist from the white horse rider that wasn't god but you better be careful what you say about him on there because he comes down through that message and says if i'm wrong god will vindicate it and god did so i wouldn't argue too much with him about it you see the voice of god come to you and i to a prophet amen that way we don't need nobody to interpret it we just need to believe it let's start come on brother silence in heaven is what the title was put on because you see if you listen to what i'm saying until that voice speaks to you there's nothing going on to you but when he starts revealing himself like those angels and all standing in all looking at the earth as to seeing a bride of jesus christ be coming to work they know the thunders will issue it forth pretty soon see we're finding out there's a lot of things under the seventh seal that those people don't deal with to find out maybe there's some things where we need comprehend but we need to understand it here i'm not trying to go to heaven today to find out what's going on up there all right paul went up there and come back and said i can't even tell you what went on up there so why do we want to get up our farm right let's take it where we got down here and then we can go up there what are we going to do oh my voice um everyday let me go becoming the word of god they realized plenty of times every day love everyday oh your words you start talking to them about one god and they just back away from them until god revealed listening to what it said about the problem rejecting the word is you got no choice remember the services we prayed the lord blessed remember that this is coming down to christmas time that we never have tried to have to say we had to put christ into christmas no we don't take him out we know really what it's all about but we don't have to worry about it like the prophet we've listened the other night there where he was saying he said you know about them little kids you know the little kids he said he's talking to an 18 month old baby now how much of an 18 month old baby second like what he said he said that little girl said he said something about she was saying you know got jingle bells jingle bells he said something i forgot how it went but he did something about santa claus she said that's my daddy he said well that's the way we need to have it that's my daddy we've never put emphasis upon christmas but we've never thought it off either we've always said put up a tree if you want one if you don't want one don't put it up anybody throws off on either way you're wrong because we want to stay that way your prophet had a christmas tree so there's no problem with putting one up right but if you don't want one up nobody loves it of course it's kind of late now anyway you know i didn't do this about a month ahead of time but just don't go off on nobody you know what i mean there's no problem the greatest gift could ever give anybody this time of the year is to tell them about jesus christ amen father we thank you for today and we ask you to just bless us now as we go our separate ways we pray that what we've said lord is needful we try you just help us open our eyes that we may see you lord and guide us in that understanding hand forgive our sins keep us in your love be with everybody on the highway give a safe journey let your light shine in our hearts and lives that the world may see truly a christmas example in our hearts and our lives not about a santa claus but about a resurrected lord jesus christ to walk in us in jesus name amen you dismissed a woman in the bible god is cuz is just remember what it is amen
