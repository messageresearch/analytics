our miss tonight brother paul and sis header god bless you and uh doris uh dora leah and our son is it liam god bless you all for coming and um we just want to thank the almighty god for tonight um as i was coming tonight again i was thinking and uh that thought struck me again that the amateur paratrooper is coming back but praise be to god the lord our god has always been faithful god doesn't care about numbers the bible says well two or three i got it in my name there i am in the amazed if i came and there was only one person praise be to god we are ready to have service and now when brother one told me on friday to get ready i was wondering was it nope today's uh that was monday to get ready i was wondering a lot of things were crossing my mind here and there and i thought i had something to talk about and between yesterday and today a lot has happened and i just want us to have an honest conversation it's not about you know just coming to please anybody of course no preacher will come behind the property because he wants to hurt anybody's feelings we are all trusting in the leadership of the holy spirit so take your focus off me and i believe it's always been the case it doesn't matter how much you love a preacher whether he's the best preacher or your i mean whoever he may be never keep your focus on the man let your focus be on the holy spirit and see where the spirit of the lord is going praise be to god so tonight we have a few things we are going to look at i am not sure if i'm ever going to get my message but if i don't praise be to god if there comes another time i wouldn't mind looking at it again tonight may be the last time i've ever talked about it um i don't know sometimes there is a bedding on your heart and then for some reason it just fills us out and we never find it coming back again so i am not sure if i'm going to do justice to this topic because i feel very much unprepared but my preparedness doesn't mean anything before the lord praise be to god so tonight if we can just stand for the reading of the word we are reading tonight from [Music] isaiah 14 12 and 13. so it's just going to be a little teaching um praise be to god isaiah 14 12 and 13. i read how are that fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which this weakened the nations for thou has said in thine hearts i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of congregation in the sights of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high shall we turn to revelations the book of revelations 12 7. revelations 12 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which is deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him praise be to god may the lord add his blessings to the reading of sword shall we be seated so tonight i titled this message a seat of contest a seat of contest but before we get to my message tonight as i said a lot of things were just coming my way and i just had to write them down it's just amazing that the hour and the time we are living in we all know how close we are to the end and if there was any time that man was very reckless is this very time we are living we have gotten so so so close and yet we don't seem to care about anything the bible says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man life was normal there was nothing out of the ordinary things were going on okay they were marrying giving in marriage businesses were flourishing people were going out and coming in as usual nothing changed out of the ordinary that did not stop nowhere from preaching the word of god he kept on talking about the word over and over and i believe at the point that people were disturbed what is this that the man is talking about over and over and he never stops i am 80 years old now and this man has never stopped and they probably send much instruments into display into space and to go and come back and tell them that the space is very very dry not even an atom of water out there in space and they were wondering is this man out of his mind if they knew when it was the final call if they knew that was the final call a lot of them would have changed their minds before the flood came but when they had the final call they thought it was one of those things because this has been going on for a long time so don't mind that man he's out of his mind it's one of those things little did they know that that was the final call tonight could be the last day as i said it's going to be a little teaching service tonight and i just trust and believe that god is going to speak to us before we leave here tonight there is there is no crop that would ever flourish without rain rain is good for crops without rain there is no farmer that is going to harvest so rain crops need rain to grow but the rain that falls in spring is different from the rain that falls in fall you say oh it's the same rain coming from the heavens yes it is the same rain coming from the heavens but they are completely different the rain in spring comes to give life the cross are there when the rain comes they are happy and they just spring forth they come back to life and they are ready ready to flourish the same rain comes in fall and then the crops are dying their trees are turning yellow their life is getting out is the same rain and that is the same way it is with the word of god the word of god comes to give life if the word of god comes to you and does not give you life what it brings to you is judgment that's right and that is a dangerous place to be wonder word you can get to a place that the word of god does not lead you to salvation but rather leads you into judgment that is a dangerous thing never take the grace of god for granted make use of the grace of god as it comes yes sir there is a saying that you make hay while the sun shines so you don't make hay when the sun is setting at that point is useless we can talk about eso when he saw his birthright right the bible says he sought after it with tears right i never found it when the grace of god comes to you and you recognize or realize what god is doing and you take a step of faith god honest that but when you keep turning the grace of god away and you just feel god is talking to you you keep turning it down it gets to a point the same word comes to you and you don't feel anything right right sure can pour an anointing oil a bottle of anointing oil on you and pray for you and nothing happens sure when a man has crossed that line of grace it is a dangerous thing even though you are still alive it is a very dangerous place to be so remember this is not my message but it's in line with what i'm going to talk about tonight in a world we are going to come to these things some of these things not everything of course so seek him while he can be found for there is coming a time when you will seek him and would not find him you know now is the time to seek him i'm not trying to scare anybody we have gotten so reckless with our lives that we can be on facebook hours upon hours and we never get tired we can even sit all through the night [Music] just on social media and we never get asleep but we can come to the house of god under the anointing of the word of god and then we sit down and then we just pass out in sleep and sometimes we are here our eyes are open and our minds are far away we need to mean business with god yes yes again never take the grace of god for granted a question just came to mind but i wouldn't ask that question for now i'll probably ask you towards the end of the service the bible says if you hear his voice this day hiding out your heart as in the provocation hebrews 3 15 and 4 7 if you hear his voice this day hiding out your heart there is something there is a connection between hearing the voice of god and hardening your heart if you hear his voice this day how did not your heart ask in the provocation there is a coordination i say again between hearing the voice of god and what is the voice of god brother abraham said the voice of god is the word of god so when you hear god talking to you do not hide in your heart because the danger is when the word comes and you turn the word down right and the word keeps coming and you keep turning the word down what happens is that you are hurting your heart when we read can we turn our bibles to hebrews 3 15. no that wouldn't be the scripture i'm looking for um that will be exodus exodus 4 21 sorry exodus 421 okay exodus 4 21 and the anger of the lord sorry um 421 where am i i think i've mixed my scriptures up here i don't know why i got this from but um exodus 4 21 does not actually represent what i want to talk about here tonight and the lord said unto moses when thou goes okay it is and the lord said unto moses when thou goest and return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but our heart in his heart that he shall not let the people go so first moses was going to perform the miracles right he was going to do what god has asked him to do moses was going to tell pharaoh the mind of god and what god wanted them right then thereafter the hearing of the heart was going to come because he would not allow the people to go now when you read here god was not on a mission to come and hide in pharaoh's heart so he could condemn him he would just let him sit in his seat and just kill him in a second that was starting for god but there is a lesson here i want us to look at now let's go to first samuel 6 6. first somewhere six six wherefore then do ye had in your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their house when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed so the book of samuel is telling us that pharaoh and the egyptians hardened their hearts and when you read the book of exodus is saying god had in their hearts now as i was saying in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god right the word of god is god so when the word comes to you or when god speaks to you and you get so stubborn and would not yield and you are so stuck in your ways the word keeps coming and coming and coming and what it does is that it hardens your heart hearty not your heart it is in your hands you can decide whether you want to or not we don't come to church for fun we come to church believing that god will talk to us and when you know god has spoken to you you know it yes when i hear the voice of god and i know something is said i can put my finger on it and i can claim it i tell myself this is for me but when you come to god and you can sit all through the service and you don't hear the voice of god i i don't know how you feel i don't know the bible says the word of god is good for reproof for instruction for correction and it is good for doctrine and if you come to church in all the ways god can talk to you and then you leave after service you are living the same way you came in sure then uh my question is why did you even come in the first place it's time to do an introspection right set your heart don't let you know yourself more than anybody knows you don't let somebody pamper you or make you feel good by telling you things you know are not right when you are living the life you know you are living the life if you are not living the life you know you are not living the life it's time to hold them fast because any moment it will all be over any moment it will all be over we say oh it's been 100 years it's been 200 years it's been thousand two thousand years since they've been talking about about all these things it has never happened don't worry another thousand years don't let the devil deceive you because that is what he is good at praise be to god as i said it's just a little teaching tonight i have not started yet whenever i start that is good i'm just laying a little foundation praise beauty god amen yes so [Music] in the message in the message conference i wrote something down here and um just took this quote to back it up now if you hear the word and he doesn't leave your salvation it brings judgment as we have said to receive the word is to receive god to reject the word is to reject god and that is judgment it's like having the blood on your hands the blood of the lord jesus christ on your hands and brethren said having the blood of the lord on your hands is judgment is judgment yes but when that same blood is applied to your soul is salvation it depends on where the blood is applied you don't want to have the blood of the lord jesus on your hands we are children of god and i'm just you know tonight i don't know which way we are going to go but i'm trusting as i've said that is for a good cause i believe praise be to god look i want you to notice something here bravo speaking conference 1957 is so striking moses commanded that they take his up and dip it into the blood of the lamb and spread it over the door the blood of course represented the blood of christ the hyssop was common with you could find anywhere just pick up a handful of ways it shows that the blood is so simple to apply the wisd represented faith just faith in god you don't have to go somewhere else just take the faith of god the faith of god i was at the last time brother brother brother jordan preached he was talking about faith and that the faith you have it's not even your faith i was seated over there and it struck me so hard a lot of the times we say we have faith we have faith we have faith and you realize that the faith is not even yours god has to give you faith to believe in his word there is only one way by which faith comes the bible says faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god so it is the word of god that brings you faith so it is god giving you faith yes absolutely but a man in himself naturally there is nothing in you to believe in the world god has to give it to you if you need faith talk to god just read your bible the basic things we ought to do as christians read your bible and pray every day you want faith read your bible and pray every day you won't fight listen to the tips listen to the prophet you want help live by the word um that is how faith comes do not think that by fasting 40 days and 40 nights faith will just drop anywhere no god is not going to sidestep his wife [Music] god so much esteemed his own word that when he came he did not disregard his word right and you think god would disregard his word for you no way no sir praise be to god the faith of god the wish represented faith just faith in god you don't have to go anywhere else just take the faith of god and apply the faith to your heart say i am separated from the things of the world because by faith i apply the blood to my case this morning i shall be healed because i apply the blood over the lentil of my heart i will never let doubt strike me again for i will protect myself by placing the blood of jesus by faith my hyssop over my door and no enemy will enter in i will never disbelieve god's word anymore praise be to god faith in god's word that is what overcomes the enemy you may never understand what god is doing you don't have to understand if god gives you grace to understand praise god but you don't have to understand everything god is doing as a matter of fact you don't you don't sometimes you don't even know what god is doing until it is done right then you can look back and then you say oh it was god but it is done right that is why we need patience in this journey with our lord my mom we need the patience of god patience is very crucial i remember in our new year meeting um you know that little time we had i talked about having patience with yourself be patient with yourself right be patient with others be patient with god brother ben narada came and then he walks right in be patient with yourself be patient with god be patient with others you need to be patient in our lives as christians you need to be patient at home as a family you need to be patient yeah at work you need to be patient with others right now when you if you leave your family and you look at somebody else's family and you see everything going on very well and then you come to your house and say why is everything going on wrong in this house you don't know what god is doing can you imagine a farmer going to somebody's farm and then he looks at his crops yes and then the corn is looking so nice maybe five feet tall and then he goes back to his farm and then he looks at his farm and then he said why are you three feet tall i planted you at the same time that never planted this corn right dark corn is five feet tall why are you three feet you are going to get five feet tall today you hold every one of them five feet five feet five feet by the time you are done you have no fun it's true praise the lord you don't know what god is doing right absolutely just be patient with god be patient with yourself be patient with others we need peace a lot of patience in this journey patience is something that we lack so so badly i just i think okay not i think so we are going to change things a little over here praise be to god yes so remember that in our walk with god never never never underestimate what god can do in your life yes sir if a dry stick a dry stick can blossom yes sir praise if dead bones not somebody that is sick dead completely dead and right if they can come back to life think about what god would do with you that is a life yes ma'am a lot of the times we don't yield too much that's right we just want to give a portion of our lives to god right and we want to hold on to another portion yes it is either god is in the driver's seat or he is not there is a lot god can do in your life if you completely surrender yes sir do not look at you because there is nothing good in a man to look at no maybe there are things good in your life that is good but there is nothing good in a man to look at always keep your focus on god if you are the type that love to go into your dirty laundry once in a while the devil will make sure he keeps you busy because that dirty laundry is always there and then he'll keep throwing things at you right through keep your focus on god amen the past is behind us yes and if ever you have to remind yourself or think of the past is to see the greatness of god where god took you from yes sir what god has done in your life how far he has brought to you absolutely but not to look at your past and then crave for it in any way form of shame right it's so rotten and filthy nothing good in the past no sir keep your focus on god praise be to god amen we are going to study this anyhow anywhere we reach praise be to god amen now a seed of contest what is the context bro said in the message contest he said contest is a show of power praise be to god a shot of power now it doesn't take one person to engage in a contest right if it's just one person there is no contest right winner takes all but for it to be a contest ought to be another person yes interested in whatever it is somebody else must be in the picture for it to be a contest yes so a contest is a show of power the bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers against rulers of darkness evil spirits what have you you can mention them right so we are wrestling against spirits praise be to god now you know there are many things uh we could base this on the prophet speaking um just in a minute but i want to speak of these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest there is does between the church and satan the great strength of satan and we want to speak of the great strength of god in his church now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and satan was kicked out into the earth and then he become an enemy to god's people and since then he has used all his strength and his strategy to try to pull god's people across the fires or into the into his fires and we know who has the most power god does and god when he gave his people the best thing that he could he could to combat satan with what's his word right now because the word is god and god is stronger and who is stronger than god so the word is god and the word becomes our strength god in the church becomes his strength to pull satan to his own fires that he has made praise be to god amen so you begin to think what is the value of a church without god when a body would put god out of the church right and god is no longer part of what is going on in that church in that assembly what is the value of that church if god is the strength yeah our strength as a body and god is not part of what we are doing here then we better close our bibles and just go home we have to make sure that as an assembly or as individuals as families that you look in the mirror of god's word yeah and then you see yourself if you read the bible and you don't see god talking to you go back and read it again yes sir it is not how many pages you read a day that matters it doesn't mean anything right if you have to take a single scripture and they just stay on it for days and weeks and see god unfolding this in your life speak it to you day in day out stay there until you feel that oh god has completely dealt with you right now then if you have to move on move on right it is not reading from genesis to revelation right no right it's good so oh i can say that i have read all the bible ten times already and out of the ten times what have you got in arabic right here amen praise be to god we must see the word becoming flesh in our lives on a daily basis every good investor when they come to the end of the year what they do is that they analyze their books they see they they they try to find out why did we go right why did we go wrong how much did you make how much did we lose right and then they tried to rest strategize right and if they made a mistake somewhere they don't go back doing the same thing over again no they try to change the strategy this time right and every child of god the good christian that you are when you come to the end of the year take stock of your life look at yourself look at yourself where you started from and see is the end of the year already where am i with god sure and sometimes we start with god here and by the time the year ends we are down here and then we do not change anything in our lives we still go on doing the same thing over and over and we expect a miracle to happen miracles don't happen that way no sir god is not a magician miracles don't happen that way that you go on doing the same old things and you expect something new to happen it doesn't happen that way you must challenge yourself challenge yourself settle for anything less right don't look across your shoulder and probably you see a brother or a sister who is doing something out of the way and you tell yourself oh we are brothers we are sisters this is doing why can't i do it you should know better than that right you should know better than that yes sir if there is anything to copy or to learn from somebody's life they should be the good things right why should you let something buy from somebody yeah one time in our morning devotion i was asking the children i said look i'm your daddy but when you come between daddy and god you must choose god if you choose me i'll never be proud of you and remember god will never be proud of you i said behold if you were driving behind me and i was in front of you doing 60 or 80 and then i slid off the road and entered the ditch or the swamp would you say oh i love my daddy so much let me just follow him into the ditch you are not going to do that you know better than that praise be to god the best and the most reasonable thing you would do is you pack up there probably call for help of come there to help me out right you will not drive in there because your lord that did too much that means there is something wrong here right sure if there is anything to learn if there is anything to emulate there should be the good things but a lot of the times people get attracted to the bathrooms if this one is doing why can't i do it sure the bible says do not follow or that's the same yes right a seat of contest where i have reached i know that will not finish this but it was not meant to be finished so if you don't finish it there is nothing wrong with that so a seat of contest a seat in other words a true now it can be political sure like we have the white house um it can be a monarchy like we have buckingham palace uh we have other kingdoms still around um it can be traditional right these are all seats so it does not matter whether it is a traditional authority whether it's a political entity whether it is a monarchy a seat or a throne is viewed across the same level sure now there is there is so much power and authority that is vested in a throne or in a seat for that matter now every throne or every seat has its fortification you can't just somebody like me i can't just walk straight to the white house and tell the people i'm here to see the president [Music] you must be somebody right to be able to walk through that door you're right not everybody is able to just come in and say i want to see the president right you have to call identify yourself who you are book an appointment and then you go to the gates before you even get there they have they have they have we are in the technology technological world they have already seen you coming you are going through the gates there are mechanisms there to make sure that extra machines there is nothing on you that is going to harm the president right and you go in there and all eyes are on you there are people on their computers you are not seeing them but they are looking at you you are being monitored yes and you will say maybe it's just a political authority alone no there is a place i know of in africa it's not easy to see their king when you come you have to book an appointment it's probably more difficult to see that king than it is to see the american president here sure and when you get to the gates and you see the people with their mercedes and their eyes so red if you had any evil motive nobody would advise you and when they open the gates and then you enter the gates and they close the door behind you you know from that point on that you have to behave yourself because if you misbehave you will not leave to tell the story there is so much power and authority right on the trunk or on the seat remember we are talking of a seat of contest now there is so much power and authority in the seat so much so that it becomes an envy the envy of an angel at the envy of the people right right those who love it love it for what it is yeah and those who hate it hate it for the same reason absolutely so when you look at i didn't know i didn't know the computers here the computers in america were a little different from those in africa when i was typing and i'm putting cool detail the computer flat it how many how many here know what a code it is what is that presbyter yes very good too overthrow an insurrection i mean in africa that one has happened a lot and the computers in africa know it you putting a cool detail anywhere in africa the computer will fake it but i put in cool detail here the computer didn't know it i said wow i'm not surprised oh my god so yes the soldiers in africa have disturbed the system a lot you just go to bed one night and then you wake up the following morning and then you hear a soldier speaking on on on on on on the news they have taken over the the administration of the country and then that is the end of it they have overthrown the constitution now the military is going to rule so any time there is an insurrection or there is a coup d'etat all the mayhem all the problem all the killing all the destruction is aimed at getting to the seat of government when there is a rebel movement any part of the country they are not fighting and running away from the from from that room they are actually fighting and they are making gains and they are coming straight to the capital where the seat of government is that is why they are coming they may kill people on the way they may dig holes on the road they may set houses on fire that is not where their interest is they their interest is in the seat of government their interest is in the true on the throne that is why they are coming and they will come and even when they enter the city i don't care if they control 99 of the country that one percent that is left which is the seat of the which is the seat of government or which is the throne if they don't capture it they know they don't have power right right yes and they would come and as i said every throne has a fortification you go to the castles you go to the presidential machines there are walls barricades and what have you and they come and they are outside and they are putting bullet holes everywhere it doesn't matter how many bullet holes they put on the wall so long as they don't get the president right they know they don't have authority right the authority is not in the building it is not in the architecture of the building it is not how nice the paint is but inside the building there is an authority and that is what they want and if they can destroy everything and still not get the president the president may be in his bunker and still giving announcement and telling the country everything is under control every everybody is believing him right and not the people that want to overtake power a seat of contest that is how strong a tron is yes and that is how much attraction it has praise be to god [Music] and now as we read the bible says there was war in heaven yeah why because satan lucifer at the time right wanted to pitch his throne yes above the stance yes he wanted the throne of god he wanted to sit on the throne of god in the seat of god and be worshipped right as god yes remember we are talking about a seat of context yes the bible says godliness with contentment it's a great game be happy what god has made you yes sir don't desire to be to be like anybody don't convert don't convert whatever god has blessed you be happy god has placed you there lucifer was not happy right with all the powers he had yes he wasn't happy but he wanted to sit on the train of god and be worshipped as god right and we all know the story i'm not going to waste my time so much there and there was one in heaven against lucifer and his angels against michael and his angels yes and lucifer and his angels were cast out of heaven there was no more place for them in heaven there were cats down here on earth right and that was where the trouble began yeah praise be to god amen now i'm going to fast forward because i have spent too much time already so fast forward now when when the devil calls the fall in the garden of eden the bible says the day you eat of the tree that day you will surely die yeah and satan comes and says you will not surely die but we all know the story that from the day man eight of the fruit from that day man died because a dead to god is thousand years to man and there is no man that has lived more than a thousand years before if any man ever lived beyond thousand years then that scripture is broken but scripture can never be broken praise be to god yes and from that day and while i was looking at this this something else just jumped at me and i thought we should say praise be to god amen now every man has a day to live it doesn't matter whether you live for 10 years 50 years 100 years 969 years it doesn't make any difference every human being every man has a day to live now when you look at a day a day comprises of daylight or light and then a portion of it is darkness sure now we can argue that towards the poles i have not been to norway before but i hear people talk about norway but towards the polls they can have almost 24 hours of daylight in summer right and then the night is just very short and it doesn't get very dark right we can argue that but don't also forget that when that is happening for six months there is another six months whitish are going to overturn right that they are going to be plagued with darkness yes for six months right so it brings us back yes to the same to the same place so when you take a day a day comprises of light and a portion of it is darkness there is nothing you can do about it right true very good now what's our look looking at this in every human life in every human life you have your time of sunshine and there comes a time of darkness that you wished you were never born it doesn't happen the same way like it happened to job it doesn't happen the same way to everybody job his time of sunlight when everything was so nice life was good everything was perfectly well right until his battle started and then he had to go into that night hour yes where he cursed the day he was born now when you look at the lord jesus christ he was light he is light yes the life of the world but guess what even he as the light of the world he had his time of darkness praise be to god very brother said in the message i know my redeemer leaveth the darkest hour this world ever seen was good friday when our hopes all was written all the hopes they had was what was written on paper all the hopes they had was what some philosopher had said and there was the prince of life dying at calvary it was the darkest hour the world ever seen praise be to god amen if he be in the light yes had his darkest moment right and he says if any man comes after me let him deny himself take out his cross and follow me daily you think you are going to be you you think you're going to be free no no it's not going to happen right if everything is so rosy if everything is so good if everything is falling right in place and there are no obstacles there are no battles to fight you have to question yourself that's right because the bible has made it clear that whosoever he loves he chastises right if he went through it that means we will surely go through it right yours may be in the morning yeah it may be in the afternoon it may be in the evening but always remember that a day which every man has to live it doesn't matter how long you live but you have a day to live that there is a portion of it that you wished you could maintain for the rest of your life and there is a portion of it that you would hate it never came your way right praise be to god if you never come to that point sure praise be to god because it's not a good place to be and there are moments where you would you would i mean you would ask yourself a lot of questions sure wonder whether there is anything wrong wonder whether you are walking in the wild of god wonder whether you are a child of god right but do not let the devil ever tell you otherwise know that you are a child of god fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of god praise be to god now now a seat of contest when the devil was cast out of heaven he was cast here onto this earth i know our time is almost um so i'll be i'll be very fast i'm going to summarize it praise be to god now when the devil was cast out of heaven he was cast unto the earth and he never stopped working he never stopped working the devil has never stopped working no what he didn't achieve there as a matter of fact he has achieved it here sure he has never stopped working and the devil is working overtime out of the 24 hours we have a day 24 hours we have in a day the devil is working 36 hours a day he is overworking right and out of the 24 hours we have in a day how many hours in a day do we actually seek the face of god sure do we learn to wait on god you know do we let do do we commune with god do we do we do we have time for god do we have time with god oh my god praise be to god it's not to say that the other things you are doing are not important that is not what i'm saying work is important either there's no way should know it what is important schooling is good sure education is nice if you can go to school and learn very well and work less and make more money and have more time for god that is a good thing to do sure um business is good making money is good i'm not against all that but how many how many how many hours in that 24 hours when the devil that is working against you is working over time how many of those 24 hours do you seek the face of god right how much of that 24 hours do you spend with god no is it all about you is life all about you if life is all about you then know that there is a problem somewhere yes sir when the devil was cast out of heaven he has never stopped working right now david said in sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was i shaping come to the world telling lies so now after the fall according to god's permissive will any man that was ever born in his flesh was born into sin right you didn't have to tell the first lie no you were born into it right so at that point the devil had complete hold of your life but in here somewhere in here was the seed of god that was lying down dormant waiting for his time of manifestation there are times and seasons yes in the kingdom of god it was just in the doormat and the devil was just pushing you here and there you didn't know who you were you were just jumping left and right center just taking you as you were smart thinking you were enjoying life sure everything was just going on now from the first time that you begin to hear the voice of god as a matter of fact sometimes you don't even know what you are hearing sure but something in you tells you that this voice is different praise be to god you know sometimes we think you have to become a christian before you see the hand of god as a matter of fact i was a muslim sure i was a muslim when i saw the hand of god that brought me from the islamic religion into christianity i have shared that dream with a lot of people i have had a lot of dreams i'm not talking of the bad ones but a lot of dreams spiritual dreams yeah and i never thought of sharing it until i went somewhere shared it and it was blessed that it blessed them so much then i thought of it but just just to talk about this i was a muslim at the time i don't know if time would even permit us praise be to god but god knows his children i mean let me just go so you know i was a muslim at the time and i was living in a compound house and those of you who come from africa you know those compound houses they build sometimes 24 rooms with one big gate and you have the toilet and a toilet and bath for men 20 and bad for women so i came out about midnight went and used the restroom and when i came back and entered the room i was not i was barely asleep i entered the room and i lay on the bed i was sliding on my back and the door opened and fire about this size just came through the door and the door closed and the fire just came straight i was lying down then i was wondering what is this i was looking at it it came so close and stopped about this distance and then i felt weight there was a weight something just pressed me to the bed and i was just lying and looking at it and then the the fire just illuminated like the headlamp of a car it was so bright and sharp i wanted to close my eyes but i saw there was a writing inside the flame so i was trying to read it while i was trying to close my eyes and i saw in that flame of fire i saw written the light and my brains just went round in my skull and i shouted jesus and then the light condensed back to its original form and then it happened again the second time my brain went right then i shouted jesus it happened three times and then when it condensed back the weight just came off me the fire just went it got to the door the door opened it went out and the door closed when i woke up i didn't sleep again right the following morning i used to have a prayer mat i went and took my bath when i came i put the prayer mouth in front of the door and i wrapped my feet on it and i entered the house so a lady saw it he said he needs to call me sadat sadat what are you doing is that your prayer mat i say yes he said he said you enter hell i said praise god so that was the end of my muslim journey sometimes you think you think that you have to start your work with god no god knows his children the way god is going to bring you in is different from the way he's going to do to somebody else but god has his eyes on his children when you are wondering who you are when you do not know who you are when you have this identity crisis going on in your mind yes sir god's eyes are upon you and in here there is that seed of life that god is keeping watch over praise be to god now oh my our time is up but you know what our time is up i knew i was not going to finish this thing praise be to god as i said it was just teaching um not nothing about so much so you know what let me just chip this in so when the devil was cast out he never stopped working right so now when you are born with that sinful nature and you come into this life the devil has so much control over your life even though you are a child of god that seed of god that representation is in here but at that point the devil has so much control over your life now when you come to the realization of who you truly are right sure when that light begins to shine in your life when that season has come for you for god to manifest himself before you and you now identified you who you truly are that you are not the man after this flesh this fallen flesh right but that you are a son or a daughter of god and you take your position amen you know what the devil gets out right yeah and when the devil is getting out god is stepping in hallelujah praise be to god amen now somewhere the bible says that when the devil goes when the devil is cast out of a man and he goes after some time he comes back to check to see this house was clean let me see is this clean and empty when it's clean and empty the bible says it's going to invite several more wicked spirits and the end of that man is going to be worse than his beginning but when he comes and he spies in there and the master is there he salutes him and then he has to run away praise be to god so what happens when the devil leaves the devil doesn't go completely when god is in the inside there is something about a man that keeps the devil so close sure this guy here this guy here can never be redeemed right right it keeps the devil so close even though god is in the inside and the devil knows he can't come in the devil can never unseat god right when god has taken over the throne when god has taken over the seats the devil can never overthrow god but do you know what the devil can do now man was created as a free moral agent you have that power in your hand that's right you can decide what you want to do that's right right if you decide to call it a quit not to have anything to do with god to give up your confidence in god your praising god then you have made way for the devil to come and occupy their sins but so long as you are holding on so long as you keep believing in god so long as you take your position i don't care what the storm brings your way the devil can never get in there but is he going to stop fighting he is never going to stop this is why the mind barrel starts yes in the greatest battle ever fought which brother branham preached the mind is the battleground yes sir why satan and god peace yes right to fight yes and you know the mind is different from the brain yeah the mind is spiritual sure the brain is physical right if you're a brain surgeon you can operate upon a man and you see their brain right but there is no way you can ever cut open a man and then you see their mind right it's spiritual right like the prophet said love is spiritual yeah you say you have love of somebody you don't see it right you can't cut open the person's heart and see oh this is how much love the person has right but you know when there is love yes so the mind is the battleground right and oh you know what yes praise be to god so now all that the devil will be throwing at you all the pain he'll be inflicting on this body sure like he did to job sure all the hardships all the sicknesses all the diseases be true or anything everything the devil brings your way he is doing it to weaken your faith to let you lose confidence in the word of god and in your protection the word is our protection right yes sir and take your mass filter the word is our protection now when you lose your confidence in the word of god what does it do you begin to turn your back on the world yes then the devil comes in when the devil inflicts you with any pain it's not because he's interested in your flesh when the devil strikes you with poverty it is not because he is interested in your flesh right when the devil strikes you with failures and disappointments it's not because he's interested in your flesh right all the fights all the war all the chaos all the storms all the problems the devil is going to bring your way it's not because he is interested in your flesh it is because he is interested in the throne there is a tron in your heart the throne of god right and god is seated on that throne the devil fought for that throne in heaven and he lost it that's right and he is cast here he has not stopped fighting for it he is still fighting for that throne there is a troop in here there is a troll a seat of contest it has become the seat of context between god and satan yes it has nothing to do with you the battle is not your battle no the battle is the lost battle stay still stay still that you may see the salvation of the lord amen just stand still right and see what god is going to do yeah a lot of the times we get in the way of god it's true when god wants to make a move we get in the way of god right stand still yeah and you will see the glory of god it is not your borrow no can a man fight satan no no you can't but there is a god in this inside yes there is a satan on the outside now who is trying to come in yes you are just in the middle you happy to be the battleground where they meet sometimes you just get up you know you are not sick but then you know you are not well praise the lord if they ask you what is going on you can't even tell what is going on sure suddenly something is going on right right you don't just have to know everything you can't understand everything yeah oh my god i know time was going to go against us tonight yes i knew about it so i'm not taken by surprise at all but let me see if i can just chip in another thing our time is a any musicians come so remember a seat of contest there is a true in your heart and as i said that every throne has some form of fortification so are you fortified yes the word of god is our fortification yes sir you are fortified that the devil cannot just come and intrude on you right you are completely fortified yes sir and when the devil is coming around know that the holy spirit is keeping the devil in check the holy spirit is keeping the devil on strict surveillance every move the devil makes [Music] the eyes of god are upon him [Music] just make sure that you don't get outside the fortified zone don't get out of the world the only way the devil can get you if the devil can get you to forsake the world to lead the fortification of the word then the devil has control over your life but if you stay true to the word even when you are down even when you are down when you are on your knees when you are on your back when you know that you have come to your wit's end and there is nothing you can do but you are still holding on to the word [Music] you are fortified praise be to god [Music] we ought to esteem the word of god more necessary than our daily bread praise be to god for men shall not live by bread alone amen but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god your soul feeds on nothing when you stay away from the world you are denying your soul of his food you are starving your soul just think about it when you go 24 hours without food how you feel sure you go 24 hours without the vegas without the rice how do you feel and sometimes we can stop our souls for days and weeks and months and years lord have mercy i want us to go before the lord we are far behind time sorry for keeping you too late yes sorry i am praise be to god i believe the lord may have spoken to somebody praise be to god sorry about that so i want us to go before the lord in prayer i don't know which way the word has impacted you tonight or how the lord may have spoken to you tonight but i want us to go before the lord just talk to god remember that there is a seat of contest there is a seat in you a throne of god in you and god is on the throne but there is a battle that is going on you just happen to be the battleground i want us to pray for the grace of god that in the midst of the storms we shall learn to seek the face of god that we shall not lose our fortification that we shall stay true to the word of god just pray in whatever way
