Alleluia could be in the house of the Lord go to see you Bruce gasps great I just I just called brother Jordan in the office and I was asking him what's the update on your father-in-law's health and we were just talking he came he said he's sitting in the front row I said well okay but it's good to be in the house of the Lord Allah blesses you can have you seat a little bit we want to thank the Lord for His grace and love and mercy upon us we had a slipper waiter stayed and went for the ministers meeting you got back yesterday it was it was a good meeting and good fellowship with some of the brothers dear but we thank the Lord and and thank you for praying for me and bring greetings from a lot of the brothers back yes or better Tony Abner he's saying his meetings to the church it was good to be out there to hear some other things the Lord is doing the money's people and see some of the things that he's also doing in the life of the people praise the Lord Amen you know a couple of years back I was down in Ann Arbor Michigan doing brother Sammy Johnson 50 years church anniversary and and that that was the weekend word the Lord graciously he you my wife from those fibroid tumor and I left a meeting and we've brought a Stevenage ro died Sunday morning I got on the flight I was right back in church him in and the reason why it is because you know when you are on the expectation you know when you are expecting God to do something and and God move on the scene there is a overwhelming feeling that comes over you praise the Lord and for some reason this weekend I started feeling the same and and I was thinking about sister kitch while I was away I really wanted to get away for the couple of days because I needed be a way to pray a little bit I wanted to be by myself and then you know you prayed you go for the meetings you year sometimes and you you see the Lord speaking to you you come back in and and I was just having there feeling you know so I was actually in the meeting when she called him yesterday and then I went to went over to the pastor office folk with heart a little bit and but she were having some some some bleeding problem she was bleeding through her nose and including stuff for the wine so we just pray we fought a little bit and and then brother Stephen told me last night he had a rough night she was you know she was streaming she was crying out and I mean different things was happening and you know brother branham explained when when he gave us an idea when people are about to leave this world he said I have seen things in the last moment before they leave this world you see I've also seen sinners in the last moment before they leave this world he said for the sinner before the leave the knows exactly where they are going amen they can see the death angel coming to take them they can see that the Torah of Hell and it will be screaming for the alive they will be screaming for their life he said for a for since they will always see angels around them they will see angels they will see people that have gone on before and all of those things you know so you know so just on my way to church this morning I had to stop to see them and give you out on a portion of the service encourage them read a scripture we pray together and then I got on my way here but you know it's not the first time the last time my sister Keisha was in the hospital she started seeing angels and she started seeing beautiful flowers and beautiful streets and all of that but you know the thing about it there is the other she been in that condition I believe with all of my heart she's ready to go and if she leave this word she going right in the hands of the Almighty God praise the Lord but the thing about it there is the other I don't know about you but I don't want her to go the reason why I don't want her to God is because I want young people in this church to see the power of God I want you to see this word coming to life there is nobody that associated around this church that don't know sister quiche hell they don't know the terrible condition unless you want to add in a saint or you want to add as a visitor if you are a visitor we welcome you and we will bear with you as long as you stayed around praise the Lord but just like I said I don't know about you but I believe there are many that feels the same and I'm looking to see the power of God you know bird branches we are living in the days where God is going to restore missing arms missing limbs amen that is an outward thing but now she has a liver and I believe that God can give her a mission the labor that she's missing I'm strongly believing there you don't you don't know you don't know me praise the Lord Amen man the day God they do they're just like you know I just over the summer John's in the morning at weaning us a brother I'm leaving he was surprised I was supposed to preach all the meetings I told him brother I'm leaving I bought my ticket through the night the next morning I was on my way to the airport and I feel the same I don't know what a God is going to do with this coming winter but I would dash in the snow I would roll on the ground that we kiss the flowers I will hug the trees you never see me being crazy praise the Lord but I just have that feeling in my heart that God is going to do something special right ask I praise the Lord amen so every time she calls my phone no matter what I'm doing I step out because I'm waiting two years I'm just I'm I'm feeling happy I'm half strength and I will run down this street they will have to call the police station and say the man is very man praise the Lord amen I'm not just talking fantasy I'm talking from my inner conviction praise the Lord I'm talking from the inner part of me praise the Lord and I was just sitting in the meeting training in order bad and better done Reagan speak spoke he spoke on the joining to the Tron and there was something that he said that just I just the law this is just exactly what I was looking for he said he said why it's not just a feeling when people ask why because I've been asking why you know insane law why I've been saying when when it comes to sister kitch health he says God love the question why because even our Lord Jesus said why had that forsaking me he said it's an inner expression it's an inner emotion when the person asks why and there was just a blessing praise the Lord amen oh man I'm looking forward to death praise the Lord amen one of the brothers acts finishes but brother one why don't you just stay there entire weekend without saying and as you know I need to be back home I'm expecting something to happen amen praise the Lord Amy and as I spoke with sister quiche and brother Stephen pastor you know the brother that was faster in the back home there was some things that I had to talk to him about he's my good friend so I told him I said brother I don't want no doubting atmosphere around this situation praise the Lord Amen because unbelief will only handle their own believer it's not going to handle God blessed be the name of the Lord I just I just had to say these things out this morning to be able to get rid of the mixed feelings that's a mixed feeling I'm having but the Lord is in control it means blessed be the name of the law oh we serve a letting go on we serve an Almighty God praise the Lord let's

name Lord oh thank you lord thank you Father praise the Lord amen I tell you this morning that Christianity is the only religion that brings the one to worship in your heart every religion worship God as an extension amen the worship God has an extension by do's and don'ts and sacrifices and prayers but Christianity brings the the one we worship in our hands amen and the worship gets better when you feel his presence because he inhabits the praises of his people God gets into the washing he becomes part of the washing he just don't sit there and seeing you worshiping him he jumps into the Washington that is the reason why heaven praise the Lord Amen for Jordan give me a little volume here that is the reason why David was called a man after God's heart when God saw David jumping into the Washington he was not just saying oh I'm the king or see what I've done I bring the answer of the Covenant back no he went into the Washington he became part of the washing [Music] and that's what it is the God that we worship he becomes part of the washing hey man praise the Lord and that is the beauty of his holiness when he can come into the service himself Alleluia oh man I just feel like praising the Lord amen praise the Lord [Music] through wash it will always move your heart that's why true worship will do that's why people can cry that's why people can run they can jump they can strain because true worship would take you out of yourself blessed be the name of the Lord thank you musicians let's just go to the scripture this this morning I don't know if it is after noontime yet but let's go to the scripture they're having something on my heart this morning I might be all over the place but there is something there that kind of a struck me I want to share with you I hope I can be able to bring it out praise the Lord amen we're living in such a day were the religion of this world and even even Christianity we have just kind of for defining with different things that are happening and in different things you know people thing is it's big church the thing is a doctrine the thing is a man and then sometimes two we get we get all confuse you know and I mean I keep you standing too long Hebrews chapter one that was where we read on Wednesday night and talking about intellectual faith Wednesday night we spoke on three things that we must not do we must not miss interpret the word we must not dislocate the word and we must not misplace the word and like I said on Wednesday night I'm not I'm not I'm not going I'm not preaching this as as as as I'm preaching to preachers or some preaching to people that they will go and explain the word because you must not do it until God has called you to do it but I'm bringing this that is the three things that you must not do with the word in your own life amen because when we talk about God dealing with you God is dealing with you I call into his word and you must not miss interpret what he's doing in your life by the situation that are happening around your life you must not misplace it amen Hebrews chapter one that just real quickly you have you see then we can lay the foundation year God in sundry times and in divers manners spit in time past unto the father's by the prophets had in these last days spoken unto us by his son when he had appointed years of all things by whom also he made the words amen obeying the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things but the word of his power amen he is holding everything by the word that's what his power is in the world so you have to look at your life by the Word of God Jesus a man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and we together upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself porch I was seen sit down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Father we humbly approach a word this morning Oh God help us Lord father we want to lift you up this morning we want to talk about your father we don't want to point the people Lord in the wrong direction we want to talk about you you said if you be lifted up you will draw man onto yourself we want you to have the preeminence we want you to be the focus of the service this morning we want you to be the one that is captured by every mind in every heart father if we miss you this morning we miss everything please Lord help me as a preacher and help the brothers and sisters also Lord we want to see you we want to see you Lord it is you you alone you are the one that pushed us by your own blood you have redeem us it's because of you that we are here this morning please father my fanny crosby said pass me not a gentle Savior pass oh snap this morning in this building Lord the children has drove over hours to to be here we don't want to miss it this morning but a few time that we will spend together may we enjoy the moment blessed be your holy name in Jesus name we pray amen amen Allah bless you may have a seat praise the Lord however God is good his mercy endureth forever amen he's so good his mercy endureth forever what a wonderful father we sell I will bless a Kenyan Redeemer praise the Lord praise the Lord but he my son also wanted me to bring reading and he was supposed to come our way but it was a kind of a miss miss preparation there so we will see how they were working but he has a shot tricky I'll go back home so we looking just looking kind of a true dad brother Billy's father is also around and he his wife because but they'll a younger brother in DC just had a baby so we came over to see the grandbaby in the mother take care of a grandchild a little bit so he might be coming to visit us very large and all of these brothers I was just telling somebody else's sometimes when you get out there into these meetings you meet so many brothers you know four people also that will never stay in home you know you just need so many of these brothers in and it just hard to accommodate everyone but we try to do the best that we can amen blessed be the name of the law Amy and I was looking at something in some things in the scripture that I want for us to look at a little bit year and trusting that the Lord would come on the scene in help us you know Peter said that the structure is of no private interpretation amen he says there and he kind of who warned us that the scripture is of no private interpretation the men of all were led by the inspiration of the Almighty you know and you were led by the Holy Ghost to give unto us what we have as the structure praise the Lord but as you actually as you look at these things and you look in the scripture you realize that you know this is the Word of God this is God in print form and and and there is the thing were the the two lodgings and all of these this men the kind of a struggle with because man like I said you know when when when Adam tell when men felt in the beginning he he got this sense you know falling from faith falling from that that perfect fit that came right out of the hand of God men have this sense of his Kiryas his answers and he's fearful he's afraid Amen aviable have you ever come to that place with that makes feeling anxious to know but yet afraid to know the anxious to know but yet be I afraid I really want to know this thing but I take time praise Lord Amen all of those things are the senses of this flesh it comes by the natural birth you don't go to school to learn there is right in you when Adam fell that was exactly you see that right there in Genesis chapter 3 that is the reason why there are in Genesis chapter 3 was was the effect of the form but the actual form was doubting God's Word she doubted God's Word when she opened up reasoning and then what happened she became curious wanted to become wise wanted to know really what the serpent said if it was true so that curiosity stepped in anxious to be like God when she was already like God she was anxious to stow too hard the devil interpretation happen to her belie God and yet instead she was fearful God said the day we eat there we were dying so you see the three senses that manifested right there in Genesis chapter 3 it came with the for the moment she doubted God's Word she became curious she wanted to know what is under the heart nothing can be there just tell them what don't go in that room he was at the kicking I wonder what in that room they say I shouldn't go well yeah yeah they say no no no nobody should go in their own you know it's they are saying they're like obedience but it's a step I really want to know what behind I do you know my mama said nobody should go there I don't know what the Obamas and nobody should go there you know it's only like an obedient time but all of their state mean there is a sense of curiosity what is honor the heart praise the Lord well you know I'm I'm not really going to see I just want to look I'm not taking it from there I just want to look and and what what is that look it means praise the Lord now but there is a sense of fear that I might see something that I'm not supposed to see but yet there is an anxiousness to know what is there well okay I'm not going there mama but can you tell me what is this why are you saying that the anxiousness to know what is behind what what is honor the heart but the fear of now wanting to know it because I don't want to be disappointed but there is a key worsening so there is there is a mixed feeling when faith is loose the reason makes feeling you you are captured in all of that it it's a sense of the flesh and the spirit you are captured in all of that your mind just go you know going all all around that and and and and and with time with time you will break the Lord praise the Lord or we're not Indian a today a mine she just for like nothing they are so it praise Lord are we together but Joe says something let's look in in in our Bibles a little bit this morning but do I have my notebook now let's let's look in in job chapter 11 let's look in job chapter 11 oh god be my help this morning amen praise the Lord if you are a to lodging I'm not coming after you this morning Amen because I'm no match for the two lodging what is longing in my heart that's what I told you this morning I want young people to realize that we serve in a Living God that's my prayer every day for God to make himself real to these young people job chapter 11 let's look at verse 7 Josie can Dowe by session find out God what are you searching through the Scriptures what are you searching nature whatever you search in Google can they have found out the almighty onto protection this word perfection kind of awestruck my mind they in Hebrew Paul says let's go on to perfection I'll talk about that a little bit it's part of mine he says it is as high as heaven what can't that do deeper than hell what came they'll know the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea praise Lord remember this is the God that we are worshipping this morning the one we call the wave maker the miracle worker the light in the darkness is the God of fill all time in space praise the Lord that's the God we are worshiping praise Lord and that's what God want to bring us to the consciousness of who he is we tried to box it into doctrine the Bible says days the prophecies days and every time we try to box it into a court of the scripture or the prophet or somebody that explains something you reduce God because no matter how much you know about God he he he million times bigger than that but he warned us to come to that consciousness then you can't hide away from him praise the Lord he know you're down sitting he know you're up you know he knows when you get up what are you going to take the left for or the right fold praise the Lord but I bet you right now you don't know brother wish wish for when you get a wish what are you going to take I know everybody processing in your mind I left right left right that's how the human mind goes everybody started becoming an army this morning left right left right but that's the God we sell that's the God we sell is there anything hard for this kind of a person for this bean oh my goodness me oh my goodness me that's why we aim for this morning people that's exactly what we aim for this morning I pray that the Lord will just help us amen I pray that he will help us this morning oh praise the Lord amen are we together you know I was looking at some scriptures this morning in last night and just like Paul said here I want to stay right here on Hebrew chapter one he said God in sundry times I've used that word over and over it was just only last night that I really look at that word sundry you know you just read it you hear it on tape you hear from preachers you just really and and I look at the word and actually I found one place were where BAM goes over it try to explain why the word sun-dried means God at sundry times and in divers manners speak in time pass on to the Father the worst sundry it just is just a word that brings out the expression of diver place and diver ways I mean diver is just is just another word just like Paul usually they're also diver - but sundry also speaks more moles especially about location the diver places like he said sundry times and in divers manner God in time pass speak unto the fathers now by the prophets so which mean God was using the life the life of those men you know the way they were born the way they grew up you know like we have talked about Jeremiah his youth was robbed uh say from from it from you know from your mother's warm but you think about it think about it now young people I'm trying to grab your attention thing also about the different things sundry will also bring those things into place the different things that God have used the candle state in the tabernacle the birds the dog that represent Christ the scapegoat that God would take to God to represent him praise the Lord he will use seven candlesticks and all of those things are everything's they are things that there has been reduced from living such things amen from living substance Oh a living elemina take the gold of the earth the melted in the make candle you know the candle stakeholders and all of that and but but this is what Paul is saying that God in type of manners he used out of things praise the Lord think about curtains curtains don't have life it was humans it was it was women that the build those curtains that was used in the tabernacle but year God represent those curtains as his stages of grace in a way that he deals with people think about arches the arches of the heifer the heifer was was was burned or the animal was burned and and God would take the ashes and miss it with water oh and and the people had great expectation when the priests who sprinker the arches water some who jump some will live for their hands some will even want to black others it should touch them before it touch others but God was represented in those things praise Lord you tell me this morning you have a heart that is beating you have blood running through your veins data that the birds in the ark that went away and flew back the doors the pigeons that got the sheep and all of those things that God use to represent himself are you telling me that those things have much value than you are you trying to tell me that those things are more garlic and you think about it this morning because that's word Ford is bringing a stone in this statement that God in sundry times there from ways to use Jeremiah slain on one side praise the Lord you might have not halide on one side for 30 days but definitely you Hal are on one side for a night are we together the DA Bob thinks that God had used in the Old Testament you think about it this morning is there something in the Old Testament that God has used that I did not mention this morning you can you can think about that runs through your mind and even the life of those prophets their life they were men of lot passion just like you and myself God there with them God relating himself to them and even use their life use their failures he used the affiliates God in saundra times oh I want to nail this down this morning praise the Lord I want to nearly down and just like brother Branham said God revealed in his word he says we are approaching trouble sometimes troubles on times things are going to happen and all the different more movement that are happening there the the the 80s movement in and the sort of movement and all of these different movement that are happening they are strongly fighting for us to lose our confidence in this world praise the Lord they don't want to take you from church church is not their problem praise the Lord Church is not your problem as long as we will reduce our God to failed amen and it would be all about ourselves let make ourself happy are we together Paul was saying here that God in saundra times just like Joe said looking such a funny God you can measure it there was no way but this great God this great god of no measure yet he use the simple things he used the things that he had made just to give us an acquaintance with him to give us a knowledge of him he used the things that he had made and and he breaks himself in it think about it Jesus who spit on the ground and robbed play with his own space and rub it on a man's eyes praise lord well you said already it's our it's our Lord Jesus so it's quick for the religious mind for our religious mind or our religious understanding in our subconscious to just jump in right there it was a holy spit praise the Lord we can just jump it fill it up quickly because sometimes that is the place where we are for us to just strange tale amen just stay still stop where you are and just keep your mind on God it's a hard thing to do why is high because we are curious we are answers we are fearful scary so it's hard to do it people think you stand still and you just starting in on God greatness a feeling will come on you you a shout you a misbehave so we don't want everybody turning around to look at us but you think about it this morning God in sundry times in davor manner divert different ways different ways what is he establishing you he said but in these last days he has spoken to us through his son in a sense of everything the anima blood you think about it even the liver of the animal in the Old Testament those parts of the animal that was taken off for sacrifice those delicate parts of the animal Paul was saying that all those things the everything that God used was speaking of Christ the stick in Moses ham was speaking of Christ the Hammond a Noah talked to Bill an act was speaking of Christ the male's that were nail into the wall was speaking of Christ what is saying that all of those things now it's so easy for us to look at all of those things that God use in the Old Testament in the different ways and we can just we can just see it yeah they were all speaking of Christ that the candle the the water that was sprinkled are the brazen self and the brazen altar all of those things was speaking about Christ and just leave it right there and don't realize that they seem we're all of those things and the things they were happening in the life of those Old Testament characters and Old Testament prophets is the very same thing amen Paul is trying to help us to see that just like all of those things were speaking and revealing Christ that is the same way with you that is the same way with you and we together that is the same way your life and everything that you are going through I say young man praise the Lord listen to Jeremiah when he says he says your day mean in my mother's womb one of the prophets that you separated me from my mother's womb they are even associating God in the womb they are associating God ain't the warm are we together praise the Lord when you get to job and job start talking about the planets and the difference times and job gets on the field and he start talking about the animals and the strange nature amen he talks about the animals and their strange nature how they had to watch over the eggs and how they even go in the dust of all of those things that are placed right there in the scripture all of those things that I place right there in the scripture I was listening to brother Branham he said he says if it's proven over and over he says that's the Word of God he said the Jews are a very proud people they believe in your prophets they respect their kings he says if the Bible was a Jewish book they would never expose the weakness of David because still tomorrow David remained the most respected King in Israel if it was a Jewish book they will never talk about David affairs Rubel Sheba Elisha was one of the greatest prophet I remember some brothers went to to Israel I say Elijah the Shah and it was it was him and another brother is regimes and and some other brothers when it got to I think they were go into Jordan or somewhere there they got to the checkpoint one of your names gave them passage why they put all the other brothers assigned become a large or a shock pass passes regimes pass Olivia names because they were associated with Israel with the prophets if it was a Jewish book they will never talk about Elijah running from Jezebel because still tomorrow they respect Elijah and we together but God my inspiration what are they like it or not God allowed them to write it praise the Lord that is the reason why what are you lucky or not God expect you to testify or what His grace is bringing you true we get stuck in our shame and our prior and we think about ourself and not seeing what God is doing are we together if he can use anything he can use me praise the Lord if he can use anything and gaashah in the Old Testament that he can use anything and everything he will place the name of Rahab and Tamara and Ruth he will place it right in the genealogy of our Lord Jesus praise Lord and then little things were happening to us in our lives then quickly we want to blame God don't love us did you think about it think about it just like Jeremiah or even David he was a young boy and he liked playing with slings God never reached allow him to reach teddy yes order and said David would be king let me not know anything I tell you yes all and that's the same thing that are happening to many of you young young brothers and sisters from your young age God being pouring this I know it's a word on you I'm writing you in all annoying all your struggle all your foolishness you come to church God an altar you don't put you aside here not you something from the world makes sense to you even if you don't understand everything something taught you somewhere all the other who said David cares he came to send for him he came and some you saw him in and broke out into prophecy and some your father or the moment some you're finished with him David was running with his rocks when Samuel anointed David David never won now I'm anointed and pick up his Bible and started reading I sue not David Finney I mean Sam you're feeling he just pick up more rocks putting in his bags and he was going and God and God was associated associated in the life of the lady praise the Lord God was associated in the life and that anointing will keep him and we keep him in his failures and we keep him in his sauces even at a time where he would come to consciousness to know that this is the reason why I was anointed in life did not change automatically but God was stay with him God will stay identified with him we have put a lot of human anxiousness and expectation to God's redemptive work and God retentive claim praise the Lord I mean the man gave his life to the Lord he believed the Lord Jesus Christ he gets baptized the Bible says if you repent and you are baptized you will receive the Holy Ghost so if you don't have the whole ego maybe you're repenting what's not right or maybe the person i baptize you never had the Holy Ghost that's why you didn't have the Holy Ghost and and all of these things what does it do it put us into a confusion it put us into a confusion praise the Lord what we want to do we want to we want to travel we I mean we we we wish the Bourbon was alive we go to Brandon Tabernacle we stayed there praise the Lord it's all because like he said we want to use our canary brain we want to use this him of mine or the secret like I said on Wednesday night the secret it's the law of God it's the law of God and enjoy the things that he's doing in your life like the scripture says everything is uphold by His Word praise the Lord don't think you're going to school is not part of the Word of God it's part of the Word of God praise the Lord everything you do the word is associated to it so if we come to that consciousness and start to see that this is God it was God from the beginning and it's God and it would be God on to the end everything that concerns you God in sundry times in Davor manner praise the Lord in him we move and we have our dean in him we move did you believe that God is here this morning oh yeah yeah he's here this morning his presence is the oldest building is so taped right here and all he's trying to do is to just bring us to consciousness they don't take me to make him here he's here amen he's here he woke you up this morning he was right by your bedside praise the Lord amen and you get down and started praying he was right there just robbing you on your back even if you never felt like coming to church he says it will be okay just try it a little bit praise the Lord how many times have you not tried to give up how many times have you not just got tired and say I will not serve God it's not your choice it's not your choice it's not your choice I want to challenge you this morning go and do the most stupid thing that if you think you would do go get higher with you you will regret you will regret you will regret and if you can slap yourself you will slap yourself I've seen men knock in their face on the wall because they were so stupid that was what Paul was trying to bring bring up we know the history of this man he tried to do everything right everything right to be a proud son for his father to be a proud son to the Sanhedrin his counsel he tried to do everything right just to realize that he was far from the reality he was far away from the reality when God met him on the road of Damascus praise the Lord young people you have to be proud of who you are amen you have to be proud and tell yourself I'm proud to be a Christian I'm proud to be a son of God I'm proud to be a daughter of God don't allow anybody to tell you you got to tell yourself that all the time no matter what is happening I'm proud to be Who I am and you must enjoy it you must enjoy it don't wait for the music to bring it to you when there is no song when there is no scripture praise the Lord even when the most stupid thing is happening that you can understand you must enjoy it David say for your sake he said for God's sake we are going through all of this praise the Lord it's not a proud thing for God to put you in your hand in his hands when when Porsha is a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the Living God amen it's not a fearful thing in a sense of judgment and condemnation it's a fearful thing in a sense that is it's something to reference when you come to that consciousness that God is dealing with me I mean it's something for you to reference it's not fair for us if they said don't do it do you see that interpretation it's a fearful thing to fall in the head who would not want to fall in the hands of the Living God David said he said law don't turn me to my enemies he said if you were deal with me I rather fall in your hands than fall in the hands of men so it's a fearful thing in the sense that it's a beautiful thing if something to reverence is something to endure when you know that you are in the hands of the Almighty God are we together amen young people are you following me Simon are you following them praise the Lord if we take the we take the experience of God out of religion or out of Christianity if we take that new birth and we take that personal experience now when we talk about personal experience people just think is to be on a ha stop praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord no personal experience and that is the thing that makes me to enjoy every time I think about sister quiche I said what a privileged girl she is to fall in the hands of the Living God praise the Lord for God to use her to be a testimony of divine healing Georgia Carter how many years she was on her back she was eaten up with tuberculosis laying on her back right there the Nightingale woman that brother Branham he how many years she was drive to the bones praise the Lord that God would choose you to put you in a state and make you a testimony for his namesake praise the Lord it's then is that not beautiful it's something to be jealous praise the Lord Amen it's something to be jealous just like I said those early Christians when a man I was reeling about the Church of nuff career there was one of the leaders during the Korean Pentecost North Korea had an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost one of their leaders and this man I mean he went to praising the beat him you know for him to for him to give up and all of that so in his mind he thought I mean it the kind of a cruel torture and it takes them true stand right there cutting their flesh keeping fire under their feet and all of those things so he thought in his mind that he said he would back up and that was the worst thing I call into his own testimony he ever did in his life only because he thought in his mind that if if he give in to the Korean government it will be a way for him to way many of them he's just saying it but you really don't believe it praise the Lord and just like Burt venom say he says sometimes sometimes what you don't realize is that God has tied many people on your experience and your decision the decision you make in certain situation can weaken the faith of many they don't come up to you and say all brother I'm looking up to you no but they are looking up to you they are watching you they are believing you they are trusting you praise the Lord and he cried he cried when he realized that his decision affected the church he went back he repented to the church and this time he was ready to give his life he went back he rewarded his stand and all of that he said you're out of those things but yet it's still when that initial confidence is breaking praise the Lord it leaves a man in a life of regret to know that a God of heaven is looking down on you no matter where you are no matter who you are if God can use candles take if God can use the blood of DOS and God can use different things to represent Christ and under the new covenant now God is now so much interested in material things like church building and the kind of four chairs you sit in in or test him and he was using a lot of material things to represent himself in but all of the New Covenant by the sharing of his blood he was not going to use different flesh different people from all around the world different situation Bonnie different condition grew up in different challenges around the Alliance to know that a God of heaven is counting on you praise the Lord Norway has just legalized beefs marriage they have just gone into law now they can marry their dogs and cats it has gone into law praise the Lord do you know where we are what was the thing that brought chaos in Eden was when Eve went into a beast coveting when the very thing that she was given dominion over when she decided to submit herself to wait we're talking about going back to eating and going back to eating the word has to go back to an eating condition of chaos and confusion before the sons of God step on the scene the manifestation of the sons of God so this it's not a joke we're not just making church praise the Lord is bringing our self into a living reality of the Living God the mysteries are just to excite us is to make God is to bring God from behind the curtains but what is the need of bringing God from behind the curtain if you will not go with you home if you will not take him home if you will not take him into your daily life you go and meet someone out there with a perverse life and then you are confused and say how can this personally be living this life and they I enjoy and I'm not enjoying is that why you call enjoyment something that is seasoner it mean something that they have to work day and night II can't even sleep in the house because they gotta pay the bills for that car is that why you call enjoyment is that the thing you want to reduce your Gothel see what Paul says here and then I will stop right this morning I want to get to your heart young people that's what I'm doing what I'm doing for I want to get to your heart I don't want to excite you I don't believe in a sight mean it's good but what profit if I just excite you if I try to show you try to make myself a good preacher to you and just explain this and explain this in the spleen days what benefit why that give to you I would just be I would just be sharing knowledge amen or we have something to be proud of praise the Lord young people that's what I want to say to you we have something to be proud of many of us sitting down here we have we have people even in our midst this morning there have been following this gospel even before we were born older than our age praise the Lord Amen I just have question this morning butterscotch just did a surgery on his eyes in a week and yet he said in service this morning what you know you just think about it think about it is that not a good excuse for him to be out of church for one month and just stay home sit on his back porch look at the flowers look at the birds it will not change the experience but why would God put on his hat to come to church is to encourage me and to encourage you young people we have something to be proud of calling ourselves sounds and daughters of God let me tell you something maybe we don't know that a little bit and and and and the brother was was was speaking on that a little bit we had a good many such meeting we were talking about a jealousy of God and he just went to my heart because when I was down there talking to brother team I told him I said brother I'm very jealous over what I'm doing I'm very very jealous and passion over what I'm doing here and the reason why is because I'm expecting God to do something I'm expecting the power of God to affect the life of one young man or one young woman even if it is just one even if it is just one last Sunday after service i sat down with brother we're scared almost two hours I had him in their office talking with him in trying to look for some advice because I just I just thought that I needed and needed to look up some things very closely sometimes I feel that I fear the Lord because I haven't burden on my heart to just to just move into some things that I want to do I have a wife I have children I can just go like I used to go before when I'm so young you know and all of these things so when things come up sometimes I just talked with some of the brothers just like composition and Trust the law for me to be able to pick up some things that's the same thing with many of you people you have people in this church that have enjoyed Irish life over 40 years and the thing about it I mean they have been walking with God and sometimes will be dealing with things in our lives and we will just keep it as a treasure and we get so proud over it even if the preacher don't know and he mentioned and you get angry or he think he is I don't know what you're dealing with praise the Lord all the preachers that come in pressure job they don't know we don't have conference and since brother you tell me what are people dealing with you the bird I ever come like that that's how he would go up I was leading in the office and stop preaching because I don't I don't I don't hire Haramain I bring people to have a birding to be able to live up Jesus Christ in the mists of the people praise the Lord we're branches we have we are facing trouble waters he sees in and the devil has a punch that is coming for every son of God every daughter of God I don't know whether is the hardest one that Kishin Stephen is going through but he has a Porsche coming praise the Lord sometimes it wait for you just when you get out of college sometimes it waits for you just when you get married it tried to shake all your belief system why God allowed that is because he want to make himself more real he want is his shake in the net like a ego we stirred the net because God don't want want you to hold to a church or hold to a message God want you to hold to him and him alone praise the Lord y'all wanna be real young people because he's real we are seven and living God we are seven a living God and he saw answers to making serie to you if he could use diaper things go into dabble places there is no way that God can go with you I don't know for what reason but I've been kind of for caught into the Holocaust story I've been listening in to a lot of survivors stories and I think Saturday night I came from the meeting hours went to the hotel prayed and I was just laying there and I decided read a story of a child that was born on the concentration camp and the mother and the child are survivors I'll ask myself I said how could this happen when the child was born right before the gas chamber when God had his hand on the life for the purpose and the only purpose is for him to be glorified this woman was because right there right on the concentration camp every child I was born was sent straight to the gas chamber every child that was born and she was right there in in Ostrava conceived and every day she saw people being sent over to I mean it's just it's just the reason why they think that draw me into this that draw me into this documentary I've been staring and thinking about the sovereignty of God I've been thinking about God's attribute just like I said before God attribute is about God it's not about you it's not about me it's about the God that we sell and over and over I think in my mind about the tender hand of Jehovah the tender name of Jehovah the thing some of the places that God will reach down to it's all about him it's all about him if I cool this morning I just want to blow your mind and fill your mind up with nothing but God a God that is real I just want to blow your mind and fill your mind up with nothing about God not about me not about church not about the message it's about God because until that God is real to you this message will never be real to you amen it will never be real to you you were just take take take us like another bunch of fanatics you will just take it like you know what it's just all about brother branham and his brother branham that we are following if you really start looking for God you will realize that a God you are looking for always use men there is no book in the Bible called first God and second God there's not a book called Jesus or the books in the Bible and named after a man or a woman that God use let me read this to you a Hebrew chopped Hebrew chapter 6 let's read this to you and then I will stop right here and then we will go on we pray and go home praise the Lord you know this service that we are having in every service we have here it says it would be a failure if we leave from here and all you can remember but a war was running and brother Warren was preaching and I enjoyed the message but I won't preach I have failed and you have feel because it's not about me it's about him when we come to the end of the service and we go home God must be more real to us we must tell our self and encourage our self I will serve God a little more Hebrew chapter 6 Paul says this I've struggled over this scripture now struggle in the sense of I don't know where better Brenham talks about it or now struggle over it because is it's there's a confusion there but listening to this Paul says here therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ the doctrine is the teachings he was McKee's Erich Elohim 1 God we can go into all of that it's just teachings it don't make you closer to God one bit if God is never real to you you your mind can be so filled with that until you can explain God from Genesis to Revelation and yet your heart can be far away from God the doctrine of Christ is just teaching just like I said Wednesday night verbatim says the walnuts when I talk about Christ they may go one like our finger and you can make God one no he feel all time he feel all specs I mean yet we believe in the doctrine that there is one Lord one faith one baptism but yeah when we talk about war Lord and won't fade we're not talking about one as one finger standing up praise the Lord am i spinning your head around your shoulder I don't mean to do that praise the Lord forces let's leave the doctrine of Christ not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works we can base our whole simmer on their stop smoking stop drinking stop lying stop we can just go you must repent we can go we can preach that sometimes that's what we look for to say wow the seventh one hot praise the Lord how many times we are caught in the end and the preacher will come and the Holy Ghost will move in that direction and rebuild things in our lives we will feel so convicted and so afraid if we just work in the spirit rain amen as soon as you start thinking about those things and you can't embrace them in your heart and said God help me you say well but I'm not married yet if I marry I will stop doing what I'm doing I'm not you know I'm still young and you start strong you stop fighting against those things before you realize you go right back into it amen before you realize you get all the reason why to do what you want to do or Paul says let's leave the doctrine of Christ let's leave these foundation things they are good but let's leave it this morning that's what I want you to do let's leave it they are all good well maybe if you said I'm that I'm not inspired that's okay repentance from the Dare works and faith towards God all the doctrines of baptizing in the laying on of hands and the resurrection of the Dead and of intent of judgment he says and this we will do if God permit now I'm saying the same thing that as long as God permit I will keep preaching about repentance as long as God for me we will preach baptizing in Jesus name as long as God permit we will put Christ as the owner person in that three person we would keep all the doctrine but this morning what I want for us to go on to like he says living the principle of the doctrine of Christ let's go on to perfection now this perfection what is it what is the perfection amen all someone says the perfect interpretation of the word it would still come back to the doctrine of Christ it was they come back to the work of faith and repentance or you talk about perfection what can be perfection more than God what can be protection poor is saying let's go on to perfection let's leave that the trains let's leave the fundamental things all of those things are beautiful he said this I would do if go up Amy but let's go on to perfection this perfect one oh my goodness me we look into the scripture and then the Bible says be your pivot I said Heavenly Father is perfect then we start to gather everything that makes you perfect without protection or without holiness no man shall see God then we start forgot of all the things in a box that we think we need to do to be holy let's go on to perfection praise the Lord I was looking at that a little bit this morning from the strong concordances means for it means completeness let's go on to completeness the one in whom all things is complete praise the Lord the Lord spoke about him the Prophet spoke about him the heavens declare the glory of God the one in whom all things is complete for the same let's go on to him praise the Lord because the doctrine of Christ would make no sense if we don't have the petal one in his place praise warning if we don't have the pepper one in his place we'll ever be to God we were talking in fellowshiping and they know what brother was saying something in and he was talking about noah found grace in the sight of the lord he said wild and noah found grace and he sees he said her other bible says the sons of god marriage the daughters of men amen I'm worried with the noise you hear in his Siri - that is trying to follow the service any Ciara that I ever said that the sons of God went after the daughter of man it's about if you look at Noah and you trace him back his marriage goes back so does the daughters of said now the daughters of King N or P we are beautiful service enjoy the preaching of the word not trying to score the preacher here this morning but there is nothing you can do to find favor with God amen you found favor with God because God found favor with you that is the grace of God it was God as pressing his law God coming down and making you special for him to show his grace to you God coming down and making you special don't wait for money to make you special don't wait for your dress code to make you special don't wait for your crowd and your peers to make you special because God by His grace that he has given you for you to realize that you have fall in the hands of the Living God that should make you special praise the Lord we're going to labor honor this thing young people we're going to labor on the distinct and we will label together we will label together until the Almighty God can be real this is what we read on Wednesday night I go back to that again and then I closed the service year crisis relating his own word now in order to study the scripture portal to meeting steady rightly dividing the word of God which is true them is three mass in the scripture in using God's Word not to preach on it in using God's Word in any way that you will use God's Word wash these three things there is three things that you must not do now let's tear the doors for the next ten minutes three things that you must not do and all out in a land wherever you are across the nation be sure to put down for this down in your mind if you haven't got a pencil you must not do these things we tell you all the time how you must do now I'm going to tell you what you must not do now you must net miss interpret the word don't use your feelings to interpret how God loved you or if you don't love you don't miss don't use your feelings what are you feel good or you feel bad they don't change God's love towards you you must not do that don't miss interpret God's Word or if I had the Holy Ghost I will not do this don't misinterpret God's Word just tell the Lord deal with me just tell the Lord to deal with you Lord I don't understand this with all that I know I love you I appreciate what your grace is doing in my life but they have things that I don't understand because how do God interpret his word by bringing him to pass Amen God interpret his word by bringing it to pass and why it's hard for us to wait for God to bring his word to pass because of these three senses we are so curious we are anxious to see it and we are afraid he creates a sense of doubt verb and says that's what most people when I receive the Holy Ghost because they are afraid to know what the Holy Ghost would do in their life they are they I afraid they're resetting personality they don't want to lose they are setting personality they don't want to lose amen because to them their personality make them to be a man oh I'm not like other women I'd like to do this so the law of their personality so because of that they will not go all the way to the Holy Ghost because they don't want to lose that they I afraid that the Holy Ghost will make people to look down on me I will be so make the whole it goes have righteous indignation if you don't know they don't take foolishness if you don't know their whole egos how righteous indignation it's not anger my goodness sometimes it's anger but the Holy Ghost will not let the Sun to go down on it and we express it and get it out and sort it out you know when anger is just in you you're just angry I just wanted to tell him that's not righteous indignation righteous indignation with a brother let's talk this thing over I'm not happy I'm not happy let's talk it over this is the way I think about it and the brother said this is the way I think oh okay I'm sorry oh yeah okay brother sorry I offended you it's us press it you talk about it and you can pet one another on the back well people don't want to be changed yeah they I afraid they don't know what will happen what it would become praise the Lord and some says you know I'm too shot and I'm to shine these people they like they let me live there hands up and and go and send special and two shots and all of that you know I've always said it's just a proud spirit it's a proud demon it's a proud demon because if you think about it there are places that you are not to shine there are only certain places you are shy amen there are certain places you are shine certain places when you break loose you can even surprise yourself when you feel it breaking loose you surprise yourself what what am I was the one but if this is the house of your father this is where you should have labour take all the liberty and you must be able to express yourself in your best if you cannot express yourself in the presence of God in your best then there is something that is holding your best and that's the spirit of pride don't misinterpret God's Word many of us are not called to preach so you can say that well I'm not a preacher so I don't misinterpret the word no no the work coming to you the word dealing with you don't misinterpret it don't miss it happily don't misplace it amen for today is the date of sedation tomorrow is not appointed on to any man so don't put it off for tomorrow you know that's their that's the common one that I have when I get married no no it must be now praise the Lord that thing you want to do for the lost study right now well the portrait imitate as a young man is it do the work of an evangelist make a full proof of your ministry so start what you are doing now it will bring the rear you out actually trust God and don't dislocate the word he says you must not misplace the word and you must not dis locate the word and if we would do either of this it rolls the whole Bible in a confusion and the chaos it throws the whole Bible in a sense that you will be confused about everything but why God did this in a life of job why did this happen in a life of David why you keep asking those why it's not because you don't believe it is because the way you applying the word to yourself you are misinterpreting it because the enemy is trying to make you a lesser creature he's trying to make you a nobody and you see these people in the scripture as

surprised me and maybe we talked a little bit of that on Wednesday night when the scripture says out of Egypt I will bring my son and over and over I saw a few things like that in the Old Testament in the New Testament word much you say and I call into the prophets he will be called and Nazareth do you know that it surprised me that there is no Old Testament prophecy that ever said that there is no Old Testament prophecy much you say he was born in Nazareth and our calling to the prophets he will be called the Nazareth there is no Old Testament prophecy oh yeah when the scripture says also that out of Egypt he will call his son it's a professor in a book of Hosea but if you look at what Hosea was prophesying off a mean and I was thinking about it last night awesome and God bless the thing in the Bible he place it right here in his word that is the reason why young people read your Bible fall in love with this Bible because this is the law of story where Benham said the scripture has compound meaning and also for the teachers of the scripture says the same thing I was thinking to myself I said I check true I looked through all the concordance and and everything there but there is a difference between and Nazareth something was a Nazareth amen the nazriya wasn't was a coveting Samuel was an assert elisha was born on a denounced recover even our lord jesus was born under the law the nasara covenant is a covenant that is kept in the head amen that's what Samson average is this is different from being born and there's earring in the city of Nazareth it's two different things are we together but you see Joe I mean Marshall was all massage and inspiration of the Holy Spirit amen st. John chapter 2 Jesus comes right there and he takes the the width and whip the people out of the temple and the Bible says and the disciples remember that it is said in the psalm the zeal of the Lord has eaten me up you know what was happening there the Holy Spirit was making what Jesus did the Holy Spirit was bringing the scripture to their mind to be able to apply what Jesus is doing to what David said are we together leg a David going through his situation Lord take not your Holy Spirit from me oh you never leave your Holy One to see corruption praise the Lord Jamie going through his own situation his brains of God he's repenting before God is happy for God Lord I feel you Lord Oh forgive me this step don't take your Holy Spirit away from me you will never leave your Holy One to see corruption hundreds of years later our Lord Jesus right they're using that same eye their pointer time that anointing comes down on he praise the Lord he's now holding a Bible in his hands it's almost like you feeling sick and you lying right there and you said Oh God give me strength O Lord help me can take me through this and I should pray and you pray and you pray no Bible in your heads and you just said Lord you said by your strap I'm healed [Music] that's the reason why when the theologians do read this book they read from cover to cover they gets confused he has hidden from the wise and the prudent and he has revealed it to babies people people that want to love him and serve him for who he is than what he says people want to serve God for what he says because I can understand what he says but God want you to serve Him and love him for who he is even if you don't understand what he says [Music] the flower has together young people love your parents even you that your parents are far away like mine love your parents when you think about your mom and dad be grateful thank God for your parents appreciate him don't look at other people parents and say why they out there their parents are doing it for their children and my parents can do it for me don't do that don't do that appreciate your parents appreciate the people that God has put in your lives that's where it starts from if you start looking to look for to love a God that you can see and you don't appreciate your parents you don't love your parents you're not grateful you can say thank you you are not able to go and say I'm sorry Heavenly Father well sometimes I'm so ashamed of myself lord I get caught up in these things Oh father I'm not even able to bring my message house but lord I pray this morning take your word deal with us this morning help us Lord we don't want to miss interpret what you're doing in our lives we don't want to misinterpret we don't want to put no interpretation what you're doing in the life of others we might not understand it but Lord we can believe that you are the Holy One of Israel that you sit on your throne and you look down upon us father I pray Lord may your grace love and mercy just be with each and every one of us father dog just ask the Lord you go with us now we will be dismayed so far the Lord guarding today is the first Sunday of the month we want to come back this evening in their prayer meeting and the time of communion with you I just pray that your grace will carry each and every one of us now we love you we appreciate you Father bless us Lord for the brothers and the sisters that will be back tonight let's give him a time of rest the time of praying Lord a time of thinking father now looking at our fast because it's in you that we are complete help us Lord to think about the good things that you're doing in our lives be with each and every one of us now in Jesus name we pray [Music] I'm Lily [Music] me me on the everlasting oh yes I'm me [Music] safe and secure from all oh maybe not you translate lady my Jesus made it on the air [Music] let's say the powerful Asti what a blessing there's war Oh bless everlasting Oh hallelujah I'm leaning on Jesus living on Jesus then take you many not you oh yeah Everlast is [Music] elastic oh yeah oh the everlasting oh you're something leaning on Jesus lady know Jesus say and thank you from leaning on Jesus oh yeah Everlast it ha what aha why the everlasting oh that's catchy yeah Everlast it Oh hallelujah lady not he's our head and thank you from Oh leaning on Jesus day [Music] Everlast I see you back at 5:00 Terry will be seated 6 o clock go right into the communion service a man we just have a fellowship so 9 singing and go right into the communion service the Lord bless you yet is guarding all
