[Music] foreign [Music] amen thank you all for coming out this morning to come and worship the Lord I believe that it's our principle reason of being here praise the Lord amen you enjoyed the service last night praise the Lord amen it was wonderful it was wonderful I just told Brother Ronin I says promise me we will get you back here it's not always hot here amen [Music] you know I was talking to brother Brooks yesterday then and uh he called me for something and then we were talking I said I said brother Brooks you got to pray for us our answer went out and I've been trying to find the best salmon on shedra Mission Abednego for the church he got the laugh out of it and then last night brother running was preaching and he started mentioning children and Abednego I said yerry City that's just what we need praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hint of praise [Applause] the Lord bless you you may have your seat for the wine praise the Lord amen and uh again we want a Greek Brother Joseph go to see your job and uh sister Indigo [Applause] amen as we can see we are expecting their baby so we will keep them in prayer that that the Lord will uh bless our sister amen and take her through [Music] but it's good to be in the house of the Lord I Thank brother brother Jordan been working on the ASC situation so I promise you we'll get this thing solved amen we will get over with it praise the Lord and this coming week brother daily will be here on should get in on Tuesday uh uh but I will let you know uh in a mess of the week we'll send out a text here and uh for what we will be doing so just just be on the expectation praise the Lord because uh our brother Brooks wanted him to come and preach on Wednesday and but he said he would get back to me so all of that could change what our service will be on Wednesday so that's the reason what I said I get back to you praise the Lord and uh let's continue to remember better John Bibi as as we said uh trust in the Lord for the miracle the the doctors who could know more because the the stand could not be pulled because of the growth of the tumor so they're turning him over to a hospice care but his daughter took him home and uh we were there Thursday night to visit with him I was there I was out there late and we spent some time there with them and and hear myself have some time to talk and and pray together and uh I learned Friday he was feeling much better I spoke with him his voice was a bit strong so uh to get back out there to see him this evening so let's just keep him in prayer and it's a win-win situation amen if I were brought across this life system I mean he's waiting for him on the other side amen if the Lord deliver him we will still have him here for the testimony praise the Lord so it's a win-win situation praise the Lord and not to take much of the time we will turn the service over to the preacher but like brother Rowley said we met in uh Alaska knew his dad just a little bit from North Carolina and then but I really enjoyed the service there in Alaska I had to close the meeting but he came in and and just just the way you know just the way to see how our brother was laboring with the with the service there and laboring with the people trying to get them into that channel I mean I was sick that night our sake the first night I preached it was cold and I was sweating I went outside so I caught the cold and you know then and he he prayed chain and uh and kept the service going for the testimony I mean we had an outpouring we had an apple and I was so blessed and I think I got healed to preach the next morning so and uh I was so blessed I was blessed by the the administration I was blessed by the gift you see the thing is not just preaching you know because any man can do it any smart person can do it you know you can go and copied and paste copy it in paste but the thing is for a man to be burdened you know for the man to just stay before God and be burdened and then when he comes he live up with the people he he labeled with the people you know in everything that he tried to do and I could see that last night I mean I told him after the survey I said you have no idea you know what the Holy Ghost was doing last night amen praise the Lord and that's and that's what we look to see that's why we love to see you know just like he said opening his uh a message last night you know uh we can read those things that you know that the prophet said but this message has to be life praise the Lord amen you have to be live and if you just watch the way that the holy spirit is going you know thank God he's taking us far away from all of those uh legalistic preachers that just come and whip the people I mean we're dealing with so much thing out there that will come in church and be and be suppressed by a preacher amen because we're having so much word and so much promises in this book that told us that we are more than conquerors amen that we are more than conquerors so let's turn to our feet and then we'll sing a song here and bring our brother and then he will come and preach we'll give him all of the time we will have only one service today and as we plan to have so we give our brother all the time to just preach and label with us this morning and let's also labor with him man let's let's take let's get our mind from all the destruction let's get into the word and let's labor with our brother let's say Amen to the word let's make it easy for the preacher to preach you see because it is not just preaching to you he's also dealing with Spirits amen he's dealing with spirits that is trying to you know corrupt our mind praise the Lord amen so uh uh we just we just thank the lord we just thank the Lord amen now Hallelujah amen amen what can we sing this morning praise the Lord amen I'm just looking forward to the preaching of the word this morning and my mind just been all over the place and uh [Music] The Same Spirit yeah okay let's think that let's sing there let's clap our hands our brother will come right in the same Spirit there is Christ from the dead the word in you Dwight in you Spirits there is Christ from the dead

Breaking Your Mother that spirit less prison with our hand claps now come on [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] before me we have for me [Music] I won't [Music] [Music] over [Music] [Music] [Music]

and every heart Lord father I pray that you'd bring us all under one one Accord and one mind father that it might be done that it was on that day that Lord they were found in such a place of uh agreement with the word Lord that you poured your spirit out among them Father the Lord we ask for that experience this morning Father Lord may it be another upper room this morning may you come and father break yourself into pieces into each life in each heart this morning God I pray that you bless this assembly father Lord I pray that you bless everyone involved here the musicians father the

this final turn father Lord I pray that you give us strength for the journey Lord feed us this morning as we draw from you Lord let it just be your word and your word alone I pray that you'd circumcise the lips and the years alike father Lord that we could just hear from your Divine Throne this morning Lord there's many things that can be said Lord many directions to take but you alone know what we have need of this morning Father Lord we just ask for you to come in a special way Lord and meet us once again as you've done before Lord we give you all our trust Lord we give you all our mind all our strength father our focus is on you this morning Lord as we love you in Jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning Saints and for everyone was rested well and amen if you have your Bibles will be off [Music] thank you brother if you have your Bibles return to the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter maybe just want to continue in this thought that we started last night the image will speak for itself in Hebrews the 10th chapter and we'll start at the first verse for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers they're unto perfect for then would they not have cease to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and ghosts should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin has thou Hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me speaking of Psalms there to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burn offerings and offering for sin thou what is not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every pre-standous daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified where of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after he had said before after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Amen may God bless his word he may be seated this morning and we all know this portion of scripture uh there at the beginning uh Parts I know sometimes uh the language of of the Old English there is a little bit uh uh troubling to understand but basically what what what Paul is writing here is that the the sacrifice of bulls and goats uh was not was not an eternal sacrifice it was something that had to be made every year and it was something that you were only clean on too and you had to wait for that Feast again to come that you could be cleansed under the sacrifice of the bulls and goats that they would it was Blood for Blood right that's the law of God is there's got to be a Blood for Blood and there's got to be a death for a life and that's that's the contrast of the Fall that we're in there's got to be something given for something received and so in these in these times the the the culture or the the tradition was to have bulls and goats as a sacrifice but it was something that had to be done every year and it was something that you had to wait until that sacrifice was made that you could be free again why what would it be to have to wait for a whole year to to be able to feel free again to have to wait for that Feast of uh to come that that you could you could be pure one more time and then you'd have to go and continue on and labor in that for another year again looking for that Feast to come and my what a time that would be uh just being so walking on tiptoes well just uh so uh anxious for that day to come and and waiting for that sacrifice to come again but I'm so glad this morning that we don't have to wait for a feast to come and we don't have to wait for the sacrifice or a bull or a goat but we have an eternal sacrifice for the offering of sin where where the worshipers once purged are guilty no more where one set you're under sanctification you you have that reputation no more so remember last night we got in a little bit of of the labels that have been put over you the individual or or the church as a whole and the individual labels that Satan has put over your life but I thank God that we have a sacrifice that's applied this morning that that label does not apply to us anymore that was what we used to be but now we're under a New Covenant we're under a new commission and and Paul says this by the commission of the Holy Ghost is the way that this is applied so we cannot just come under this Grace uh living any kind of life or living any sort of way or just halfway in halfway out we are not we're not we're not Baptists and we're not we're not Presbyterians and we're not methodists but we're required to live to a higher calling than that we can't just live a life out at five days a week and then come in for the two days a week we come to church and have a good time and and act like this applies to us but this is to the worshipers that were purged under the power of the Holy Ghost so friend if you're looking for peace in your mind if you're looking for comfort in your life get under the power of the Holy Ghost and he is the comforter he is the one that will lead you and guide you into all truths we've got to come underneath that headship in order for this to apply and that's a wonderful thing for me to tell you that that all these things apply to everybody out there but the truth of it is they don't this doesn't apply to everybody out there it only applies to those that have subjected themselves under the word it only applies to those that have laid aside every other worry and care and desire and have come underneath the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I think that's an encouragement to us this morning amen that we those of us that have been under the fountain we know that this applies and those of us that need to come underneath the fountain we see the results of what comes from giving our giving our life unto this you see if you're going to give something you've got to see the return you've got to see that there's a result now many people will come to church and there's a Sunday morning here's the resurrection morning and there's many churches and assemblies and beliefs and doctrines gathered this morning and many of them are coming together and they're coming to the house of God for fear of going to hell let me say that that's not any reason to come to church that's not a reason to come and worship the Lord just because you're scared of going to hell but the reason we come to church and Worship the Lord as we Behold Him in the power of his resurrection and there's a love within us for him that though he slay me yet I'll trust him though he cast me to the side yet I'll love him anyway why because my love is for him I can't help it now you can't help who you fall in love with right you can't help who your eye has stayed on and somebody might try to talk you out of it and maybe there's some young men in here looking for a a young lady and you find one that your mind is just it's just fixed on and that's going to be the one and your mama might come and say no she's not the one but you know on your eye that you've got you've got an eye on her and there's a love there for that well you can't help who you fall in love with thank God that that's his law because he fell in love with me he can't help who he falls in love with but when you ever love somebody there's everything that you would give for that person you would give everything you person because they are the love of your life that is why we come to church we come because he died for us and there's a love there within us we don't come that we could have a just a tradition or have a service and the order is just going to go this way and we're going to dismiss and we're gonna go get uh this kind of food and we're gonna go get this you see the routine that we get stuck in and we get stuck in this pattern if we if we don't recognize why we come why we're here this morning I don't know about you but I'm here to hear from the throne this morning I'm here to hear from God Almighty that he can express his love to me this morning I believe the songs have been sung and we've expressed our love to him oh how great are thy works oh God there is none like thee and we've given the praise to him and now this is the time when he gives back to the church by revealing in his word who we are we are the image of him we are not just something like him we are the image of him we're not just we're not just something that looks like him but we are bone of his bone we are flesh of his flesh we are the same in substance and word right and I know that that seems that seems hard for us to grasp because we know our inability right we know our faults and our failures and how we we fell yesterday we made mistakes and we fell short and we don't always do the right thing at the right time but yet even through that your bone of his bone your flesh of his flesh now we talk about that story of that that that uh uh uh uh Chicago meet me owner right and he would come down to that farm in Texas to look at his cows and he would choose that woman that would be his wife and he said I'll be back for you and she was the wash woman there you know the story right do you think that that woman made mistakes in that year's time sure she did do you think she doubted that he would come back sure she did she made mistakes but she was ready when the day came she had her clothes on when the day came she had her garments on when the day came so it doesn't matter what we did yesterday but do you have breath in your lung this morning do you have a new breath in your lung this morning then God's not done with you yet he hasn't thrown you away he hasn't forsaken you but God has given you breath this morning for another chance for Redemption another chance to be filled with the Holy Ghost another opportunity to give back to him this morning I'm so thankful this morning church that we are not just here guessing if he's going to be here but it's a promise it's a promise in the word for us it's not just for anybody it's for us the promise in the word has got your name on it it's a letter written to you this is a this is a letter with your name on it this is a letter addressed to you and you've got to open the mail and you've got to read about yourself you've got to see what is he saying about me what is the promises that God is saying to me I would say like this there's there's value in the book right I remember one time a brother told me a story he said there was this there was this Rich uh uh woman in New York that had so much wealth and millions and millions of dollars and it came time for her to pass away and and she had a maid that was faithful with her all these years took care of her for I think 50 years he said and she was with her all this time she was a widower and a widow and it came time for The Inheritance to split up and that's when everybody shows up and her children were there and I want this and I want that and it will begin to get dispersed and the house went to this one and the money went to this one and they began to get dispersed right and there the the woman said that she used to she used to read this uh she used to read this book this map of the world and imagine what it would be like to travel the world and she would read this Atlas and she would look over these things it would talk about it would talk about the beauty of India and Asia and Africa and Europe and Australia and she would read about these things and said one day I'd like to go there and she would always read this book and so when it came time for The Inheritance all that this made got was this book you think after 50 years of service that you know my that's all she got was a book and so the children didn't dispute her they said yeah she can have the book we want this and we want that and we want this and so it all got settled out and she took this book home and she began to open the book and in every page there was a check for a thousand dollars she would turn the page there was another check for a thousand dollars and there was enough money in there for her to go to Every destination that she had marked in the book but you see if you never open the book then you don't know the value that's within it but he said lo I come in the volume of the book this is where I'm hidden these promises is what I've given to the church but if we're not looking at the promises then we'll never know the value that's within it but thank God that a word came in our day that was able to open the book and to begin to reveal the promises that lay in store for the church in this age I I'm excited to be a believer in this time I'm not downtrodden I'm not defeated but I know the value that's within this book and I've seen my name in there and next to every promise Peter would say this is a promise unto you who's you this is a promise for you so let's just settle this and you're wondering if this if all this and all this uh all this truth in here is for you what did Peter say This Promise is to you This Promise is to you so just put your name right there why don't you just open your Bible to act sometime and just just write right above right above that you write your name there This Promise is unto blase This Promise is unto Jordan This Promise is unto you this is your promise this is what he's given to the church now we would be daresome to come into the house of God and ask him for something when he's already given to us that would it would be something for me to ask this brother to go get my phone back there on the desk but I have my phone here he'd be back there looking forward and looking for it and I would have it right here but I gotta recognize it's already here it would be something for us to come and ask for healing and beg for healing in the house of God when he's already giving it unto us it would be something to come in and ask for a fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he's already given it unto us God is not a great God up there sitting on his throne just looking down at us thinking you need to try harder you need to you need a you need to walk on your knees no God is a gracious God is a good good father God is in love with you God cares about you God is God is pleading with you to come God is pulling on you to come he's Paving a way for you to come if you only could see the way that he sees you friend if you could only just one time look in the mirror and see yourself the way God sees you I believe we're beginning to see it I believe the bride is coming to a position where once we look through a glass Darkly but now we're seeing him face to face beholding him as he is once we saw it as shadows and types and symbols but now their space is applied to those symbols I believe we're rising up in the position of John where he was caught up in a vision and he began to see the people of God in this day worshiping in spirit and in truth and we are the Fulfillment of that Vision right what makes a prophet a prophet the Fulfillment of his prophecy right we are the Fulfillment of this message whether you feel like it whether you feel like you look like it whether you act like it you are the Fulfillment of this message we are what makes this message real so you can't come to me and tell me that there's nothing to this message because I know I know that it was speaking directly to me I can't speak for everybody else but I know that it was speaking right to my ear identifying who I am in this age and I know who whom I have believed in you're not going to persuade me out of it you came too late for that right you can't come to me and tell me that the days of Miracles are passed you came too late for that but I've seen too much I've experienced too much I've had too much love I've had too much grace I will not turn away our our entire Focus has to be on this the days the Miracles are not past friends we're not just hoping for another man to come we don't need another man to come that's right we don't need another man to come back we already have what he promised you can murder William Branham but the seed has already been sown in the message you can take him off the scene but the seed has already been on display in the people it's too late it's too late and the critics try to rise up now and say this or say that well where were they when the prophet was standing in the Pulpit did they have anything to say brother Brandon would plead with them please come please come to this pulpit and tell me where I'm wrong in this scripture I challenge you to come nobody nobody would come hey as service after service he would beg the people come tell me where I'm wrong come tell me where I'm wrong now I'm not that bold this morning but if I say what the word says then I have the confidence to know it's in here and if it's in here then it's correct if it's in here then it still applies today if it's in here if it ever did apply it still applies today the confidence to know and nobody came to challenge him but yeah you take the man off the scene and now all the critics rise up and now everybody has something to say and now everybody's got an opinion or and I would just ask everybody that has a a critical spirit were you there go ahead were you there when that happened well no then I'll take it from the eyewitness I don't really care what you have to say I'll listen to the one that was there I'll listen to the one that witnessed it actually happened if you weren't there you know in in Ministry we hear a lot of of third-party stories no he said she said and this one said and I didn't hear this directly from the source but just take me out my word and you end up wondering but were they there right did they actually hear them say that or do they actually see that happen and then begin to you begin to wonder whether you're actually there when this happened well no well then we can't credit your testimony right you weren't an eyewitness but Peter says we have beheld the more excellent Glory of Christ being eyewitnesses of His Majesty of the Transfiguration of what we're no people into a supernatural race of God I believe that's where we're at this morning I believe we beheld the glory Amy I believe we've been held something greater than the rest of the world has beheld and we are coming to the fullness of this now this this quote here from Feast of trumpets is where I got this thought from that we started in last night we didn't quite get to the thought but we just trust the Lord did what he had to do but the man would say it's What God Says that is the word the bride is with their one how can they be one when that word was wrote there becomes in you and make you and the word becomes one pretty simple right when you believe it the word comes into you and now you're one that's exactly what he promised then interpret it God don't need an interpreter they say well we interpret it like this you've got no right to interpret nothing God does his own interpretation God said let there be light and there was life who interprets that he said a virgin shall conceive and she did you don't need any interpreter it's already interpreted and God said these things would happen in this day and it is it don't need an interpreter it interprets itself Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah if you could if you can see what I see it interprets itself we're not waiting for somebody to come and put a stamp of approval on how we worship or how we enjoy the word but we are the bride now you asked me how the bride is supposed to act right how the bride of Christ is supposed to act you say well you're two you're too charismatic or you get too carried away or you yell too much or you run too much well I'm the bride I cannot help the expression of what's on the inside of me there is nothing to say that I can't do that there's nothing to say that I can't express myself that way there's nothing to say that you can't just head not in hand raise and you're the bride you can express yourself how you feel to express yourself as long as you're free in the word then then you're free to worship but too many men have come and tried to put a label on you can't do this and you can't do that and this is too crazy and this is too charismatic and you're going to be end up in Pentecost you're going to end up going back to here sure I'm the bride who's writing the next chapter of the book Acts who's writing the last chapter of the book of Acts that will have no end who's writing that I am you are so how should we act we should act the way that the spirit gives assumption to act so you're not gonna bother me this morning if you want to shout or run or you want to sit there and you want to wave or you want to stare you do what you do because you are the bride and the bride is the only one who knows how she should worship I don't think it's for a man to stand behind a Pulpit and dictate to the people how they should worship are we worshiping in vain do we have a revelation of this then we're not worshiping in vain if we know who we're worshiping that we're not doing it out a vain repetition but we know why we come into the house of the Lord we know why we bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord and far be it for me or any other man to come and dictate to the bride how they should give back to God I say Let Freedom Ring in the house of God I say let Liberty loose in the house of God this time for the bride praise she's free to give Glory she's free to do the miraculous she's free to do whatever the spirit gives her action to do in this age we're not under the Mandate of a man or a bishop or we're just that would be another denomination right but we're supposed to be free from denomination freed from a denominational Spirit or attitude or nickelodeonism we are free to worship God how we feel to worship Him you say well what would make somebody act so crazy as to run around the church and to shout an amen into but if you were where they were if you had been through the troubles that they've been through [Music] if you had been caught in the bondage of condemnation that they had been caught in sure if you had drug yourself into this building like they drug themselves in here just wondering if this was going to be their last service I've been I've been in this I've been I've been going to a message church for 35 years you know how many times I've said I'm never going back sister how long you been in the message did you ever come a time where you thought I'll never go back I'm just going to give up well that's good faith I I'm gonna be I'm just gonna be real I don't know who else to be I've definitely got some defeats and got some I got offended by people in the church I got offended by Ministries I got offended by hurt by different things and I thought Within Myself I'm not going back I'm just going to turn away I'm gonna do it I'm not gonna go live a life of sin because there's something that's on the inside that won't allow that but I'm just gonna go live in a mountain somewhere I'm gonna move to me and my wife joke we look for houses in Montana all the time because there's just nobody there we're just gonna move out to Montana and we're just gonna be by ourselves and we're just gonna hermit out there because because it's too hard to put up with everybody and everything and who's right and who's wrong and I'll just go off and be by myself anybody else ever thought that all right just just tap yourself are you here even when you thought you'd give up you're still here even when you thought you'd go back to Africa you thought you'd go back to Arizona or you thought you'd moved to Montana or you thought you moved to Timbuktu you're still here this morning why because safety cannot stop what God has started and even though we wouldn't have the courage within ourselves to continue God has put something within us that is pulling us that is drawing us and it's not even by our strength it's by his strength within us how did you get here this morning there's something on the inside of you were those times when you couldn't you didn't want to come to the house of God you said I'm never coming back but yet you came [Music] what was it there had to have been something to Anchor in there there had to be something in you that Christ could set his acre point to and pull you right if it was just the strength of a man that anchor wouldn't hold if it was just the strength of a man you would just have given up and walked away like many others have but you're here this morning because there's something on the inside of you that you did not put there that your preacher did not put there that's your mom or your dad did not put there but God put a seed inside you that he could hook his anchor to and he could pull you he could pull you into his presence and that seat is what's pulling us here this morning and it was put there before the foundation of the world that's right you didn't get that seed when you came to the Altar and gave your heart to the Lord no that seed is what Drew you to that place the seed was already there it had to have been the election of God so he can't help who he falls in love with him oh well I've sinned and I've I've fallen short and how could he love me he can't help who he falls in love with right he's already put a seat in there and even though you try to run there he is and David would make his own bed in hell there he is he would try to run a man running from the presence of the Lord there he is and he would try to get away and try to get away I tried to get away from this my entire I don't want to be a preacher well I want to be a preacher I saw how I went for my dad and I saw I went for this brother and that brother I don't want to be involved with this I tried to run so hard for this here I am and you've tried to give up sure and you said I'll never be back but here you are you say well I'm just not now why would God call you to this place and then just leave you I'm just gonna keep holding you and keep bringing you that you'll just dry up on a chair someday if God brought you here this morning then God's got a purpose in mind for you if you still have breath in your lungs then God's got purpose for your life right is that what that God will only take you when your purpose has been fulfilled are you here this morning do you have breath in your lungs and there is a purpose in your life you're here for a reason you're here to fulfill the word of God you're here to put Satan under your feet you're here to manifest every promise in the word you're here for a purpose so don't come to church thinking you're just coming on another Sunday but you're here this morning for a purpose many of you drove maybe hours I don't know how far everybody lives but you're here this morning for a purpose you did not come of your own accord or your own strength but God rich in Mercy has brought you here this morning and he did not bring you here to just fill a seat he brought you here to reveal something to you he brought you here to make you better than how you came we have a reason to worship and rejoice the bride knows what she's shouting about the bride knows why she's so joyous and happy and there's a smile there that you can't control and you can't put down because she knows he's coming for me he's coming for me and he's here I feel him in the midst I feel him in the life I feel him in my in my walk I feel him everywhere around me he's already come he's here the Revival for the bride is not coming the Revival for the bride is already here now when are we gonna get revived we ought to do it right now we ought to say I'm ready let the Revival Fire come let the consuming fire come and consume what we brought to the house of the Lord this morning we speak for ourselves him in US the final voice to the final age as we talked about last night how Michelangelo would make this Moses they would labor in this statue and labor and making it perfect and Michelangelo would look back upon this statue and he would say my eyes so beautiful looks just the way it's so real it's it's so lifelike there should be life in this you see the attribute of the creator but he's not God so what does he do he takes his hammer and he says speak and he slays the statue and the chip comes off the knee speak no matter how hard he would scream at that statue it would never speak because he didn't have the Breath of Life but he would Smite the statue and he would say speak that statue would just stare at him I wonder what that statue would say had it been able to speak Moses was trapped inside this rock all these years since the beginning of time trapped inside this block of granite and this man takes the time to release him to make him the image that he always was what do you think that statue would say what do you say I can't say anything but thank you we're all sinners we've all come short of the glory of God and yet to think that a block image like that that God would take the time with me just a hypocrite on the front Pew just waiting for church to get over so I could go hang out with so-and-so or go do whatever but God would take the time with me an individual and everybody comes from a different walk and maybe you were out insane and you were on the streets but God would come down and he would take you and he would begin carve on it and work on it and then he would Breathe the Breath of Life of the Holy Ghost into that and that would be given the power to speak what would you say this morning I say we have a reason to praise him this morning I say we've got a reason to give him thanks this morning that he's thought so much of us that he would give his own life to it that he would give his own breath of life into us that we could speak and then we come and we don't use it for his glory my what would we do with that power now we see the world does it they take the music and they pervert it and they're this and they're that those are all attributes of God but therefore the original purpose of of worship we know why we're worshiping we know who we're worshiping I don't think we should let any any label that's been put on the church condemn us for how we worship you're built different than everybody else is built you're built different I can prove it to you in the scripture you are built different than everybody else's Bill God has designed you as an overcomer in this age he's designed you this is uh this is uh I gotta skip thoughts here but I just feel the Lord moving here are we together yeah Exodus the 28th chapter now remember the individuality of God I'll try not to hold you that that long this morning we got a timer so we'll try to stick to it but if I'm the one up here working sweating then you can you can bear with me right Exodus the 28th chapter and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with the cunning work after the work of the ephod Thou shalt make it of gold and blue and purple and Scarlet enough fire twine linen a fine twine linen Thou shalt make it foursquares shall be being doubled a span shall be the length thereof and a span shall be the breadth thereof now this is all you think how does this apply to us watch the detail of God's work this is how God is telling Moses to make this and thou shalt set it in settings of stones even four rows of stones in the first row shall be a sardius a topaz and a carbuncle this shall be the first row and the second row shall be an emerald a sapphire and a diamond and the third row of the guru in an egg in an amethyst and the fourth row of barrel and an onyx into Jasper they shall be said in in Gold of their enclosings and the stone shall be with the names of the children of Israel 12 according to their names like the Engravings of the Signet everyone with his name shall they be according to the Twelve Tribes so if you don't know we're talking about the urum and thumbum right the breastplate inside the holy of holies now think about this brother if you could if you could get to the urum and thumb today how long of a line would you wait in to know the plan of God for your life to know that you're walking in the perfect will who should I marry what church should I go to who's who you know should I should I should I preach should I not should I do this should I not should I if we could get to the urum and thumb that could answer that question how long of a line will we waited sure as long as it took and these children of Israel would give they'd have a dream or a word and they'd give it to Aaron or the aaronic priesthood and they would go into the holy of holies and they would speak this and the breastplate would cast a light right and if it cast a light then they would know that that dream was from the Lord or that word was from the Lord or they should do that because it was of the Lord because you can't mimic that there's nothing in there to cast that light but as the light would cast across us it would make a perfect rainbow light and there's no way to get a perfect rainbow unless you have all these stones in this exact order so God is giving this order to Moses to build the breastplate this way because he knows it's the only way that'll work and it can't be impersonated any other way I sent the brother a picture do we have that picture of the of the uh of the breastplate I know you don't bring in an evangelist to teach but I just feel like we should go this direction this morning okay so that's an exact order of the breastplate right I actually took this picture off of brother Tim Pruitt's desk this he has this sitting on his desk and it's exactly this way he got it from Israel and every stone in here and and these Stones aren't necessarily they're not shining diamonds they're not just beautiful works but everything is exactly in the place where it goes and when this this light would cast across this to Supernatural light would strike this it would produce a rainbow right and this is how God built this in this specific order to do his commission right that they would have a way to know whether they were walking in the word they would have an exact way to know and a verification to check with that they were walking in the word now think about this Fred Jordan how long would you wait in line to have two minutes with the prophet as long as it took you'd have a list of questions you'd have but you know what before you got there you'd probably know the questions and he would tell us you just beat his presence and just say what what do you have for me what are you going to say to me you say I really need to know this one thing and I would think that if we really if we really chiseled down away everything all the life decisions through the marrying and who the this and that and what's going to happen to this one I think the one thing that we need to be sure of is do we have it yeah because once you have that you can walk on in faith once you're established that you have the seed within you you can walk on in faith for everything else so I would think that if we were going to lay before the prophet or we were going before the yerman thumb of there was one thing that we need to be sure of is that we have the seed of God within us that we have the Holy Ghost living within us and if we're sure of that that we can walk on and the rest of the promises because we already know they're for us right and if God before us who can be against us but we know where we're standing right we know where our confidence comes from now now I know this may be a little bit slower this morning but just bear with me so God designed it this way that they would have a way to check where they're at and he designed it so specifically everything had to be in perfect place we just read that out of Exodus right everything had to be just this way and the measurement was this and this was this and this and this and this and God has an exact order to how he creates things now this is his perfect way right now if we turn here uh to the book of Ezekiel the 28th chapter we'll find this same pattern again moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say to him thus saith the Lord God thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty now he's speaking of Lucifer here thou Hast Spin and Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was upon that covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the barrel the Onyx The Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of that Tavaris of that pipes was prepared in the in the day that was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thouest upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that was created till iniquity was found indeed how many stones do we count in Exodus 12. how many stones did we count right there in Ezekiel sardius topaz somebody counting this diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald carbuncle gold how many did you come up with nine sardius topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper Sapphire there's three rows of Three Stones there nine stones that's not the same I'm not good at math brother is that the same there's three missing right now why why can't Satan worship like you can worship why should we not be afraid of being an impersonator because he can't impersonate what we're doing he cannot impersonate the word he can impersonate the shouting the dancing the jumping the tongues the prophecies the the sermon he can he can all that but he can't impersonate the word why because he's missing something amen he's missing something that we have now we counted right I just showed you scripturally right are we good yeah 12 9 12 9 he's missing the third row if you go back and check it he's missing the third row of stones he does not have it you just read how God designed Lucifer he does not have the whole package he doesn't have all the stones that you have you are designed in such a way God built you in such a way that every stone is in his place and this Dimension is just right and he has all that just so close but he is incapable of matching you step for step that's why the prophet would tell us there are places you can go in this word that the devil can't follow you there's a place in Revelation there's a place in worship there's a place in the word that you can go that the devil cannot follow you he cannot go with you because he is not made the same way that you were made he does not you have he does not cast the same colors that you come that you cast you're made differently than he is he's not equipped to go where you can go it's time for us to step into a realm where the devil can't follow us are you tired of the devil beating you are you tired of the devil coming at you and hammering your mind and hammering your body and he's just over your day and night that it's time to go further into the word then he can go we are built to go places that he cannot follow us it depends on what vehicle we're in now we could go back to a horse and buggy and try to outrun him and he's going to catch up to us now in the horse and buggy age that was as fast as they could go right we're in an area we live in there's a lot of Amish folks and they ride horse and Buggies and that's just as fast as they go top speed of 12 miles an hour and that's as fast as they're able to go there's no there's no world outside them to go any faster and that was their age and Martin Luther went as fast as he could go in his age there was no other vehicle for him to get in to go faster that was just how as fast he could go and then we move into the automobile age and you get an old model T and they go about 35 miles an hour and that was so much faster than the horse and buggy and everybody was in the car and they were going faster than the next guy and that was a progression of the age and they got into another vehicle and they were able to go faster they will ever go further and then the car develops and the car develops right and then but pretty soon the car is going 100 miles an hour 200 miles an hour and it's going so much faster the horse and buggy just looks like a blower going by but both in the same age right but then comes the airplane and the airplane goes so much faster than the car goes and they get into that vehicle and they're able to go faster and higher and further and they could go around the world and you see the vehicle that they're in but the same age the car and the buggy are still in existence so you can choose to ride the buggy if you want to it's still in this age you can choose to drive a car and never get on a plane and it would take me 10 or 12 hours to drive here but I can fly here in an hour all right it's my choice if I want to drive here in my car and take 10 hours to drive here or I can get in another vehicle and I can go so much faster and I can go so much further but they're both in existence in the same age now now the car when there was no airplane left that was as fast as they could go he couldn't John Wesley couldn't go any further he can only get in the vehicle that was for his age but we live in another age where there's a choice to be made there's a choice of what vehicle you get in now you can stay in an airplane and you could be bound under the layers of the ozone but now we live in another age where there's a rocket in the H and you can choose to get into that vehicle and you could go so much faster and so much higher in a place where the airplane cannot reach where the car cannot reach where the buggy cannot reach but you've got to get into the right vehicle let me say that this message in this hour is the rocket of this age and if we get in this vehicle we can go places where the devil cannot follow us he cannot go there he doesn't have the fuel he doesn't have the option we can go higher than he can go because we are built different than he is built he's not built like we are we just read it in the scripture he doesn't have the same material you have but God Made You with the material takes to go all the way Hallelujah I don't think we should be singing I'm just barely gonna make it I think we should be singing all the way I'm going all the way that's our song because that is what we're here to do I don't know about you church but I am not settling for stopping short of perfection I get her settle to stop short of every word and promise that's in this book I'll take it and settle this for you do you see this Revelation do you see that the message came to you do you see there's going to be a Rapture ask yourself do you see brother do you see there's going to be a Rapture let me settle this it's for you for you you can see it it's yours today bring a supernatural revelation hey God bless you folks good to see you we met back in Ohio right right okay God is not going to bring a supernatural Revelation to you and then tell you it's not for you here's this display the table set come and dine oh wait not you no do you see it yeah yeah do you see that there is a perfect healing yes do you see that there is a God that answers do you see that he's a miracle working God do you see that he's still filling hearts and changing lives and bringing back prodigals and setting the captive free do you see it then it's for you if you can see it then God has revealed it unto you and it's yours to have so don't let the devil tell you that it's not for you it's for your neighbor it's for so and so or it's for the pastor is for you if God showed it to you then it's yours to have and This Promise is unto you and unto your children and unto as many as the Lord Our God shall call This Promise is unto you see it he tells the brother random ask us that do you see it yeah why because he's establishing the faith within you that I see that if you see it take the land taste and see that the Lord is good when Joshua sent two spies Moses sent to him Joshua sent two they came back and said the land is ours they came back and said we've already we've already overtaken it we've already he's so afraid of us he's cowering down in fear we don't even have to raise the sword we'll take Jericho without lifting one sword now whose report do you believe well the devil's Mighty and he's got a Punch coming and you better be careful and you better watch out where you're going you might get too bold whose report are you gonna believe yeah there's Giants in the land but you're able yeah there's enemies to defeat but what are we here to do you think we're just here to live out our 75 years we're here to fulfill a commission and why and walk into the word of God go somewhere in the word today that the devil cannot follow you go somewhere in a spiritual atmosphere you ever get when's the last time you were drunk in the spirit and you just felt like you were the only one in the room there was nobody else around it was just you and him it was just you and him and nobody else to see the devil wasn't in there the Devil Couldn't enter the holy of holy because you found yourself in the inner Tabernacle just you and the spirit of God just you and him and nobody was there to interrupt that or to disturb that and you could they they've drugged me out of places that no idea how I got to my bed nobody was there to disturb that just me and God when's the last time that happened for you yeah it's something you need to try right you know we were out in the world we wanted everybody to have a good time like we were having a good time here brother have them have the bottle here past the bottle we pass it around and here have some of this and every you wanted everybody to enjoy the way you were enjoying it well I think church is the same you want everybody to enjoying the blessings that you've enjoyed in your life I think it's time to pass the bottle around say hey have a good outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your life and it'll notify your face that's your raptured it'll notify you that you're being delivered it'll notify you that you've got a reason to shout and a reason to praise the image is speaking for itself we are the ones that are called to speak in this age why cry unto me speak why cry unto me lamentation speak and go forward and what is the direction of the Holy Spirit forward never backwards friends we're not interested in going back to Pentecost we're interested in going forward to Pentecost the original pattern of the church now don't take us back to Azusa Street but go forward into the blessing somewhere that Satan cannot go he's not built to go there he's not made to do that yeah you want to hear the prophet say it questions and answers now watch that pattern I'm taking a lot of time but look Judas Iscariot followed the same tracks he was justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus and then accepted him as his personal savior he was Sanctified and give power to cast out spirits but when it come to Pentecost amen and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word did I read that right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the fullness of the word when it came time to Pentecost now we're moving Way Beyond the denomination don't get caught up on the denominational term that's a label and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word he showed his colors that's exactly what the Canaan spies did exactly what Esau done they showed their colors if you take those three stones out of the breastplate and you cast a light upon it you know what you'll end up with a six-colored rainbow but if you put that third Stone Those third row in there you'll end up with a full rainbow he cannot Satan cannot impersonate you he cannot go where you can go why are we playing with him in a realm where he's able to access why are we going and hanging out in a place where he can go and he can pull on us and he can take us and he can affect our mind and he can battle us and he can give us this and he can give us this thought and this Affliction why are we dwelling in a place below where we can go well I'm tired of dealing with this with this person I'm just gonna I'm just gonna cut them out of my life and there comes a time when sometimes you just got to get around situations and just come out from influences in your life you're trying to do something for the Lord and this influence comes along and all of a sudden you feel like you're back down you got to cut influences out of your life you got to cut things out of your life and we're afraid to offend people all right I don't know brother we're afraid to offend people and we don't want to hurt their feelings we don't want to lose their friendship but yet we'll let the Lord stand in the corner with dirty feet we'll offend the Holy Ghost every moment of the day not to offend somebody else but more than that what even more of a disgrace is we're afraid to offend the devil and we won't take God in his word I say devil get behind me I've had enough of your lies I've had enough of your torment I've had enough I've had enough I'm moving on into the promises of God I am going somewhere that you cannot follow me I am going into a place in this word that he can't come he's not he's literally not built the same that you are he doesn't have it he can't go where you can go why stay down here when you can be up there remember the eagle in that story brother man would tell about the the eagle standing on the branch and those Chipmunks were just chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter and the Eagles sitting down there and brother bear looks the eagle he says why are you still here haven't you had enough of this he says almost like the eagle Cottage thought and he took one look and just one flap that chipmunk couldn't go where the eagle can go now the eagle has the choice to stay there or he has the choice to rise up now you have the choice to stay down here and listen to what the devil will tell you and tell you you're not good enough and tell you you're not gonna make it and tell you you're good for nothing and tell you it's for everybody but you and give you a million reasons why that this word is not for you you can choose to stay down there and battle with that or you can choose to use your god-given ability to rise above rise above every accusation he's not going to stop accusing you the accuser of the Brethren accuses day and night the only way to get away from it is to enter into the holy of holies where he cannot go he's not built to go into there he's not designed to go into there there's only one that's designed to go into there it is the bride in this hour she was built with every stone to go into there I think it's interesting if we look at this the stones that he's missing we'll try to get through this quickly the liger Stone was the first stone that he's missing on that third word I want to get into the you can go back and study it on your own time it's a good study comes from the tribe of God and it's an amber color God is a judge it means to be Vindicated he can't be Vindicated anybody ever taken the time to look up what Vindicated means it means to be loosed to be free Vindicated loosed overcoming power is what it means an overcoming power to be loosed the devil Works in ways that we're not always ready for he's Sly he's slick and he attacks us in ways we don't see coming and sometimes he'll put thoughts in our head and we wonder where they came from we think why did I think that well it's not your thought remember brother Brandon would be counseling that man he would have a thought and brother man would tell him you that wasn't for you it was for me the devil put that in your head because he knew I would see it that wasn't your thought that was the devil's thought so you see in that we see that the devil has access to your minds and he can plant a thought in there so you might be worrying even with this service today but those are not your thoughts because you're a child of God and your mind is fixed on the word right so if it's any other thought you know where it came from right and so the devil works like this and I you know sometimes he works in ways that we we don't we don't even see coming and we'll have a thought and we'll if we don't identify immediately where that thought came from it'll control our mind I'm just going to be real real with you for a second there was a time I was going through something in my life that I was I was ready to give up I was just done I actually we were on our way to church and I told my wife I said I'm I'm talking the pastor after service and I'm going to step out of the ministry and step down from being a deacon and just stop all this and I'm just gonna see what you know see where it goes but I'm just I'm just done I got so down and just so so down in the place that's why I know what I'm talking about when I preach that there's Freedom right go bound up in my own mind well this brother thinks this and this situation looks like this and this and this and this and this and this you begin to you begin to see all these things and then once the next movie comes in and begins to make you doubt your belief right I think well you know maybe there's you know against the Whittle away at that see if you don't identify where the thought comes from you'll give it power and I literally showed up to the service that night with every intention of resigning and I sat in the front row like I was sitting right here and I'm a pretty excited guy when I'm when church was going on I'm ready to have a good time when I'm playing volleyball I'm having a good time when I'm in church I'm having a good time but this service I was literally sitting on my hands I didn't want to say Amen I wasn't going to give the satisfaction of that preacher to say amen I wasn't I was done and I knew that if I engaged in the service there might be Freedom there but I didn't want to be free yeah yeah I didn't want it I wanted to live in my own my own uh depression and I just sat on my hands for the while I physically sat on my hands oh this is okay but yeah and he started preaching you know what he turned to Psalms 27. you begin to to preach on my desire is to seek thy face I thought this guy's trying to get me it was a Thursday night it wasn't even a Sunday morning just the Thursday night it was sitting there and he probably preached 45-50 minutes and I I sat on my hands I wouldn't say Amen I'm just everybody next to me hey man hey man and I I can tell and people were thinking like what's wrong with him and I was like I don't care I'm mad and I want everybody to know it but where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty even when you want it when you're in where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and he began to labor in that I remember he said please stand and I didn't even stand up I just sat there in my hands I could feel just the Lord dealing with my heart and just I mean and I've you know I've been I I believe I got the baptism the Holy Ghost as a young man maybe in 2021 and I this was way down the road this wasn't just maybe five years ago that this was going on and and and I thought well I know I've had an experience with the Lord but and he began to woo me just like he did on that first day and it was the same atmosphere in the same anointing and I thought no I'm not going to do it I'm not gonna do it but you know what happened brother something inside me took over that I had no control over right no control over and it was like a flood of Life came back to where there was dead spots it was like a flood of Life came back where there was limbs that were dead and useless and they had no flow of life and then but all of a sudden to begin and you know why because the devil works like this brother random describes him as a transparent band that gets around now if I if I put a if I put a band a zip tie around my hand and I put that real tight this this hand is going to go numb right it's going to turn purple it's going to turn useless I'm not going to be able to use it for nothing it's just going to hurt it's just going to be a dead limb right and brother Bram says that that's the way a spirit of unbelief works is it gets into your mind and it's a transparent band that binds your flow of faith and if you don't remove it then it's cutting off the circulation of life to your faith but in the presence of the Lord it breaks those bands in the presence of the Lord it breaks the band that would bind your unbelief right now this this this stone that that that that the lager Stone is only is only a value in one condition you know how they find out that it's a real lager they hold it over a fire and that's the only way you can tell that it's a real Liga Stone by this by the light that shines through the stone but it has to be held over the fire and through the fire the value of the Stone comes out through the fire the value of what's on the inside of that Stone comes out through the fire is where you're really made to be who you are and the fire is really when the real you comes out but you know what brother Brown said when those three Hebrew children went into the fiery furnace it killed their the mightiest men he sat with him this is how stupid the devil is I'm sorry but he's just dumb he's just dumb he says send these three Hebrew children and send my mightiest men with them they're not built to go where you can go Satan's mightiest men are not built to step where you are built to step Satan's mightiest demon 200 000 000 Horsemen are not built to go where you can go you are built to go into another realm you are built to go into a higher plane and as they begin to step into that fiery furnace turn it seven times hotter where are we at friends we're in a seven times hotter age they are not built to keep up with us it's time that we recognize who we are and the commission that we've been given to go beyond where they can go and as they stepped into that fiery furnace the devil's mightiest men were burnt in an instant because of how hot that fire was yeah oh but the children of Israel were burnt were built to step on that it's in the fire that the value of the Stone comes out and as they walk into the fire and they're still there and they're still there and they're still there but who's that Fourth Man In The Fire where are we at friends we're no longer in this age of of an airplane or a car or a horse and buggy we are in the fourth flight of this age we are in the coming of Christ the bride age is on the rocket age the Golden Age The Eagle age whatever you want to call it I call it my age and my age is here to go beyond where other people have gone because there's a fourth man with us and you know what brother bam said all that that fire did for those Hebrew children it didn't make them smell like smoke it didn't make them it didn't cast their hair on fire it didn't sing their fingers it didn't sing their feet you know what he said it broke the band broke the band now you might be fighting with a transparent band of unbelief and you don't know how to get it off yet in the fire get in the fire of God and all that fire will do for you is loose your band oh us life to come back into you break the band off and remember what it was like to have to have fire in your hands remember what it was like to happen the blood flowing through your body but the value of it only comes when it's put in the fire so thinking not odd that we go through these fiery trials but they are of the Lord to give us the value that's within us right we're still speaking of the Masterpiece but God sees the image of what he's trying to get out he sees what he's trying to bring out and he will not settle until he gets to perfection prophet of God said that God has a perfect picture of you right yes I used to think Jordan I need to be in shape when I'm 19 or 20. because that's where I'm going to come you know that's that's gonna be my body for eternity but a lot of us had scars by the time we were 19 or 20. a lot of Us carry things that we didn't we didn't want in our body well I got a tattoo when I was 14 does that mean I'm gonna have it over there because I'm 19 year old body that's not the perfect picture of you he took right the picture of you he took was in the back part of his mind before the foundations and that picture of you is the one he's looking at now he's the artist and he's comparing the picture a little more fire a little more trial uh there's still a little bit too much of them there right there's still a little bit too much of this Fallen nature there I see the picture yeah and he's looking at the bride picture she's almost ready yeah she's almost ready I see a perfect picture of her somebody graffitied a little spot there washed that off I see a perfect picture his picture is oil based it's not just washed off it's not just wiped away but it's there by oil and he sees this perfect picture of you and he's the developer how many knows what a dark room is right and he takes this I'm not a photographer again but I just know a little bit about it and they go into this dark room now in the old days they took this camera this picture they'd have this big Hood over them and they'd have a light bulb and it would flash and it would capture the image yeah it would it would strike that image the light would strike this magnetic film right well the one who took the picture is the only one who knows what it looks like yeah you were having your arm around somebody else and maybe this guy had his hands behind you or maybe you weren't smiling or maybe you were blinking but the one who took the picture we have a couple of photographers in the church and we're good friends until it's family picture time and then don't do this don't do that take your hand in your pocket do this smile but she's the one who sees what the picture looks like and all the while he knows what the picture's supposed to look like he's the one who took it yeah but it's got to go through the development stage and he takes it into this I believe correct me if I'm wrong but I believe there's three major chemicals that you use in a dark room I remember the names right now but there's one tub of liquid and there's another tub of liquid there's another tub of liquid right well in this dark room there's no light allowed except for a red light right am I right so this picture the only thing that sees this picture is through the lens of this red light and then the developers looking at this picture and he's holding it up to this red light and the only way he sees it is through that red light contrasting through the picture right and he takes it in the first tank and he takes it through justification and he's rinsing it out and he's holding it to the blood and he's holding it up there looking at that lens and he's taking it no a little more justification and he's developing the picture that he sees because he knows it's in there yeah and he takes it to the nest tank and he's sanctification he's going to rinse it out in sanctification and he's holding it up to the blood out yeah he's the developer he knows what the picture looks like yeah he knows the potential that's within you that's right he knows that all this all what needs to be wiped away and there's false light in this slide and different images and everything on this image and he's going to wash it until it becomes a clear picture you know the last thing that they take it in it's called the sealer no photographer puts that photo in the sealer until the first two stages are complete and then when the first two stages they hold it up and it looks like just like the picture they put it in the sealer and they sealed that photo and it hardens and it becomes and then you can turn the light on and then you can look at it because it's the manifestation of what was taken on that camera many years ago and some some pictures are just coming to development some some people are at different stages of this development but we're all developed into the perfect picture of Christ do we trust him enough to let him develop our picture do we trust him enough to let him have his way in our life that he could do what he pleases to get the full value of what's inside of us I believe he knows us better than we know ourselves I believe he knows what's inside of us because the blood is telling him what the image looks like right the blood is speaking better things over you than you realize it if you were to tell your own testimony if you were to have the own word of your testimony you would say I'm defeated I'm down I've made mistakes I'm I'm in a dark place I don't know where to go and you begin to tell your own testimony but thank God we're not the ones telling our testimony the blood speaketh better things the blood speaks better things I think we should let the blood speak for us let the blood speak over us the image will speak the blood yeah the blood brother man would have an interview as we try to close here brother bam would try to have an interview with his sister Bruce right before he goes out to preach the message the masterpiece it's called private interview it's about seven minutes long you should go listen to it sometime especially a young person battling with whether they have the Holy Ghost or not and this sister is a good saintly sister and she's she's there gotta got just a few minutes with the prophet and what's her question do I have it yeah and you say sister you're a good sister I've known you I've watched over your life I've seen I've seen you I I've watched you under vision and I don't see anything in your life that would hinder you from the Holy Ghost now he's saying I can't tell you you have it it's got to be a revelation yeah but what he is telling her is I don't see anything in your life that would hinder you from having it he said I've watched over your life I've watched everything now what would that mean to us my just to have that word of encouragement yeah the prophet to come down to you and talk to you and say I I don't see anything in your life you're you're walking on in total Victory I see you there and what a consolation that would be but you know what she does the same thing we would do without a revelation he says but but you don't know all the mistakes I make you don't know how the mind battles I have you don't know how I failed him you don't know how I've questioned him you don't know how I've wondered you don't know and he's saying sister I'm looking into your life and I don't see anything and she says now he said now sister I'm about to lay my hands on you and I'm unworthy to do that but under the blood of Christ it speaks better things over us than even how we feel or what we see he said now I'm going to lay my hands on you because I am not a sinner under this blood and neither are you just take out sister Bruce's name and put your name right there under this Blood I am not a sinner and neither are you I am not a hypocrite and neither are you I am not a make-believer and neither are you but under this Blood I am a blood-bought son and daughter of God and I have rights to enter into every commission that the Lord has given me I say let the blood speak better things over your life than even you would say the blood will speak greater words than your mama would say the blood will speak greater words and you would like to imagine about yourself let the blood speak for you the blood has a voice in this age let us speak the blood is just as powerful as age I say let it speak let it come forth in power let it speak the worshiper once purged but under this Blood oh my we've got a reason to sing under this Blood these Egyptians that you see today you will see no more forever right why because you're under the blood if you're looking for me and you can't find me it's cause I'm under the blood the devil's out there like a roaring lion he's looking and he's looking to see whom he can devour and guess what he doesn't see you he can't see you he can't see you why because you're under the blood and he's looking and he's looking and he's looking who can he devour he can't see you you're under the blood I'm already under the blood but you know what Joshua would have left that bucket in there and he'd left that hospital that simple Faith right there the death angel would have come in his house and taken his life yeah but the blood had to be applied and he took that hospital out of the bucket he walked outside I imagine he started painting in that doorpost and have the perfect miter joints it was just an old doorpost and he began to paint it and began to paint it red I think we need to paint it red they stole our car phrase paint the town red I think we need to paint the town red again paint the church red again use the blood and apply it over your life paint this town red again paint this hard red again let the blood be applied stop coming to church with condemnation on you feeling like you're never gonna make it let the blood speak over you these Egyptians you see today you will see no more forever and what happened oh well Glory that's a good thought oh no you see you weren't there when the task Masters whipped them when the taskmasters kicked him and had whips and had and killed their friends and threw their bodies over here and threw them over there and you see in that moment every Glory every accuser yeah yeah everyone who had dirt on them that some fear that a sin would come back to haunt them everyone that knew that about them they watched be destroyed Under the Red Sea they watched The Blood come and destroy every accusation every enemy that they had they knew why they were shouting they knew why they were worshiping because every accusation that had come against him had been cast into the sea have been cast into the blood and the and that blood speaks something over the church that Satan will never hear these words he will never I want him to hear this because he'll never hear it to him it is for the bride and the bride alone you never did it in the first place you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and you never sinned to begin with it was not you in the first place let the blood speak better things over your life I think it's time we listen to the blood take the simple faith and apply it over your life and say I claim the blood and Jesus shed on Calvary those blood stays were made there just for me I never did it in the first place it wasn't me I'm not guilty I'm free I'm free they knew what they were shouting about [Music] they knew they had been given Liberty oh and you know what they weren't allowed to do in Egypt they weren't allowed to play their tambourines that's right so the first thing they did Miriam grabbed her tambourine said we're not in Egypt anymore we're not under the bondage of this one or that one anymore we're not under the label of this or that anymore we're free we're free now think about this there was two million people that came out of there right so if you just take it down to to adult aged women probably 200 000 250 000 out of 2 million a quarter of them how loud was that shout 250 000 women that have just been liberated from the bondage of condemnation the bondage of slavery the bondage of having to lose their firstborn or having to be told to do or what to do or can you imagine the shout [Applause] how loud it echoed all the way back to Egypt and Egypt knew that their army had been defeated by the shout of the king in the camp I think it's time we let the devil know who's on The Winning Side we are not defeated but I want him to hear it all the way down in hell where he came from we are not defeated but the shout of the King has returned to the camp we know why we're worshiping we know why we're praising we've been in Liberty in the house of God to worship and to praise and to give him glory it's our commission praise the Lord oh my God think about this friends now it's not just the women but now every son and daughter of God has been given the same promise these fearful spirits that you see today you will see them no more Forever Friends Our God's not lost power I know brother Juan's been up to chibac ious Brothers there I was there about four years ago I just came back from there a few weeks ago and I'll I'll close with this testimony but I want us to realize the power of God is still alive we were there about four years ago and there was a there was a brother there used to be the I think he used to be the associate there at the church and then one of the brothers I was with asked how he was he said oh he hasn't been in church and he got sidetracked on this website and he hasn't been back he doesn't believe the message has been three or four years since he's been to church I said well let's go see him so we go over to his work and he was he was friendly shook his hand began to talk to him okay okay maybe three four minutes we'll see you tonight so yeah see you tonight he said wait what's tonight well it's a nice Church I think the meetings are on Tuesday through Thursday it was just in the middle of the week so he came to came to church first time in years sat in the back row brother preached had a good service the next night he comes he's sitting in the middle [Music] third night he comes sitting in the front row right there in that chair and the spirit of God began to move in that building and the pastor came down and he said he said I want to at the end of the service the Sun to the under the inspiration I've felt just somebody just needed to give their heart to the Lord I said somebody here needs to give it over to the Lord and the bass player was behind me and he stood up he said it's me it's me I'm the one I'm the one he's after I'm on me I need to give my heart to the Lord he ran to the Altar and started pouring his heart out to the Lord and after that just a just a Miracles started taking place in that place and after after just a uh maybe an hour of this taking place the pastor came down and he got in the in the line he said I want to claim my children he said I've got eight children and under this anointing and this power that's in this room I believe that God will hear our prayer and he said I've got eight but I want to claim my oldest because he's the furthest God he's the one that needs the most help and we called all his children by name and we began to pray over them now how do you get to see back you got to fly there right yeah there's a village about 800 people not more than that maybe 850 people the only way in is a is one flight a day that comes in so you don't just get there don't just show up there it's not on the way anywhere there's no Road I don't know how God did it but I'm a witness that he did it not 15 minutes after we prayed for that for that pastor's boy he walks in the back door I don't know where he came from he was red-faced he was drunk he was upset he comes in the back door and he leans up against the wall the back wall of the church and we I'm kind of looking at him you know wondering and I don't know who he is I've never seen him before and he just leans up and he starts raising his hand and singing the songs we're singing he begins to come out of his and begins to worship and about that time the pastor's wife just recognizes what's going on and begins to just take a Jericho march on her own around the church and began to scream begin to shake her tambourine why because she knew that God had moved in 15 minutes of prayer that she'd been praying for years and years and years and years but in 15 minutes God caused that boy to walk in the back door and to come into the house of God and while that was going on this brother sitting in this chair that I left the message he comes running to the front he says I see it I left Christ I have left Christ when I left the message I want to come back I want to come back into the fold I want to recognize Christ again I want to recognize all the power my life is gone I have no Liberty I have no freedom but I see that it's underneath this message and improve the repentant heart he comes back into the fold that was four years ago and I've told this testimony I've told this story and all the while the devil attacking me and saying well you don't even know if that brother's still in church well I just went there a few weeks ago and that brother is playing the guitar leading songs back in the house of God has never left since that day has been back in the folds since that day and you think what is too hard for God nothing is too hard for God well then I looked around the congregation and there was the boy I'd even recognize it because it looks like a whole different person not under drugs and alcohol but sitting in the Church of God is their oldest boy still serving the lord you see when God moves on the scene it's real it's not psychology it's not a workup but when God moves on behalf of faith of a child of God it's real the days of Miracles are not passed but it's right now they this is what we believe for what else are we here for this morning but to trust in him I believe is the same yesterday today and forever and yes that still excites me you might think I'm simple or juvenile by saying well you just said that but I I know what it means I know that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever means he's obligated to fulfill every promise in his word the same way he did it for them he will also do it for you he's obligated in his word the way the blood spoke for them the blood will speak for you he's alive friends the music players would come he's the same in every way that he was then we had a situation at the church a brother got real sick during covet we didn't know if it was long coven we didn't know what it was but he just began to just melt away just his body began to deteriorate and deteriorate turned yellow just lost probably 100 pounds just looked looked like death barely coming to churches because he didn't have the strength and we were all praying for him and pleading the blood over him and there was a service that happened in our church our pastor was preaching and the anointing of God came in that building there was there was people there in that service that had been born in the message 30 something years they've been coming to church and received the Holy Ghost in that service for the first time he's not giving up on that he's not gotten too Mighty where he's not still filling with his spirit I fear that many churches have gone back to trinitarianism it's the same it's the actual spirit of God why would we not want it in the church why would we not wanted to dictate our service and to move on our behalf and to control our worship and to be in our praise why would we I say we welcome the Holy Ghost I say we bring it in we invited and we say Lord I worship you I'll wash your feet I want the Holy Ghost to live in my life I want your presence to come it's abide in my soul I want the power restored that was once given I don't care what they label me I don't care what they call me I want the Holy Ghost to come yeah and while the spirit of God is moving in this service we're just moving to the ocean I think probably an hour and a half of prayer went on we're about to close it up in a voice told me brother one a voice put in my ear and it said don't forget Brother Andy he's the one who was sick and just melting away and just withering and he hadn't been in church in a while and I just happened to look back and he was sitting in the back row [Music] and so I leaned over the pastor I said do you have one do you have strength for one more said yeah I said Brother Andy he said bring him I said no we need to go to him and friends I've been I've been in church my whole life and I know the anointing is Sovereign it moves how it wants to move and most of the time you got to come to get under the anointing but this occasion the anointing was so powerful we began to walk down the Pew all the way to the back and that anointing just built and built and built and people I'm not making this up but people were literally passing out under the anointing walking down that aisle we found ourselves walking back here sitting right about where you are brother and and we just began to pray over him and it was one of those Sovereign anointings where I couldn't even get words to come out we just began to pray over him in tongues and supplication is not even having the words and and our pastor began to pray and he said if there be anything in your life that would hinder you from a perfect healing may it be forgiven let the blood just speak over it and let our brother be healed and he began to just pray over him and this brother's been in churches his whole life seemingly but there was such an anointing that in the same Pew down the row one of his daughters had a blood issue was scheduled for a full surgery the next week and under that anointing without even having hands splayed on her she was healed and that instant by that anointing that was in that room healed of a blood issue she had for six years she was healed right there [Music] why wouldn't we want the power of the Holy Ghost in our church [Music] that's gonna physically heal me but I know something changed on the inside of me I'm not the same person I was I'm ready to meet him if he should call me I was afraid before but I'm Not Afraid now I know that he came to me I know that he spoke to me well just a few weeks later I was on my way to a wedding I tell these all for the glory of God friends I was on my way to a wedding and I was going to go this certain route but I I decided to go this way and I get a call from his daughter and said they didn't know what was wrong with them and finally they took him to a specialist and the specialist told him you've got pancreatic cancer your pancreas is covered in tumors and cysts dozens of them just tumors all over it he began to talk to him he said is there any history of this yeah my dad died of pancreatic cancer at my age and the doctor told him well this is probably how you're going to go it's just a genetic curse there's nothing we can do for it we can't operate it we can't touch it it's just all over it it's just every your pancreas is covered in it and I was on my way to this wedding and his daughter calls and she says I don't know if there's any way you can make it there but he's about to get a secondary scan taken of how they're going to go forward and treatment and is there any way you could go encourage him and pray with him I was 30 minutes from the hospital he was at this is a three-hour Drive I just happened to be 30 minutes from there and you might think there's no way that God can get to your situation and come to where you're at but he's already on the way because he knows where you're gonna be when you call out his name and he's already come to meet you at that intersection we walk in that hospital room and I just asked the brother I said brother I believe God's A Healer he said I know God's A Healer and he began to testify to me about all the things that God had done in his life and all the healings he'd seen all the Miracles he'd seen take place and that the atmosphere began to change in that room he testified to me for over an hour of the hand of God moving in his life I didn't preach to him I didn't I didn't I didn't try to I didn't try to work him up I didn't try to Baby him he encouraged me by the word yeah it's in that place to sit brother can I lay my hands on you he said I wish that you would pray for me and as an anointing was there I just put my hands on my sin Lord God you're the same yesterday today or forever and I believe if you ever healed a man once you'll heal him again and our brothers poured out his heart to you and he's he says search me and try me if there's anything in me Lord remove it Lord bring healing to his body we curse this generational cycle that's over his life we curse this generational cycle that Satan has tried to put over his life to tell him that he's never gonna move past it we curse that in the name of Jesus Christ just a simple prayer and brother I walk out and as I'm walking out there's a there's a space there between the curtain and the door I said Lord you'll cause these scans to come back clean I will travel the world and tell of this miracle and I walk out the door I didn't make it two hours down the road and those other scans came back in the day had already taken but the results hadn't come in until I was two hours down the road and they said there's no cancer on your pancreas we have one skin of it like this and another standard Pro Player yes [Music] hey and forever if he did it for him he'll do it for you if he build one he'll fill another he's the same oh friends why don't we let this why don't we let the artist who knows what we are going to work on us [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] Oh The Blood s that she Jesus [Music] oh it's in a personal revelation way back [Music] from days [Music] void reaches [Music] [Music] anything [Music] I'll see it was [Music]
