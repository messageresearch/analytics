in the house of the Lord this morning and uh it's good to see the grace of God on your faces and uh uh the Lord bless you you may have your seat I have a few prayer needs I want to read to to us this morning before we uh uh going into praying praise the Lord and I think the Lord kind of for ordained that we should have a prayer meeting in the first month of the year and uh because I did not plan it but I think uh the Lord kind of for order it that way and uh uh right after the 31st Service uh many many of the Saints God sake and and uh uh and so we started having prayer meeting just not to keep much time in the building and uh by the grace of God most everybody has recovered and then um uh out of that also brother brother Lawrence took something that he was alleged to and he kind of broke up things on his body but he's doing well and uh so last Wednesday he was prepared to lead Sunset I told him no uh let's just continue the sunset service you Le songs on Sunday and then uh uh it turned out also that uh uh he couldn't be with us this morning so I feel like the Lord want us to continue this way and I think it's a good thing uh for the church and as many as many of us uh many of you know as we uh uh if you have observe how we have uh order prayer service around around uh the the Tabernacle year it has always been from prayer needs and and burden because that's what I believe uh um prayer is it's a burden that is from the hearts of the people when the people bring in prayer needs and other things and uh so I've been turning a whole lot to lot of different SS prayer needs that been coming in on some of our uh Minister group text this is another prayer need uh from Brother D Smith Brother Dale Smith has not been with us for many years now because he's pastoring the church uh uh somewhere there in the harona area uh greetings all please pray for sister Diner beer she is a 80 year old sister in our church she fell and Fracture her shoulder in in lots of pains thank you kindly for remembering her and another prayer need um I humbly ask prayer for myself being down with uh Bron Cades since last week and uh this is uh another prayer need [Music] um brother

and uh I mean the the the enemy has uh been doing as much as he want to do we're just going to focus on the on the Rapture and the coming of the Lord he can go ahead and do what he want to do the Bible say he know his time is short so he's going to do he's going to throw everything in our way and uh uh I left from here last night maybe around 930 10:00 No 9 9 uh around 8:39 to get home and

the praise to you be the glory and honor in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen oh praise the Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you musicians thank you area let's turn to the book of uh collusion let's turn to the book of ction colan chapter 1 that will be after the book of Philippians before the book of first and second tting let's read from uh revelution chapter 1 verse 25 wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the Mysteries the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his sins to whom God will make know what is the riches of the glory of this mystery now you have to know now it's just one mystery but there is a three parts to that mystery amen verse 26 again even the mystery which have been he from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his sins to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles and what is the mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory father I pray that Lord you will bless this little word of exhortation and uh May something be said Lord that we encourage your people this morning in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat when you look in Revelation chapter 10 when you look in Revelation chapter 10 in Revelation chap 10: 7 uh what what stands out as a familiar ver uh verse in the Bible to us as message Believers verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall be begin to sound the mystery not Mysteries the mystery just one mystery and that's the same thing that Paul spoke about there in cusan the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets so this one mystery God has declared it to all the prophets down through the ages and this mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord amen Christ in you the hope of glory so uh we want to we want to encourage you a little bit uh uh yeah I was I was just I was just thinking this morning just when I got in the office praying a little bit and I just said Lord uh I mean there there's just a lot of distraction that is going on but uh uh we want to look to you the Altar and the finisher of our faith amen and pray that he give us strength and and inspiration this morning to be able to say something that will encourage you so we want to talk about this this one mystery this morning I'm not going to go into a lot of uh mysterious things or uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed that that is a whole series there but I just want to grab your attention to something just like Paul said as we have just read he says uh uh uh this mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory now you take think about it think about it this way and uh uh when when God made man in the beginning uh uh and then on the six day the Bible says he formed a man in His image and and he rested in the in the message uh uh uh God transforming power brother bam says God never work again because he got a man to to carry on the work praise the Lord so he he never work again he he started using man from then on so it gave us an idea to see that uh God had an ultimate desire desire was to be made flesh that is God higher expression amen when God Express himself he can express himself through the sun through the moon the stars and everything that he may but his ultimate his most desire expression is to be made flesh praise the Lord amen so then you can understand why that was a mystery like Paul said it was a mystery he from all ages because All Through the Ages is so easy for us to see men in the picture praise the Lord but the mystery behind the different men that God used All Through the Ages was that it was Christ the hope of glory praise the Lord amen the hope of glory Christ in you is the hope of glory are we together with our Christ in you we don't have a Rapture with our Christ in you we don't have eternity the hope of glory the thing that uh uh uh Heaven Waits For That Glory waits for that all the saints of all ages is waiting for is that Christ should be formed in in you the hope of this word this Earth cannot be redeemed until Christ is formed in you are we together Christ in you is the hope of glory and that is the mystery now we talk about sep and seed and water baptism these are all information they are all informations surrounding that mystery all through the years we have dwell on the information we have U on the information and F on the information no it's to coming it's three coming it's morning coming it's evening coming it's back work baptism front War baptism we are just forcing on information praise the Lord amen if a check is written for us to to cat the check and every one of us have a different idea of how much amount is on that check we're not going to cash it praise the Lord I think that's five I think there's no he the way he write his five it looks like S I think there's six we we not going to cash it and that's the problem with the church we just been arguing on the information we have not been cashing in the check to get the result we not been cashing the check to get the result and enjoy the benefit of what is written on the check for us we are living on a privilege we have a check in our hands and we just fing about who supposed to catch the check he's the next one in line and and and know this it's not this one and we just fing about that praise the Lord I was talking to a brother one time and a good friend of mine and and uh uh we were and and he taught that he saw something that that is an error so he says uh and and and and you know and and we say all the time uh you know Revelation chapter 10:7 you know uh in the sounding of the Mysteries you know and and then he said he says you see it's just one what is that one mystery so I saidwell if we would just have a conversation and stop fussing if we can just talk maybe we can reason together praise the Lord because in the mind of the bunch of Believers in the message when we read this scripture I I've been I've been guilty of there before you know when we read this particular verse we don't say mystery we say see mistress because we have now been exposed to all of these things that we think we know praise the Lord are we together so you will see that's the reason why uh brother Brandon would tell us that U uh uh Christ is those seals the seal is Christ are we together I don't want to get into into lot of explanation this morning but uh uh there's something on my mind and and that's what I want to go into this morning if if the Lord will help us and I think uh I want to I want to use that and and and see if I can encourage you but also I want to use that to also be able to uh uh speak to our local church situation or speak to our local church need praise the Lord amen and it's it's something that I've I've been studying uh a while now and and I T well I need to uh Lord I need to I need to find a good time to be able to to uh to bring this but I feel on my heart this morning that uh you know is going to encourage you are we together praise the Lord now so just like we said U uh um Christ in you is the hope of glory for Christ to be form in you is the hope of glory praise the Lord Paul will also say something in the same light in the book of galatian uh let's see if we can we can read it I'm going to read a quote here where brother Brandon referred to that but I want those to be able to look at that in in in galatian chap 4:9 19 Galatians chapter 4: 19 now I remember now Paul was speaking to this galatian and he was trying to encourage them uh because some of the things that they have got away from they started going back to some of those Traditions they started going back to some of those worthiness and they started allowing some things in their life and you know and then he started he started you know uh speaking to them from the the beginning of his writing he was very harsh to them he called in foolish galaan who have deceived you you know who have presented another of Christ to you but listen listen how he will speak to them here as a father in uh verse 19 he says my little children of whom I travel in birth again until Christ be form in you I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for I stand in doubt of you praise the Lord but he's expressing something here to them and saying my little children of whom I have traveled now he's using a kind of uh uh language of a woman that is caring a child or the woman that is respecting the child i' have worked with you I have Labor with you I've gone through your different birth pains as this word is beginning to form in you and just at a time where the word is beginning to form in you you are beginning to be distracted praise the Lord which of course it comes also with the natural birth uh not many times do the mother understand the language of her body when she's carrying a child praise the Lord like uh the they call it the morning sickness and the different things that that she would go through she don't understand that right from the onset she's expecting to have a child she want to have a child but when when that child is beginning to form in her the changes of her body she don't understand it until she she stole that she's pregnant until uh maybe you know if she has been a mother after a few time she might be able to pick up one or two things but a new mother don't pick it up all the time praise the Lord so let's read this together and then you will get the picture of where I want to go this morning praise the Lord this was what caught my my attention um uh brother Brandon said this in the message we have seen his tith and have come to worship Him and we want to read this to you he said this he said when Christ Jesus was being formed in Merit that's when the persecution set in that's right that's right that's when her persecution started are we together before then she was a lovely girl you know she could hang out with her friends but when she came to this place to start to tell everybody about this Angel visitation then that's when her person persecution started and then he read this very very verse we read he says and is the same thing in you the church is the same thing in you galatian 4:19 says there when Christ the hope of glory form form in you Christ is being formed in you when you are dying and Christ is coming to life wash the persecution set in wash trouble start on every hand watchh the devil go on the Rampage certainly when Christ is being formed in you praise the Lord can we relate to that is does that sound like something we can relate to amen does that uh uh uh uh uh you know uh uh kind of of kind of a speak to speak to us this morning praise the Lord and so that's that's where I want to go that's what I want to drive down this morning to be able for us to be able to see you know uh uh we we have to realize that the church is is uh you know is a is a type is a bride to Christ she's a type of of Christ in that way so we seeing here Paul tell in the church that Christ in you is the hope of glory amen he says and Christ in you is the mystery of all the ages of all the ages what God was doing since the beginning praise the Lord when God stepped down from him being an internal spirit because one time it was him and him alone when he stepped down from being an eternal spirit with a plan of creation his ultimate desire was to do among his people praise the Lord God plan was to have a family not a family where he leaves and and and travel a family that he would dwell with Exodus chapter 19 he said the same thing to the children of Israel I have chosen you as a family a Perpetual family a family of priests I want to make you that that is his desire he's not this God that want to be behind the clouds and have us on Earth figuring things by ourself no that's not his desire are we together amen are you are you beginning to see the picture a God that is distant he says uh H uh uh uh I mean uh uh uh we read that Deuteronomy Paul also echoed that in the Book of Romans you know if we confess with our mouth and believe in our heart he says we cannot say God must come from Heaven he's even n he's so close he is so close are you beginning to see the picture so that's his desire his desire was to D so when he came down and started making making an earth and separating the water from the land he said everything everything and and and every seed must must uh uh uh be able to bring for after his kind and uh you know put the the the fishes in the water the flowers in the air he said everything and then on the sixth day he said okay let us meet man in our image praise the Lord amen he's coming to that great expression now he didn't say let just let just make man to inhabit the Earth he says let make man in our image and in our likeness and the Bible says God made Man In His Image praise the Lord are we together so you see that was his ultimate desire Christ in you the hope of glory if you miss that you miss everything you miss the entire Redemption story The the Redemption story is not to make one h a holy man there in the church and make one holy bishop or Holy Father know that the the the Redemption story is Christ want to be in you Christ in you is the hope of glory are we together but see this picture that we are looking at now here is God All Through the Ages he have used different men and uh uh uh he started right down from Adam and then he called a man Noah uh that he told to build an act and then he got a man by the name of Abraham and he spoke to AB Abraham Abraham kept telling people you know I'm going to be the father of Nations I I mean God was dealing with him I mean many around him couldn't understand it until one day Sarah was called into the picture and God there with these men All Through the Ages but y City came to the place where God have chosen to come through a little virgin and he's going to get a bother for himself like we saw before he produced the egg cells and the blood cells and he's going to to to manifest himself and and in doing this we see here that uh just at this at this time like we said when Christ Jesus was being formed in Mary that's when the persecution set in Praise the Lord let me take you back a little bit let me take you back God told Abraham that I'm going to come down with a mighty hands after 400 years and I will deliver the people praise the lord it's a promise that has been lying down there until God gave a man amram a burden and he started praying and and and and that be to spread and people started praying and they started Desiring the deliverer they started Desiring that the deliverer will be born they want to get out of Egypt that I mean they on Bish yeah the tax Master is so bad to them they are whipping them they I mean they they are in pains they are not enjoying like it used to be when Joseph was once in Egypt praise the Lord now when God was about to send this deliverer praise the Lord amen just in the time where Moses was born when the deliverer was yet in an infant State when the deliverer was yet in the sea form what happened a persecution come on the people praise the Lord Pharaoh increased the attacks and again he said they have they having so many time to to to prayed and and all of that increased their work and for the matter of fact the the the the Egyptian are increasing so he said to them well let's get rid of all the all all the children from this setting age down praise the Lord are we together now so we see here that right at a time where the deliverer was going to be born a persecution said on the people of Israel so it is almost almost and always just at the time of our deliverance just at a time where God is about to step on the sin and bring his word to pass praise the Lord are we together amen but before Merit will be uh uh uh have any uh encounter with an angel or have a testimony to talk about an angel she had all her friends maybe she was the you know the the the more likable girl everybody talk about her the priest praise her in church praise the Lord but when she will come with that testimony that it is no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me hallah then her persecution starts are we together are you seeing the picture because it's a parting through God's word and the thing about it that is that that that I want us to realize is that uh it is the enemy that is trying to stop that word from coming to pass he's trying to stop you from getting to your full potential he's trying to stop you from getting to the place where you can really get you know he don't have a problem if you are just a church member he don't have no problem if you just warm the bench don't even understand what a preacher is preaching about it does not bother him at all praise the Lord but what really rock his but amen is when an individual or a man or a woman a young man or a older man praise the Lord say I want a life change praise the Lord I Want For Christ to be made manifest in me this thing they talking about about the joy of the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah you see that's one of the thing I can say you know many of our young people born around the message is robbed off they have really never seen the Holy Ghost manifestation because they born into a church where there is church order everything is kept kind they never seen anybody dancing in the spirit they really never seen anybody speaking in tongues and the moving of the Holy Ghost so as soon as somebody shout and they get uncomfortable to look and and and they see somebody jumping up they say what's going on it's it's all because I mean uh you you be robbed of that You' been Rob of that but there is a genuine manifestation of the Holy Ghost I'm telling you that can pick you up from your seat make you to run around this building and you don't even have control of yourself there is a true manifestation of the Holy Ghost that can get a person on their feet V in the spirit they don't care what you think about them you might get in trouble with God God our church is getting so quiet and de that's the reason why people can come and sleep are we together that's when when Christ is being formed that's when her persecution starts when Christ is about being formed in you the hope of glory then all hell break loose praise the Lord all hell break loose are we together and that's the kind of a thing I'm thinking in my mind I'm saying Lord what's what's going on praise the Lord sometimes it looks like uh you know uh uh uh uh things is getting out of order sometimes it's look but you see the the enemy brings so much pressure that sometimes you even think that I'm am I in the way of God why is all of this happening to me praise the Lord that's the same thing that happened to a woman that is having a morning sickness she just feel like sleeping the whole day and it's not normal yet she don't know there's a life that is forming in her praise the Lord It's Beginning to change her body it's beginning to change the atmosphere around her life praise the Lord you see but for a for a Believer for for for a man or a woman that have that I mean that that have been down some Rocket Road and have had experience with God when these things are happening around their life they stand back a little bit praise the Lord you see because the first thing there the devil will throw it right at you you know I mean you're not living right that's what is happening to you not serving God right that's why all of this is happening to you but a man that has been with standing with God he knows he knows that a life is beginning to form something is happening that the enemy is trying to create a distraction to throw me off because that's Satan greatest weapon amen that his greater weapon if he can make lot of noise for you to leave what you are doing praise the Lord amen lot of noise as much as we love this cell phone they're just coming distraction just to get your mind off that's how he work that his greatest tools if he can just create a form of distraction praise the Lord for you to not pay attention to that life that is beginning to form in you Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord as long as he can get you to the place of being a church member that's that's that's that's enough that's as far as he can bring you and identify with a church and still play in the things of the word but when a man or a woman try to live a separated life praise the Lord and you see that's the reason why many people are afraid of this Holy Ghost experience they know that is truth but they also know there is a li of sacrifice praise the Lord some are afraid that you know it might make them to L old schooled praise the Lord let's read on a little bit like I said it's just an exhortation to encourage you amen and I hope you paying attention to it and when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come the king's commandment all you people just as she was the Christ was becoming a four baby ready to be delivered right then a great persecution now the baby being formed for a long time all alone in the wom but this is but this is coming the last day when the completion when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among the people praise the Lord I mean even Even in our home you know I I sang this song this this morning and uh we were struggling with it right there I don't know why Jesus loved me I was lying down on the bed all the bed and and I was just I was I was listening to uh to something and and I was just trying to meditate I think I just came from studying and I was trying to meditate on something and and uh and the thought kind of for hit my mind you know uh uh um and then I started thinking about that song you know like I said we we get exposed to all of this information and we think that we have become too smart but we have to realize that the devil is smarter than us amen you have to realize that God is not requiring you to be smart either he want you to be a believer he want you to be somebody that believe his word because no matter how smart you are you can now be more smarter than the devil praise the Lord amen so I was thinking about this and and and and I thought about it because uh uh I mean like I said I've been down that road before you get so religious and now you begin to Jorge some ssongs you say well you know this song is I mean the the whing is not correct I don't know why Jesus loved me I mean the Myster of God has been revealed because I'm his bride that's why he loved me praise the Lord you know you you feel like that but you really don't know why no matter how how much mystery you think you know that you are the seed of God you are in the mind of God the four reason is not yet unfold to you praise the Lord amen and you see some of those songs are written from a place of deep inspiration Andrew crush is the one that wrote the song the same guy that wrote through it all he wrote that song praise the Lord and that boy was a stumbling child he couldn't he couldn't even speak out one word very straight and uh uh H never never never even learned how to play the piano you know but he always go with his dad you know to meetings and all of that it was it was the it was a falling of the anointing the Holy Ghost and and in the Revival meeting and and all of that uh you know and it just brought him to the place of of inspiration and giving some of those few choruses that we sing but but here is the thought that was on my mind sometimes and many times that is the reason why we don't we don't really appreciate one another amen because we feel like we are the better person in a relationship now there just take from the thought of I don't know why Jesus loved me because that was the thought I was on my mind that night I was singing that song and just worshiping you know uh uh just pouring out my heart to God crying on the bed and and because we we we always think about it praise the Lord when it comes to we and the Lord you will think that every one of us we think that you know the Lord in this relationship he's better than us amen but I will also say the Lord feels the same about you because if he never got you there is no way he will manifest what was in his mind there is no way he will make himself known so he feels like he esteemed you highly in this relationship are we together amen just like sometimes we think about it you know the Lord has been so good to me I don't even deserve his Mercy I don't even deserve his grace and I think in every form of relationship if you really sit down and look at it in the truth sense the man must must be able to say to himself that I don't deserve to have a wife like this the wife must be able to feel is not just a statement it must come from a deep true feeling praise the Lord because God with all of these great mystery in his mind there is no way he could have manifest his attributes until he make man in his image praise the Lord David said in the pm he says he said for that sake we have been killed all day long we are going through what we are going through for his sake why because he put you here on per on this Earth for a purpose and until that purpose is fulfilled you going anywhere if he has to drag you by the teeth he will drag you by the teeth nobody else is I'm not going to fulfill your purpose you can fulfill mine for his sake that's why we go through everything that we have gone through why because the love of God has capture our heart and will not allow us to do anything contrary to his word it is for his sake that we cannot go around living in adultery than living in in fornication it's for his sake you you you even find our young people trying to live a decent life is for his sake his name sake praise the Lord that's why brother would say something like God want to give you the Holy Ghost more than you wanted because he knows what you are going through he knows that he has set his love upon you you can't get away from it you don't even understand it you go through things in life you don't even understand it but because God love you and he's determined to save you he's determined to change your life he put lot of road blocks before you you climb over it you he make it more harder you climb you jump you fall down he pick you up he heals you but you see in our filal relationship we always think that we are the one that deserve the better no if you actually start to understand understand it if you actually start to understand it that without that man you wouldn't have been a mother without that woman you would not be a father without her you will not be a husband without him you will not be a wife praise the Lord I know we living in a crazy world where you can go and buy a a mannequin and put it in your house and address it but you know you just lying to yourself amen you can go down and buy a ring and put it on your finger and everybody to think that you are married you just lying to yourself so if you have somebody in your life you better realize come to a true reality because you see that's what it is it's a choice that's what the love of God is that God will leave everybody and set his love upon you praise the Lord that this woman will leave everybody and think their child this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life to you must say I don't deserve it it must bring you to a true feeling it's not a it's not an expression of appreciation it must be a deep TR feeling God has a go say one God one God but he manifested in three four purpose that one gold was the one mystery that Christ will be formed in you that's the hope of glory that's the hope of a millennium that's the hope of 1,000 years are we together we come so short because we use the very little knowledge that we have we read the Bible and H understand very little thing and then we just surround our entire brain around that thing and you think that you really know God and sometimes it put us to the place that can be a by place because it becomes a religious spirit a really true spirit of God will give you the desire to know more of God praise the Lord but when you come to the place and you think that there is nothing more you need to learn I already know that before the preacher open his mouth you already know where he's going I'm telling you you running without a message I have the message wait for me to learn well you see why we have all of these things around our life you just sit there sit there sit there and think about your own life why have we gone from one one trouble to another trouble why look in this book and and and talk about the children of that's the reason why the the the you know the the the unconverted Jews frown with the story in this book because if they are called God's people they have been surrounded with captivity slavery bondage actually they were God people that should be living in Hollywood and in the best mansion that's what Prosperity Gospel want to bring to you just have you settle down here all your life you are living for a just down year competition and what else you can get and and and then you know fill up all the all the shopping sites praise the lord we will back things that we don't we don't need we will never use are we together but you see when that baby begin to form when that life of God begin to form what we call the New Birth praise the Lord when it begin to form then we starts to have all of these things happening we have lot of example around around the the the scripture praise the Lord see and so it's it's some of those things as you know as as a pastor you you you sit there you watch the church you watch the movement of the people you watch the Wednesday service the Sunday service you know you are just there it's not it's not about the crowd no it's not about a crowd it's just to be able to see you sit back and see how God is helping the people you sit back and see the some of the challenges that the people are dealing with praise the Lord I mean the enemy coming and uh you know uh uh throwing sicknesses year and all of that uh I mean we sit back and we know that uh the shout of the king is in the camp amen we know the shout of the king is in the camp we have a Brazen sepin Jesus says that Moses raised up the Brazen serpent so the son of man will be lifted up you know we can look and live we know there one praise the Lord you sit back and see how you know the enemy come as a rolling lion and and then he gets he gets after the young people he gets after the little ones praise the Lord amen I you know I always tell parents you you know parents little little kids they are so special you know they are very very special and they they are very gifted very precious and and sometimes you you can you can you can be able to see a gift in a little child but you know as parents I always tell parents and just just like me as a pastor when I see a gift in somebody I don't go telling you you are so gifted no my my my my my position is to pray for you I prayed and watch and see let God bring out that you know and I see it coming out and you know well I as much as I can guide and that's what a parent supposed to be don't expose your child you find all of these things he's find people take a seven year old and you know and and and give him a microphone and say he's he's a preacher because you have taught him some Bible verses you are you are exposing that little child to demon Warfare you don't know the Devils that preachers fight he's too young for that as a parent you just pray you are seeing something in a child look at Paul is telling Timo you have a gift in your life that runs down from your grandmother and sometimes I think about it did she wash tumid your life and just pray for him you know the prophet God would teach teach us and says when you come in the meeting and and and you know we praying for all of these uh uh sickness and and things you say you have your little ones hold them closely and pray you know just pray them pray for them keep them covered you know uh uh uh uh uh because because that's that's what that's what uh uh uh evil spirit like evil spirit like to deal with people innocen praise the Lord now let's get back to our Tau here now let's read a little bit down so I can be able to get you out here but I I I want you to grab that picture I don't want you to miss it so now the baby is being formed for the long time he's talking about the church now he's talking about Christ being formed in in the church he's talking about the bride body for the long time since Pentecost a seed was sold on the date of Pentecost amen right there when they received the Holy Ghost what happened right there they were they were arrested chapter 4 they were weped they were told not to speak in thy name bringing them on the intimidation and sometimes a person get under so much pressure on they abought that life the baby been formed for a long time alone in the womb this is coming the last day when the completion when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among his people he says so he promised it in in his word and and and when there fullness you see there there is unusual things begins to happen that he promised and that is the reason uh uh our great uh uh shua life and things can understand that is foolishness to them watch they are forming a counsel of churches see just the time when the church is beginning is beginning to get to her feet where the Supernatural is begin to work praise the Lord so are you are you getting the picture amen uh h a a Christian Life that's what make it a dedicated life because it's a life where you are conscious of your surrounding you are conscious of your symptoms your spiritual symptoms you have to be conscious of it why am I going down this path what is happening to me you can you can't just live a Carefree life and you Says angels are watching over me yeah angels are watching over you they are there to guide you they are there to instruct you if they will instruct you then you must be listening if they must guide you you must be watching where they are guiding you to because that's what is happening and you know what happened is there it frustrate many people it frustrate many people because they don't see it they don't see that there is a life that is forming in them that is that is going to overtake this body praise the Lord no they don't see it and pretty soon they think that well you know Christian life is hard when I used to be in a word you know I I mean I I just used to do this I just used to do that I mean you I mean you have you have the whole word to yourself but when that life is beginning to fall in you because Christ in you is the hope of glory the earth is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God is the hope of this word Christ in you is the hope of this word if God can just get a little group of people that know what he want to do in this little building and become dedicated to it praise the Lord when you realize when you really know that you will not play with your prayer life when you get down to praying you will not just be missing words and repeating words he will get down and start crying to God and say Lord I don't even know what to say just gather my tears you won't play with your prayer life when that life begin to form in you see what he says here let's take this one Christ is the Myster of God revealed but all these mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth hell hell is against this truth which mean you are on the devil's radar hell is against the truth that you are bothering hell is against the truth of decency that you trying to live if you are not just dressing to conform to a church way of dressing you are dressing because you believe that this is a representation of Jesus Christ that a man should be and and a woman should be hell is against that held us against this truth of the revelation of this mystery one mystery keep it in your mind one mystery and what is that you you you don't need to you don't know water baptism you don't know godhe one mystery you must know let Christ be for me mean that is the hope of glory that is the mystery the rest of it is just information you just gone to spoken word bible school you get too much knowledge that it has robbed you from from the reality we argued about brother said oh no that said and we don't have the life to back it up H is against this truth the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it hallelujah what are we standing on let Christ be made flesh in me that's what we are standing on we're not standing on who is my pastor we're not standing on what church I belong to I'm standing on let Christ be made flesh in me that's what I'm standing on see what he says now what do you why do you hunger Church why do you thirst is the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you what what what what makes you that you are not satisfied with where you supposed to be why you keep having a craving in your heart is God trying to make you he that hunger and test for righteousness shall be filled why do you hunger Church why do you thirst is the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you the distractions the distractions their distractions the devil will just use some silly thinking some silly thing and before we realize all our time of concentration all our time of meditation just some silly things take over our mind and we even forget that we've been talking to the creator of heaven and earth when we supposed to bring that thing on our feet and say Lord I give it to you I know that this is the devil trying to distract me but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let the children you let the cares of the word you even let some pastors you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that you that way down in your heart you are thirsting way down in your heart what you need is not a bigger Church praise the lord we down in your heart what what actually you need what you what we really need is God we need God in our life he's the only one that satisfi he told Abraham I'm your satisfying portion praise the Lord when there is there wherever you find yourself you feel content and you do your best for the Lord amen praise the Lord if you cannot do anything for the Lord in a house meeting if you get if you get out there I mean you would just be lost if you don't know how to get yourself involv in a little body like this praise the Lord if you don't know how to get yourself involved you let some Pastor you let you let something else get there out of out of you when when you know way down in your heart you are thirsting H hungry is God trying to reveal to you see the Revelation the last day is here notice now now so you see uh uh uh uh uh I read something here to you where he also says that he says he says All Through the Ages the church have only strive when it's being brought under pressure history prove that the church you look in the book of Acts you read you read church history The Church strive the people get down to Christ to God when when when you know when when they feel some sense of pressure praise the Lord but you see also it's in the place where and that that that pressure comes that pressure comes it's it's two things that's happening because there is a desire in their heart there is a true desire and all the devil wants to do is to just fill it with something think when you can just stop to the place like well I like I like the pastor I like his preaching praise the Lord you just stop right there you feel satisfied if you see another person behind the poopet you feel upset because that's where you stop I like the pastor when he preach oh I like the church I like the music as good as we want good music we want the word of God rightly delivered to us praise the Lord amen we want the word rightly delivered to us we want the word engaging us brother B said we spend too much time telling the people what they must not do he said when Paul met the Philippian Jailer he told him what he must do when we spend too much time telling the people what we must now do that's when we preach a condemning message we condemn everything we condemn everything but we must be able to engage ourself are we together make us to see the spiritual reality that is that is around us Christ in you the hope of glory amen Christ want to make himself manifested in you that's his desire that's the reason why he's creating the hungering and the thirsting the more Cay for God and and uh uh uh the allowing things to come for us to seek his face and get closer there a life that we are carrying Within Us Praise the Lord there's a life that we are carrying within us let's read one more thing yeah we were close I get through AAS toight and we find another time I just wanted to encourage you after this prayer meeting we have this morning and uh you know you think right there in in recognizing your de in this message brother was talking about how uh uh uh uh back in uh uh 1958 you know he was talking about how the Revival was going around and all the people were saying pra pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray he says uh he says uh uh uh you know they were they were expecting something you know they were all wanting you know that God will send a Revival God would send he says but it didn't realize that it has already happen amen and I I was thinking about that but the reason why I was thinking about that not in not in that line the most but it is mostly at a place where that you know just like I said you know prayer is a bir burden the people Hearts has to be burdened the people has to bring their burden you know I mean you cannot you cannot just get people on an atmosphere and then you should uh uh let's pray pray pray pray pray loud pray pray let's just pray then you know I mean as if to say we selling something in a in the street market we must have something we commit to the Lord and we must engage ourself praise the Lord amen and if we don't have one we must not manufacture one are we together now so let's take this one adoption that will be my uh uh somewhere down there how that God has set some in the church through their labor pains oh they get tra tremendous sometimes when the church is groaning under the persecution of the word praise the lord of the outside word Believing on the Lord Jesus that that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cried on the labor pains praise the Lord amen how they groan and cry on the labor pains that's like like I said as many of us we I mean we have been robbed we we we you know we we uh born around uh uh a message church we grow in we know Church order and uh and and it's it's so easy for us to be critical and and then sometimes uh uh some of our uh uh saints that God will bless and bring into the Fai that you know uh that uh had uh you know uh the experience of the Lord sometimes many of them also you know become become shocked I'm I'm saying this because you know uh I was I was having u a conversation with uh with a d sin yesterday we were talking on something and uh you know I was just I was just trying to to uh you know trying to encourage uh the individual I was talking to and because you see like I said people coming you you you see the church order and and all of that and then it puts you to the place where uh uh sometimes it's almost like uh uh you know you you you feel a little bit starching you know you feel a little bit uh uh uh uh H lock in you know and then you know yeah brother BR talking about one year groaning under uh uh the persecution and now you will you realize that uh uh uh you read the book book of Acts and you read uh you see how uh uh uh that year is is kind of a type in a way of of labor pains and sometimes that's that's how you know some people are designed you know there are people that grown in the spirit if you if you reality you have not experienced that before you know uh uh it's it's a kind of a thing where you uh the person has a constant burden on their heart that don't go away from them sometimes I mean uh uh the least mov they have to close their eyes they just get to that place I mean you are so groaning that you can't you you can't you don't have enough words you know to be able to say what uh you ever see somebody in pains and they are just I mean they cannot express the level of pains that they are dealing with praise the Lord amen they can't express it I mean they are they are so locked in this pain I mean and and and and all they can do is to just grab their teeth together and just and just grown and and just oh praise the Lord trying to contain the pain and and and and and and also trying to contain their cried and and uh and and and sometimes people do that in the spirit you know sometimes people do that in the spirit I remember uh uh years back when I was traveling and sometimes I I'll be there I I just uh you know I say oh God and the brother will say what happened you know he would think that uh uh maybe I'm worrying about something and uh uh uh but my my heart is just my mind is just in such a place praise the Lord amen you know when Paul talk about uh pray without season you can really pray without ceasing if you learn to grown in the spirit you can pray without ceasing because you just carrying that thing in your mind you carrying that thing on your heart but here he's talking about labor pains how they grown and cry on the pains but when they are born and positionally born in the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some to be Apostles prophets now he's talking about how gifts are born and he gives into their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge and wisdom you know I was talking to a friend another brother I says you see uh uh because of the margin of error that we have had around the churches it makes people try to suppress spiritual gift amen but God still give his people spiritual gift praise the Lord God still people give gift I mean still give people the GI of Prophecy the GI of speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues I remember the other year that I was over in UK after preaching uh uh a Sunday service I I I could tell that this that that young that sister I I could tell that uh I mean uh uh uh uh that was that was just not a message breed amen I could tell that this was somebody that had the holy ghost that loved the Lord they believe the message praise the Lord because I mean right after the the service we got through praying and and you could just feel the atmosphere in the building and and I mean she was just all over the place lifting up her hands her High his shoes was somewhere else she was just prophesying and bringing the word of the Lord you know that this person has an experience with God praise the Lord but you see we become so sted we become so sted that we even we even hold ourself back from crying the god of Heaven that we supposed to cry to we hold ourself back from crying we don't want to cry we become so excellent in in our words we speaking grammar to God nouns and pronouns but at Birth God designed it at Birth when birth is about to come he designed it that both the mother and the baby of Christ he designed it when God is about to bring birth to a church both the church the preaching of the word the singing of the songs the people boss out in crying they Worship the Lord in tears they cry when the word is preached they cry when they prayed you know that life is about about to come that's the way that God designed it see this pretty woman she gets to the hospital she's smiling with everybody she happy that she's about to give birth when that pain starts to come she know she face her hair so nice when she gets on her labor pains that hair she took so much time to to fix she grab it she throw it everything away nothing matter to her she want to bring life what matter to her is that life is for that life to come forth praise the Lord musicians you can come that's my encouragement to you Christ in you the hope of glory if you just allow that word to take its place in your life allow that word to take its place in your home allow that word to have the preeminence and when things are happening you will not be quick to find the rots that are running around the house you know that the devil trying to create some distraction and get you off course and I believe that's what he's trying to do create some distraction to get off off off course praise the Lord make this one to fall and make this one to hurt and you know uh he want to burn out our homes and uh uh uh he might even get mad and put this church on fire whatever he want to do he want to create distraction he want to get us away from the word but if we know that and we identify that then that's the time where we have to put in more time to consecrate ourself he's creating distraction around your home making your little ones to be sake that's time where we put in [Music] time just before we prayed the technician asked me to announce that there will be a another training section next Saturday if you want to learn how these things work if you are interested just come uh around 3 3:30 there will be

realize that it's the enemy trying to create a distraction whether in our home that's that that is the thing sometimes that is difficult for us sometimes we realize sometimes sometimes the Holy Ghost is going to just whisper in our ears and say watch up now the devil trying to create a distraction but we we we turn to hold to our ground there you know I'm not foolish you can't talk to me like this and uh uh and sometimes we even create that behavior in the house of God to realize that it's it's it's just the enemy and uh Jesus said blessed is he that is not offended in me we can't take offense in the word and and I mean even if the preacher call your name or he speaks about your situation or I will say Lord just help me give me [Music] Grace we know there is no there is one righteous man
