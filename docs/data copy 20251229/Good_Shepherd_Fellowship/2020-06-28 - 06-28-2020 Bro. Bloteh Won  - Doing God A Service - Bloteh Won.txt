but we thought that it would be good for us to meet at a church site and in that way you can we all can be able to have you know a walk through you can be able to see firsthand how it looks ABS their nails on the floor you still see ladders up then I will tell you how far the church age you will know what to expect for Sunday morning praise the Lord amen I might just be preaching on Jacob's Ladder praise the Lord there's a place for that in the scripture - so praise the Lord so Saturday we will all meet at a church I mean just like we said bring something to share it will be a time of fellowship and so if the Lord grant us the privilege to meet on Sunday this is one thing that we would like to remind ourselves and let each and every one of us know we will be seated by the Deacons the Deacons will will give us our place to sit and those that will come early we also have a temperature testing that we would like to try to do so those that would come early now remember that the church doors will be open at 10 o clock there will never be children on the school for that Sunday on next week we will still have the other Sunday school going there will be a tape to play now this is all if if we have things ready to go for Sunday so if you come in things I mean a little bit different don't run I mean because I myself I will be frowning and I won't be funny now anybody I'd be running at the devil so don't find that mean so but we will be seated by the Deacons and [Music] if the Lord grant us their time now with this with the seeding that we were put in place we're trying to keep the gala end of the state so we we got another place for our overflow we will be putting a tent at the back of of the church right in the fence there will be a tent there and there will also be sitting there we hope we can be able to get everything going true that what we can have a monitor there to be able to follow the service just like you would do in the foyer also now this will be to those that will be coming late one and also to to the description of individual if you feel more comfortable sitting behind it in the tent you know what I mean you come in just just ask the Deacons or you know how to get back to the back of the building you just go right in there I mean we try to get it in a way that there will not be destruction if you come Saturday you will see what we the provision that we have made in in saying that that means the week will be pretty busy for for as many there will be willing to help it is net you know one man responsibility is every one of us

those traveling down but Wesley and his wife oh my goodness good enough I just thought about the ad but Wesley and his wife are celebrating the 51st wedding anniversary and we want to say congratulations Ray's Lord you have broken the sound barrier after 40 years you've gone over a generation so god bless you and you can soul into the heaven something internally amen praise Lauren and

had a wonderful time and got to see them on Thursday brother Wesley came down with his wife and he brought his scaffolding to help us put some of the wires and speakers up in order there and I mean he was ready to work it just that we didn't have work for him to do so we appreciate out of there praise the Lord mean amen amen I'm just I'm just kind of struggling in my mind here to make sure that is there is not something I'm leaving out but if there is anything that is left out we will let you know by the way of text so praise the Lord amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord I want to take us I want to take a subject I want to take a subject that brother Branham spoke on and I want to use that this morning to be able to to bring this his service that we are dedicating to ourself to you to brother Jordan and his wife and everyone that we are appreciating and we're burnin preached a message trying to do God at service we've already been the weight of God but this morning I want to speak on the message doing God a service not trying but doing God a service in ordering what it takes to do God a service you know brother Branham preached a lot of his messages you will see bourbon and would tell what led him to speak on a setting message sometimes at the beginning of the message you will lay the background what drove him to that subject and sometimes you will not let a background but as you go along and you follow his taught you can be able to see what led him to title his message the way he did and that is the same with every preacher there is a burden there was something that is only a heart there they want to bring to the people and that message trying to do God a service but brandman actually preached a message where the burden on his heart seeing what he was seeing around the businessman the Full Gospel businessman and seeing what he was seeing around the Pentecostal churches and even he brought it home in in his in his tabernacle and the way he brought it home was he said around 5:00 a.m. the Lord kind of a spoke to him in the woods about brother neva because he the Lord told him that Brittany view was being over pressure by the people because everybody he brought neva had a gift of prophecy you know he had a gift of prophecy which is the gift of interpretation of tongues the gift of interpretation of tongues is the gift of prophecy so and and you know and brother Branham says the Lord told him you know you know go tell but neither I mean he's been over pressured by the people because everybody wonderful burden either to to to to give them a prophecy you know and to prophesy over them or say something to them from the Lord and and most of the time that is that is the way it is so that's what brother Branham was was was was dealing with under the Holy Ghost to bring us the subject of trying to do God a service he said I've seen that around the the the Pentecostal people you know I don't I don't have that in my notes but let me just let me just read something to you here so we can be able to start off and that will help you to see where where we will be going with this table this morning praise the Lord so I'm speaking on doing God a service because I believe that the bride you know the bride she she's in the place and if she recognized her message of the day the message of the hour and she have rightly submitted herself to to the Prophet messenger of her age she must not be trying to do God a service she must be doing God a service you know she must be doing God a service I guess you can look at the thought of trying to do God a service as if you know like Jesus said after we have done everything that we know how to do we come back to him and say we are unprofitable 7 so in their way you can look at it in that direction that we are trying to do God a service but as the bride of Jesus Christ as the son and daughter of God it must be our pleasure to do the King a service and so we want to speak on doing God a service brother branham in the message trying to do God a service he taught us the five months you know and knowing those five months that he had that he taught us in the message trying to do God a service it put us to the place where we will now be trying if we line up with the five months and we do some of the things that he taught us to do we will not be trying you know we only try when you don't know you know you don't have the the right equipment you don't have the right tools you know you try if you have the right tools then get down and do the job right leg Amen praise the Lord all you are not called to do it just leave it then you know so it is in their sense that we want to we want to talk about doing service this morning so I just I just pray that the Lord will be able to to to bless this start I just pray that the law will be able to bless this start and as we as we fellowship together let's just read the word let's read the word of the Lord and then we can get into what we want to talk about I want to talk about you just just bear with me now I'm I'm about like like a scatter totes this morning or scatter notes or just bear with me praise the Lord that would be second Samir let's read from the book of 2nd Samuel second samuel again david verse one gather together all the chosen men of israel 30,000 and david arose and when waive all the people that second samuel chapter six and david arose and when with all the people that were with him from bill of judah on to bring up from hence the act of god whose whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the chairman's and they said the ark of god upon a new card and brought it out of the house of a Boneta that was in Gibeah and use here in ah who the sons of ebony that drove the new car and they brought it out of the house of Ebenezer which was at give ear accompanied in the Ark of God and I who went before the ark and David in all the house of Israel played before the law on all manners of instrument may by fair rules even on Hopsin on the past race in the chambers and all the koenings and the cymbals and when they came when they came to now who trash hole you see a port for his hands to the act of God and took hold of it for the oxen shook it and the anger of the Lord was candid against his ear and God smote him there for his error and there he died by the Ark of God and David was displeased because the Lord has made a bridge hornier and he called the name of the place father used him to this day and David was afraid of the law that he that day and said how shall the Ark of the Lord come to me so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord onto him into the City of David but David carry it aside into the house of overridden the gate Heights and Ike of the law continuing in the house of OB Aidan the gate I three months and the Lord bless obey Edom and all his household let's pray to get him Heavenly Father we just ask the blessing of your word and we pray father God that you come and take a context this morning precious Lord out of the pages of your words something that would capture our hearts and mind this morning father Lord as we place our self before you we love you we appreciate you father and we just commit ourselves in your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you can have your seat if I'm right if I'm right you can correct me I think of this have been three months since the Ark of the Lord has come to our homes everyone had the opportunity to have the Ark of God in their homes this have been three months so if you treated the act like Oh be Edom date surely you and your household will be blessed Amy praise the Lord so I want to talk about from the house off I've been at that to the house of OB Edom that's what I want to talk about that's where my inspiration is and dealing with doing God a service it's from one house to another house and let's let's see if the law will be able to shower his blessings upon the touch that we we have in and and we know our our God he's he's he's a faithful God his ways past finding out any man so well there is there is one thing there brother branham brought out in this message also I was looking for this and I was I was just hoping there we can get back to church in and I was hoping that I will be able to use this and so we can talk together talk about it a little bit now there was a situation of a little boy at that time in Branum tabernacle one of the brothers son and he got electrocuted and brother branham was not home at a time and he was helping a man to wire his trailer and Boyd got shocked with with with the current and and I mean he he pass out and you know like Burt Brennan says he's I read a little they reversed something somehow Iran's the current into the water where the ball was he sees the little boy just a little lad and it it killed a little boy his stomachs were we know electrical shock you know when they die that's what happened his little i said his teats were to get him now so brother branham addressing this situation he talks about he was not home so immediately the father of the boy I think it happens to be there he was just a new believer he believed the Lord and believed the message what he did was theater he got a hold of he got a hold of brother Richard Brown Richard blind one of the brothers there in in the church so he called the brother and and says my son just God you know just got killed he got shocked and amber Branham says you know the the brothers went down there you know and you know the the the pray for the boy and the young boy came back to life now so brother Branham dealing with that you know I'm trying to get to a place where I will not take much of the time you know on talking about this but he said I can listen to this she said you see what that does what a pays off for a man's life to believe save his little boy because the father was a believer and the father did the right thing to call the brothers and God hi his lawyer seventh brother blaring and them to pray for the little boy when he was in that condition yes when anything happened this is where I wanted to get him when anything happened remember you are children of the Living God where Branham says when anything happened remember you are children of the Living God wherever two or three I gather in my name there I am again it is written he's a very present help in times of trouble and if this ever was a trouble was that little ball lying there dead on the ground from the shock of electricity that went through him so we are thankful God we are we are thanking God this morning with all of our heart for this for these things that he has done now so just thinking about that and as I've always thought about it too as a church that is the reason why we've been kind of a dwelling on a book of arts because that was the attitude from the believers in the book of Acts you know they have just witnessed the resurrection and the Ascension of Jesus Christ and that's what the Holy Ghost would do to you it would it would make you to witness the resurrection of Jesus Christ in your heart we that were once dead in sin and trespass have he quickened that's you know that word quicken it's an earnest of a resurrection you know so Christ has been raising in our heart that's what we are witnessing by the Holy Ghost it's no longer either liveth but he that liveth in me he delivered in you so you see they just witnessed the resurrection and the Ascension of Jesus Christ and and and and he already promised him that he would be with them he would never leave them never forsake them so when the Holy Ghost came they got that assurance that he was in DMS so whenever there was a situation they call on the name of the law I believe they were not despising their medical system in that day they were not despising doctors they were not despised in operation Rome they were not despising you know taking medication at home but just to have the consciousness that the first one that we can turn to in case of anything are we together where Burnham says God bless these faithful men too in the time of emergency that's the time to look to God and look to him and be beyond friendship with him before the emergency arrive we know this if we have favor with God we can ask him anything like you do any of your friends and he is a very present help in time of trouble and all we are living in difficult times I mean it will be very you know disappointing to to me or to any of us to know that a brother is sick or the sisters sake you know when and and when people get these things in your mind that if you are sick it means that you don't have faith or if you are sick it means that it's a sign of sin in your life I mean that's just a poor understanding of of the gospel they are support understanding now we were praying for the sister year that came down with the culvert and and one of the relative was telling me well that you know what didn't want to no people to know that's why we didn't tell you and all of that so I said what am I going to do if you tell me oh I know how to do is to pray you know oh I know how to do is to pray you know and those are the things that we enjoy so like brother Branham says if anything happened water in your home or I mean when you I alone I mean get get someone on the phone cause if you can't get ahold of us like like these brothers brother branham go ahead he testified they were trying to get ahold of him they couldn't get ahold of him but because they have been taught right they knew what to do they have seen God moving in the immensity of saying God you know so the God write down that you know but Richard and the other brothers they just drove over there right there that little ball lying on the ground his eyes are popping out and stomach getting swelled up they just called life back into his body and I believe we stayed seven that seemed gone amen I believe we are stay serving that same Living God so if anything happen if you do remember let's go to the Lord in pray and he men they just call upon the name of the Lord he is a present help in time of trouble you know when we committed to him then we can be able to you know advise ourself what next to do so we just want to encourage you there way as we get into continuing our book of art series we will talk more about there praise the Lord so we want to talk about this morning [Music] doing a service doing God a service you know doing God a service that's that's why we want to we want to speak on this morning doing God a service praise the Lord now so just like just like I said we go we are going back to the taught of [Music] press lol I'm trying to to get myself together yet a little bit forgive me I'm everywhere sure that I'm that I'm not exhausted man seventy times seven year because I keep asking you to forgive me praise the Lord Amen [Music] if you gotta count just let me know how far I've got so I know how much as they have in store [Laughter] praise the Lord oh yeah we love the Lord and I went I went down there for that funeral but see I didn't have no idea and I was on the wait in the common all your doing the way you preach in the wake tonight and see they're you know trying to get there for the waking and and we just I mean we just we got right there on time and I mean I just try to run and get myself ready but then there was there was kind of a miscommunication because the the funeral home was not going to hire the people at a setting you know above a set in ours so we kind of cancer there and then the next morning and I mean how all of these things planning a funeral I didn't know about it never if you read the program got there to the church they said well I mean you are the moderator of the Finneran so I had to be leading songs I have to be singing special I have to praise the Lord that [Music] we won't thank the Lord for the end I was glad to be getting into and to be able to help and to be able to help sometimes you do those things and you don't realize how many people sit back and it just they just was there for you do and then after after the meeting that comes to you and appreciate you know because it wouldn't have it would have been something different if you I mean if the grace of God didn't help you to bring something special to to the service so they all appreciated in and we were grateful for the end praise the Lord so as we look into the service like I said I want to talk about from the house of Albany there to the house of Edom now as we look at this we'll be dwelling on history of the Ark of the Covenant as we go into a little bit we will realize there the whole story stats from First Samuel chapter 4 that was when Israel lost the Ark of the Covenant in the battle where the glory of God left Israel and Eli's sons died in that battle and the scripture led us to know they're the the Philistines capture the Ark of the Covenant and I believe over a period of time these people realize there was something you know about this Ark of the Covenant you have to know yet they're Israel a lot of strangers in their gates you know and he talked about the atop anak who worship they talked about what is in the Ark of the I mean in the tabernacle the Ark of the Covenant what it means to them so these Philistines now you can you should remember when they were going to war Israel stream out and the Philistines acts what is that noise about and somebody says is because of the act of the Covenant because God was di cam that was what them they made a noise but in that battle Israel lost the Ark of the Covenant he went in the hands of the Philistines and they didn't know what to do with it you know they didn't know what to do with it they try all the oratio they tried to appease the eye we learned from the scripture there in in 1st Samuel Chapter five huh I mean was just breaking their homes down and beating them and so they said well we don't know how to deal with this thing let's build a calf praise the Lord now you see these people didn't have no idea they don't know how to handle this thing so they build a cart they said they act on it they just put the cat face into Israel and you know the car took the Ark of the Covenant right into the cam of Israel now they did not know there when I honor the instruction of Moses how to deal with the act so what happened is there the provision the main God blessing or God blessing for the act to be able to come back to Israel they came back to the gates of the children of Israel and that was how the took the ark and the place it in the home of what is his name now I've another that's word replace it in his home and I was looking at I was looking at his name you know looking at the two names of those gentlemen that's the reason why I choose to speak on this his name means willingness he means means willingness praise the Lord and let me just look at my notes here a little bit it means a father's vow a father's vow which mean his dad made a vow but the base of the valve was willingness so that's the meaning of his name so they took the act over to his place and the Ark of the Covenant was there you know when all during the time we saw was leading Israel as as you know as as the captain of Israel as a king and then when David came you know to to office he now wanted for the act of the Covenant to come to the City of David and one of the reason also because it was not only the house of everything that the Lord bless the Lord also bless the house of Habanera here his two sons were were also in one sense he's from the family of Eliezer so they that's a priesthood family you know that's a prison that was the reason why they kept the egg in his house because he was part of the priesthood now so we see here that David Nail has become King and he had the city of Zion and now he won the Ark of the Covenant to come into his city it's not going back to shallow it's not going back to the tabernacle of Moses now is going to be in the tabernacle of David now so that's what he was planning to do praise the Lord and brother branham you know when over there in and you know says it was it was a good intention you know but God on you know I bless us for good intention it has to be according to the word of the Lord they are so and we know all of the Aten and you know easier put his hands trying to stop the ad from falling and he's putting him I always used to think in my mind why they choose to use a car it was hit the way they're taking the example from what they saw the Philistines did because the Philistines build a card and send it back to them was that the only example that it took because Israel has already been instructed by the prophet Moses how to transport the ark the act was transported by special men you know it was the priests and they had to carry the Ark on their shoulder above the heart because that's where the Word of God supposed to be carried above our hands amen so Moses instructed them their way then I'm thinking in my mind is he because the Philistine pulled the ark on a cart and it came it came right to the gate of Israel safe and never fell down was that there was that what give them dead I don't know but the shoe have known better amen praise the Lord and God will not allow them to go and end anywhere father because that was not his privado way it was not the way that he provided for the Ark of the Covenant to be transported so we see here you know were and and brother branham go let me read some of these things that I said I wanted to share with you sorry sister Fei they will not be part of my notes but we would get we would get to we would get to we get to death oh praise the Lord never been here you he said I realize I'm talking to 99% of penny Custer's but many many times a man girl can deal with them give them a gift and the people will squeeze in on those people if they are net perfectly called or sent from God he will cause the man or the woman to see something that is in his will because the people constrained him now take that in context now of what is happening here okay because brother Branham before he said this he took the storage off of a hub when Ahab went and called Joe Scheffer for them to go and take the land of remedy that that was part of one of those land that Joshua gave it was supposed to be a City of Refuge the island was supposed to be a city of refuge and and and when brother Branham deal with that year what he said is that he said you know the people put pressure on air now you also have to realize that a hub wanted to gain the favor of the people he wanted to gain the favor of the people because Elijah have just spoken Elisha has just brought his word that will not be rain or Dew you until I cover it the people knew there was a prophet in the land and Elisha was standing against all the influence of Jezebel so a xavier realizing that he's losing his ground he had to also dance to the music of the people to be able to win their favor and in winning their favor he's also putting pressure on Joe Scheffer for them to go and get the lane now so brother branham is letting us know yeah he says that is the way it's a happen he says and he says he says he cooked this and says so he said they said here our children needs bread and we have got enough land to raise bread and our enemies the Philistines they feed her children the Hayden's off of the very ground that Jehovah give us death that's very strict we the people of God we sit here with our children needing and our enemy feel their children on the ground that God called us out of Egypt and give it to us you know so all of those things that's what they were seeing now you have to realize brother Branham said the land was for Israel right God give it to them amen but Ahab was not the right man to be able to redeem the lands back because he's already standing wrong on the principle of God's Word he has gone out em and married a woman that has brought him bow worship into Israel and I mean he's not standing right with God for the fact that his heart is not right with God he's not a man to be doing the lost work no matter what right we have to do that no matter is the promise that is given to us the thing that attract God on the scene is when a man heart is right with God we can have good intentions and but when I when our hearts are not right with God because God works with the heart he deals with the heart is the heart that he burdens is the heart that he is he instruct even when a man is instructed by God go with will things around his heart to give him patience to wait on the law to give him tempering God will deal with his heart for him to be the right channel to do that work the land were for Israel but the man there was king in Israel his heart was not right with God but he wanted to gain favor of the people that's politics and politics does not work in the house of God it does not work in God's program because politics is of the devil he knew that his son is not right if you if you have a had to go and redeem a land that is taken by the Philistine you have just killed never for his father's Lane here is a here is a true Israelite I was guarding the inheritance of his father and in him kill him for the lane and now to win the favor of the people he says all we it belongs to us we trying to redeem the lane if that does not sound like politician what about him says he says that stumble me he says he says there was one time in Jeremiah who said they will they will they want to be down there for two years land he was talking about another prophet that prophesied a challenge Jeremiah and since I mean it's only two years if even we're going to go into as I would be two years Jeremiah's is 70 years the poor look around his neck and all of their so he's bringing us to this place you know to be able to realize what create the room for people to try to do God a service when we are taught right we must not be trying we must be doing what we are taught to do when a person is not so sure it's when they try when a man is short in his setting he don't try he goes in the name of the Lord David was not saying I'm I would try to kill normal no he says and an on second style Philistine against the army of the Living God he says I'm going against him because he knew he was trained by God for the work praise the Lord and I believe I believe as the bride of Jesus Christ I believe as a people that is preparing for the rapture we have been taught and we must know how to do a service for our king praise the Lord and let me give you one secret get yourself out of the way you should begin with that get yourself out of the way because God will not share his glory with no man amen and he can never move if you are standing in a way it's just one thing you can't stop him it does not mean that you have a strength to stop him he just don't want to crush you he's a loving father you don't want to crush you so just step out of the way amen where Baron said this I read this to you he sees 99% of the Pentecostal people he says that just they just squeeze on the people a big if if they're not a fella called and sent by God he would cause the man or the woman to see something that isn't you know it's in his will you know because the people constrained him to do it he says how how I had to catch our own pastor year out here in the world one morning about 3 o clock in the morning go to her brother neva and I come I did but nivea everybody Bernie the prophesy over me tell me this dad you know in order he says you have you have him saying things that wouldn't come to pass you know so they heartburn evac'ing things because the people put in pressure and we're Burnham says I could even see the strain on him because here is IRISA here is a major profit ministry and the people are seeing all the the discernment they are seeing you know what I mean majority was now after the message it was just they were just benefiting from the gift and and and and out of that and when brother Branham leave here is Brittany via yet that has to stay with the church he has to stay with the church and in in the situation here the people now are having I mean they are having great expectation for Brittany via they are asking him you know and and just like every word some people will not even show up to church when Burt Brennan was not there when brother brother comes then the whole tabernacle is fall then how do you think Bernie vo the man I was staying there with the tower that were there something how do you think he feels when he see those people coming in and going out and and and all of that so all of that put a lot of pressure on him praise the Lord now so while we want to get into we want to get into our subject I don't I'm I'm just trying to to kind of lay a foundation so we can get an idea you know why a man can try to do God a service praise the Lord what a wonderful King we self blessed be the name of the Lord now so as we look at the name of these two gentlemen I mean either and obey Edom a banana is willingness overridden the seven who honor God in the right way that's the meaning of his name he names means seven of edom but it means the seven who honor God in the right wing now so they I came from the house of willingness and it came to the house of a man who honor God the right way so the right way to honor God you have to be willing you have to have a willing heart Moses said there in building the tabernacle he says let the people bring they are offering with willingness of her thus that was worth the whole concept of offering came from he says God was looking for women that had you're a willing heart and they were also skilful with their hands so in a way to do a service for the Lord we have to be willing and and that willingness will make us to do an honorable service for God in the right way so we are living the house of willingness to the seven that honor God in the right way that's our inspiration this morning talking about doing God a service but Branham said this but Johnny I think this one should be in mind not there the healing line he talks about this he says he says in Christian friends as sincere as I know how to how to be before him before God because some of these people it's somebody's mother talking about the people coming in the prayer line year perhaps and someone's mother now what if that was my mother or some man was praying for my mother and they sure want him to be sincere praise the Lord and I sure want him to do he says and as and as I do to God's people I am seven God he says so much as you who have done it on to the least of these little ones you have done it unto me this is that right now so we realize here brother branham showing us right there in the prayer line he says why he had to be sincere you know it is putting yourself in someone else's shoes why if you are the person there you know what will you do either said and done we ever said he's putting himself in he says just like if it was my mother being pray for I would want the preacher to be sincere he says I come out with a sincere heart because I realize that as I do to God's people I'm saving gone listening here's a lovely thing as you save one another you are saving God see the love of God is in every Christian hat and be kind one to another forgive one another if you don't see the strip if if if you don't see the scripture just little well you believe anything and pray for the other person and just love one another you will find there's no greater evidence of a Christian in the word then to love now I better Branham showing us he had a lovely thing he says as you serve one another you said God you know there's a place where brother Branham talks about you know as a woman serve her husband she's seven God and I mean some brothers have written that thing on on the on the refrigerator you know they have they have put it in bold letters in the living room because they want their wives toe-to-toe to be enslaved unto them but you have to realize here you know in the context that brother Branham said that it's not only the two of the wife you know if she's saving you and she's saving God then who are you saving who are you saving if you are saving garden you have to find somebody to save that is that is the secret of the Covenant of Christianity Almighty God came down to earth to save a brother branham said he became a foot wash flunky he took the least job just to let us to know that all of this covenant that we Accord the joy of this covenant is to be a seven it's not to sit back and relax and be self if you were enjoying Christian life and that's what the Holy Ghost is given because the Holy Ghost bring all of those vets you patient love and all of those things to make us a better sevens because we don't choose the people we serve oh man if it was for me to choose the people I said I just look for order you know there are the cool guys the one that does not give trouble but we don't choose the people we serve but yet God equipped us he gave us his spirit for us to be able to serve his people praise the Lord the AK wouldn't have come to the house of a banana if he did not hire a willing heart to be a service to the people praise the Lord he was a man of willingness ready to self and as you serve the people you are serving God you will never enjoy your Christian experience if you don't have a seven hat praise the Lord if you have a bossy spirit I mean you need a new birth not just the prescription I can give you this morning you need the new birth you need to be born again and come let's rebuffed I see you praise the Lord amen ask yourself one another where Branham says I have to be sincere because as I said God's people I'm seven God and here's a lovely thing as you serve one another you are serving God praise the Lord doing God a service how can we do God a service so how can we do God accept one another from what our hearts make our hearts uh willing ha to be able to serve one another I mean that there should be nothing that is so big so small that we can do either big or small whichever one praise the Lord but you see that's that's where it is he says that is the greatest evidence of Christian in the world is to love and have a seven hat praise the Lord the message the image image of Christ he said and so is the new birth it's a mess the new birth is a mess anyway you take it but a produce life amen a produce life what kind of a life as seven life the new verb will produce a seven life not an I pleases life not a math sevens life but I mean a seven-letter pressing the happy heart to serve God he says to humble yourself to deny yourself that's the kind of life all they said but I have seen them cried and bought around the altar and carry on show they they are being born it's a mess I don't care where you go you might get up you know your face I'm full of tears and eyes red and your hands rolling from from beating the the altar but it's a birth it does something to you it makes you a seven it takes the starch out of you and and and makes an image more than new life new creation you maybe or mess up when you get up but you are born again no matter where you are I mean its net its net to create a scene for people to look at you know I mean you are just laying your heart there because you want a change of life you want a heart to be able to save people praise the Lord doing God a service it's having a heart to be able to serve God's creation to serve God's people having a seven hat praise the Lord the Bible talks about Niemeyer's he was opened in Ayrshire and the Bible's talk about how I mean he was so diligent in his work before the king but this man hearing about what was happening in Jerusalem that you know the temple the walls being broken in all of that his heart was so burning and I was thinking about all of those things having a seven heart and because he was a good servant to the king you know God when I found a man I was a cup bearer he was not even a preacher he never had no ministry praise the Lord because sometimes people think that the ministry is you know it's it's it's a high calling and then when now the man is a minister you know he's walking on ice and he must be told by the people you know the people should carry him the people should I know I work for him and or that know when you are called to the ministry you are caught itself and if you don't enjoy serving you can never make a good ministry or good minister to the people if you have a sevens heart and you must enjoy it too because he can get messy praise the Lord he says a brains new image life it makes seven out of you that's what a new birth is it gives you a seven life to humble yourself and deny yourself praise the Lord doing God a service and we do God a service when we serve one another amen when we serve one another you think about the shimmy night woman her desire was net what I've heard about Elijah or Elijah let me bring him over to the house and maybe he would pray for us you know she just wanted to do a service she saw this man and she knew that this this is this is a man of God praise the Lord she just wanted to be a service she went over and talked it over with her husband you know and then they sat down and she said I mean I I see this man passing in the middle of the day the Sun is so hot he's sweating you know I can just see you know he was bored so I mean just like he poured water on his head you know what and let's just make a place for him he never even had no idea about it when I open their home to the Prophet they were opening their home to the Word of God they were opening their home to the Word of Life [Music] you know and and and that was one of the things when you read the scripture you find out that was one of the things that kind of intrigued the heart of David because he heard the house of obed-edom was blessed God is blessing his heart and David you know not really out of selfishness but he wanted that blessing also you know he wanted that blessing also in his place in the City of David so he wanted to do everything together cut the ark over but he went about it the wrong way he got the wrong people in the job he should have consulted the Prophet that's what the Prophet taught us and that's that's the way the Word of God says and we have the Prophet message you know we have the Word of God we have the Word of God I mean if I mean if it is something that you have to brainstorm over I mean just just prayed about it read the Word of God find a time fine you know something in the world that we encourage you to do there but you see many times the people that have the true burden has no time to go and look for the Bible verse and stick it on the a dome to remind me I have to do this so I can be blessed you know Jesus said like Burt Brennan said year he says as you have done to the least of my little ones and in the church age book brother branham said that these people that were doing it there were I mean they were they were not doing it consciously they had no idea because the scripture brought it out clearly when Jesus acts and says you know where banner says they were asked Jesus when were you sick and we visited you when were you hungry and we fed you he says they were asking those questions because they were not even conscious of the fact that were ministering to Jesus doing those things and he said something like that also hearing a message perseverance he says if I don't love you then I don't love God and the only way I can serve God it's 7 he'll save one another in so much as you have done to the least of this little one you have done it unto me having the heart to do God a service I think we will see that in the nest courtier he make reference to that I mean the God that we can see you know and he's the one that we are serving but we have to realize God is in his people it has to come from a willing heart to be able to bring a right service to the Lord those were the two houses that I Act went to from one to the other it has to come from a willing heart to bring the right service to God if the heart is now willing if they had is selfish there is no way we can bring a right service to God sometimes we just we get we get caught up in our seven we we become so concerned about ourselves and then you know and I mean we should be the one serving out there we should be the one doing the best to be able to encourage one another I mean Jesus said no greater love them for the man to lay down his life and I believe when we get in prayer for one another we are laying before God amen and as a church that's the only way we can be able to bring service to the people that God has given to us realizing is God that we are serving he also said this in the message just go ever change his mind about this word listen love one another for you can now dislike your brother who you see and say you love God who you haven't seen now I say this awesome as as we as we trust in the law to come back together as as a body I mean if a person even on on Saturday you know let's come back keeping you know the state measure because we know we will be out there we will be in the area I mean around the church it will be a little bit crowded so I mean come with your Max and and you know and out of there but I mean we should be able to treat one another you know us as brothers and sisters if you have a problem you know if you don't want to shake my hand I'm not going to be offended with that praise the Lord just just let me know you know and I'm gonna respect that as well but you see we want to we want to love one another and we want to treat one another with respect you know I'm hope they're I'm hoping that we can come back together you know in the service of the Lord and I mean we can be able to have a positive mind of one another you know even all of those ones that I mean that was sick in our Mason even if they come back to church we have to believe that God has healed them and and and also as we were advised when a person is sick stay home you know it does not show that you don't have faith in God especially in such an hour that we are living you just love one another then you serve one another you said God isn't that right as you do on to the least of these that God the quickening power in them you have done unto me when did we see you in need when did we visit you in the praising when did we do these things what you have done to them you have done unto me now so you see just honor this thought I mean with with with everything these three months you know being away everyone in their home you know and just having service in your home you know it's not only to the fact that we are preaching from birth Jordans house but even receiving the word in your home you know having a respect for the word in your home that was the Ark of the Covenant I mean you had a willing heart to be able to wake up on time to be able to prepare your home to be able to observe church order in your home if you did not had I mean I mean if you just think there were nobody to seeing you and I mean you get your coffee pot going you get I mean whatever you were doing in your home that is before you and God you know but the word there was the importance of the Ark of the Covenant to the children of Israel because it was right in their delayed delayed that the ten commandments that they delayed the tablets the Torah was lay right in the ark so that that was the important it was not just to have a monument in the home but they wanted to have the word and and the home that respects the word and honor the word is the home that gods bless and that's what David wanted the Ark of the Covenant back to his place so you think about it now just like I said I just trying to bring this thought as a Thanksgiving to each and every one of us most especially to Perth Jordan and his wife but thinking about it this morning you know doing God a service the Ark of the Covenant came down from the Philistines and this man there were many other priests he was Ned the only priests he was not the only or the high priests there were many other men there but yet he opened his home you just think about it they are called the Covenant had destroyed lives in the Philistines and Israel know you know how how delicate this Eyck of the Covenant was it was not something to play around and fooled around you know and had the children to jump up opening you know for their toys in and out of the end so just breaking the eye into his home you think about it those were one of his boys that were killed even at a time the ark was leaving his home but for all this why he had the Ark of the Lord in his home he kept it in a delicate way he taught his children to respect the I David wrong decision of using a cart cause the life of his son but all this water that I stairs in his home because he was a father with a willing heart to bring the act in his home and give the eye a place to be god bless his home albeit on the same year is the AG has just caused the life of use here and everybody is pulling away the realize now a man has died because I mean he has tossed the Ark of the Covenant it's a scary thing it's a scary thing everybody would like us to have service in church at least we can get away from the home because just having the thought of creating their atmosphere and setting our home in other I mean if you don't treat the the services in your home as you are in the house of God it's just good as you just watching something on YouTube just like you want your movie on YouTube this is not a movie you are watching this is the service of the Lord and your attitude at home shows your service to God not to me I don't see you what you're doing at your home I don't see how you treat the service at home God giving us the same opportunity that he gave this man for the word of the law to come and meet us in our home know how we will how we would get back to church on time you know if we if you've been having service in your home and I mean you just you just came tuned into the service right you know you didn't have no time of meditation you just yeah I mean turn your monitor on what are you using your phone or are you using a string whatever you are using you just turn it on there's no way you come back to I mean just to the building and trying to come if you if you never had that consciousness of meditation and praying I mean you just come in with with an hour display if you could not do it in your home with sincerity when nobody is looking at you you just come in with an hour display I would think that we need a birth in their area because we have the opportunity for the world to come and meet us home just like this man had the opportunity God wanted you to serve Him from your home for you to be able to receive the word from your home of willingness to a seven who honor God the right way there's for the two homes that I had to travel through before it went over to Zion praise the Lord and that's what God required for a service to him there were many men right there after you see her fall to the ground I mean they didn't now force this man he could have also choose and say no I don't want my children to be killed you know I want my private time with my family I don't want you know I don't want you know this service thing I don't want to eat my house I mean I'm having my family time and having having scheduled I get my work to do I get all of this he could have taught about all of that you think about it I mean it's so easy for us to complain and it's so easy for us to criticize it's not when I mean we are singing in in and in our best role in all of that and we come to the house of the Lord and you know singing all of those songs and dancing to the music it's just all part of it and I just believe those are just the the preparation that we make to serve God that just put us in the atmosphere create an atmosphere the worship the preaching of the word just create an atmosphere they gave you a watching the right map for you to go out and save God after you have received the word what you do with the word is the service to God it's not in a service when you live on your hand and say hallelujah praise God you are just preparing yourself you are in an atmosphere of preparation after you leave the service putting the word in action that's the service to God putting the word in action I want to say this morning this is what we are caught Oh or this afternoon as the bride of Jesus Christ you know I mean if if if if a wife stayed learning or staying struggling you know trying to serve her husband then I mean she's not being paying attention that's what I was saying I mean she's supposed to be at a place now worth she said in her house much she's not trying she's not guessing you know and I believe that's what our bridegroom expect from us for us to bring a service to him we are not guessing we know what he wants we have we had an Eliezer that gave us a five months it must be the right person it must be true the Prophet must come by the Word of God he gave us all of these mass because he didn't want the bride to be trying the bride's supposed to be bringing service Esther said if I die let me die well let me go and try and see whether I mean the king would bring me in or net no she did the right thing she prepared herself she was in the atmosphere and she just and I came stretch for his hands and say come my love as we come back to the church realize that I mean we're not coming to self anybody we're coming to self the king and a way to sell him is the service that we would give to one another the way we will respect Kings that would be done and when the Deacons tell us to do things and and you know I mean with all the city in order and everything that we would try to practice I mean people are so quick to run judgment and pretty soon they will just think that setting people are preferred over the other people it well if you don't come to service on time and then you want to come just when the preacher is about to close his salmon and you want to have the first seed you want to have the more preferred seed I mean where does that happen we don't want to respect the things of God I mean if you if order this time you have not got that preparation in you you will just be running to have the first seed because you want to be in church and you can still be in that building and not be there and not be bringing service to the King because you just want to be there as we serve one another as we serve our husband self our wives self our children said the brothers serve the sisters we are doing the same unto the Lord Peter they're fishing all night he couldn't you never caught anything with all his skill he tried Jesus came and just asked him to use his boat he turned the boat over the boat that was meant for fishing he turned it over for a church so Jesus can have a pulpit to stand on and preach a little bit because he gave his boat to be used for the service of the Lord you saw that you know the scripture you know the the the cash that he got they almost broke the net because he gave his boat to be used we have to realize that you can all give God we can never give God for my loaf at everything we gave to him is what he has given to us it's what he has given to us so in this life I just wanted to bring this talk to you and once again to tell each and every one of you thank you for all our service to the Lord where we were able to manage this time being away from from the building and I mean we we trust the Lord as we go back there are many many churches that have went back to their building and yet they had to go back home you know but I mean this time if we go back if for any reason we have to have everybody home we will still be broadcasting the service from church so we want to thank you and once again brother Jordan sister faith god bless you richly and we let's bow our heads together I've seen many places work I mean people just put the title of I'm a minister so that thing is just in their head they can even pick up a broom they can't even find something to do because they just put that in their head I'm a I'm a minister so the thing that this you have the the hide you know the first place and people should open the door for them to enter the church and I mean in order that if you really know what a ministry is it's a service you are called to serve you are called to self and you are not a minister until you start serving the people heavenly father law finding a way to be able to appreciate the brothers and sisters and and everyone has been chipping in one way or the other even those brothers have been going to clean the church here cut the grass and the different things they've been doing father even the sisters that was still home and think about the service and pray for one another not just being consumed about their own needs but being burden being burning on their hearts for their dear sisters and dear brothers and different family crying to God out of a sincere heart father we wouldn't have been successful Lord Jesus all through these three months Father bringing the word from this place Lord but we just want to thank you we want to thank you Lord you you wash over us Lord Father I believe no doubt Lord the neighbors around here got to know that every Wednesday and every Sunday there are more few cars that drive to this home and no doubt they are thinking in their mind maybe something is happening father but we hope that they are believing their Christians are gathering here father we hoped Lord Jesus we have been able to rightly represent you for them to know God we came to lift up your name father maybe not this time Lord for all God may you may you write it in your book of remembrance now some days law of father God when Lord Jesus they might think to talk about it it will realize father is because of you that our dear brother and sister give up their home I remember one day sitting out there in the vehicle and a young man ran by on his backing and and he said something and I thought about it and father you just you just directed my mind to the wording and I believe he was thinking why why this God is sitting in this car in this neighborhood what is he looking for and but father we just want to thank you we appreciate you we glorify your Holy Name thank you Lord Jesus for the man Lord God that even been working on the building father in which ever way when the internally will be able to tell I believe we answers to get back find a little girl but you also help us Lord realize in the budget that we have for the work you were able to provide a man that could do it in the framework of our budget out of there to play on the time in a delay but we thank you Father we appreciate you Lord you place it on our heart to be able to do it and for the rest of the time that we're going to stand stay in that building father we are just praying our heart desire that you would just bring us Oh father a refreshing Oh God like brother branham said the dynamics of this church a so God a refilling of the Holy Ghost father as we go back Lord we want to we want a book of our church law that people that is coming back with fervent prayers on their heart Lord I mean a ready mind to serve God we know that we get in that building father is to create an atmosphere for you to come in in our midst Lord Jesus it's not just so father dare to look at the walls or father or precious lord or to look at one another it's because of you it's because of your father we want more of you we want more of you we have some brothers they even use their vehicle to be able to pick up once they have a need to come to church father we know sometimes it's a struggle sometimes law people are not in the right mind to do those things we look at the cost of gas and different things Lord but father you have given your people a willing heart to be sevens that would bring honor to God in the right way that's what we're talking about this morning are willing hard to be a seven to bring honor to God the right way that's the two houses that is before us the Ark of the Covenant came from the house of a willingness to the house of a seven that brought honor in the right way and father that's the kind of a seven we want to be help us lord help us father sometimes who God am i cause us our resources sometimes father but Lord if you don't give us the willingness if you don't give us place the burden on our hearts sometimes all of these brothers that take care of the sound and then and and do the projector and all of that they don't have much to get from the service because they are trying to serve the people and yet people would sit in church and it would be unhappy because of the sound will be unhappy I don't know what they were doing back there they were not projecting the words and we would just have those kind of a negative attitude help us lord help us father if we just only make room to give mercy it would just only make room to say lord help my brother help my sister some people put pressure because they want a pastor to be to be firing all that I mean I he sees preaching psychology and and they just have their mind in a way that they think they want you to preach or what they want you to say and not even knowing some of the things that goes behind a service for the Lord give us a heart that is merciful give us a heart Lord that will have the first instance to say help my brother help my sister father we want to do service for you that's why you call us for to be your servants but we can only be successful if you give us a heart to be able to serve one another no no one no no one of their some I just want to be self father we know this all the proud spirit that comes with this stick in nature deliver us Lord we want to be your servants we want to be your servants we want to sell one another we want to sell our wives our sisters want to serve their husband we want to serve our children we want to serve the brothers and sisters Paul in that way taught us to prefer one another better than ourselves Peter in his episode said we must submit ourself one to another after he said wives submit yourself to your husband he said we must made ourselves one to another that is the way we can be seventh because that is the calling that we a quarter that's what Christianity is all about it's how much we can save dear Lord we put our heart before you deal with us O God once again we want to come from the house of willingness that's the way we can be a seven Oh honor God the right way and that was what every Eden was be with your children lower father those that will be making the time to to come in the evening to help at the church the few hours that we will be there beginning this evening we just asked our Father Lord you will be able to help each and every one of us know some have to work there are some that that have that having a heart Lord wanting to come but they have to work help them to father that they can be seventh in the places that you have them they can be seventh in the air capacity to their children to their home to their neighbors to their co-workers father no wonder your ministry your time here on earth was so memorial among the people when you start your ministry they say it's isn't there the Capitals son they saw you in a cabin to shop you face their cheers you repair their tables you helped him you saved him and when you even came to the ministry it was a conflict to the mind of the people because right from birth to the grave you were a seven help us Lord be with our hearts Lord in our mind we commit ourselves in your hands now Jesus father the meeting on Saturday we just want to pray you go before us Lord Jesus as we come together give us a good weather and give us a good time of fellowship we love you and we appreciate you now in Jesus name we pray amen Amy well the Lord bless you and for some and most of you I will see you on Saturday but
