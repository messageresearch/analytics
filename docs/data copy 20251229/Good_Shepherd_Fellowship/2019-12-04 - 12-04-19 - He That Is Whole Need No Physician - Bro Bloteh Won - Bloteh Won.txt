in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen praise the lord praise the lord guru be in the house of the law - night amen let's let's just take our Bibles and we can be able to go into the scripture tonight praise the Lord praise the Lord Sunday being the first Sunday normally we will have had communion in the evening but we cancel the service because of the weather and you know and it's good when you have people in church that are you know desiring to to just be part of all of those different ordinances amen and you know the people who will keep texting and keep asking you know different questions in one of you so I kept thinking about it realizing that we will always have this kind of rhythm sorry for keeping you standing let's read the scripture reading if I don't forget I will continue what I'm saying praise the Lord amen love the law tonight I assure you do Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6 praise the Lord it has a Matthew chapter 6 is Matthew chapter 9 sorry Matthew chapter 9 Marcin chapter now let's read together and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own country and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on the bed and Jesus seen the effect said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer that sin be forgiven thee and behold setting all the strife said within himself this man blaspheme and Jesus more in their thoughts said Wuerffel think ye evil in your heart praise the Lord my goodness you have to be careful when you around him he men he knows your thought my goodness praise the Lord Amen wherefore you thing evil in your in your heart for whether is easy to say that sin be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then said he told the sick of the palsy arise take up that bed and go on to the house and he arose and depart to his house and when the mortage you saw it the mother and glorified God which had given such power unto men praise the Lord realizing that is net unto Jesus alone this power is given unto us that we can experience in our myths and Jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receive of custom and he said unto Him follow me and he arose and follow him and it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him in his disciples and when the Pharisee saw it they said unto his disciple why eat at your masters with publicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what die minute what that meaneth we have mercy and not sacrifice for I am come to call I'm not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance amen let's pray together tonight Heavenly Father law we approach the service tonight Oh God with Thanksgiving in our hearts O Father Lord to know that you know our hearts tonight you know the thoughts of God upon our hearts Lord you know the desires so far the law that we bring into your house tonight you know the needs of God father you know the burden so Lord upon our hostel now you know our hearts you know how the blood flow so God all far the true our vain and how our heart pumps you know how fast a bit slow has slowed a bit so God you know our hearts tonight Almighty God Father precious Lord Jesus we pour our has before you or my regarding acts the Lord you will come Oh God even Lord as we approach your word tonight we just want to access special blessing of father upon the service tonight Oh God in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so just like I was saying and normally the the Sunday who have been our communion service saw my phone later and just now me same in the text and I felt bad I was not able to talk to her so I went home and I was just thinking you know as as an assembly we have traveled a little bit and I remember a couple of years back we will we would normally have our communion service on Saturday night we would come Saturday night in and have our communion service and then Sunday morning we will come back again and it was either the communion service or a prayer meeting you know and and that's we as we started traveling the lawn and and then sooner we went into having our communion service every first Sunday and and gradually we are growing into debt but just like I said on Sunday because of the weather you know I won't I won't want us coming you know and then being caught in the weddin praise the Lord so we we did cancer it and then I went home I was thinking about it and then I remember that I don't know whether it was the last communion service we had but I kind of make mention about it that we might have our community service on Wednesday night if the Lord lead us to so I had it upon my heart and quickly I spoke with the Deacons and and I think they were okay with faith instead of just skipping the communion service for the month we can come on Wednesday night have a prayer meeting and then just because it's all part of the word amen and we can just commute that way and just just as much as preaching and listening into the world praise the Lord so tonight I want to preach a little bit I want to take this thought that Jesus said right here that we have just rare day that behold ninet a physician amen data behold don't need a physician it's only the sake that need a physician praise the Lord amen and as I was looking at there through the scripture I remember Jeremiah cry to Israel they're not a bomb in Gila is they're not a physician praise the Lord and he says why our people you know L one of my people sake we have a bomb in Gila amen we have a physician and that is the great physician praise Lord but we live in in and in an Asian and loud issue has been diagnosed as an age that is sick but don't know that he has said praise the Lord and and and you know and naturally God has also blessed this age you know with with with great with great gifts of doctors you know wish of course when you look at the promise of divine healing if the law will just give us a little time let's go to Malachi chapter 4 let's go to Malachi chapter 4 what's now part of my trench tonight but it just came to my mind praise the Lord amen Malachi chapter 4 as we live as we read the promise of Malachi chapter 4 we we know us as believers of the message we return to to remember Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful dead of the Lord but when you read continuously I mean when you read down you are from from from the 4th chapter we have to remember that you know is Bible scholars that break out of these all of these things into chapter to be able to help you know condition our mind to understand what is happening but yet a strip shows a sub verse 1 behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall shall be stubble and the day that Comet shall burn them said the Lord of Hosts amen and it dare I shall leave them need a root of branches praise the Lord and you can look riding the earth you know I can I can be able to bring global warming from in their scripture tonight but I'm not going to do it him in praise the Lord but it's the dead of the Lord and the dead of the Lord speaks of a day of judgment amen but what I want to dwell on tonight verse 2 but unto you that fear my name unto you that fear my name other people in the house that fear the name of the law tonight unto you that fear my name the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings now brother Branham is somewhere in days brother Branham read that and he said the Sun of righteousness will rise with great healing campaign amen rise with healing in his wings and shall go forth amen he shot and and ye shall go forth and grow up as a cap of the star now there are other things I could bring you but what I want to look at tonight is as we are looking at Jesus said is those that I hold they don't need a physician only those that are safe so we realize here there is a promise over in Malachi that comes with the Malachi 4 promise and with the Malacca four promise and a Malachi 4 ministry and that they will they will also have healing part of it amen the Sun of righteousness that will rise up in this endtime ministry with healing in his wings praise the Lord amen so we see here that God gave this promise and when you look in the scripture most especially that means let me just kind of wrap it up quickly and help you you look in the book of Revelation as we were study together we realize there were four anointing there that was given to the church amen where Branham says right from the Book of Ezekiel when Ezekiel saw it he classified as the cherubim surround the throne but when it comes to the time of John they were like beasts they were like powers and and and those were the anointing that were around the throne and wish of course it has been described as the the lion the ox the man and the ego praise the Lord Amen and we can hear there are places where Berta Branham called that God he touched there also with the four books of the New Testament amen that the New Testament church where God will be anointing and that's why we had Matthew Mark Luke and John you know they were just took it was like a god to the book of Acts praise the Lord but where I'm going with this is that these for anointing were not just there from the beginning because we realize in a book of Genesis when God torrenting Eve to leave his presence the Bible says he gathered the treat of life with turbines so the cherubim has been God right from the beginning amen when Moses got to Moses to build the tabernacle he told Moses when you build the Ark of the Covenant porch irving's build turbines of gold over the Ark of the Covenant to serve as a God so God has he has had this thing write down this this anointing has been there right down from the ages prays alone and and in everything in our in our salvation in our protection in our our deliverance in our healing there are works within in in a conference of this anointing now the way I want the reason what I'm going I'm going this way tonight is because I'm talking on healing amen and and and and so when we comes to healing here is a promise that the Sun of righteousness with rise with healing in his wings and we know there is only one healer and that healer is God prays alone but yet God because he works with with with the principle of his word he has distributed also this anointing this these four powers let me not call the beast for like a better world but these four power these four anointing is also manifested I want to bring this in a way to be able to help you tonight or help us to now so we can be able to look at this praise the Lord amen yes Jesus coming right down there and with their seeing this man of palsy the broad and he could see that the Bible says Jesus seen the effect he saw the fate of the people to just be able to approach God to go to God for healing amen he saw the effect and he said some be of a good chair they are saying I forgive me praise the Lord amen now we know that sin is the Serpent's head if you kill the head the entire body is dead it's in a sense sin is the cause of sickness we wouldn't have high any sickness in a word today if it's in had now started so Jesus was just stepping on the seven head amen praise the Lord amen so we see you there God through the ages he has been the God has healed but miracle divine healing and God has blessed our age with a miracle science I mean they have advanced and we know there's that's healing now the reason why I'm bringing is because I've said is over and over you know and like a crossword and and I'm trying to explain myself so you'll be able to understand me when I say that now when you look at this for anointing like we said there is there is the lion's anointing there is the Ox anointing we have the main anointing and we have the Eagle anointing and we apply the photo to healing tonight before I continue on with what I want to I want to look into and then we change the order of the service so we realize this this great anointing comes through the ministry tweak we apply to the church ages we're not dealing with there tonight with want to be able to apply to healing and it's as as much as it sounds you know shocking to many people even death is healing death is healing to the believer Amen praise the Lord oh that that age there is the greatest divine healing you can get hey praise the Lord because like Paul said if this border be dissolved there's another body waiting for us and and as believers we've been taught in the world when you died you you you don't cease from existing you leave this brother right into a better one you know there is no door moving there there are just no door moving and you see it as an age that is that it's preparing for the rapture that was the reason why brother Branham God gave brother Branham our for our age they experience beyond the curtains of time what I explained to us the reason why God allowed where Branham - how that experience is to be able to explain to us what happened when we leave this body that there is no draw moment you step out of this body you jump into another one praise the Lord amen while we are crying for you you just stay right there and you're just smiling that's why Paul says we don't weep like those that don't have hope amen we don't weep like duo's that don't have hope we whip because we've been as part of our fleshly saints amen when we get a little bit of sorrow we week and sometimes when you are too happy you week praise the Lord amen when when when I mean when something is happy to you that you know you don't deserve there is a mixed feeling I don't deserve this but I'm glad that I have it that's why he will wear our tears when we get on the other side praise the Lord this isn't that part of mine or I don't know where I'm going to Nebraska I don't know whether you are the one pulling me no Rupali me but I'm going to go in a way they mean because I myself I'm beginning to enjoy it praise the Lord amen so death is one of the best healing we were ever experienced amen so what a saint died from cancer or died from anything you know what the moment across this life amen the moment across this life they go into a better body without moping I mean the doctors have done an amazing surgery for sister Kish she she she has a brand new level but she has to deal with pain right now she's dealing with pain amen but if takes us out of this body no pain it's over with are we together tonight amen now so when you look out of that you will realize that any reason why I say that is because you will see some believers praying and trusting God for their healing and they are believing and they are believing you know I mean they are going through different things in their body but here they are still trusting God is still loving God and they are still serving God praise the Lord and it looks to the natural eyes that that that nothing is happening amen but in the eyes of God and according to Scripture what is happening there is that God has given that believer an ox anointing because the Ox anointing is the anointing that can be amen in our sorrow we can still trust God even though he's flaming I was still seven praise the Lord so as far as God is concerned that believer is healed as far as his word is concerned praise the Lord because you feeling sorry for him but he's praising God I thank God every day for the strength that he gives me I thank God every day I can be able to wake up you know and and and he's just praising God and you see there are many I mean they were prayed their hands will be laid on them but God will keep them in that state on tell to break into a new body praise the Lord why some some has faith they're lying on anointing here able to take God by his were still right there and take God by his word you see because the thing about it did is that you know sometimes it troubled the minds of Christians well it's as well if you know it's not really healing this is - how to go through surgery they will not be able to see that amen because in as far as their mind can conceive it is there the sickness should disappear amen to them when it don't disappeared no that's not healing the signet the doctors can join the bones together but it take God to heal it amen and you have to know in your mind every process of healing is creation every process of healing is creation if I will said the earth was without form it was vowed darkness was all over for God to bring and eating he had to bring healing to the earth he had to take the darkness away he had to gather the water one place there was a healing process so healing is a process and healing is the beauty of creation praise the Lord Amen so there are some you know that God will bless put down the the the the anointing Elias anointing I mean it would take God told by his word I mean we stand it we stand when the doctors say don't stand on the folder with sand on it they said God I take you by your word you know I'm a man trust in your word I'm going to take the first step praise the Lord amen and you see the those things just don't come overnight they don't come overnight because God don't play games he's not a magician he's the creator of heaven and earth you have to believe his word you have to live by his word you have to obey his word praise the Lord and above everything else you have to love God praise the Lord whether he will answer your prayer saying yes or no you have to love him praise the Lord those that are whole need not a physician we will get to that in a little bit here and so we see them you know those ones that an origin of faith it's the same is the same that God that is standing insane and take God by His Word and you know and and the one that is there the same the Lord is my healer but the estate bearing affection a flexion in their body amen and yesterday praising God amen I'll tell you tonight that person is better than the one that has his whole body well and can't even praise God now pressing is more alive because the Bible says let everything that have birth praise God and you can have your whole body well but if you can't praise God you are just like a dead man because only the dead that don't praise God amen so you see a scene you know loving God maybe they're in a wheelchair or there are no crutches then you then you stand there and feel so sorry for them oh my good and what God can heal him you just in a miserable condition your condition is more miserable than that person that is in that situation I mean your condition is more miserable do you know why because when God put a man in a certain condition a man and a woman what is a condition of disability God put them in that condition for you to be able to appreciate the beauty of creation praise the Lord and then that's where medical science comes in is under the man's anointing God will bless men he would bless me this mean they do surgery I mean god blessed him amen like the Lord just kind of patrols in the path of of this this doctor much you the ones have been helping my wife and some of the other sisters I mean just a godly Christian man he just a godly Christian man and and and this man approached his profession just like a preacher going to preach he goes and prayed when it's time for surgery he don't speak to anybody he even pray with his with his patients now some are not Christians but God has blessed him it has to be gone because only God is the creator so for a man to be able to have a to be able to pull one vein to another vein and and and and and and and and you know and and put it together for your blood to flow through it it has to be acknowledged from the Creator that's what brother Branham said he says there's a place in heaven for a god called doctor and then the miracle comes under the eager anointing because the Eagle that fly so high God just take the sickness away you know take the tumor away before the doctor hints that's the ego's anointing so that's your fault that's your full anointing God I mean that the Sun of righteousness rising with healing in his wings you know when when he when he rises with healing in his wings he blessed all these areas amen he blessed man to go down the street I mean pray for sake raise the dead he blessed them he also blessed you know Christians to trust God they will not deny God they were not denied their confession even on to the grave praise the Lord amen I mean I mean lovely people nice people I mean one of the last time I spoke with brother brother Lonnie good he was a good friend of mine he said he said brother Warren I'm trusting God for my healing he said I just don't want to give my body so I believe medical science but I don't want to give my body to chemo I'm going to trust God for my healing and if he calls me through this way I'm still going to praise him you know so all of those things so what are we talking about tonight it's only a data that I hold that don't need a physician praise the Lord now there's the physical part of sickness and different thing we are talking about you know what tonight but we also want to look at their spiritual part praise the Lord Amen because there that is the that is the sickness that is more dangerous the one that was separated from God amen the one that was separated from God that's the one that is more dangerous you know and then when we come to the place like like Jesus said I'm not come to call the righteous but I've come to call sinners to repentance amen so the the way to the healing of the spirit man is repentance the way to the healing of the spirit man is repentance are we together tonight now but that's a beautiful picture here that's a very beautiful picture I want for us to look out tonight and kind of for meditate upon it last night and you think about Matthew the very writer of this book that we just read tonight the Bible said he was a tax collector amen Matthew was a tax collector praise the Lord amen and and DOS and those are tax collectors in those days you know I mean that that that was a fortunate job that was not just a job that was giving you know to to anybody praise the Lord I believe much he went to school I believe he trained himself in in fun eyes he had some financial ideas and in order of the adding you know whatever they were required of him that day for him to get that job praise the Lord and I believe the job pays him or else he was here he might have found something else to do but he was he was making good money and being a tax collector you know at that time you you you you know sometimes he bribery never started now they were bribery in those days amen oh I believe marty was invited to some of the best you know some of the best feast doing just invite him Marty can you come I'm having the palette oh I'm having a feast tonight the governor will be the amount you can you come over and now that's most of the time they will want to you know strike the ievo Dee's axe for some kind of for help you know for some papers right under the table praise the Lord and and and and we found out I will I will now want to believe that my to you was not guilty of that amen and he was not he was not the man that was I mean he was a with with his position that he had issue have been in either the upper class or the middle class not not the lowest class if you are being somewhere writing me let's keep me in the middle praise the Lord Amen and in the scripture says he has Jesus just coming from this from this revival he just he just healed a man were pausing and in the people I saw you know wow I love the way to save the glorify God which had given such a power two men in a sense God has has has given such a power among us now right am on us Bible beings and among us praise the Lord that we believe in a God that can heal the sick we believe in a God that can raise the dead we believe in a God that can change the sinner to a sane a God I can be able to destroy habits in a life of an individual praise the Lord you know that's one thing that happens to to our faith our Fed is reenergized every time when we trust God and we see him come on the scene there is something that just gives us strength to keep trusting him because he's a present tense God amen he's a present tense God so Jesus just came from out of this this meeting and the Bible says as he passed he saw this man macchu he saw this man sitting at his office amen maybe he was sitting right totaled up to the custom table and he was you know doing his working and and you know and and Jesus just just looked his way when it came to eyes contact my two eyes just look at his eyes he said follow me praise the Lord Amen gonna be easy to follow the law like that if you just look at you eye to eye but you see the problem most of the time he's trying to look at us and we are looking at something different he's trying to get our attention here and we take our eyes from there he gets here he tried to get our attention and we take our eyes from there I love it God God likes to look into your eyes praise the Lord but see what is happening here he calls marching and as it as it comes down and they are walking and March it is following this this this man and I will Lord Jesus Jesus go right down to the publicans and sinners he took much he below his class what is a great thing is a great invitation this is the man that he are talking about I mean everybody is talking something about him from the meeting he came from Wow he told the man your sin be forgiving we have never seen this I mean I'm man was bedridden and he pray for the man and a man came off the bed machi who have loved to be associated with that guy but yet he told machi as he walked down he brought him down to the lowest class praise the Lord my Jesus used to go into all of these parties with several wearing and everything praise the Lord but yeah he's down here eating what I have to put food in in leaves I wanna in his mind he's thinking wow really it's he really wigs praise the Lord I want to go somewhere with there tonight glory be to God amen and yet the Pharisees and then you know the the religious man of the hour when the side is you know no he just he just stepped below the line you know we highly esteem him but not getting down there and you know and you know eating with sinners for a matter of fact that was one of the things that the the disciple I mean the Pharisees accused Jesus of they called him a wine brother because he was always down eating and drinking with sinners you know any and he's guided on they don't they don't have that yeah yeah you know their feast with our wine so if Jesus is always down there with Benny just think that you know maybe he's a drunker praise the Lord amen but you have to remember this is the God that left his truth above amen and when he left his truth above he chose to be our neighbor he moves so close to us by taking on flesh and becoming one of us came in you don't call somebody you never I'll a far away the person have to be close the Bible says he is touched by the feelings of our imprimatur the Bible says he was tempted every way every way so he came so close left his throne about he descended to the lowest state and that was one of the first lesson that much you had to learn about the Lord Jesus the first lesson he had to learn about the Lord Jesus that the way up is down praise the Lord amen he humbled himself here all these religious guys are all know if he really were what he is he shouldn't have been like this he's eating and how your masters eat with sinners the Bible says and Jesus heard him and he says they that a whole don't need physician bar Branham said it should take one message to put you on fire for God it should take one preaching to put you to the place to make business with God if you take one service so stop you from playing Church praise the Lord I mean so I I think about this and I and I thought about it last night and and and and and and this is this is word this is where it comes it comes to my mind as a church and the place we find ourself the edge we find ourself in praise the Lord a few nights ago some brothers I wanted to talk to me about something and we were talking once there's something to mean I told him okay I with when the other one come you bring him alone at one a year where he got that information from we'll talk about it and and I saw the composition I saw them trying to pull my strings into argument but I've laid my guns down praise the Lord I told the brother that's his I won't waste my time to argue about anything I'll rather go and argue with a sinner to stop taking drugs I rather go and argue with him and tell him that I believe Jesus can change your life there for me to waste my time arguing what doctrine is writing what doctrine is not right I don't have time for that amen because it's only those that are sick that need physician many of us we have sat around so long and it's like our mind is makeup it looks like no preaching going to change your position amen it looks like you just come to witness the preacher and see what he's going to jump up and what he's going to run in what you know what is going to be like amen it's like we have our mind made up and we determine in our heart on terror it is our way we're not going to move you don't need a physician you don't need a physician until you comes to the place and realize that you are needing and you really need God every service would be very important to you praise the Lord I know this this little church has been blessed I remember one night we just we just got through preaching we had a service and we just wash it the Lord in and as soon as we came to the end of the service Geron ran from the street right in here to this pulpit and I mean she was just all I mean she just couldn't get her words and everything right I mean some some some of the believers have already left home and we were rounding and we had to spend time with hurting and pray them and I mean we are right we are right in in an area where we are exposed to that all the time sometimes I can't is parked right out there people coming and I mean it would knock on the door and remember a guy one time came in you know he was using sign language he couldn't talk and he realizes the car that somebody's supposed to be in there and I just heard it you know the bang on the door and you know bloody in and you know he told me what actually was happening to him and we see those things all the time and that's that's one good thing I like about this place for his Lord that's one good thing I like about this place well you see the like like you know blood brown talks about how we believers sometimes we become statue he main will become statute and sometimes we get to the place where we are just concerned about ourself we want a good service for ourselves praise the Lord let a little baby cried and we are the first thing what a mother can take the baby she did step in the service do you think about how much sacrifice they may for you to have a good service why if we have all of those baby in service tonight they don't yet the thing we are talking about they can just cried and shouting and this and anything about it there is data I listened to brother Branham all the time I hear children crying all over the place it don't stop that prophet he don't say take your baby out I got to a place one time I was in the service then and I saw what those brothers were doing you know zwip in the case for I told them I says don't do that I said don't do that I mean I mean it was they were becoming a little bit you know not in the sense of like encouraging the child or or maybe you know trying to help the child pay attention but I think they were going to the extreme it's all because we get to the place where sometimes we are so conscious of our convenience few weeks ago I got an email and I don't know how how this person got my email but someone from the neighborhood that's a gentleman that comes to church I would also be done with you I'm taking too much of the time tonight and at one time he came to service I mean he came right in the front seat here and we and we pray for him turn out to become a good friend of mine he would come around every time we see so one time he came out to service we hang out together took him across there to get some pizza and eat what what actually is is there he's in a group home somewhere back here so I decided to drive him I wanted to see where he where he lives so we went there in you know and then I dropped him off and each time a time we were meeting all of that you know and and and and just another time again it was there was another individual that comes coming to the church but what am I saying tonight Asuna those that are sick and needs the physician and who will be Jesus to them who will be Jesus to the ones that I need him praise the Lord you find people dealing with things in your lives and and I mean the struggle the struggle the struggle and and you you know and and and they just they just they just hurt himself you know you you can have the lying faith and stand in the face of the devil and defy the devil on the basis of God's Word praise the Lord and God can give you the victory for you to raise off from there because when the enemy comes as a flawed the Spirit of the Lord can raise up a standard but when after you have fun and you have fun and you realize you don't have strength ask for help praise the Lord because sometimes even when I know that oppression is struggling i found all sorts of ways to talk about it talk to them praise the Lord and sometimes you really see their most especially what breaks my heart when they start to become arrogant it just break my spirit are we together that's what the church is this is a soul clinic praise the Lord this is a soul clinic amen we come here to bring our knees to God we come here for God to help us all to help those that need help from God praise the Lord and that's why we oh that's that's that's our work that's why we create an atmosphere create an atmosphere for the Great Physician to comes down and many times I see if God comes down and you know I mean he just deliver people you just see clouds getting away from people life and spirit being cast out praise the Lord you love the law tonight amen we're about to go into prayer now musicians you can come praise the Lord you let us take our house before the Lord tonight let's bow our heads together and I wonder for us to sing a song but let let just by our heads together [Music] [Music] [Music] me me [Music] please us me me like give me their fear with long and me me me Thank You father tonight Oh me me light he's us me me lie give me a ha there feel wave law and me me more like me oh yes me me like me oh Jesus me like Oh give me nah how they feel we blow and me me like they just pray together tonight [Music] those that are hold don't need a physician [Music] those that are fake [Music] and like I said before Christian life has never been an individual life no Christian life it's a body life when one man still the entire body feel [Music] just like your entire body can add just lay it on just one part of the body it needs to hang they need a Fault in it and I in even years even the least member of your body that's very important and that just how the body of Jesus is that just had a Christian life is but sometimes people rolled into any view alive and they had their individual concept their individual representation they don't respect nothing the church belief it's well that's that's why you people believe I have my own word of light I have their own wait I have to do this I won't take you anywhere you just come to realize that you just become a selfish [Music] you are just becoming selfish and selfishness will affect the one that is becoming selfish it will not affect the people that you don't want to give to [Music] let's just pray together tonight just before we come or change the order of the service I pray that God will be able to deal with our house tonight and condition our house even if you thank you in a position that maybe you did not expect convenient service tonight you think you're not prepare for it the taking of the bread and the wine don't take that above your approach to go tonight you can come and take the bread and wine and yet your heart is still far from God [Music] [Music] if you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you have a right to the convenient tonight but yet if you're not living right [Music] there is room at the altar to that is wrong other Auto tonight and the reason what I want to do this church because I'm feeling the need in my heart that we need some cleaning up to do and that's the only way God will move in the mists of his people I don't want for us to take things lightly for us to be a church that is just callous but I want for us to be like that woman that is sweeping the house looking for that lost coin we need more of God they just pray
