[Music] of a blood sacrifice blood had to pay the price and it's forever been the same there has never been any other way or anything else that ever took its place it was blood the only way that God receives his children back is by this Blood substitute no other price can be paid nothing else will do God's first decision is always perfect and its Eternal and we know that that's true because God can't lie and he cannot take his word back since that time has been God's only way and only place of fellowship with man now the subject was now the word death means separation when we die this way it does not mean our physical death does not mean that we are dead Jesus said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die now that death speaking of there is separation from the presence of God but the physical death that we have to go through here yet it is not death we're still in the presence of God we move from this place to a closer place with him in his presence it isn't the death that we call death what we call it here remember he said to the the girl that was died gas's daughter she is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scarn he knowing that she was dead that's their terms she was dead but Jesus said she sleepeth and he went and wakened her and she came back to life now from Adam until now man has tried to make his own substitute he's tried his best to do something a little better than what God did it then and that's just natural in man man is always trying to to better something to make it a different way he wants to inject his own ideas into the plan of God and that's why we stand tonight separated uh the Christian people of the world by barriers by denominational barriers we it does this because that man has injected his own idea into God's plan from Adam until now as I've said it's been that way Adam expressed man's thinking in the Garden of Eden when he made himself a fig Leaf apron to face God it's something that he did himself and from fig leaves he's tried education Towers cities Idols civilization denomination but it ever Remains the Same God only accepts his subject under the blood that's all education has totally failed more educ we get farther we get from each other denomination has totally fail we draw lines and barriers in each one trying to get that denomination higher than the other and it breaks Fellowship civilization has merely brought about confusion cities towers and whatever more has all failed and God's plan Still Remains the Same under the blood this Blood must be a displayed blood in the garden back in the time rather of Israel when Israel had to kill the lamb and a place of blood upon the L and on the doorpost god required that and that token must be there no matter what other position them man might have showed that they were circumcised Israelites they might have confessed that we believe every word that Jehovah said but that didn't expel it they had to display that token the blood must be shown amen that's the way it is tonight I believe that every Christian has to display the blood of Jesus Christ is cleans them from the things of the world regardless now in that time the token must be on the door it must be there regardless of how Rel religious the house was how religious the people how well they had brought up their children how fine they tended Church how well they displayed all the things that God has said it's still at that last hour where it showed between death and life the blood had to be displayed and the blood showed that a innocent substitute had been taken in the place of the worshipper and the chemistry of the blood the red blood itself was a sign on the door that this house was safe under the blood now that was a type now in these last days we're coming back again to the hour of God delivering his church I I believe it amen and it's certain as that blood had to stand for a memorial so does the token had to be is required today for now they could not take the chemistry of the blood of the Lord Jesus and placed upon ever heart's door but you see that time an animal died which was a lamb and to show that the animal was dead the blood was on the door so the life that was in the animal could not come upon the worshipper because the animal doesn't have a soul so the life that was in the animal could not come upon the worshipper but today when the blood of God's own son was shed at Calvary for our pardoning and release the life that was in that blood was God himself and the Holy Spirit returns upon his church upon his believer and it's a token in these last days he'll pass over the man or the woman that's accepted the death of Jesus Christ as their substitute and the Holy Spirit Bears record you might say I've accepted it and you still live in the world you still live like the world then there's no evidence that that life was for you until that evidence of the Holy Spirit has struck into your life there's God's requirement that every man or woman must have that evidence as a token in this last day when I see the blood Jesus said verily verily I send you except the man be borned again of the water and spirit he will in nowise enter into the kingdom therefore it's been God's program all the time blood it was blood in the Old Testament it was blood in the New Testament in the Old Testament was the chemistry which was a type of the life that is to come it showed that there was a substitute taken but the worshipper went out with the same guilty conscience that he had when he come in and offered his lamb but this way when the worshipper once purged from sin has no more conscience of it the thing is dead passed away and you changed from Death unto life and you're alive again in Christ Jesus with eternal life the Holy Spirit resting within you bringing forth the life of Jesus Christ again where the Bible said in Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever God is waiting the hour to see his church come to that position regardless of denomination regardless of creed color or whatever it may be that his entire church would come to the place that they're displaying the token of the death of Jesus Christ for a little while he said in the world seems me no more yet ye shall see me because I live you live also I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I get among Christians sometime who claim to be SED man of women of God they're ashamed of a testimony they're ashamed to say Amen they're as shamed to sing the songs of Zion they're ashamed everywhere I like to get among people who's not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ though it seems like heresy but yet they're not ashamed something has happened and it means more than life to them it is life it's life eternal because they have accepted God's substitute I like this kind of singing when I was back there praying for some of the people a few moments ago that had been brought in and it's not being a prayer service just to speak I was in there and I can hear the songs the Clapping of their hands and we wonder and some of them even uh seen them run up and down the floor what they call dancing in the spirit at first time I was a Critic of that when I seen the Pentecostal people dancing in the spirit and I thought what is this it must be a bunch of nonsense then I got to reading the Bible and I found out that when dancing in the spirit the devil cop it it and put him out here with rock and roll and stuff but the real genuine Dance come from God exactly and always a dance was Victory when David slew Goliath and this little runny looking boy come dragging ahead of this chant into the city the people met him dancing they had the victory when Moses crossed the Red Sea by the power of God and took the children of Israel on the other side miam picked up a tambourine and all the daughters of Israel and up and down the bank they went beating a tambourine and dancing in the spirit if that isn't an oldfashioned Pentecostal meeting I never seen one in my life the trouble was with me I didn't have enough Victory but when you finally get that Victory and the token of the blood of Jesus Christ comes upon you I remember David the Great s psalmist of the Bible when he had done something that this great thing he was given Saul's daughter and she was kind of a self self style so-called believer and the Ark had been away from God for a long time the visible presence of God the pillar of fire hanging over this Ark the Philistines that come in and tuck it out under Saul's Reign and one day when David seen the ark coming back to the house of God David run out before the ark and he danced before the Lord oh singing the Praises of God and Saul's daughter seemed to be very much embarrassed at that man's action her husband her young handsome husband cut up and misbehave himself in her presence the King's Daughter and David said so much if you don't like that watch this a little while and around and around and around the ark he went again dancing in the spirit and she was embarrassed and God cursed that woman with a curse oh the victory through the blood of Jesus Christ The Token of the resurrection of Christ his life lives within his church there's no other way of Fellowship under but under that blood our denominations will separate us and one say that's nonsense and one say this that or the other Pentecost was our pattern no one will have to say but what or can say but what that the church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and the same spirit that come upon them on that day every time without fail in the Bible when the Holy Ghost came upon the people they acted the same way let me say this that in the Heathen lands where I've had the place of the privilege of traveling and seeing blanket natives of the islands and in the hotten tots and see them stand there where he have to speak through an interpreter never heard the name of Jesus Christ in their life but tell them a story and ask them to raise up their hands and receive God they do the same thing you do right here when you receive the holy ghost shows it it's a universal thing it's a power of almighty God the display of his token upon his children whether they're red black white or whatever they might be it's the only place that Fellowship is given Nimrod built a tower and Nebuchadnezzar a city and so forth they go on down through scientists and everything but ever Still Remains that it was the blood that God made his decision that it would be a innocent substitute would have to take the guilty man's place for pardon and it Remains the same thing tonight and never has changed it job lived by it job the oldest book in the Bible though everything happened to that man yet he stood firm because he know he had met Jehovah's requirement he know it was right Abraham the same way many of them Israel met only there was only one place that Israel could have Fellowship that was under the shed blood man ought ever H to Worship in Jerusalem until there was a sacrifice there was no worship and the sacrifice was blood today the day is yet as fully educated as the the nation seems to be and as high cultured as they seem to be and all of our scientific research to split an atom and whatever it takes place to shoot a rocket to the moon or send up a a satellite or whatever it might be all of our scientific research all of our denominations all of our education all of our schools it's only got us further from God than it was at the beginning what it takes is a surrendered heart to the power of almighty God by his will and the Holy Spirit will come as a token upon that person these signs shall follow them that believe it ever Remains the Same Christ said so go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe it's a manifestation of the holy spirit that God has accepted the worshipper for the spirit and life that was in Christ comes upon the worshipper could you imagine a Jew in the old days under the shed blood here he comes down the road it's the day of the atonement he's going to make a sacrifice he has a fine fat bulock that's Jehovah's requirement or maybe we say he has a a lamb a fine fat lamb it's going to be looked over by the priest to see if there's a blemish upon it and then he goes to the place of worship he realizes he's a sinner he's did that which was wrong now he lays his hands upon this Sacrifice by laying his hands upon the sacrifice he identifies himself with his sacrifice and then when his throat is cut or its life is taken his hands laid up on him and his life is taken and he feels the pains as that animal is dying and the blood squirting out upon his hands he realizes that that animal is taking his place and there he goes back justify because he's done exactly what Jehovah required him to do and that's the same thing it is with Christians today it isn't signing a card that you'll come to Sunday school so many days or so many Sundays in the year it isn't taking a pledge that you won't drink no more for 6 months it isn't that it's laying your hands upon God's provided sacrifice his pardon the head of Jesus Christ and feeling the Terrors of the flesh at Calvary and then identifying yourself with him in baptism that as he died and rose again so are you buried in his name to rise
