and see where we have gone uh a little over hour time year now so let's try and get right into the world praise the Lord you know I have I have one other preacher One Pastor good friend of mine is an ever you know he followed the service and you know he's uh he's his brother wanna Follow Your Service all the time I want to tell you try and let the people go home early praise the Lord I say Sir sometimes I don't know if I'm keeping them or they're keeping me praise the Lord but I know most of the time I'm keeping you I'm sorry and uh but we thank the Lord uh brother one and his wife travel over to Japan and talk to them during the week they're saying their greetings and talk to different Brothers ministers that also send their greetings and sometimes you'll promise that you will greet the church and you forget so may the Lord just just have his way and help us this morning let's go to the Book of Genesis chapter 28 38 not 28 38 38. last week we were talking about the house of parents I will I would like to continue in their Direction but I will speak unborn by the Sea incorruptible Born By the Sea incorruptible that's what Peter said uh back there the so that's that's what I would want us to talk about uh that's that's the subject I will I will give myself this morning but let's just read Genesis chapter 38 just for the background that we did do a little review from where we stopped you know all the time we have a sometimes I go home and I ask myself am I I'm not a making it easy for the people to understand the direction that I'm going uh I know many of the time I even Leave myself in suspense how much more about you amen and praise the Lord you know the brothers who say brother one you always preach and you leave people in suspense and sometimes it's hard to follow the direction that you're going but I pray that I'm not leaving you in the day I came in let's read that Genesis chapter 38 we read from verse 26. you have to remember we started with this subject back at the beginning of the year when we were talking about righteousness so let's just read Judah confession here and Judah acknowledged him and said she has been more righteous than I because that I give her that to ashila my son and he knew her again no more 27 and it came to pass in the time of her travel that behold Twins were in her womb and it came to pass when she traveled that the one pulled out his hand and the male wife took and bound upon uh and and bound upon his hand as colored thread saying this came out first now you have to remember that phrase this came out first because that phrase identified your first birth that is your first birth and uh this came out first and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said the male wife I would guess how have that broken forth how you how you overcame he was the first how did you came out praise the Lord how have that broken fault this bridge that word Bridge is is almost like it could mean bridge that goes over a lake or you know it could also means uh a gap something took place amen you you bypass the natural author praise the Lord and as we go back to uh uh uh uh uh who is this Melissa that we can take that top that you bypass your teal funny for you to come to time to be tempted for you to be tested praise the Lord so there was a bridge that will connect you back to your original identification praise the Lord so what this bridge be upon be therefore his name was called fears praise the Lord and after war came out his brother that had this the Scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zero praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed while we turn to First Peter chapter one where we're taking our inspiration from uh this this morning First Peter chapter one that's where we're taking our inspiration from this morning let's read from Verse 18 for as much as you know that year will not redeem with corruptible things uh silver and gold from your vain conversation received by traditions from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ amen as of a lamb without blemish and without spot we verily was full ordained before the foundation of the word but was manifest in this last time for you oh by him do believe in God who raise him up from the dead and give him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God not in a man not in a church amen Your Faith and Hope might be in God praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord are we together trying to find myself to be with you seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit onto on the frame love of the Brethren saying that ye love one another with with a pure heart heavenly being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible praise the Lord so we would we would deal with the sea principle every seed must bring forth of its kind so Peter is saying here our new birth when we are born again our new birth our second birth the one that bypassed zero praise the Lord amen is not of corruptible seed is of Incorruptible see praise the Lord and that Incorruptible seed is the word of God which liveth and a Barrett forever praise the Lord so we uh for this second phase we want to speak on born by the seed incorruptible praise the Lord now if if we will look close here you will see that the uh uh we were we were in a book of Ruth chapter four let's go back there and let's cap up on our review here root chapter 4 praise the Lord that's where we saw these uh uh this tremendous uh uh these tremendous prophecy about the house of pharaohs amen I don't know whether whether you grab it or whether I left you uh in suspense but what we were talking about here what what kind of a meeting uh what made it a prophecy here is the other this is how the uh the the the the wedding after the wedding of Ruth and Boaz and then uh uh don't don't uh just just follow me now uh the brother is trying to translate down the you know the don't don't say there is voices you hear your voices okay don't say what's going on hearing voices just stay with me the technician will get that under control praise the Lord amen now so uh Ruth and Boaz here but then after uh the the Javier chai uh the the the Heathers were were testifying and uh the Bible says verse 17 of chapter 4 in the Book of Ruth and the women her neighbors gave a name saying there is a son born unto now meaning and they call his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David then then right there the Bible goes into this you know as as as a Christian as a as a Bible reader uh it must grab your attention now these are the generation of pharaohs you know what what does that have to do with roof and boas what what does that have to do with this child that is born praise the Lord amen now so it gave us the generation of pharaohs and then it ends on to verse 22 and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse be gay David and then if you look at that there it gives you 10 Generations so then it also sent us back now to the book of Deuteronomy that tells us that an illegitimate will not enter into the congregation until after 10th Generation praise the Lord because we realize that what happened between Judah and his daughter-in-law Tema there was an illegitimate Act dependent so for God to redeem that because that was in the sea lion of God praise the Lord so here we we we're seeing this prophecy laying out here and and you know and God is uh uh uh grabbing our attention to that so God is dealing he's he's Redeeming the Sea of Judah he's bringing the seed of Judah back into the congregation of the Lord why because the Bible says that the scepter shall not leave Judah which speaks of the kingship so you see that's the reason why Israel could not have a king because the family out of who the king was supposed to come hard and illegitimate curse over them so on turn that curse was breaking until the high one that we come back into the congregation before Israel we have a king that's what Meg David a king after God's Own Heart because he broke the curse are we together praise the Lord so you see yeah there's there are just there's a whole lot of mystery concerning your life that you don't know about don't think that you figure out your life don't deceive yourself don't lean onto your own understanding because there is a whole cloud of mystery around your life that you have not break the Earth you have not even touched the surface of it are we together so yeah we see that out of that illegitimate ad there were two there were two seeds that came out there were two sounds that were born praise the Lord Sarah that was supposed to be the first they are the male wife identify as the first But True Divine of image perish people he overcame Zara and he came forth praise the Lord amen all of that is happening the male wives are watching it they are saying oh wow what kind of for Naughty Boy is this how did you do that praise the Lord they are seeing all of that but they don't have an idea that God almighty God is writing prophecy no idea okay that's the house of pharaohs this morning I want for us to look a little bit into the other songs praise the Lord you love the Lord are you ready for the word how I need God to strengthen me this morning praise the Lord how I lead God to strengthen me this morning you see it's it's very amazing when you read the Bible this Bible contains from the beginning of the creation of the word you read this Bible you go back and read the book of Genesis right in chapter 11 in chapter 12. and and and and you can see word history there is not a nation under the Earth there might it might have a change of name praise the Lord but it's history is in this book there is not a family on the face of the Earth whose root is from somewhere else that you cannot Trace back to the Bible there is not a race of people there is not a tribe your tribe might have come out of one tribe and Miami Tribe but if you trace it back it will end back right into this book praise the Lord this is an amazing book It's a Wonderful book praise the Lord Hallelujah it's one of the book that is most read it's so bad that we're having a generation now that don't want to read the Bible but you will realize that before time lawyers when people steady law they always read the Bible praise the Lord great scientists read the Bible actors read the Bible there was just something that uh uh there were there were there were just something that was that it had a kind of for magnetic food praise the Lord it used to be then you travel around the world you get into a hotel check the draw you'll find a Bible yeah working praise the Lord when men were condemned to death life sentence in praising the next thing they will hand him up is the Bible go and spend the rest of your life with this book praise the Lord now I I've been we've been reading through the Book of Joshua Holmen and I've been doing my own Joshua steady with different things I've been looking through and and all of that uh and some some some some very fascinating things came out of the Book of Joshua for me let's go to Joshua chapter 6. Joshua chapter 6 is the the conquered of Jericho but there are some amazing thing in the end in their book uh I was going to read a quote of brother Branham here to Startup wave but it looks like I didn't I didn't add it to my note I didn't add it to my note but we we will catch up here Joshua chapter 6. praise the Lord amen Joshua chapter 6. you see that's that's one of the things that makes me to stay alone I have a very slow stat and this guy like you have to push him down the road you got to keep pushing him get up the hill and let him go you know I'm just like some kind of for all vehicle where you gotta push with one leg outside and jump in and try to face but when you get me going I've I've tried to get you to your destination praise the Lord there is an amazing thing here in in Joshua chapter six I want for us to study together Joshua chapter 6 you see God in his law now follow me now there are some things that the Lord takes unto himself you realize that in Egypt when God was going to strike Egypt he decided to to hit Egypt so high by the slain of the firstborn and when God did that it moved Pharaoh it moved the entire Egyptians but then God turned to the children of Israel and said that I did that because I want to have the right to your firstborn from now on all the first born of man and obese are mine praise the Lord and then as time will goes on God will now show that how he moved up from having the firstborn as heads to have the levite as his and the Levites will now be you know uh uh the people that would Belongs to the Lord and in some way they will represent the first bomb now it used to be in those days that when a man had the firstborn son and uh he knew that that song was for the Lord so uh uh there was something that was that was instituted that was called the Redemption money so the man would come up with a certain Psalm and he would go and give that money over to the priests and then you know he will have his boy at home but it was still in the back of the in their mind that you know that uh the the the firstborn was the Lord now when you come over to Joshua chapter six there there are some other things lying there but I will I'll get over it or else I won't get to what I want to talk about God approaching the promised land he approaching the inherent things that he promised to the children of Israel he's going to bring out a principle that I want us to see God is going to use the Conqueror of Jericho and the way he will approach Jericho praise the Lord you can see right there from the beginning when those spies went into Jericho Rahab testified of how the people were were terrified they have heard of these people you see so God went before Joshua and he created a fear in the house of the people of Jericho praise the Lord the Lord was the one that created that fear Israel never had a a military group they were they were just they were just families they were traveling together praise the Lord all the how was the shout of the king in the camp they had the Ark of the Covenant praise the Lord now all they are the high God India mess the Lord and I'm telling you if you have the god of the universe in your Camp you are on The Winning Side you are stronger than any nightmare in the world are we together God is going to approach this I want you now to put on your your your your your spiritual cap and look very closely yeah he's going to approach this with with with far with such a principle because this is the land that he promised Abraham I will give you this life Lord your sea shall sold joy in a Strange Land I will bring them out with a mighty hand and I will give you this Lane so what is he going to do God now is going to take a tie from what he promised to give them the principle of tithing oh I get you in a in a tight corner here praise the Lord he's going to approach this in in this way that Jericho the conquer of Jericho he toyed Israel I would give you every inch of the ground you have to fight for it but with the approach of Jericho God is going not to allow Israel to use their muscles they will not fight amen praise the Lord he's going to conquer the land by himself in a supernatural way he's going to bring down the Walls and he's going to tell them that you must burn everything this is going to be a burn offering to me I have given you the lane but this portion is going to be a burn offering to me after this when Israel go and Conquer they were to this they were to distribute the sports whatever they gather they were to take it praise the Lord but God is going to say in Jericho not a sheep not an arcs nothing don't take nothing everything Burn It To Me praise the Lord so just by that principle you will realize that God was taking an offering to himself if I'm going to be part of this battle I'm going to take Jericho which is the first that's the principle of tithing people the first Robert Brown says show me the man that will prosper or the man that would put God first I will show you a man prosper so God is going to take that first Conquest but the king true that Jovi oh I love this I love this Hallelujah amen I love this praise the Lord Hallelujah after they came through the Jordan he's going to take this first Conquest as his now they are set in principle here you go home and read the entire chapter but let's go let's go quickly here chapter one now Jericho verse one sorry not chapter one chapter six verse one now Jericho was strictly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in why because the two spies has gone so the barricade of the entire city and the law said unto Joshua seed I have given now I will give I have given it's already done it is already done praise the Lord it is now your weepiness now you're begging that is going to make it down it's not your fasting God has already given it it's a finish work praise the Lord Hallelujah Do You Believe In The Finnish work amen are we going are we ready to trust in the finished work are we going to claim the finish work or do we want to impress God that we can do it better are we together you love the Lord oh let's give you in the hand of Praise Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you for the finished work amen we can sing It's Already Done the Battle Is Over the victory is won it's already done [Applause] it's a finish work the law said unto Joshua see I have given into I have given into thy hands Jericho and the Kings thereof and the Mighty Men of vellum and the Asia come past the city all the men of War and go around about the city once Thou shalt thou do six days now verse 4 pay attention to verse 4. because it's going to be very very important praise the Lord verse 4 God is going to rewrite he's going to break his own Lord he's going to break his own principle that's the way that's that's that's what I love about my God praise the Lord because he tells you that there is nothing above his word that even he himself he's not above his word praise the Lord amen but he says I can go around it verse 4. and seven priests shall bear before that now go back go back and and read over there uh in the tournament Leviticus it was always 12 priests that goes before the ark 12 priests ish representing a tribe but yeah for Jericho the order change it's not going to be 12 pricks I want seven to go before the ark are we together praise the Lord amen are we together people am I keeping you in suspense praise the Lord amen are you sitting and saying I wonder where is he going and oh yes people get so anxious they just want to put their hands in no no wait one at a time one at a time oh we just love the Lord amen we love the Lord Seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram Holmes that's completely different Ram horse were never used in battle it was silver horns that was used in battle when you go back to Leviticus horns were never used in battle Ram Holmes Leviticus chapter 25 is the Jubilee horn praise the Lord Leviticus chapter 25 when you read and then and then that was the horn that was born to announce the Jubilee glory to God that now you are free all your deaths are paid but God is introducing that here in in this battle it's completely different and the seventh day yeah shall come past the city seven times but either Commandments he says the seventh day keep it holy and ye shall do no work in the seventh day even the distance that Israel would travel in the seventh day was calculated you cannot go above certain miles you break the Sabbath Year God is going to make them to work on the seventh day praise the Lord are we together seven priests shall go before the ark with seven Rams Horn and then on the seventh day they must go around the setting seven times that is above the miles that they will ever travel on the seventh day man God is introducing all of these things to show that when he introduced the rest on the seventh day in Genesis chapter 1. the Bible says and God rested from all of his works praise the Lord that it is not just like in our human natural sense what we think about the rest well there was something that God was introducing that's the reason why for the New Testament Church the rest has become the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Hallelujah amen now you have to realize that when God gave them the Commandment they were the one to rest on the seventh day praise the Lord so if God is instructing them here to work meaning that they are not the one working by law they are supposed to rest so on the seventh day it's going to be almighty God that will step in there because they were not supposed to rest they were not supposed to work they were supposed to be resting praise the Lord hallelujah you see that is the reason why the New Testament Church never talked to the Sabbath they talked to the resurrection that's why we meet on Sunday to all of the Resurrection because the resurrection magnified the Sabbath [Music] are we together now let me say before I go any further and we should stay along in church please blame yourself Hallelujah is that a deal okay okay let's just make that as a deal so it will not be like the pastor is said we kept him there long praise the Lord but you understanding what I'm saying the Sabbath supposed to be our rest amen it's supposed to be the arrest glory be to God and brother Branham said if we have not entered into rest for God to take over our work we have to enter into rest yes yes are we together as long as you are working it out yourself the father have nothing to do you are keeping him in arrest because you are doing the work you supposed to work sixth day in the seven days you step back and let God take it over [Music] are we together so if these people if God I'm I'm in my mind I'm imagining all of these men looking at Joshua what is he saying we never use ram horns in battle Joshua out of his mind Joshua I thought it was supposed to be 12 minutes before the ACT each man to a Travis lever representing uh uh uh uh a tribe praise the Lord I don't think they argue with Joshua but in your mind just like we do you sit there you hear the word and in your mind you're calculating praise the Lord what is he talking about Joshua you realize the seventh day is the day of rest do you realize that listening listen to what is God praise the Lord I'm going to check for the court Moses had it and go right into Exodus chapter 20. I finally caught Joshua was honored Divine instruction Joshua was speaking that day just like brother Brandon preaching the seals praise the Lord the angel met him just before he came to the pulpit [Music] he never had control over it praise the Lord I believe Joshua went back and listened to the table and said what was I preaching today oh my God but he was honored and divine Divine structure holy spirit amen just like we don't like to leave our comfort zone we get so used to doing things the way we faint is right it's righteous in all of that and you become so uncomfortable put on your religious gears praise the Lord seven priests seven Ramones seventh time around the city praise the Lord are we together Joshua chapter 6 verse 17. Joshua chapter 6 verse 17. praise the Lord sister Queen are you are we together am I boring you okay let's do it praise the Lord are we together verse 16 let's read and it came to pass after seventh time when the priests blowed blew the blue with the trumpet Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord had given you the city verse 17 and the city shall be a curse now that word is a little bit tricky it's a little bit tricky a curse who means something that is cursed it could also mean something that is dedicated praise the Lord amen it could mean something that is dedicated now so just follow me a little bit yeah [Music] and the city shall be a cursed even a uh and all that is there in told the law now that's where the catch is it shall be accursed toward the lord amen so in the sense there is that God has condemned the senator himself that he won everything [Music] praise the Lord and that's why when God call you as a sort of God he condemned you to himself he don't only want you on Sunday praise the Lord not only when you ain't in church a curse unto the Lord condemn devoted dedicate it are we together and all that they are in to the Lord only rehab their heart shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she believed in Malachi for [Laughter] eign God please forgive me but that's the way I believe it amen because she held the messenger that was sin can we say Amen you feel more comfortable to say Amen that way that's fine that's fine I'll bear with you as you bear with me also praise the Lord the Bible says here and yet in any wise keep yourself from the accurs things least you make yourself a curse when you take all the accursing and make the calm of Israel a curse praise the Lord so you see you could bring a curse into the camp of Israel if you temper with these things that are dedicated unto the Lord that is the same principle like I said in tithing it's your money but the 10 percent is the law are you understanding that so if you is your money it's your high and high earned money praise the Lord amen I'm not on a wish hunt yet I'm preaching the word of God glory be to God I'm showing you the principle so God is saying if you temper with this dedicated part you will bring a curse into the camp because this is set aside for a purpose are you seeing the principle he changed the order of War in Leviticus the priest never goes to war praise the Lord but yeah God is not using the men of War he's using the priest and he's using seven of the priests are we together and make a mega cam of Israel a curse and trouble it but all the Savior the gold the vessels of rice and iron are consecrated to the Lord is that what the Bible says they are consecrated to the Lord they shall come into the Treasure of the Lord there were things that would be used in the Tabernacle praise the Lord so you see the idea that God is taking this entire city to himself praise the Lord you love the Lord are we together are we together are you tired praise the Lord because I have not even started preaching yet I'm just gonna laying down taking you through the stretch you're creating my picture I'm not even start I'm just loading my gun I'm not even started shooting at the Devil yet praise the Lord Hallelujah amen just help me let's let's let's let's uh let's let's lower this thing because we have to blow this guy off amen Hallelujah praise the Lord so we see this principle travel with me in a little bit chapter 7 verse 1. chapter 7 verse 1. by the Turning of Israel committed a trespass in their accursed think the very thing that God told them not to Temple with you always have a defined person in the bunch praise the Lord amen switch your phone off you will always have somebody coming in to use their phone and it will want to make you to believe that it really you always have a defined person that is the first nature that's our first birth is stick in this flesh very stubborn I always want to defy the Lord of God and see what will happen young people you don't have to smoke you don't need a taste of it you don't have to say let me try and see what will happen you might be hooked onto a demon that will take you to the Grave always a divine nature to seek right in our flesh praise the Lord if God has given you Grace and has created an environment for you to grow you better be thankful if you think it says uh well I I I I you know uh Amazing Grace I want was lost but now I found I don't know how to relate to that song is because you have not wake up yet you don't know yourself yet praise the Lord you don't have to go into the garbage of sin you don't have to pollute your minds with the field on the internet you were already born lost you don't have to Lost yourself more you were born last born in sin simply in iniquity coming to the word speaking lives you were born lost from the economy of God it's not when you go out and break your virtues and go into uh the mass life of sex and drugs and all of that before now you know you are lost you are already lost by Nature [Music] is how one defying person how Joshua was saying to these people they said it and all that it has is dedicated to the Lord you will always have an Akon but the children of Israel committed a trespass in their cursed him for Akon the son of coming the son of uh zidi the son of Ze ra trace him back to the Second Son of Judah from tema that's the reason why we travel all of this place because we wanted to find that Second Son the one that's supposed to be the first the one upon Whom The Raid prayer was tied on his hands he was a curse all I encouraged nature you love the Lord are we together they see us are open people the Bible is a new book thoughts of God has been released to us the thoughts in God's back part of his mind to make us to know that we bypass our tear funny praise the Lord we came to this world with all of these sticky nature stubborn and defy nature but that's not the real you don't believe that could be the real you because it's going to destroy you know [Music] praise the Lord I don't care whatever your lowest point is you can do better you can always rise above that oh how I love the Lord how I love the Lord how I love the Lord oh let's give the Lord a hand of Praise Hallelujah [Music] glory be to God the Bible says here the aegon the son of Kami the son of uh zebbe the son of Zira that's uh of the Trap of Judah if you want to look at that you will see there over in uh where am I here now you look back out there and uh you go down to verse 14 to verse 18 I've got just one part of the reading about just in this first verse if you want to look closely if you go back to to Judah which was the father Zara was the son the first tween that came out so if you count from to akan you have what fourth generation amen fourth generation is that truth am I right don't don't agree with me because I'm the preacher I want you to be involved in it the father of this that's one generation the father of that so this is four generation Exodus chapter 20. Exodus chapter 20. we show 10th Generation before their seed could come back into the congregation now we have it and not a full generation in Exodus chapter 20 the Bible will say God is visiting the iniquity of the fathers to the dead and the fourth generation amen the iniquity of Jacob or Judah but it's beautiful here let's re-exit it chapter 20. that is in the tanks combining praise the Lord look we come to church to enjoy the word of God not to tell you Bible stories I'm not a politician I'm not running for running the campaign to tell you which party you should vote for we we come to enjoy the world are you enjoying the word praise the Lord okay so let's enjoy the Bible says here thou shall have no other gods before me that's chapter verse 3 of Exodus chapter 20 thou shall not make unto thee any grieving image or any likeness of anything that is that is in heavens above or that is in the earth below and all that is in the waters under the Earth they are sure thou shall not bow down thyself to them don't serve them I was I was selling this yesterday something caught my mind that I've never seen before that I've never seen before that God is going to tie the the engraving image because you have to realize to know that it is man that make gravity image it's man that makes idol God never make idol God make a tree they cut it down and they build their own Idol praise the Lord so God yeah that's going to a Time the worshiping of an idol as an iniquity as something in a dream that we hunt down to the fifth generation man I'm telling you I can get in this and I will keep you here the whole day praise the Lord we never book a restaurant for us to eat I think you have money to give you your favorite food today so I won't do it praise the Lord amen but I'm telling you yeah it's so it's so why the fourth generation why the fourth generation because Bob the curse and the blessing runs down to the fourth generation God told Abraham I will bring you back to this land after 400 years fourth generation he says in your fourth generation Moses was part of the fourth generation Abraham Isaac Jacob praise the Lord and Jacob ha the Patriots and Levi was one of his son out of Levi was born amra which is the fourth generation and amaran born Moses are we together now but look at this it's very interesting uh little kids this is for you this is for you you got to pay attention to you thou shall make no grieving image I mean we make gravy image of everything praise the Lord amen and I will tell you it's not in a bad way but the first Idol to a child is the appearing praise the Lord and the way we relate to God that's how our children learn from us if they never see you praying they will never know how to go in prayer and they never see you reading the Bible they will never learn it praise the Lord now because your worship is so a true and a living God and your child looks unto you I mean uh uh yeah I mean your your daddy should be your Idol you want to be like your daddy you want to be like your mommy in a good sense are we together now so the Bible is saying here but if you start to build a grieving image it will be a grieving image if you are copying after Hollywood and all that the child can know is just year abusive and just in filthiness praise the Lord amen then that adultery runs down from that child to the child that they will give birth to the next child are we together not just washed it I don't know if you would appreciate like I did appreciate thou shall not bow down thyself to them not sell them for I am the Lord thy God verse 5 I'm a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children onto the tear and the fourth generation so yeah with Akon case he was visited with the iniquity object of Judah that's where I'm going with that but right here the Bible says here that God says that he's visiting the iniquity to deter that the fourth generation of them that hit me and showing Mercy unto the thousands of them that love me so he's in he's he's visiting in both ways he's visiting iniquity he also visiting them they love him and he's giving them Mercy praise the Lord he's giving them Mercy now but what caused my attention here uh is the other poor in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 He says children obey your parents amen he said honor your father and mother he said this is the only commandment with a promise now that struck my mind last night and I was thinking oh my god I've read this before I preached this before but it's coming in a completely different way to me he already said God has already laid out a commandment of the Paris iniquity visiting the children and yeah he made a provision for the children now to break out of that how are you going to break out of it it's not about you try thinking that you are wiser than your parents are smarter than your parents but the Bible says honor mother honor your father and your mother praise the Lord glory be to God because sometimes we think that we we are smarter you know how to operate the iPhone your father don't know how to do it so now you think you are smarter praise the Lord but you see God made a provision here for a try it is the reason of the son but Abraham said the baptism of the Holy Ghost break us from that curse but God honored his Lord year that's making a provision now many of us have believed in parents some of our parents are not believers some of our parents don't have the same conviction that we have but how many times church has turned family against himself breaking that law of God you are turning yourself over to the curse praise the Lord Hallelujah and I'll say to you young people young sisters no matter how much you love that boy like the stars of Heaven to realize you had a boy in your life you had a man in your life that was your daddy no matter how poor he is if that boy cannot respect your father you are not going down the right rule I don't care how much gold and diamond he promised you praise the Lord if your parents don't believe the message you must live the life live your life be a man I understand the mystery but they will respect your love live the life that will convince them it's a problem because we are in a millennial generation because you're we are in a tech generation that Lord of God was written before your technology if you really love you he will love and respect your parents they raise you up they send you to school praise the Lord the boy your first dress before now he's seeing you to be praying where was he sorry I don't know how I got down this road brother random share here in adoption he said where the church Apes now this is my purpose of preaching this I can stand behind brother Branham and say I'm having the same purpose this is my purpose of preaching this the church is always trying to take somebody else's Corner we always want to be like somebody always copycat be yourself [Music] be yourself and appreciate your humble beginning if you were not born with well done I like you high wealth don't I like you how well because you're making ten dollars an hour appreciate your humble beginning that was this that was the song where you were sought in the lady appreciate the mark if they appreciate the Marty appreciate their poor condition and because they appreciate it it comes out like praise the Lord watch all of these television and all of these mothers those people they are having heartbreak right they can't keep relationships praise the Lord they cannot keep relationships they're they're married and then that's not their own Opera to get a new husband and all of that and that's the people you want to inspire your life after Ruth has to glean in the field one thing that pleased her the Naomi was so uh generous to allow her to come to this Lane the culture is not like her culture that she knows the people don't dress like the way that she knows she loved her praise the Lord glory be to God for the mother of father and the more abide she will not even having in her mind already knowing the way that the Jews there with the mohabbat god of the Heaven and Earth kept the prince of the Harvest almighty God kept the lord of the Hobbies Boaz the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never raise corn in Ephraim Connor if you are Mana self you have got to take your place in Christ praise the Lord not in your Tribal Spirit or your National Spirit you have to find your place in Christ the word the word if you were ever serve the purpose of why God allow you to breathe the Breath of Life find your place so as you would just be a Wandering Star trying to be like this trying to be like that and at the end you don't even know who you are see Canada did not represent the great Heaven because because it's War the trouble and the killing fighting and so forth but it didn't represent this that it must be a perfect walk God was watching the award that's the reason why he ordered their steps name Canada land was all about their work their behavior their behavior that's what matters you gotta be salty so others can get thirsty you gotta be salty don't create a better a dark atmosphere around you no space of light because they came they came it's not the clothes you put on it's the thing that you have in your spirit is the thing you have in your spirit that make your surrounding darker that's where the church is feeling today on that walk that's where the church is feeling today on the behavior of the people the trust that goes through their mind the feeling that is in their heart come to the Church of the Living God and then we go home with hurts and bitterness Darkness fill in our spirit even when you are alone you are angry that's where the church is filling that's where you are feeling as a Son of God that's where you are feeling as a daughter of God let the light of God breathe through you let God's light shine in you so you can be able to give somebody a hope [Music] that's where the church is feeling today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior your behavior not somebody else's Behavior your behavior can we say my behavior [Music] my behavior Preacher Man my behavior even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You believer can cause this church to mentally feel and if you cannot bring the church to Phil you will cause your family to fail praise the Lord amen if your family is telling on the word you can bring them to fail you will bring yourself to a wretch your misbehavior of unconfessing us your life to glory to God because if you go back to the Book of Joshua you will see that when Joshua called the house of Israel he called them by tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken he called them by family and the family of Akon's father was taking he called them by homes in Aiken house was taken praise the Lord amen he was the one that stole the babylonigame and hit it in his house why would God destroy him and his wife and his children because the wife saw it and she never said anything praise the Lord to Sapphire the men that have taken your husband away they wait for day why because both of them sat down make their plan to lie against a lie to the Holy Ghost you are not forced to do it praise the Lord with your contribution will find your contribution the church the Church of the Living God the work of God will stay go on there are a lot of work of God going on around the world that's the thing that is bringing people to Iraq I was born in the message that does not have nothing to do with that you need to be born of this Incorruptible seed which is the word of God or S is just a matter of time just a matter of time we'll be reading your posts on Facebook are we together we have hung around this mountain too long people it's either we get to business to serve God or we forget about it praise the Lord amen there is one person that need to be pleased in this building is almighty God Hallelujah getting all of this attitude and we kill the life of the church because while we sit back we just complain and complain and this thing your brother than this thing and not not even having the grace to go and and sit down with a sister and say sister can I talk to you better man said do that he said we before you get it from there you will realize how much you are the one that needed God how much that you have missed on us too thank you praise the Lord I just have to lay this thing down I'm not an evangelist Joshua after he crossed into the land God gave him the promise to fight an entire campaign without losing the man just like I said uh last Sunday was that Sunday or Wednesday night praise the Lord do you know what it would be if God can just help us as a church weather it is Wednesday night or Sunday morning it will make no difference we are all in the house of God and we want to see God moving praise the Lord we rather hard there will not be a national Revival but I still believe that the world can stir us up I still believe that the world can revive us [Music] foreign campaign without losing the man without getting the stretch without having to fight uh having to have a nurse or the first aid God said the lane is yours go fight think of fighting a campaign and there is no Red Cross around at all there's nobody going to get hurt praise the Lord but if there is one place in the word where people are hurt is in church hurt of mistrust heard of deception in church take advantage of others when this is the place where we must have Honorable Men people that can keep their word people that tie their character to their name but go to the churches praise the Lord even in the business world in the business world you're having you're having men Christmas men that God has blessed but they always try to keep their faith behind why because as soon as people find that they are Christian the next thing they want to find the church that it goes to and when it goes to that church it says well we are in the same church can you please help me with this this just to Rob them Paul says lie now one on to another amen praise the Lord you sit back I said pastor you know some of the DRS need among the people you are saying oh God oh God you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord you see the knees among the people what is the dearest lady say oh God I believe that God you open the rare seed I believe that you can you can get through this situation you can have this brother through this you can have this sister through this and you know that is not because you are you are wrongly preaching or you have some kind of a false Doctrine honor your slaves if you find one bring it we sit down and talk about it I mean I want to be saved but then you see the people press the Lord when our needs must be happiness to run into the presence of God the most needed we become the most we go away from the presence of God we get swamped up and overcome but I will need praise the Lord amen I hope you take this in a good sense like I said I'm not on a wish home to you amen I'm preaching the word of God because I'm dealing with a spirit praise the Lord I believe that God is still having the New Testament Church praise the Lord I believe that we still have a New Testament Church Place word the presence of God is fair we're the word of God is having an impact in the lives of the people now motivation of speaking for the word of God because Broadband says when you come pray up preacher is pray up we are bound to a year from heaven then we know that heaven will speak to us and man can lay on his face lay on this carpet and lay down and said God move in our mess but when you get the people fussing at home disrespecting one another at home foreign I really want to preach now I don't have time praise the Lord amen I was just going all around the corner to come to next this is now when I really want to preach praise the Lord amen you're always taking me through the long route but that's okay that's okay we still have more time yeah yeah you love the Lord will let you go down fading the Son of God brother Brandon said for he for he's born of the spirit of God and the seed of God remaineth in him and he will have no desire to do that the Bible says the worshiper wants parts has no more conscience or no more desire to sin if you still have the desire you are you have haven't been pushed yet that's just one thing sure see if you will still have a desire in your heart to go out and lost just remember my friends you need to come back to God back to the altar for we are sword with The Incorruptible seed of God praise the Lord amen an ordinary say it's a grain of wheat one perish if it is in the right kind of a ground how much more about the seed of God that is receive faith if you don't take an attitude on receiving the word of God and you can just relax and say be it unto me Lord and calling to your word praise the Lord be with my heart changed my life for him without himself for every believer I believe every Christian that's born again has got to go to those tests every son that comes to God must first be chest in parts is that right if you cannot stand ing of the Lord then you become a bachelor or an illegitimate child you claim God to be your father and you know nothing about him because God trained his children God's children are not loose they are not loose they are disciplines
