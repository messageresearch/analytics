never forget of all of his goodness praise the lord thank you musicians let's take our bibles tonight in the book of hebrew praise the lord in the book of hebrew we started reading it on sunday about a priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we want to go back to there tonight amen i want to go right back to that tonight that would be hebrew chapter four that was where we started from chapter four let's start from verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens we have to realize that before he went into the heavens he stood between heaven and the earth amen and he was standing between a living god and a dying humanity praise the lord seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have met and high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all point tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come bowling praise the lord that's the reason why we cannot be shy of our sin we cannot be uh you know we cannot hide we must come bolly we must come open line in another sense amen we must be open about it because he knows praise the lord the more we become open the better he can help us because he knows about it amen so uh i mean you've been shot about it you are only keeping uh an element of that weakness in your flesh but when you are open about it you know uh uh you know that's that just how to deal with that devil amen let us let us uh therefore come boldly onto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need chapter 5 verse 1 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for man intense pertaining to god for every high priest taking whether it was the sons of levite whether it was the sons of aaron whether it was the sons of finney heist or all the others high priests that were that i've ever served every high priest taken from a more man is ordained for men in the things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant or on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmities praise the lord amen so the high priest is just as in need as you are in need praise the lord that's what paul is establishing here we have a high priest that can be touched with our infirmities but every high priest that is taken from a more man for the service of god the things pertaining to god he's not like that high praise that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he himself he have infirmities praise the lord i cannot be touched by the feeling of your infirmities i don't know what you're doing i don't know what's going on with you until you tell me are we together let's read a little bit amen and by reason year of he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins amen and no man taking this honor unto himself but he that is call of god as was aaron praise the lord let us pray tonight heavenly father almighty god and what what a calling lord the lord we will be able to stand lord in the place for aaron lord god he knew he had a word from the prophet moses when you told him to tell his brother aaron to self in the priest's office father lord for finney house he had a word lord god but uh many of us lord and by faith oh god or fear calling to this office but lord we can never measure up with god to those men that lord jesus were called directly by an angel called father lord by the instruction of a prophet so lord we just want to pray and ask the lord you will come in and bless us tonight as we take your word in and fellowship we want to thank you for this opportunity lord gab father we just appreciate you for what you are doing in our lives so god appreciate you for what you are doing lord father in this uh little local assembly and and the people lord that are committed to this place we want to just ask the father you will help each and every one of us lord even though god does once lord father because of this things that can be with us tonight father lord we will pray for many of them lord jesus that you will bless them too we love you we appreciate you father god in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen hallelujah amen you happy to be here tonight amen amen amen we want to thank the lord for a wonderful service on on sunday and uh and also thank the lord tonight we want to continue in a lot of that talk that we spoke on on sunday but tonight we want to talk about as we read from the scripture year uh a high priest that can be touched with with our feelings he can be touched by our feelings he can be touched with our feelings by our feelings praise the lord he's he's different praise the lord he's the very creator of feelings amen he's different i this this particular bible verse stays in my mind because many years ago i can remember now that would be somewhere in the 90s i had one young brother there was that was oh my goodness this young brother he will he would throw questions to me like somebody is throwing oranges and one time he came and asked me the question and says uh uh berwana uh i gets confused here on this on this verse the bible is saying that for we have met on high priest which cannot be touched i think it was the net we have met and high priest throw him off in understanding that jesus cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities so we had a good uh one-on-one bible study on that so it's kind of a stick out to me uh just from that experience with that young brother praise the lord praise the lord but tonight we want to just look into this thought we'll go back a little bit and uh uh if you if you read a book of hebrew you study the book of hebrew and also you go and study a hebrew exposition you will realize that just like we said for some reason some reason because the apostle paul i hope one of these days i can be able to to just take you through the scripture from from the time paul was convicted in in in through the writing of his books so you'll be able to see some some beautiful things that sometimes slips our our view when we are reading but paul was never accepted by the by the jewish people uh the hebrew people the jewish people and because they felt like he he betrayed them so even uh uh [Music] you know even at the time word there was a prophecy from acaba for him not to go to jerusalem he stayed what determined to go to jerusalem or go to rome and he wanted to go through jerusalem we realized that every time he showed up in in the synagogues there was always a riot you know they would have to sneak him out they were they were there were people that were determined you know to end the life of paul because they felt like he he he betrayed the council the jewish council but uh uh we we als we are also glad that uh the lord kind of for change his path the lord there with him and uh and the lord used him in such a tremendous way to be able to bring us the new testament amen so we realized there were there were three men that were that were uh responsible for the for the word of the lord moses brought the the torah he brought the old testament to the to the children of israel and paul wrote the the new testament and then god promised by the by the ministry of an elijah prophet in malachi 4 that uh the the the mysteries will be revealed so uh both the old testament uh how one that was that wrote it the first five books every other books in the old testament is all surrounding the five books amen and in the new testament we realized that the ministry of grace was given to paul he actually wrote the new testament we know you know peter wrote his account we know the uh marty mark luke and john wrote their own account and all of that but uh the uh the gospel in the in uh in the new testament was written by paul it's strange that he says that god will judge this word by my gospel and which of course is the gospel the ministry of grace he was talking about now now and then you and myself we feel blessed to be able to be sitting on the uh the ministry of of of brother branham you know what god's god's prophet to this generation or this age because we we see that uh uh the fulfillment of re revealing the mysteries you know uh it was fulfilled in his ministry we that's that is that is a beautiful thing to look at you read the book of of dania you will realize that the angel told daniel to shut those things he was showing daniel he said shut it until the time of the end amen the angel says shut it till the time of the end and then also when it when it when uh uh uh uh jesus in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks were revealing the the time of the end of the future of the church to john but then it came a time also where he told john to shut those things up amen so just like he told daniel to shut those things he also told john to shut it the beautiful thing there is that when you look at the parallel you will realize just at that time he was giving uh dania the vision the injured there was an angel that appeared unto unto daniel amen a mighty angel michael a great angel yes in revelation 10 you realize also there was a mighty angel that also appeared unto john so you see the uh uh this are that uh things that uh you know that that i developed or uh uh you know that were that were coca uh somewhere else praise the lord i don't bother by the light amen let's hold the light down glory be to god amen praise the lord so uh uh uh you know so it's it's very beautiful it's very beautiful but as we just want to to to to keep us together tonight for the uh the the wednesday evening sacrifice before we get to talking let me just travel with you a little bit as we look in the book of hebrew year you realize that the book of hebrew just like we said paul had his identity because he was sending this to the to the jewish believers and with most of them that struggle you know with hearing about him you know uh uh you you can even imagine uh god had to reveal show gave ananias a vision and say ananias go and have paul you know for analyzing lord jesus you know that man you know how he killed the the christians you know so all of that and uh uh so uh [Music] in the book of romans paul also expressed his desire for his for his brethren this is the desire that i have for my brethren he was talking about the jews i wish that god would open their eyes the same way he have opened my eyes paul realized that the jehovah of the old testament was jesus christ praise the lord that that was the revelation when when he had that experience on the road of damascus and and and from that light says i am jesus [Music] whom you persecute that changed the life of paul it changed his life forever praise the lord so the scripture will let us to know that paul had to go in in the in the desert of arabia for three years for him to study the old testament and while he was there the holy spirit started dealing with him the holy spirit started taking him from genesis through all the old testament praise the lord so uh so as he went through that that's where he drew this inspiration for the for the book of hebrew so poor year in the book of hebrew now what he's going to do that i want you to catch and and go back take your time read the book of hebrew you will see it a different way paul is going to exalt jesus that's what he's doing in the book of hebrew he's exalting jesus above everything amen and it is troubling told to a jewish student because there were there were things that were very important to the jews you don't play with their prophet that's right amen the jews believe in angers which of course that was what made the sarah the the the pharisees different from the sadducees amen they believe in angels and the the jews they had a hiri guy for their temple they respected their sacrifice so you will see paul as he goes through the the entire episode of hebrew he's exalting jesus above every one of that right he absorbed jesus above the promises praise the lord i know it is it's the weather so uh we will we will not keep you long amen don't worry we'll be okay yeah i think i think we're in the safest place at the feet of jesus okay amen amen praise the lord now so so all of these things are happening here here in the book of hebrew that's where i want to grab your attention okay that's what i want us to to grab your attention and and and then you will then you will appreciate right you know you will appreciate as you study the book of hebrew you appreciate so paul goes ahead let me start here praise the lord we'll read this from hebrew chapter 2 that's that's that's actually from from a quote in hebrew chapter 2. so reading from hebrew exposition now praise the lord hebrew chapter 2 in the first chapter in the broadband i'm expressing this in the first chapter we find that it was exalting the lord jesus so he says here that uh paul was exalting the lord jesus and paul let us know the other night he's going through the series so i just i just took a few of these uh you know uh baiting pieces here and there just to be able to throw a note up so you'll be able to grab the thought of what we are going through tonight so he says in the first chapter paul started exalting the lord jesus chapter one hebrew chapter one let's read he says god who are saundra times in davao manum speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets amen so paul is is letting that those believers know that we believe in our prophets [Music] they will god must peace praise the lord amen he said brought half in in in these last days spoken unto us by his son he have appointed ears of all things so you see he put the prophets there but then he exhort the lord jesus above the prophets are we together [Music] amen are you seeing the picture then he goes down he says here in verse 4 chapter one which of course brother brahma says here also there in hebrew chapter two he says the other uh uh well let me see i think as i thought i said my notes up there well okay let's just go let's go ahead tonight so he says here in he says in in the first chapter we find that it was uh that it was uh uh exalting the lord jesus and paul let us know the other night that he was in the great beginning amen so as we look in in chapter one we we see how paul exulted jesus and also we we we're going to see something here uh okay have in this last day spoken to us spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed heroes of all things by whom also he made the words so so that's that is that is the talk that brother branham also is giving us here that paul you know we if we find him exalting uh the lord jesus in the beginning and paul led us to know the other night that he was in the beginning by him all things was made and he goes ahead again he says and we found out that he was nothing less than metisside the king of solomon that would show up over in chapter seven between chapter five and chapter seven of hebrew that were the story of matrices that would come but the reason why that would come up is because right in there paul is teaching of a better high priest amen his teaching even though we have the levitical priesthood as jews as us as as jewish believers god obeying aaron we have the aaronic priesthood which also linked with the levitica priesthood and by year paul now were used there between chapter 5 and 7 to show that there was a better priesthood and in that also he's exalting jesus now you have to realize that jesus himself said if i be lifted up i will draw all men that is that is just the secret to drawing man is just lift up jesus praise the lord just lift him up and then he says also and evie may the angels worship him let's see there in the scripture verse four let's drop will not be able to go through the entire book of hebrew tonight neither i'm not preaching on the book of hebrew being made so much better that's the word you will come you will find over and over you remember the statement uh uh uh we come under use it it's a statement that's that talks about the blood of ebay speak better so you will always find that language better he keep using it a better high priest a better promise a better rest it's a word that he used continuously amen he said being made so much better than the angels as he have by inheritance obtain more excellent name than day who was he talking about jesus praise the lord who was he talking about class please answer me praise the lord be made so much better than the angels as he have by uh inheritance altina more excellent name than they for unto which of the angels say he at any time thou are my son this day have i begotten thee amen he never said that to none of the angels okay praise the lord now this is where i want to grab you now verse 6. and again when he bringeth in their first begotten into the word what was the first begotten the logos amen when he bring the first begotten into the word he said and let all the angels of god worship him that was when god became god because god is not a he's not god until he having subject to worship him because god is an object of worship are we together so we see here that uh uh all he was doing he was just exalting jesus so he assaulted him in the beginning he assaulted him over the prophets he assaulted him over the angels he there poured there with that seriously because he he he had to bring because uh uh uh to the jewish faith that these things were very important they were very very very important they believe in their prophets they believe in angels you read from the scripture it was it was angers that deliver the ten commandments to moses praise the lord so the jews believe in there now so you come over to uh uh you come over to to chapter two you know he's he's he's making uh emphasis on that so just just so we can speed up and get to where we want to get tonight i just i just use that to be able to give you an idea of what uh we will we we will be looking at there are a few scriptures there that are that are standing in my face but let me go to what i want to talk about tonight so he's he's talking about uh uh so he exalted jesus above the prophets above the angels above the priesthood he says we in jesus we have a better covenant praise the lord in jesus we have a better promise in jesus we have a better rest because he said if if if the rest that he gave the sabbath rest amen if it was enough for the people he would not have promised them another day so because he gave them a promise of another day which means there is a better rest onto the people of god are we together so he's exalting jesus here in in every way i want to make sure that i'm not i'm not uh i'm not missing anything here in this beginning are we together praise the lord now so as we look at this the reason why i'm saying this is because when we come to talking about the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities this high priest that high priest he's not he's not a uh uh like uh uh the the priests in the in the in the tabernacle it's not like the old testament high priests so paul is uh trying to establish a thought here that because god has given us a better covenant and and uh you know a better promise and all of that and even there was a better blood that speak better things than the blood of abed amen so uh he he's talking here that also he has given us a high priest that have passed into the heaven jesus the son of god and this high priest he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities praise the lord amen because he make an intercession for us he says your high priest you have the local ones the one that god has ordained and more men to save you in the things of god they also have infirmities that's the reason why when they go to offer same for the people they also have to offer sin for themselves because they they also have infirmities they have weaknesses they have limitations but the better high priest we have he have no limitations praise the lord and when he and when he offered himself as a sacrifice it was not for himself it was for the people are we together now so establishing this thought is is to bring us to this place because if if you don't if you don't balance the the types and shadow you will you will run into water and you get drowned praise the lord you'll run into places and then you will drown yourself and and then you will you will create it will create a lot of confusion in your mind because sometimes people think that uh uh you know all of those things that god gives us a shadow and and uh speaking about the better high priest he's the chief shepherd amen he's the great shepherd he's the good shepherd praise the lord when this church was named good shepherd i don't think they were thinking about me they were thinking about him because he's the good shepherd now so i said that because this gone sunday we were dealing with standing between the living and the dead but the inspiration was more on feelings praise the lord amen it was more on feelings but i will come tonight again and and i will read something from hebrew chapter three uh there's there's uh that's from the message hebrew exposition brother branham who says something this this my mic keep falling and pulling my ear off it looks like i gotta pull a lot of it off tonight i think maybe my vest is the one that is uh or something is pulling it down okay so what what i want to take now tonight brother brandon is going to tell us a story about uh uh uh rosetta rosella was a young woman that was caught up in drugs and and she was i mean she was known as a drug addict there was there was just no no i mean she went from one treatment house to another treatment house and she got completely delivered on the brother brandon ministry praise the lord she got completely delivered from drugs and then brother branham is going to tell a little story about her yet when she when she got delivered her mother was a praying woman her mother was always praying for her and just like we were saying on sunday uh my mothers never never lost feelings for their baby you know we had all the same uh a parabola all saying the parents are all people say there is no bad bush for the child you know mothers don't have babush [Music] praise the lord meaning that they can never throw their child away no matter how bad they are so her mother were always praying for her and believing that god would have done something for her it was uh you know uh there's a testimony on there uh but when when she got safe it affected her so much to see this woman that could not go at night without drugs to see that she had no desire hallelujah she was so touched by this until she wanted to go on the street and and she wanted to stand right in the highway and tell everybody about jesus praise the lord and she was not going to argue about water baptizing or she was not going to argue about trinity or what doctrine you believe or she was going to tell you that i was one a drug addict and jesus changed my life and jesus delivered me that was the only message she had praise the lord now so brother branham is going to talk about heart a little bit i'm yeah i'll just pick up something there as we go along tonight he says and to see a lovely little lady like rosetta and just seizing and now she's very respectable she got fee a call in her heart but knowing the bible about woman preachers see she know is something else now because of what jesus have done in her life she's having this feeling to go and tell everybody about jesus but yet she also know in the scripture the place of a woman amen now watch this now that's where we we we're going to wrap this whole thing around around this thought tonight but knowing the bible about about women preachers see she knows it was something else and god is leading her into jails and things to give testimony it's just wonderful to know to seek after the will of god sometimes we have a feeling but we want to carry that feeling into places if you don't watch the devil will take that feeling and pervert it into something but as long as we stay with the bible as long as we stay with the word of god what does that mean it means that the word of god creates boundaries to govern our feelings praise the lord the word of god create boundaries when god created right in the beginning not only our feelings everything that god created he also created boundaries let the sun shine by day and the moon by night they knew their boundaries let the water come this far praise the lord so when we talk about feelings not losing feelings it's not a feeling that just flow around like a floor that is going to take the entire city that because you should have feeling you should just have feelings if feelings does not have boundaries it becomes destructive are we together if feelings do not have boundaries so when we talk about uh uh uh you know uh uh moses losing the feeling of the people i mean it was it was not you know uh uh uh it was a sense of the fact that everything that he was doing trying to bring them in in understanding the commission that he had they were not seeing it they were all about oh we don't have food to eat today all the water is bitter oh where is the garlic of egypt that was the thing he was they were trying to drag him back into into their senseless feelings for the garlic and and all the fleshly thing when the thing he was trying to point them to was the promise of god i praise the lord just as much as god want us to have feelings for his people amen it's not the feelings to be able to make you to catch up with what is on youtube and make you to catch up with what is what is uh that is is to bring you in the place of the word of god for the hour the word of god for the hour praise the lord because sometimes we have feelings it's a sense of our body praise the lord in a way our spirit reacts to it is through our emotions praise the lord but you see almighty god create a boundary praise the lord to be able to keep us protected to keep us safe as parents we have feelings for our children but yet god gave us boundary praise lord it could be your child and if you don't keep that hundred that loving emotion will turn to an abuse as your pastor i should have feelings for you but god help me to know my boundaries praise the lord god help me to know my boundaries i'm not the high priest that is touched by the feelings of your infirmities i don't know what you are going through if you don't tell me i don't know i don't know and sometimes it's a good thing that i don't know because it gives me the liberty to be able to stay behind that word and preach as humans when i know i struggle sometimes because i will now want to to to to to abuse that you trust me with uh things that you are going through and then i use the pulpit to come at you no if i speak about it you might just know that you know it's it's it was not directly at you it was because the holy spirit wanted it to be a blessing but why am i saying this you see because in the message i don't know why i never thought about this it came across my mind but why i never thought about it by any message how can i overcome that's the only message where brother branham used a passing statement where he says your pastor is your spiritual husband it was a passing statement he was talking about lot and his wife and and and that statement has uh you know uh it has been a blessing to many people and also it has been a statement where people have used in in different different ways praise the lord paul says i mean peter says there in the book of acts he says choose you seven men so they can't so they can be able to attend to your effects and we can give ourselves to praying and to fasting and to study the word of god praise the lord my job is not to show up at every baby birthday party show up every you know baby shower show up on average you know if if the time is there to do it okay thank you and uh uh it's it's uh you know if the time is there you know and and fellowship you know well uh i mean it's not i mean after every service you know bring everybody you know uh let's let's go over to the to the you know to the beach and you know you got to spend time with your pastor and all of those kind of kind of things well i'm sorry i'm not caught that way i'm not caught that way praise the lord because when feelings are not guided the nation had just went through i've i've been i've been putting some things together especially for for the young people and uh um i'm trusting that uh by june next month we should bring it to you uh uh you know with all of these uh weddings that are popping up i would like to uh take some time in and and talk to you on how uh i think as a church year uh we should approach those things amen and uh yeah we just went through i try to close right now this weather has been hanging all through the day even at work there were you know alarm going on of of the weather being being awful and it looks like the devil just kept it to wait for us in service tonight praise the lord amen so we just found a place to close here then we can continue another time but we just went through the entire nation was put on a standstill just because a very nice person crossed the boundaries of their feelings a very professional woman that had worked as a corrections officer for 17 years giving an authority by the country trusted second-in-command to that facility because she allow her feelings to cross the boundary that was given to her she's lying in the mall right right dead she allow her feelings everything she has worked for she was just about to retire because she kept hanging around the wrong person and created a feeling for a killer so it's not just oh i feel for this person or i feed for that person your feeling must be gathered by the word of god it must stay in the confound of the word of god or else it will not be a blessing to you neither a blessing to that person amen it must stay in the confines of god's word right i read this to you and then we bought our heads to pray sometimes we have a feeling but we want to carry that feeling into places if you don't watch the devil will take that feeling and pervert it into something but as long as you stay in the bible as long as you stay with the word praise the lord right you think about it brother branham says uh uh uh great about you ever thought sit on god eve by her reasoning yes but it was the same thing she was never taught to be careful adam never told her you got to be careful yeah you got she was never taught to be careful she loved all the animals the same praise the lord the only person that can be touched you might be going through something and when you share it with me i can i can tell you i know what you're going through i'm trying to put myself in your shoes but it's not like when our lord jesus christ is touched amen he knows how every nails in your body is pulling he knows how every cell in your body is moving i don't know about that i can just be compassionate and try to process in my mind how did this happen how did you get here what's going on why you never told me not i can do all of that just to be able to put myself in a place where i can be able to to to be blessed by god to help you praise the lord but if you're going through something and you're dead and says well you know i've been going through this two months now the pastor has not called me how do you expect me to know right yeah exactly how you expect me to know praise the lord well we will try to continue with this thought as we we fellowship on this praying that the lord will use it to be able to bless us i have to realize that the scriptures say god is not in favor of false balance he told us we must never remove the ancient landmark right all of those things are idioms placing the word of god to guide us let's buy our house together tonight reach out and touch the
