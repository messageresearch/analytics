========================================

[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] 6,000 years or six days that God built the earth. Now, it took God 6,000 years to establish it, plant it with good seeds, and to bring forth everything after its kind. Everything must come forth of its kind. all his seeds were good and so it must spring forth after its kind. God took 6,000 years. Finally, when he got it all made and finally we uh finally arrived with its headquarters of the earth in a beautiful spot laying east of Eden called the Garden of Eden. God made the world's headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt. Right at the east end of the garden was the headquarters and over the whole situation, he put his son and his son's wife over all of it. &gt;&gt; Right? It's what God did. He put them in full control. They could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow. They would speak to the tree and it would move from here to there. The lion and the wolf fed together and the lamb laid down with them. There was no evil. It was perfect peace, perfect harmony, everything in perfection. And when God had it under his control, and it notice, he had his he had his world, he had all in operation, he had everything coming, everything eaten, vegetation, nothing to die, nothing to be ruined, nothing to be spoiled, nothing. It was just perfect. And over it all he placed his beloved children, his son and his daughter, a husband and wife to control it. God was so satisfied and he rested from all his works at the seventh day and hallowed this seventh day Sabbath for it because God looked it all over actually been 6,000 years and molding it and fixing it out making it come into existence and put the mountains up and make the volcanics pushed the mountains up and the things that taken place in the eruptions dried it off and fixed it the way you had it and it was a beautiful place. There was nothing like it. the great paradises of God, the great dinosaurs and whatever more crawling through it and of the great animals. No harm in them. They were just as gentle as a little kitten. They had nothing at all. No, no sickness, no sorrow, not one disease germ on the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a place. The great bird swinging from tree to tree. And Adam could call him by name and they'd fly up on his shoulders and and coup to him and uh oh what a wonderful place God had and then made one of his attributes from his own body. God has attributes in his body like you are an attribute of your father and you notice you was in your grandfather's grandfather's grandfathers but in that say we'll take it down to like you and your father now you did not know anything when you were in your father the germ of life comes from the male the male has the blood cell the woman has the the Now therefore the blood cell has the life in it. And then when you were in your father you actually know nothing about it but yet science and God's word proves that you were in your father but you know nothing about it. But then the father long to know you and with the union of connection with mother then you were made known to father. Now you are your father's attribute. You look like him and you got parts of your body that looks like your father. Now that's the way God was in the beginning. Every son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning. You don't remember it now, but you were there. He noticed &gt;&gt; and he wanted you to become so he could contact you, speak with you, and love you and shake your hands. Don't you want your own boy? Isn't it a great day when you're a boy and can come home and set out at the table? When he comes back from the battlefield or something, another scarred up. How you fix the dinner, you kill a fatted calf or whatever more and prepare for him. It's your own flesh and blood &gt;&gt; and he was in you. You didn't know him then, but you knew he was there. And so God knew that we would be here, &gt;&gt; but then he put us in the flesh so we'd be contacted. an order he could contact. He become one of us &gt;&gt; when he become Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God. Therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship. When I was in my father I knew nothing about it. But when I become his son and was born of him I was an attribute a part of my father and you are a part of your father. And as children of God, we are a part of God's attribute that was in him, made flesh like he was made flesh. So we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the earth. That was God's purpose at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the beginning. He had everything under control and he turned man over into the Garden of Eden on free of all ages. He say, "Son, it's yours." What a beautiful place. God was so satisfied that he just went back and rested from all of his works. Every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles. No berries ever come off of a thorn tree. Everything was perfect. All seeds were perfect. Everything was in perfect condition. Then when he went to take a little rest, his enemy slipped in with the seat and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he put trust in his own child as you put trust in your daughter when she goes out at night with a man. When you put trust in your son when he has to go with a drinking boy or smoking boy. See, he put trust in his son that he would not do anything wrong and would keep every word that he said. But the enemies slipped in like that greasy slicker that would take out your daughter and misbehave himself or or some woman would take go out with your son and the same thing. See, he slipped in. The enemy of God slipped in and misinterpreted the word to Eve. Now, he by this fall, it has took over and possessed the Garden of Eden himself. He took it over and now he has had 6,000 years of deceitful rule. &gt;&gt; Amen. deceiving the people, God's children, as he did then, because they were based on free moral agency to act any way they wish to and believing if they would act right or trusting they would act right, then they come with the wrong act and sold their birthrights as Esau did for the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Satan won it. And he took it over. And he's had 6,000 years to build up his Eden as God had 6,000 years to bring his Eden to a close. And by deceit, the seed of the word of the people now established his own Eden in this earth in sin. God's Eden was established in righteousness. Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin. &gt;&gt; God is righteousness. &gt;&gt; God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life. And Satan's establishment is in sin &gt;&gt; and religious sin. &gt;&gt; Know how he deceived deception as he said he would. He promised to do this. Did anybody know that? Let us turn to Isaiah if you want some of these scriptures. If you I ought to quote more of my guests. Let's turn to Isaiah the 14th chapter. Just a moment. Let's see what Satan said here just a moment. And Isaiah 14, we'll read it and watch what this fellow done. Isaiah 14, beginning with the 12th verse. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation? For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars, that's sons, stars of God, and I will set also upon the mount of the congregation, the side of the north. Now I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the most high. Now compare that over here with our other scriptures over in Thessalonians a while ago how he said he sits in the temple of God exalting himself above all is called God so that he as God is worshiped as God upon the earth. There's the God of this world that I preached to you about last Sunday. Here he is today in deceit. that treacherous hour, that tremendous time that we're living. It's the most glorious time of all the ages because we're facing the great millennium again. We're facing the Eden again. But right at this age, all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with, he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself and come down like God and put himself in place of God, religious, and can quote the scripture and can tell you scripture just as Satan did to Eve in the Garden of Eden, but leave out one spot of it. It's all he has to do. make that gap where the poison doctrine of the devil could pour through like the thinking man's filter we was talking about the other night. &gt;&gt; Now he said he would exalt himself above the most high. He would ascend above the clouds of the stars and he would sat there like God and be above the most high. And he has succeeded in carrying out his threats. He has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age. &gt;&gt; That's exactly how he's done it. Never age he explained it away. In the days of Noah, he explained that it was impossible for it to rain from heaven for there's no rain up there. Great scientific gospel that he preached in the Garden of Eden. He could shoot the instruments to the moon and prove there's no moisture up there. &gt;&gt; But God said there would come a rain. &gt;&gt; But Satan succeeded and poison the mind of the people by scientific research that it could not be done. But it was done. God said it would be done and it was done. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now in the days of uh of Jesus, he did the same thing. He poisoned their minds again by deceit. see misinterpreting the word. If thou be the son of God, now let me see you do something about it. Jesus didn't clown for him. He never did. God's not a clown. He don't have to answer anything as Satan asked. He only had Jesus said, "It is written, thou shalt not live, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." He didn't have to clown from him. He didn't have to make bread. He could have done it, but he'd been listening to the devil, so he didn't have to listen to the devil. And again, it is a religious sin as at the beginning. So deceitful. Watch it now. It's not just purely old everyday sin, committing adultery and getting drunk and using God's name in vain. That's not it. &gt;&gt; No. You remember years ago, many of you hear the old-timers. Remember that sermon I preached on the disappointments of judgment? &gt;&gt; The harlot, she ain't going to be disappointed there. She knows where she's going. The drunkard ain't going to be disappointed there. the bootlegger, the gambler, the liar, the thief, he's not going to be disappointed. But that man who thinks he's right, &gt;&gt; there's the disappointment. &gt;&gt; That's that fellow said, "Come say,"Lord, haven't I preached the gospel? Have not I cast out devils in thy name?" Jesus said, "Depart from you, from me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you." There's the disappointment. See, that deceitfulness, that's what I'm constantly, that's where I'm so misunderstood. It's not that I want to be different. I don't want to be different. But I've got to be honest. &gt;&gt; I have a message and that must go to the people. Makes it very much misunderstood amongst the people. They think I'm against everybody. They only know I'm for everybody and trying my best to bring them what's the truth just as it's laid on my heart and the way it's laid in the Bible here. And God proves that to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing else can be done about it. So me either look at it or they don't. See, they don't want to see it because they have already sold out, &gt;&gt; sold their birth rights to some organization, some denomination to try their birth rights to get to heaven upon the basis of some organized religion, which Satan is ahead of every bit of it. &gt;&gt; God never did have an organized religion. &gt;&gt; Never did. And they sell out to that where they a bunch of man interpret the word and say it means this and it means that. God needs no interpreter. He does his own interpreting. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need anyone else to tell him how to do it. He's sovereign. He said how he would do it. And that's why he must keep his word. &gt;&gt; When he said these signs shall follow them that believe, he meant just that. &gt;&gt; Whatever he said would take place, he said it would happen in these last days that he would do certain things and he done it. &gt;&gt; He has to ask nobody whether it's time or not. He knows what the time is, what the plan is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan, this deceiver as spoke of in Matthew 24:24 was so much deceit. Now, we find that by his gospel programs of knowledge, better education, higher ethics, civilization, and so forth has bewitched. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people that wants to serve God into believing his lie. Eve did not want to do that. But he showed her how it was more wisdom in it. &gt;&gt; She didn't know. She wanted to know. She didn't understand. But she wanted to understand. And God told her not to try to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can I understand any of these things? I cannot understand them. I believe them. I don't have to understand them. God is faith and not understanding. &gt;&gt; We just believe what he said. Now compare God's Eden to Satan's now after 6,000 years of perverting of the true interpretation of God's promised word to the age. Let's compare it now and see where we get like he did to the church in Christ time in Jesus trying to keep uh keep back uh God's loyal sons from knowing the truth. That's God's God put his son here his attributes to fellowship with him by hearing his word. &gt;&gt; What if your father told you and you are a loyal son to your father and he told you son don't you go in that water out there swimming because he's gators in that water and a fellow comes back says surely such pretty water is that there's no gators in it. who you going to listen to. If you're a genuine son, you listen to your daddy. &gt;&gt; And a genuine son or daughter of God takes God's word first. I don't care what anybody else says about it. They take God's word first. &gt;&gt; Poison in the cup &gt;&gt; and they believe it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Having faith in all his word, his seeds brought a Eden of holiness, love, and eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's what God's eating produced. holiness and &gt;&gt; it brought a Eden of holiness, of love, understanding, perfection, and eternal life. That's what God's planning, his word, his seed. That's what his church will be at the end. It'll be the same thing. &gt;&gt; Notice here's a thought. Don't forget it. I'll get to it some other time or some other message. But you know, God said, "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." Is that God's commandment? &gt;&gt; Now, what good is any preacher or anybody else trying to make that word say something else? &gt;&gt; See, every word of God is a seed. Jesus said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A seed of sore. So, so if Mark 16 is God's word, it'll bring forth of its kind. If Malachi 4 is God's word, it'll bring forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; And every other promise must bring forth of its kind. You see, see Satan out here in disguisement. He's trying to say it not. It's not so. &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Satan say, "Oh, that ain't for this day. That that that's some other time. That don't even mean that." Every seed must come forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; That's how God establishes Eden. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here it is. That's how God establishes his church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every word after its kind. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; See, Satan, he'll take something else. But God said, every seed after its kind, &gt;&gt; if the promise said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." Now, the church says, "Join the church, recite the creed, know the catechism." There's not such things in the whole Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. In my name, they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; If they take up serpents or drink deadly things, it won't harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." &gt;&gt; Who is any man to deny that? &gt;&gt; See, every seed will bring forth of its kind. If you are a seed of God, an attribute, a son of God, then the word of God is sown in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and then when you hear the word of God, my sheep hear my voice, a stranger, they won't follow. You get it? Then every seed comes forth after its own kind. Now we find out that every seed bringing forth of its kind, there was no death in the new in that Eden. There will be no death in the new Eden. &gt;&gt; There was no nothing else but holiness, purity, and eternal life. Now by unbelief and all of God's word has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; We are now entering in where Satan is taking the throne as the antichrist in a a sin, &gt;&gt; perverted religion. &gt;&gt; He started not upon I am Satan. I am the great angel. No, not upon that, but upon perverting God's word. &gt;&gt; And that's how he's brought his kingdom in every age. And now in this great deceitful age, ready to take his throne by his people, &gt;&gt; he's built himself an intellectual educated scientific Eden, &gt;&gt; right? Scientific preachers, scientific church, scientific theology, everything is scientific. Everything's on basis of knowledge. The whole church is built upon knowledge. &gt;&gt; It ain't built up on faith. One time I went into hold a meeting to a man's church. It was a great auditorium in the west, a fine man. And he denied these things that we're talking about. He was I liked him. Fine man, old man. When his congregation went out, it seated about 6,000 people. When his congregation went out in the afternoon service, about 1500, they were all fine dressed intellectuals. I sat there and watched them. He preached a very good sermon. The man did. And then he asked if anybody wanted to accept Christ just to raise up their hands. And no one raised up their hands. And finally, a woman raised up her hands. He said, "All right, now you're a Christian." And made her for baptism. And then when he went out, he dedicated the baby, kissed the little baby and made a prayer over it and dismissed the audience. When his congregation went out, all fine, scholarly, educated people, then I stayed on the side to shake the man's hand and wishing God speak as he went out. And when I did, here come my crowd in. They couldn't let him in while his crowd is there. Here come mine in wheelchairs, stretchers, straight jackets, insane, and everything else. &gt;&gt; See the difference? That's it. That's the thing I'm talking about. See, it's something different. When by scientific knowledge, you can make an understanding gospel. You he that believeth on Jesus Christ shall not be condemned. See, but these signs shall follow them that believe. See, he fails to put that in there. See, she believeth on Jesus Christ. She's saved. If these signs follow the believer, &gt;&gt; and he that heareth my word, not just may not hear it with his ears, but understand it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anybody can hear it. A prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute. See, a drunker can hear it, a liar can hear it, and still remain a liar. But he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life. There you are. See, and no man can do that except God for orain him. Jesus said, "No man can come to me except my father draws him and all the father's given me will come to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all the sovereignty and fornowledge of God. He lives alone and nobody tells him what to do &gt;&gt; now by unbelief and though taking all the word of God has brought a seed of unbelief, unholy, sinful hatred and eternal death is in this sinful intellectual church age. Now you got it. And this day that when the whole world is religious, did you know that &gt;&gt; the whole world is religious? &gt;&gt; And in this religious age, big churches on every corner. Everything, the whole thing winds up in Satan being worshiped. Here it is right here in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. And in this intellectual theological seminary that's brought out an intellectual person that's been trained how to speak, what to do, how to make their emotions and everything like psychology three to four years to know how to deal with a man's mind. See, it's the spirit of God is not something that you is schooled into you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something that's predestinated into you by the hand of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you. It's predestinated by God's hand and God's forn knowledge into you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, they brought forth this great Eden that they now live in a church world's Eden. They're all uniting together now at the great ecumenical council and going to have the world church all coming under one head where Satan will be thrown just exactly. And the last call's going out to catch the bride before she gets into that. For once in that she's tucked the mark of the beast and doomed. &gt;&gt; She'll never come out of it. That's where he said, "Come out from among them, my people, before he goes into him." See, come out from among and be separated. Now, hatred and death and eternal separation from God in this Eden, lust, filth, perversion. How? by sewing the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; Reminds me of the vision I seen before I ever met the Pentecostal people of that man going around the world and white. You've heard me tell it many times. The one coming behind him sewing seeds of discord, but he wanted barely in Eve in the Garden of Eden by the lust of Eve for sin. The lust for Eve of sin. And if Eve lusted for knowledge, it was sin. And when we lust for knowledge, want a PhD LLD, it's sin to do so. &gt;&gt; That's strong statements, but that's the truth. &gt;&gt; No matter how strong it is, is still the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. the lust for knowledge, understanding. The thing of it is is today we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts. &gt;&gt; We're trying to establish ourselves. &gt;&gt; Churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart. &gt;&gt; We are commanded to establish the word of God. Paul said, "I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest upon the knowledge of man, but I come to you in power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God." &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Man must establish yourself. We find it amongst Let God do something first. [Music] [Music]
