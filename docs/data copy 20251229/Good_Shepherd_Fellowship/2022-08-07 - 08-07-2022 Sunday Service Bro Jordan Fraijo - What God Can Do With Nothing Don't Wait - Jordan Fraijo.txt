sing the final song and invite the pastor up a bit this morning and we have the offering backs at the back there for those who are coming lit as the service goes on you can go ahead and drop your offering and you're tight god bless you [Music] oh [Music] [Music] why are you [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] in the oh of the lamb [Music] is [Music] one more time [Music] is [Music] are they [Music] such a beautiful song you know we could just sing that song and go home if we pay attention to that song the whole you know that we sing that course over and over again it's asking are you washed in the blood of the lamb it's not you're not stating something but you're asking everyone around you and yourself a question have i been washed in the blood of the lamb have i been plunged beneath that flow where i've been made white as snow and you if you're paying attention to all those verses we get up to that last verse put that last verse for me real quick so i can read it if you have not been washed if you ask yourself the question this this song is a sermon in itself because it comes all the way to the end it takes you right to the cross it just let you know all you do is lay aside your garments that are stained with sin you don't have to keep them if you've asked yourself the question of course am i washed do i need that washing this morning you it says lay aside your garments and you can be washed because there's a fountain flowing for the so unclean and just be washed by the blood of the lamb that's all you need you see oh i love these songs these inspired songs so much every time saints when we get out of the rhythm of our religion and actually get into the inspiration of the word of the word that these songs were written in these are men inspired of god all these songs whether they're fast songs slow songs um their praise songs worship songs songs that that help you to take and reflect upon yourself this song's acting you reflect are you washed are you washed it's just not a nice song with a nice rhythm with the nice lyrics but it has a message something god laid upon someone's heart inspired to them said write this message in a song that many of people will sing it that many of people maybe they'll hear the tune and they'll go home and maybe even in that service it didn't strike them but later they'll go home and that tune will stay with them and somewhere a long way they'll be humming that song and all of a sudden it'll strike their heart am i washed because so i can lay aside my dirty garments right now i don't need to be in a church building i don't need to be with someone else i can lay them down right now and be warm in the blood of the lamb my goodness saints it's it's just beautiful it's beautiful i just want to get to give you uh greetings from brother juan he sent me a message this morning to send every all of you greetings there from zimbabwe i think i got a quick video and a picture he sent me i sent it to the back i don't know if we have that go ahead and just share it with you so we can all be a part of that you know i think that's important is brother random made that statement and i think we're going to follow up on that a little bit in the sermon he said if if you can't go he said send somebody you know we always think in this case brother brother one is on the other side of the world go ahead and play [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] i think the other one's just a picture of the same but but yeah you know he said if you can't go yourself he said send somebody or support he said support somebody and if that's some way you can do it financially or as the church we do that but even in your prayers in your prayers support them brother branham said the the reason the main success for his ministry said was those little prayer warriors back at home on their knees praying him through think about that we each and every one of us have a place and a part to play no matter how small or little you think you are or how little you have to contribute no matter how young no matter how old no matter how big or how small we have a part to contribute that will have an eternal effect on the lives of somebody brother branham said if those little prayer warriors or those who are able to give what they can give out of their talents their ability their finances whatever it is that you have that you can contribute to that he said for every soul that is saved from that ministry your name is attached to it eternally from here to the end of time you didn't have to be there you didn't have to be the one to preach the message you didn't have to be the one to uh lay hands on the sick you didn't have to be the one to stand in that icy cold river and baptize all those giving their lives to christ and yet your name is attached because you were a part of it because we're all part of a body and if you're supporting the body if you're a part of the lungs that helps bring in oxygen to the body that helps the legs move it doesn't matter that you're not the legs moving across the ground if you're a part of the the the heart that helps the body move what it needs around or whatever part you play and how big or small you're a part of that body and every success that is attributed to that body is attributed to you so we can all equally rejoice you know paul said that he said he said we we can if any part of the body does well we can rejoice with them and when you realize that you can connect you can see a little video like this from halfway across the country many of us may never meet a single person standing in that group but we have a connection that's stronger than any bond you'll ever meet on earth and that that's kind of what we're going to talk on this evening or this morning we got a couple of prayer requests it's just been a beautiful morning already we had a couple of testimonies of the greatness of our god uh how his his ability in power to save amen whether that's us from our life of sin it's us from danger it's us from our own stupidity whatever it is he's gonna he'll save us from that if we'll distrust him we've got a prayer request here it says dear saints of god kindly pray for me i'm having a lot of pain in my tooth i am scheduled for extraction of my truth please pray that this will go smoothly and the lord will be with the dentist from sister mary we want to keep her in prayer she goes before the dentist and then we have a praise report here we'd like to take time to thanking god for adding another year to my husband and best friend an eternal life partner today asking for all god's continued blessing and strength upon his life this day and always from our sister christian because you want to keep our brother in in prayer and just ask god's blessings upon his life and i know he's been such a great blessing to all of us if we can just raise him up in prayer as well and their family there let's just go before the lord heavenly father lord we just come before you once again this morning just for so thankful to be here in your presence father lord in the midst of your people father just gather together lord and lord supporting each other father lord bringing our little licks of fire together father that we could bring them to a blaze this morning father lord we're just so thankful for that we ask that you'd be with our sister mary father with this tooth pain father lord that you would be her strength father lord even now you'd believe her of all pain father and as you'd go before the dentist that they would have the wisdom and know the right thing to do whether whether that's the removal of the truth or if there's some other way father but that you would give them understanding in the wisdom and and just guide them father lord we want to thank you also for brother andrew father the the life he lives father and only just before his family father before this congregation and before your people father we ask you bless him mightily father lord just strengthen him lord we just lift him up before you this morning we thank you so much we give you all the honor the glory and the praise father the lord we ask you to be with us this morning father you just take full control this service father lord that you would just take control the speaker i myself father lord that it wouldn't be me speaking the lord i could surrender myself to you and you would speak through me to your people lord we ask you come down upon the hearer father open their ears to hear bring revelation to their heart father that even if it just be one word or maybe maybe they've already heard that word in song the father this morning already and you could just anoint that to their heart and meet their need this morning father lord we just dedicate ourselves all to you as a body holy and together this morning lord we just love you and we thank you we give you all the honor the glory and the praise in jesus name amen amen amen thank you musicians we just appreciate your ministry of music this morning if we go ahead and just we'll go straight into the scripture reading we'll start with matthew chapter 10 we're going to read verses 9 and 10 and then verses 16 through 20. it's just so wonderful and to be back here in the house of god with all of you this morning it's there's nothing like it saying that you can go to any other event you want whether it's a motivational speaker or your favorite sports team and yeah there will be an atmosphere and there'll be a charge you'll be happy for a moment but you'll never find real joy like there is when you gather together with the saints of like faith whether it's in a church service like this or you just get together with a brother or sister and fellowship around the word there's just such a presence and such a joy from that you can just you can live on that man let's just go ahead and read here matthew chapter 10 verse 9 provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purse nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat and we're skipping down to verse 16. behold i send you forth a sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you heavenly father lord we ask that you just come this morning and take this little reading of the word and just apply it to our hearts father take full control of the service we dedicate it to you in jesus name amen you may be seated i just want to take a a little thought this morning and i want to like to speak on what god can do with nothing and maybe with a sub title of don't wait don't wait okay and you know i was thinking about this and it was actually after the last wednesday night when i ministered here and the presence of the lord was just so beautiful and it was just amazing and that's nothing of myself it speaks more to all of you than anything the minister had to do with it but i was just thinking and on the goodness of god as i was going home and that's when this struck me it struck me so hard and just thinking about my own life and the the struggles and issues and things that i've had to overcome by his grace and by his mercy and i thought wow what god can do with nothing if we'll just turn over nothing to god he can do such miraculous things but so many so much of the time our problem is is that we think god needs something from us in order to for god to be successful you know and that's why we have this reading here in matthew matthew sent in matthew jesus is sending out his disciples and he's instructing them exactly what qualifications he wants them to have in order to serve him properly and what goods and services they should be taking with them and he starts out and he says well first of all don't take any gold right and in case you you're thinking well i just don't want you carrying large sums because that is dangerous don't take any silver either in case you're still stuck on that um don't take any brass in your purse like don't even take pennies nothing don't think that it's by your own wealth or your own ability your own influence what you can contribute is going to be of any use here so let's just leave that at home first of all he said then and i should have looked this word up because i i i'm sure it has a it means more than what i have here but nor script for your journey neither two coats don't don't take an extra coat he wanted them to to fly fast and easy and and hardly even put anything in their carry-on like don't take an extra coat neither shoes not a not an extra stave for the workmen is worthy of his meat and if you read the area in between there of course he talks about when you go into a city and and they they will provide for you but what he's saying is isn't that these individuals are going to provide you but he said as you do the work of god as you go out and you're doing the work of god with that intention and purpose in mind when you're going forth putting god first putting the kingdom of heaven first then all these things will be added to you now he doesn't tell you how much in abundance it'll be added to you at any one given time but he said you'll be taken care of you will be taken care of if you can move out by faith you see he said but what he's trying to drive in here is that if you're not moving by faith how can you preach a gospel of faith when you're not even living the faith that you're preaching so you before you go out and you want to share you have to at least be willing to step out on the same faith if you're asking someone to receive something of you or believe in something that you believe in you have to stand the same and believe this is 100 the truth and when i believe it's the truth then i don't need anything else you see that's where christianity has struggled is struggling so much today in the western world and everywhere else is that they have abandoned their core values and they have discredited the very gospel they claim to believe this is happening way back in the 50s and 60s in brother bannon's time when that that missionary was there and speaking to the muhammadan and telling him about the about christ and he said why don't you want to receive christ he said well he said your christ said gave you all these promises of of healing the sick and raising the dead and all these things when was the last time you saw that happen where's the last evidence of this and the brother backed down he backed down and brother branham said i wish i would have been there i wish i could have been there but the point is is by little by little there's a little song that says the the the sheep got out the sheep got out we let the we let down the bars the sheep got out we let down the bars the sheep got out but how did the goats get in because we let down the bars you see we stopped actually believing we found a way of religion we found a way of us to perform our own works we found a way for us to make ourselves feel good we found a way for us to to take a way of law just like the old testament the the priest of the old testament could take the law and use it to control the people but we no longer christianity is no longer holding on to the power related to the name because they're in name only you see christian they first were called christians in antioch and do you know why because the people of antioch said these people are so much like the original they must be christians like christ these men are like christ but we've we've gone so far away from that original so what we want to do is take a look back and see what was the original like what did he instruct us to do just keeping a a mind on what god can do with nothing um now in matthew 10 16 the beginning of it i i just i highlighted this for myself it says behold i send you forth a sheep in the midst of wolves and when i read that i thought wow none of us like that that that totally goes against our human nature because when you think about the contrast sheep and wolves one defenseless not able to do a whole lot its greatest defense by itself if it's all by itself is running away if it's all together is to get in a big circle and bunch together as tight as possible so that they provide as as little attack surface as possible and if the wolf dies in that it's the it's so thick in there it's smothering but wolves they have strong powerful feet and paws and and really sharp teeth and their favorite their favorite food is sheep and jesus says just just in case you're wondering how it is i'm sending you out i'm sending you out as sheep amongst wolves don't take any of your own defense so not only are you not taking any money you're not taking an extra coat so we covered all the the natural things first he covered that first and now he's diving into the spiritual things he said don't don't go out there thinking that i'm sending you of your own ability or your own prowess of your own morality or your own strength so i'm sending you a sheep amongst wolves because not because you're going to escape every persecution no no he says beware of men beware of the wolves because this is what they're going to do for they will deliver up to the council and they will scourge you in their synagogues he said you're going to get scourged he didn't like about this time you're like yeah lord where's the part where you come in and save me i said no no you're gonna get scorched yeah just it's par for the course he said you understand because you ain't there yet but just wait the crucifixion's coming and you'll understand there the the servants no greater than his lord if they called the master of the house meows above how much more those of you of his house and you should be brought before governors and kings for my sake for the testimony against them and the gentiles he's looking to spread his gospel as far and wide as possible to everybody from the lowest to the highest why so that on a day of judgment none will have any excuse that's your job that's where he's sending you forth this is why he didn't want you going with your ability because if you go with your ability how is he going to judge them a holy god judge one man off the word of another man that wouldn't be just that wouldn't be just so that's why he tells you when they deliver you up take no thought right the first thing we even even naturally we get pulled over by the police and either we know why they did it or maybe we're not sure but probably you have a pretty good idea most of the time and if not you have a guilty conscience anyways so the first thing happened you pull over and you're thinking okay what what do i need to do for the best outcome possible you know we put on our smile and we get all nice and happy and and we're not feeling real happy but you know officer comes to the window and and uh how are you officer you know i hope you're having a great day i sure am no you're not not right then right but that's our response is we're thinking okay how do i get out of this what what can i say what what's the right thing to say what how do i say it how do i word it like i'm gonna wait for them to say something first that way i just in case there didn't pull me over for what i thought they did which i know i'm guilty of i won't i won't let it slip you know but jesus said no no no in this case this is not earthly things so take no thought your only thought is lord use me that's it that's it that's your thought because the minute you inject something it's not what god can do with nothing it's what god has to do to get you back to nothing and we're going to see that as we walk through the scripture here there's there's so many examples in the scripture and i advise you i advise you there's so many examples in the scripture both of those who needed to be brought back down to nothing those who were able to submit themselves with nothing and those who thought they had everything and had to be a base i mean we just heard that on wednesday with brother dan preaching you mentioned nebuchadnezzar he mentioned king uzziah these are men who thought they had something to offer god and god had to bring him back to what nothing nothing it's not because he wants you to always have nothing but he just wants you to remember always remember that you have nothing to contribute except for what he's given you if he didn't give it to you don't try and give it back to him because he don't want it if god didn't give it to you he don't want it because only the gifts he gives you are gifts worthy of the king and the only guest worthy to give back to a king the gifts of your flesh the only reason why he wants you to give that to him is so he can throw it into the furnace and burn it away so when you try and take this something that you think you have of your own ability of your own thoughts of your own strength and you go and say here you go lord here you can use this he's like what am i going to do with that you want me to burn it you're like no no give it back give it back i i need that he's like okay well just let me know i i got a big giant furnace to take care of that thing when you're finally done with it but that's about all i know to do with that gift you were trying that thing you were trying to give me right now kind of kind of awful it kind of stunk it didn't look so good it looked like dirty rags and i'm not sure what you were wanting me to do with that i got a nice clean robe for you when you're ready but you can't wear them both at the same time you know and so talking about what god can do with nothing i i was thinking you know in order to get to the place where you realize you have nothing to give nothing to add nothing of value of yourself that god can use that's when in order to get there it takes surrender now we we've heard these words so many times surrender and and there's two there's two different types of surrender i want to mention real quick here i took them both out of i took some definitions out of the webster dictionary and that way we're all at least working off the same place here okay the first definition is the one i would attribute to what god is doing for us and what he would like out of us it's the action of yielding one's person or giving up the possession of something especially into the power of another you see that first one here is you yielding of your own free will now the second one is your only other choice if you don't choose to yield to god is the yield to the power control or possession upon compulsion or demand and that's the devil you only have two choices there's no third choice there's no sitting on the fence you can either yield willingly to the lord because brother brahm said that holy spirit he's a gentleman he'll never come in and take you of his own ability of his own power he's waiting for you to say lord i surrender i surrender but so many times we're like we're like that kid that you know rebellious teenager and we run out and we do all the things our parents told us not to do and we get into trouble and then we turn on to our parents say if you love me you wouldn't let me do this or at least when it happened you'd come save me and your parents like no you did it you suffered the consequences i still love you but because i love you that you're going through this and i'll still love you when you're done going through this and when you decide to yield of yourself to the power of another then your life will change but right now you don't realize that you think you're making your own decisions but you're yielding your power your yourself under compulsion under demand you know why because you no longer have a choice once you yield in that direction you no longer have a choice on what your actions are going to be right that's the it's the it's the cliche saying that you hear all the time sin will take you deeper and further than you ever intended to go why because it's upon compulsion and or demand once you start going there once you yield initially you're no longer in control now here too once you yield 100 you fully surrender you're also no longer in control but he's never gonna force you ever at any point you're like you know what lord that you know i don't i don't i'm not gonna i just don't feel comfortable going there he's gonna be like well it's gonna be a lot better for you but i'm not going to force you he'll just let you sit there right where you're at in your place of complacency waiting for you to surrender a little bit more the opposite is with the devil as you start going down that road and you know you're hanging out with those friends you're hanging out with that influence or whatever it is that's taking you in whatever direction it is and you're gonna go like i'm not comfortable with that and they won't stop until you do it go a little bit further and once you go a little bit further you go a little bit further i want you a little bit further you go a little bit further but they're never less like oh you're not comfortable uh since you're not comfortable with with with this that must mean you're a pretty good guy i'll just leave you alone it's never been the case not in my experience you know you only like little lies oh well don't tell any big ones then just stick to your little lies it's not the way it works it's like you're the little lie and then the lie gets a little bit bigger and the lie gets a little bit bigger and then your lies are so off they start where where satan started with eve one word different and you're like it's one word what's the problem you know it was kind of the truth you see but the minute you have to insert kind of sort of similar to there's been a deviation and the minute you add a deviation into the truth it makes it all a lie so now all of a sudden you get to such a point where if you don't make a choice to surrender the other direction where god can start working with you then what's going to happen is you get so far you like the devil start believing your own lies you know the devil he reads the scripture but he's so invested in his own lie he believes it he really believes that he's got a chance at the end of of time to beat god he believes it he really does you know how i know is he's persisted for over 6 000 years through millions of miracles that were not in his favor and through a whole ton of failure on his part he's never once turned a son or daughter of god to not be a son or daughter of god and yet somehow he thinks that at the end of time when all the sons and daughters of god are together with god again somehow he'll be able to influence them through some type of power and change them all at once because he keeps fighting and that's until you stop fighting god and surrender that's where you're at too we keep fighting god thinking that if we keep doing it our way eventually it'll turn out right because we don't want to give up of our own thoughts our own ability our own doing our own direction in life we're like this is you know we're we're locked in it's like a career and and we feel like well we can't stop we've gone so we're so invested in this career now that if i i have to give all this up in order to do something different and when i do that i lose all my investment they say that is how the biggest losses are made in investing is that once someone is invested in something even when it starts to go down they're so invested they're more likely to invest more hoping it'll come back up than to cut it loose because it become a part of who they are a part of their self-worth a part of their identity and it hurts so much to cut it loose and we all get there we all get there whether that's a in you know even in in an actual job in an actual career you know i can speak a little bit from experience i growing up worked for my my dad who was a general contractor and i started working when i was like seven years old he would haul me off to work i don't know how much work how much work i was actually doing and how much work i just was additional um but by the time i got into my early 20s i had had 10 years of full-time employment on the job with a highly trained individual well worth what i was doing i knew how to to work i knew how to get things done i had several skills and all that's going on i was getting paid equal to anyone else in the industry and not just working for my dad going out and working for other contractors working for people and and the point of that is is i had to make an active decision because i looked at some things and i looked at the end point for many of these men and i said most of these men end up in the end of their life in a way that i do not want to i said so i have to make an active change and that active change required me to go from what would be considered close to the top where people will ask your opinion ask your advice ask you how to do things you're the one actually giving some leadership down to the bottom you have to go back down to the bottom and be humble and say i don't know what i'm doing but i'm here to learn i don't know what i'm doing but you just tell me and i'm willing to follow your instruction you see and that's where so many of us our struggle is with with full surrender is that we're like but i have to give up by my influence maybe i'll have to give up my authority maybe i'll have to give up whether that's over your own life or you're scared you're going to lose some type of influence or authority with others or you're going to lose some type of prestige because now they're going to realize that wow he's not that guy he's kind of weird that guy i thought he was you know and maybe we've been in the message for 20 years maybe we've been in 10 years maybe we've grown up in the message maybe we've been reading our bible we've been listening to the message we've been in sunday school we've we we know the the seven seals book we've read the church ages two or three times as a child and you're like even for that you're like i've done everything i should do and the devil be like well you you go to give your life to christ and ask to be baptized they're going to know you're a sinner like they think you're a pretty good kid right now but you're gonna have to make a public um confession that you're not as good as they all as they all think you are don't worry about it they were all kids they've all everyone in this building who's gone on with the lord their backstory may surprise you you see that's the biggest misconception of people coming to church is is i've heard this statement over the time and over years both from people coming just starting to come to church or come to know the lord and from people who have gone out perhaps away from the church and are thinking about coming back and they say well i don't know that i can come there because all you people are such good people and saints and i just don't know that i fit in and it's like that is a lie of the devil he said because we we are all saints but it ain't because we're good people we're all saints by the blood of the lamb and you know how long it takes you to join that same rank just surrender surrender and come under the blood of the lamb and you'll look as bright and shiny as new as everyone else it don't matter the back story then is is wash clean your backstory is the same as theirs is that the price was paid on calvary and you are justified you are sanctified and now you're primed and ready for the baptism of the holy ghost what only matters now is how fast you want to go you know so many of so many times are like someone learning to ride a bike and we come to a hill and we go to ride down the hill now you don't need to pedal the power of the hill is going to carry you down but the problem with most is that because they don't fully trust they have fear that creeps in a little bit of doubt they've never moved that fast before is that they hold their breaks the whole way down and they lose out on the experience they could have had all because of fear now i know this is all perhaps sounding really simple but it's a simple gospel you know i and yet at the same time this is the seven seals you say wow brother how do you what do you mean the seven seals i thought those were mysterious things they are to people who to whom they are mysteries to but to whom that the arm of the lord will be revealed they're revealed and you know what brother random said the seven seals were jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so how do you know if if whether or not you understand all the types and the symbols and the terminology and all that if if you have a revelation of the seven seals do you have a revelation of jesus christ in your life is he living out through your life so if so if that is so those seven seals are being unveiled and living through you right now and you don't even know it because that's what the type of belief and faith god is calling us to is not one where we need to figure it out oh it's beautiful i love the ministers that have a ministry and they come and they bring all the symbols and the types together you can watch them just fit them in there and type it out through history and it's beautiful it's beautiful but god doesn't require you to know all that in order to be a fulfillment of the prophecy that's in them he said just believe just believe so here we are surrender now in order to surrender we have to trust okay now the definition of trust is assured reliance on the character ability strength or truth of someone or something it is also one in which confidence is placed and also dependence on something future or contingent right no many of us use this word in our daily life all the time right whether it's dealing with one another or or someone says hey you know i'll meet you such and such a place i'll have this stuff or i'll do this for you and you said yeah i trust you i believe you you'll be there but our trust is kind of shaky a lot of times you say yeah i trust you to a point and that's not the trust god's looking for you see is our trust in relation to the lord is based on what we've already experienced with him you see and it's a very shallow trust sometimes as we say you know lord i trust you for for all my my needs my uh and to supply my needs and my income and supply for my family and then we spend most of our time worrying about it i thought you said you trusted i thought you said you trusted him to supply your needs what are you doing worrying because worrying is a breakdown of doubt worrying is a part of fear fear and worry are one and the same so where there's fear and worry there's doubt so you don't have total trust you say lord i trust you for my healing but then we're concerned about how he's going to do it lord i don't know if you really can do this what do i need to do to help you trust trust me trust me that whether by miracle or by way that i will send you to the right dentist you're going to be healed trust don't worry just trust he's there for you even if you go to the wrong doctor and you're trusting god you got a promise of healing it's like when you go to church and you go into a service brother branham said even if the minister behind the pulpit isn't living right doesn't have the right doctrine is not of the right spirit he is 100 off the word he said if you walk in there really prayed up trusting in god for something that you need for your life that man can't help but say what it is because god will use him to speak to you doesn't mean everything he says throughout that service will be right but god will use him in a certain point in time to speak directly to your need because you trust but many a times god isn't able to speak to our needs even when the man behind the pulpit is prayed up of the right spirit and has put his time into the word because we don't trust we are so anxious and worried that maybe this person might lead us astray because god is not in control now i'm not saying that if you see someone you go in somewhere and they're preaching the wrong things in the wrong doctrines and you see the lives of the people all over the place that you you just stay there what i'm saying in a certain specific instant in time if you go in having a need from god god is obligated to meet you there if you actually trust now i'm using the word trust because it's a it's a it's a it's a simpler word that we use all the time that we can associate with that we even associate with one another right but the word that we actually use for this all the time is faith you know what what faith faith only has one actual meaning and that is complete trust like we make faith a very mystical thing a thing out beyond our reach or something that's like just it it's it's it's it's not brother branham faith said faith is so simple that we use it every day we use it every day when you walked out to your car this morning as long as it's something that normally starts for you when you put in the key you didn't you didn't now some of us and i've been in cars like this before some of us do not have faith when we get in our car we slide the key and we're like okay buddy here you go i believe in you you can do this you don't have faith you have hope that that thing will start but many of us every single day from the time we wake up in the morning when we went to bed at night we had faith we were going to get up the next morning most of us did we didn't think oh man i better not go to sleep because i don't know if i'm going to wake up in the morning how many of you last night were like i'm not going to bed because i do not know whether or not i'm getting up in the morning i didn't my head hit the pillow and i was out now some of us stay up longer because we worry about other things we're not worried about whether or not we're going to wake up in the morning we're worrying about all the other things that we shouldn't know which is stopping us from getting the rest we need so we can wake up in the morning but we're not worried about waking up in the morning we just have a common faith a complete trust come morning i'm going to wake up and then we get up and you go to your the bathroom or go to the kitchen or wherever you head first and you turn on the the faucet at the tap and water comes out now you don't have any special prayer before you turn the knob on that faucet like saint i know this is really simple but it's this this simple it's it's this simple it's not some type of abracadabra magical thing it's simple faith simple faith is complete trust complete trust that's why god compared wanted us to be like little children in our trust in our faith of him little kids they say little kids are not born with any fear all fear is learned you learned to fear whatever fears your anxieties or worries you have you learned that that was taught to you either by someone by an experience if you have a fear of of small spaces you have a fear of of really fast speed you have a fear of um whatever it might be put it in there you learn that from someone you have a fear of dogs right most people that you find that are afraid of dogs children that are afraid of dogs watch their parents they're also afraid of dogs so for that child that fear typically has nothing to do with a negative experience that they've had but they learned it by copying someone else and that's where most of us are at most of our worries about our life we learn from people we learn from associates we learn from friends and family we learn from some type of experience that we then accredit it to you know it's a fear we learn it but god says i want you to go all the way back before that to the time when you were a child i want you to trust me like a little child i want you to get up to the edge of that that counter i want you to get to the edge of that playset and just leap off without even warning me because you have so much trust that even though you didn't say hey i'm jumping i'm going to catch you anyways because that's the faith and trust a little child has in his parents right that's why you see these these videos of of of of dads of uh with amazing feats and it's always like the the kid will do something and go flying off the couch or off of something and the dad without seeing anything just spins around and catches them right god said that's the kind of trust i want you to have in me that's that is faith that is complete trust it's not it's you don't even have to warn him lord i'm gonna take a jump i'm going to dive off of this thing because i know you got me so many times you're like lord hey um i'm thinking about doing this what do you think and he's like yeah sure do it and we're like are you really sure because um maybe you could give me some assurity how do i know you're gonna catch me and this is not new this this thought process is not new this goes all the way back into the old testament i got some examples but i'm going to have to speed up but this goes all the way back into the old testament and maybe i won't use my notes i'll just run off of them with moses moses right here's someone who had everything and thought he could do it himself he thought he could do it himself he had so much confidence in himself he had so much faith in himself and his own ability he said i can do this see he had misplaced trust he put in his own ability instead of putting it in god and god said that's not going to work he said if god said if i support that one time you're never going to learn and you're never going to come to a full maturity where real power is at you're going to be hanging out these lower levels the rest of your life so i'm going to have to let you fall on your face once and find out your ability has nothing to do with this and he goes out and he kills one egyptian think about it he thought if i kill one of them it's going to make a difference this is a such a powerful kingdom that they are holding two million people in bondage and he killed one and he didn't even it's not like he went and killed pharaoh he didn't cut the head off he killed one pass master out in the field he was just better than the just slightly better than the slaves to pharaoh they were all slaves to pharaoh it's just the jews were the ones at the very bottom everyone beat up on them and moses thought you know what i'll kill this one guy and it'll make a big difference watch and the minute he did that he realized his mistake and all the fear and doubt and worry set in and he started hiding it you ever doing something that god's told you to do no matter what it is you're not going to hide it you're not even worried when god tells you to do something you go do it right out in the open that's the difference when you do it by your own ability and it all goes wrong you're looking for a place someone to blame somewhere to hide it somewhere to place it real quick and then you know try and go walking away like nothing happened and hope nobody noticed but someone noticed not only did other egyptians notice but the very people he was supposed to be helping deliver and be an example to noticed and you know they saw him the same way they saw the taskmaster he didn't look like any savior to them he just looked like another abuser and here he goes he goes off into the wilderness he's driven off into the wilderness you know that was just the grace of god they should have put him to death for murder but the grace of god saved him from himself and sent him out into the desert pharaoh didn't send him into the desert god sent him out into the desert he said here's where we begin little by little we're going to dismantle this thing until you're down to nothing now you're done to nothing 40 years later god's like okay you're about at the point where i can actually start doing something 40 years and here he is brother man says he's an 80 year old man beard down to his knees he doesn't look like much staff in his hand out herding sheep he didn't exactly have an illustrious job in fact god knew what he was doing because the egyptians from whom he had learned all his knowledge saw sheep and sheep hurting as an abomination so god sent him out brought abased him so low that he put him in charge of the things that those who he once looked up to would just despise him for and that even in at the beginning when he still felt like he had a little bit to himself every time he started to feel like maybe i still have a little bit he'd look out and he's like i'm hurting sheep i'm an abomination to myself 40 years of that and now he's there before a burning bush and god began speaking to him in exodus and exodus chapter 4 and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee moses is in a good spot for god to use him he's no longer in the spot saying look at me guys you should just believe me because i'm moses why wouldn't you believe me but here's god he's standing before a burning bush a supernatural event and he has had so much taken out of him he's been so abased that even after a supernatural experience he tells the lord lord they're not going to believe me who am i that they would believe me why would they believe me that i tell them something miraculous happened to me do i look like anything like anyone that something miraculous would happen to and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and as we would continue reading we all know the story and if you don't you should go read it go read exodus chapter four where god has them cast the rod down and it turns into a serpent moses didn't of himself just run over and pick up the serpent right away he was scared something really crazy just happened in front of him and now he's got a serpent the thing that he's been trying to protect his sheep from for the last 40 years running around on the ground right next to him and it happened out of the thing in his hand so now he's got all these thoughts like how long have been holding this snake and didn't know it right and god tells him now you pick it up god is now rebuilding moses he's rebuilding his confidence not in moses but in god you see we have to get so low that when the lord tells us why don't you go talk to someone lord they'll never believe me he said yeah they will because it's not you it doesn't have to do with you take no thought you go i'll speak you see you jump down to they've gone through all these signs there's a snake a leprosy in his hand he tells him you're gonna pour out water and he'll turn to blood he's seen all these things and moses is still struggling moses is still struggling and the lord tells him and moses said of the lord oh my lord verse 10 i am not eloquent neither here to for nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and slow of tongue moses brother ram told us used to teach the teachers of egypt and 40 years later he says i'm not eloquent i'm i'm slow with speech the only people i talk to anymore is these sheep i think real slow how am i going to do this and now the lord gets frustrated with him and the lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or death or the seen or the blind have not i the lord now therefore go and i will be thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say lord says you're still not getting it i got you to nothing because this is where i need you now i just need you to do as you're told go where i tell you and then say what i tell you and you won't have any more problems your problems before is you went where you wanted to go and you said what you wanted to say and that's what landed you here if you would have known to do what i told you and say what i said in the beginning we wouldn't have had to go this route but now that we're here the reason why this is going to succeed moses doesn't have to do with your ability and it doesn't have to do with your inability either see what god can do with nothing so many times we're either concerned because we feel like why i don't have the ability to do that i don't have that talent i don't have that gift i don't have this or that and god's saying go go i'll speak through you i will work my gifts through you you don't need your own gift but the gift that i'll give you when you have need of it go in fact we're better off that you're dumb and don't speak except for when i speak so that's a that's actually a plus so don't worry about that bit that's on purpose i don't want you saying your own words that's why we went through this process to make you make sure you weren't eloquent and we're slow of speech because if you're slow of speech i can jump in before you say something stupid now you would think mo god just told moses i'm going to speak through you i'm going to be your mouth that would be enough and he said oh my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him who thou shalt send and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will put be with thy mouth and with his mouth and tell teach you what you shall do you see no matter how many excuses you have if god has a work for you to do he won't let you have too many excuses he'll have an answer for every excuse so don't think you're going to get out of it you're just going to look sillier the whole time but god's not going to let you get away from his intended purpose okay now just another quick example of what god can do with nothing is we all know the story of the the five lows and five loaves and two fish and the little boy that provided those loaves and those two fish had more trust and faith in what jesus could do than the whole rest of the crowd including all his disciples if you don't believe me go read john chapter 6. and you say how do you know that it doesn't say the little boy had faith when jesus said we need to feed all these people who has something that we can give them little boy said i have five loaves and two fish many of us when god says i have a great work to do we go okay what do i have um i have five loaves and two fish how far will that go well that was only supposed to be my lunch i'm a small boy that won't even hardly feed me because i had to walk out here so i'm not even gonna tell anyone because i'm so embarrassed i didn't bring enough for everybody that's not what jesus asked he said what do we have what do we have he didn't say how much do you have he said what do you have what do you have now jesus actually already knew that that little boy had five loaves and five fish and he knew how he was going to provide you know how i know that because that's actually written here let me read it just real quick okay john 6 verse 5 and when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he said unto philip right he turned to the disciple whence shall we buy bread that these may eat that's what jesus said to philip he asked him a question he asked philip that question and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do [Laughter] we we think that when god presents a question to us we do the same thing adam did way back in the beginning when god comes through the garden calling adam adam where art thou god did not was adam wasn't hiding so well god didn't know where he was he was saying adam what did you do and can you see where you have fallen to where are you do you even know where you are adam i don't i'm not asking for myself i'm saying adam can you see what you just did can you do you realize where this has landed you where art thou with this one when shall we buy bread that these may eat and philip's like wow lord if you don't know i mean i don't know i mean how are we going to feed all these people and like the logistics and and uh that we're out here in the middle of nowhere in the desert there's no town close by by the time we go get it and come back it'll be too late and philip's going through all this all he all he wanted from philip was to go well lord you can provide i've seen you provide before can't are are you not able to provide again that was the response jesus was looking for he was testing his faith little at a time that's how he does with all of us throughout our walk he tests our faith and and we'll think and he'll be like so now you're out of a job what are you going to do now and we're like wow lord i mean if you don't know what job i'm going to get next what am i supposed to know and how am i going to provide for my family and he's like come on buddy you're failing again we're gonna have to do this lesson more than once and it's to everything in life everything we do there's not one thing that we get worried about and and you'll think and you'll and he'll go like so what how are we going to do this he's not looking for you to come up with a plan he's looking for you to say lord i don't know how we're going to do this but i'm trusting in you to bring me through anyways you see because the whole the whole walk with god is him building your faith because until you build your face to a complete trust until you completely trust him he cannot completely trust you and tell and if he can't completely trust you he can't bring you to the place he's wanting to bring you which is a place of adoption of sons and daughters with god where he then grants you full authority with him you see because if you completely trust him he can then completely trust you knowing that you'll always act in accordance with the word but as long as you're trying to add something of yourself or add something of your own ability you don't completely trust him okay five loaves and five fish but many of us afterwards make a big deal out of it we look back to what god just did and we're like wow that's amazing that's great now i can trust you he's like that's not trust 20 the the hindsight is 20 20 thing doesn't help you any because that means the next thing you come to your next time you're hungry you'll be like man i don't have anything to eat i'm just gonna starve because you still don't trust you still don't trust you still don't have faith complete trust so you just walked away and and this is what the men of this group of these thousands of men in this group that just got fed by five loaves of barley and two fishes and it says therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley lows which remained over and above unto them that had eaten and do you know how many people were fed let me just make sure i get the right number for you here and maybe i don't have that that may have been on the verse or before there but i believe is about 2 000 men or 5 000 there we go 5 000 men besides women and children and typically back then the family unit was much larger than here in the western world the family unit was the husband a wife and anywhere from one to twenty kids like the good old farming communities so 5 000 men let's assume that only half their family came and times that by two or three but steve i know those numbers don't really add up but it's only for the story um but let's say there was 15 000 people there they all got fed they all got fed and they picked up extra they had more in the end than they did in the beginning because one one young boy had faith not the whole crowd you see faith is a powerful thing brother adam said you get one individual fully surrendered to god he can do more with that one person than 5 000 look up the number because that number i know is off but it's a big number one person fully surrendered with complete total faith complete trust can have an influence over the entire community this young boy this young boy's faith fed those 5 000 men and their families one individual had faith in what god could do and working off of that faith alone god did something miraculous for everyone see that's the way a gift of god works is a gift of god isn't for you because that little boy already had his lunch you see they say in in in the financial world that those who are poor develop a hoarding mentality because they believe there won't be any any more if they let go of what they have but those who are truly truly have wealth know that the more that they give away the more they will attain because not because of their own ability or their thoughts or anything like that but it is actually a concept of scripture of god wants to take that of which you've been blessed by and share it with others because when god is doing is he is investing in you so that you're a place he can draw from to bless other people and that's not just a finance thing that is love joy peace longsuffering the gifts and of the spirit it's it's the fruits of the spirit that he's wanting to take and share with everyone else but until you have complete and total trust and faith anytime you get a little bit you no it's mine i can't i don't have enough to share with everyone else and god's saying just give it to me give it back to me and i'll multiply it for you but we're so i only got a little bit of love and this is the only love i've had my whole life and and if i give it away then what will i have i'll just be nothing great that's what god wants because until you're nothing he can't give you any any more that little bit of joy if i share my joy and if i get too excited in the service and expand myself i won't have joy for the rest of my week no he's wanting you to express joy he's wanting you to express joy in the service he's wanting you to worship and praise why because that will bubble over to the next person and the next person and the person behind you and guess what you will all walk out with more joy than what you came in with and enough to keep you through the entire week not just you but everyone else because he's just waiting you for you to give it to him and have faith complete trust i can't expend this it comes from a unexpendable fountain it is a fountain filled with blood with with no end in sight it is an ocean so great that if i take a little bit and i share it with someone i can go back to the ocean and get more there's no end to it what god can do with nothing just realize you had nothing to begin with so you have nothing to lose that's our biggest problem we think we have something to lose brother branham in a quote just just tying up that that little story said uh faith that was once delivered to the saints the little boy one day had five fishes in his hand it wasn't very much but when it come in jesus hands it fed five thousand it's not very much in your hand what you got but give it to him one time what little talent you got give it to him find out what it'll become in his hand you know and that's the exact same thing complete and total trust complete and total faith that's what that widow woman who came to the temple with her two mites jesus in speaking to his disciples said she gave more than any of the others because she gave all of that which she had now it's not that god's looking to keep us all poor but he's wanting you to be willing it's your willingness to go back to nothing without even thinking about it when god puts it on your heart and he moves on you and says give all you have give all of yourself expend yourself fully maybe that's your time maybe that is your finances maybe that's your love expend yourself of the love which you have said watch what i'll do he said lord but they're unlovable he goes yeah so where are you but fully expend yourself of that which you have and you know she had just got that she hadn't been saving it for a rainy day if you read the scripture through the gospels and follow the story she had just earned that as wages and it was meant to feed her and her son her and her children and something moved on her because jesus needed that example before his disciples do you think it just she just did it because she wanted to god was moving on her when she earned it knowing that jesus and his disciples would be standing in the temple watching people give offerings and it was an example jesus needed to show his disciples to teach them something and so god put it on her heart to go give those two mites she had just earned that day to feed her family that's all she had and she walked and she said and she was probably thinking i don't even know why i'm doing this two mites and she walked out and she said and she's probably thinking well now what do i do and jesus standing there said look at disciples come here come here come here did you see that we stood here all day we stood here the last two hours just to see this this is how important this is it's not just a story she gave all because she had complete and total trust she had faith that god would provide her needs if she gave back to him and because of that she gave more than anyone else and i'll bless her for that i don't believe for a second then her and her children went hungry that night not for a moment but that's the mentality we find ourselves in so many times we're so afraid if i give up what i have there won't be enough for me now don't mistake me i know this is used in many a church and many places and and poor men in ministries that are teaching things wrong and it's because they're facing the people i didn't say give it to the church it may take that form i said give it to give it to god maybe you took that two mites and you gave it to someone on the side of the road i don't know maybe you found someone in need and you bought them some some fruits and vegetables maybe someone you met them and they were breaking down and you spent some time with them and you walked them off a ledge and you prayed with them and you gave of your time you gave of the two mites of your time that you didn't have you took that extra moment to share god's love when you yourself were at a point when you're like lord you woke up that morning you said i don't even feel saved this morning lord where are you i need you more today than ever before and you know what he does he takes you into the path of someone who needs something he said out of the what you feeling you have nothing are you willing to give the little you have because maybe he's just waiting for you to do that so he can bless you abundantly because so many times i've felt that maybe i've been struggling and you'll come in contact with someone who's looking to withdraw from you and you have a choice to make you can either be like i ain't got nothing to give you i barely have enough to keep myself right now i'm i'm hurting right now can't you see that i barely have enough love to keep me going the joy of my salvation i'm barely holding on you want to share your problems with me go find someone who cares i ain't got time i barely have time to do what i'm doing i'm barely getting sleep at night and god's giving you an opportunity to do something with nothing he's looking for you to say lord i have nothing to give them come and use me speak through me to them bless them in some way and when you become that conduit for god to speak for god to share his love you know what he has to do first he's got to pour it through you he's got to fill you up in that moment so that it's pouring over so that your cup is running over so that it spills over to them and you'll walk away from that moment so spoken to so blessed you won't believe it but as long as you're holding on yourself this is mine i gotta keep it i don't know what am i gonna do next you'll never experience that never um and i gotta let you guys go it's okay god is so good god is so good he's so merciful so kind he's so long-suffering so so wonderful let me just read this to you see here let me just um we're going to make it through through this this uh set of note saints we've only made page 10 out of 10 i mean 2 out of 10 so but i want to i know the lord says what he wants to say whether or not we use our notes it's not about that i i think most of the time god just wants to see are you willing to put in the work to be a blessing to others and then when it comes time to be a blessing he just does what he wants to do don't be so invested in your own work your own notes your own ideas that you can't just let god bless someone the way he wants to bless them that's that's where we struggle so much is that we're like no no i did this i did this so i got to use it i got to do something with this god's like no no no that was just me saying if you were willing to you were willing to actually put time aside that's just me saying if you were willing to take isaac and put him on the altar [Music] this was me trying to get you to realize what are you willing to sacrifice are you willing to sacrifice oh good wonderful we're on the right track we got you to nothing you're willing to give up everything to be a blessing to somebody all right but now i'm going to do it my way so just get out of the way and and that's just what we got to realize saying so many times is that's what he's just waiting for us to do he wants us to see ourselves for ourselves are you willing to to give up are you willing to dedicate yourself a little are you willing to suffer a little are you willing to go through he said you know they're going to scourge you when you go out with nothing are you willing to take the scourges for my sake and maybe it's not a physical scourge anymore but maybe it's something that requires you to make a sacrifice of your of your ability of your time or whatever it is he says okay you made the sacrifice now i'm gonna bless you and them because guess what when he comes and he does it his own way the person speaking gets this the person whose voice he's using just just as much blessing as those who are listening because i we we're hearing it for the first time too when it's not your thoughts it's just your voice saints and it doesn't make anyone special the fact that god can use you doesn't make you special it means you just finally got yourself out of the way he can do it with any of you no matter your age no matter your your standing no longer matter how long you've been in the message no longer how long you've been a christian no matter where you're at in life if even in one moment you say lord just use me you're at school and something comes up you're at work something comes up you're driving in your car something comes up you just go lord use me that's simple and if you really mean it if you have complete trust what i mean by complete trust in those situations is lord i am not afraid of anything that might come out my mouth once you start using it because you know that's the reason why most of us don't surrender in those situations we're scared god might use our voice to say something that we would never say ourselves in public or to somebody and it might embarrass us we're scared we might be embarrassed by what god is using us to do and so we don't want to fully trust we just want to have a little trust but we want to have some type of gatekeeping ability on the voice and every time you do that it will fall flat you'll say a lot of flowery words but there'll be no connection but when you let go your words may not be the most eloquent but there'll be such a presence drop in that place and you and that individual or you and whoever it is that you're helping you're speaking to whatever way you're doing it that god's using you it'll be like it's you and them alone in the room it doesn't matter if it is you and them or if it's you and a hundred people it doesn't matter if you're standing on the side of the sidewalk and the cars are driving by there could be a mob going down the road and you and that individual stand there you're in a bubble and a world all your own and god will use you when you realize lord i have nothing to add to this i'm depleted myself just come and use me to speak to your people here yeah that's okay let's go to mary's belief it's going to read this i got two quotes for you and then we're gonna end the service um mary's belief and i'm gonna skip through this a little bit uh mary she didn't wait until she was positive she didn't wait to see some physical sign if i look for a physical sign for what i'm led for tonight i'll look for every seat in here to be taken up that's brother branham speaking about the place where he was at when the place is only about two-thirds full but that doesn't matter we don't have to have an overflowing crowd there was 120 in the upper room but they were all in the hands of god god started a revival with them 120 completely surrendered completely trusting into his hands that that's never ended a fire that cannot be put out what could god do here tonight with these hundreds in his hands what god do with us here today if we would just lend ourselves and put ourselves in his hands it's just getting ready believing holding his promise before him you see it's not holding our ability it's holding his promise before him mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be a mother and you could wait after the meeting i'm sure many of all the mothers in here today could identify with this statement is many of you knew before anyone else i think i'm a mother i'm pretty sure but i'm not going to tell anyone until i'm really sure right but he says mary could have waited she could have done that same thing it's a natural thing to do until she had some kind of sign that she was going to be a mother and you could wait after the meetings over until you feel that you could move your crippled leg just a little better or you could hear a little better out of that deaf ear or the cancer seemed to be that it wasn't bothering you so much that's not taking god at his word take god at his word is to hear his word and accept it and start rejoicing with it we could see i'm just gonna skip down we just have to take god's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word of of word to life as we water it with praises what makes a seed grow water what makes the word of god grow is the praises of god i'm continuing just to jump down to paragraph 21 you're wanting a revival start watering the word the promise that makes me feel religious myself now the minute don't don't get caught up on it you start watering the word on the you part because remember the watering is being done through praise and you wouldn't be able to praise him unless he gave it to you to praise him with and you're what watering the word his word not yours so you have to have full trust full complete faith in his word that if you will water it with that which he's given you it'll grow and take root um if you want to come out of that that makes me feel religious myself if you want to come out of the wheelchair start wandering the word if you want to come from that cancer start watering the word little ricky tonight here is a testimony that god heals cancer he heals cancer he heals all our sickness thousands times thousands of infallible proofs of it we've seen mary started quickly testifying that she was going to have this baby how she going to have it she never knowed a man there's never been such as that has ever happened now remember this real quick this had never happened to us it is a 2 000 year old story that we because we say we believe in jesus christ and our christians just take for granted no time in the in the thousands of years prior to starting from creation to mary had this ever happened god had never done this there was no example in scripture of god doing this with anyone nothing even close even with abraham and sarah they were still husband and wife they just were younger this was a whole new thing god was doing you have to be so sold out that you believe god's word is true when he's doing things like this because you're going to look really crazy there's never been such as that has ever happened but she just took the word of the lord at what it meant and begin to rejoice if each person here tonight that's bound with sin in your lives will just take him at his word and start rejoicing because jesus saith he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out though your sins be a scarlet they shall be white as wool there is no need of being bound down you can be free tonight from your burden of sin if there are those here to unite are bound by sickness just take him at his word and start rejoicing you can be free he said so and he's no respect of person whoever will let him come now there when he said you are bound by sin i know same thing we touch on this a little bit just briefly earlier about how that feeling of condemnation keeps you back the devil tells you you're not good enough to be there i had some other examples in here there was that harlot that came before jesus he was there at the pharisees house and she came running in and fell at his feet began washing his feet with her tears and drying it with his her hair and anointing his feet with oil it was because she knew she had nothing to offer that she ran to the feet of jesus she didn't walk up and present gifts she ran to his feet and the only way she knew to ask for forgiveness was by weeping and she didn't come in thinking i'll wash his feet that wasn't her thing she fouled her at his feet a sinner saying if anyone can make me whole of sin you can and she was so moved in his presence that the tears began to stream it wasn't she did it wasn't a worked up thing she didn't get in there and work up her tears so she could wash his feet but she was so moved upon in her spirit that the tears began to flow and they washed his feet and as she got the tears on his feet she realized my tears aren't worthy to be on his feet but the only thing she had was her hair to dry them she anointed his feet with an oil he said what do i what can i offer she didn't do it from her abundance per se but it's just all she had she said lord you have everything i have whatever you want to do with it you do because you know that that very expensive oil was purchased with the money she had earned through her profession how many people today if they saw that happen would say how dare you anoint the lord's feet with something bought in such a manner but jesus knew her heart it was her only way she brought everything she had and laid it at his feet and said lord do with it with that which you will and he said your sins which were many are all forgiven so don't let where you're at or where you've been keep you from the master's feet so if you can come recognizing yourself as nothing before his feet he'll raise you up and he can do something mighty now he can use you for his purpose and for service because even right in that night he used that woman and her actions to speak to and condemn the pharisee right at the same time because the pharisees sat there judging him you know many people think the pharisee was judging the woman pharisee had already judged a woman long ago he saw her in the street all the time he was judging christ right because he said if in his thoughts he didn't say it out loud he thought he was being proper and polite and and all that stuff because that was his training but in his thoughts he was thinking if you if he was a prophet you see he had no faith in jesus as a prophet he invited him in in acted like he was doing it something good but he was doing it to bring him in close to see if i can catch him maybe in a time of intimate time of conversation i'll catch him and prove he's not a prophet then i can just show the rest of the people too what he the the false prophet that they're following and so he's sitting there and he's thinking aha i knew it all the time it was too good to be true because if he was a prophet he would know what manner of woman she is and jesus didn't say anything right away he was focused in on the woman the pharisee didn't matter he got all the way through with the woman first and then he said to simon simon i know what you've been thinking how does that put me on the scale on whether or not i'm a prophet i know your thoughts and i can tell you this since the time she entered the room she's not ceased to wash my feet with her tears and dry them with her hair and anoint my feet with oil and kiss my feet simon you did not even follow the proper customs of the land that as a guest when i came in someone should have washed my feet if not you someone of your household when i came in you should have anointed me with oil when i came in you should have welcomed me with a kiss and here you sit judging this woman when you even according to your own customs did not fulfill them correctly now simon tell me who loveth more one who is forgiven much or one who is forgiven little this is an easy one buddy you know i don't you don't even need your fair they're training as a pharisee for this one he said well obviously he that is forgiven more he said yes he that's forgiven more no woman thy sins which were many they are all forgiven go and sin no more because this love that you're going to be living by is the love that's going to go with you and keep you from that life of sin this is not under the law or i tell you don't now don't go sin or i'll strike you down but this is the law where i say go in sin no more because i will go with you and be with you and in you to the ends of the world you're no longer working or keeping yourself under your own power but the power that is within you will keep you one last one in israel in the church 1953 brother random says we're just going to end on this little note of of faith puts me in mind of a colored man down in the south an old fellow packed his bible around said and and said why are you carrying that bible for boy he said i believe it i said you can't you can't read a word in it you see every once in a while even a prophet will play devil's advocate just to test people and see where they actually believe just like jesus telling philip philip how we're going to feed all these people sometimes he'll send someone or come your way and test you a little bit see what your response is see see what as they say see what spills out they say you are the person you you really are when when you're in the worst of situations you're not you're not the person you are in the best of the situation the real you is the real you you are in the worst of situations when your buttons are being pushed as they say you can't read a word in it said i believe it anyhow said i believe it from kever to giver believe the giver also said how you know he said it's got holy bible wrote on it and that's why i believe the cover yes sir he believed it anyhow here is a man like mary had to stand believing something he could not confirm for himself he could not read it himself he would have to have someone else read it for him and he had to have faith and complete trust that they were reading it correctly and then god was revealing it to him correctly and that god would let him know if they read it wrong how many of us even though we all can read won't believe something until we read it ourselves let's you know we'll be let's say i know with kids you'll be playing a game and this is the way it was for me growing up and we were all extremely competitive and so when you're extremely competitive you always see what you can get away with but the minute you see someone else getting away with someone thinking you pull out the rules yeah that's what we do we do that and we we do that with each other in life and they'll read the rules and they'll say the rules say this and this you'll be like no uh give me that i'm gonna read it myself that's the way most of us are in most things we're not willing to take someone else's word for it even if they your even if they're standing in front of you reading the document like let me read it myself that's what brother branham said the hardest thing god ever did was get one man to believe another and that's why it's the foolishness of preaching it doesn't make any sense naturally the natural man says you should be skeptical of everything coming out of my mouth not believe it one word now i say believe it but go and prove it and that's the difference but anyways here we go i'm i'm running off on the side he believed it anyhow didn't make any difference and said i said what would you do said you do anything is in that bible said the lord told me to do anything i'd do it he said what if he tell you jump through that wall he said i'll jump you think you could walk through that wall without a hole in it said if the lord told me to jump he'd make a hole in it for me that's right too brother hallelujah that's the truth god tells you to jump he'll have the hole there when you get there don't worry about it that's what god can do with nothing is i have no ability most of us god says jump to the wall and say well lord we need some demo tools we need a jackhammer maybe a tractor maybe a crew of men to create the hole first for me because if i make the hole i may be too tired to jump through it when i'm done god said no no no jump jump through the wall jump through the wall just do it complete just like a child if i you had a little kid that trusted you totally and you convinced them and some of us will start laughing to ourselves because we've done these things before because we we find it very funny and you you know they're not going to be able to do something and you'll convince them hey go do it you can do it you can do it and we do it because we know they're going to run they're going to hit that thing and bounce back and it's going and we're all going to laugh but they have complete and total trust it's only after you've done that to them a couple of times that they start becoming more wary and they'll walk up and they'll be like no i can't and no matter now what you do you can't convince them right and that's how many of us are in life we've tried to do things ourselves and jump through the wall and boom we've hit the wall and fallen back and so now when god says hey go jump through that wall lord i can't jump through that wall i've tried to jump through the wall and i've done this and i've done that and i didn't hit the wall and i hit my head and i fell down and i said no no that's when you tried to jump through the wall by yourself you're not jumping through the wall by yourself this time moses you're not you're not going to battle by yourself gideon you're not when i say jump through the wall just jump just jump because you don't even need a hole in the wall god doesn't need a hole in the wall to take you through because if you have total faith then you'll start moving like jesus did after the resurrection where here they are they're in a a a room a walled room and you know that the the rooms and the buildings that they built back then in those days were mud walls if you go back to the area and see some of the buildings that are still from that period or were built in the same ways they're two and three feet thick dirt mud and stones and sticks it's not like even the wall like this here today has got a little brick on the outside if all of us got angry enough and had took these chairs we might make it through yes sir yes sir but that was not the case and they had a big wooden door on the door and they would take a slab of wood to lock it in place a bar across the door you'd need a ramrod and multiple men to break that thing down and here they are they're hiding after the resurrection they're in hiding no one else even knows where they're at they've had no other contact with jesus since the resurrection to tell him this is the room we're at and all of a sudden one minute he's not there and the next minute he's just standing there in the room because he don't need holes in the wall to come on through and if you have complete and total trust he doesn't need a hole in the wall either to take you through whatever it is he's taking you through whatever that wall represents for you just trust him and say lord i believe you can take me through close your eyes and just walk into the wall and the next minute the next minute you won't even feel the wall you'll just be outside you open your eyes you'll be wandering around outside you won't even know when you went through that wall because that's how he's looking to lead you that's look at how he's looking to carry you through the the the footsteps musicians if you'll come because i'll just keep going with footsteps on the santa time that poem the man looking back over it he's talking with the lord these are all stories we've all heard over and over time they've been there over and over but it doesn't make them any less if we can touch into the revelation the inspiration that they were written in the inspiration that this word was written in the inspiration of the songs and what the inspiration they were written in oh there'll just be an abundance of power you won't be able to contain it you won't be able to hold it you won't be able to stop sharing it it'll just move and move and move god's just waiting are you willing to admit you have nothing are you willing to admit you are nothing and then are you willing to surrender are you willing to trust and as you begin to learn to trust at one point will you learn to have faith that's what jesus told them there on the boat when the the seas the the thousands of demons came and beset themselves upon the ocean they said let's drown them and it was so bad that these men who were seasoned sailors of the sea who'd been in many a storm their boat was filling with water and they began to worry and have fear and panic and in that moment they were doing everything themselves everything they knew how to do all of their own ability they were rowing they were bailing water they were doing all these things and you know what they forgot they forgot jesus was on the boat they actually thought not only did the demons think it but for a moment the disciples thought that the demons of hell might have a chance of sinking a boat that jesus was in that's doubt doubt caused them to think that fear caused them to believe it [Music] and jesus didn't move on the scene from where he was at until they called out his name that whole time they never once called out his name and it's the same thing in our lives until you reach the end of your own ability where you see yourself as nothing and call out his name and say jesus help us jesus save me [Music] deliver me from myself deliver me from this situation carry me through we were talking about those footsteps on the sounds of time that's right i keep halfway through the story i move on the man was looking back over the footsteps and he saw that during a period of time there was two sets of footprints his and the lords and he looked at the most difficult parts of his life and during the most difficult parts of his life there was only one set of footprints and he turned to the lord next to him and said lord i don't understand [Music] why is it that there's only one foot set of footprints when i was going through such a hard time why did you leave me you see he was so distraught in that time of his life he didn't he couldn't even recognize what god was doing in his life think about that how many times have we been there when we're so down life has got us so beat down we think we're doing it all on our own and no one's helping us and jesus goes to him no no no you misunderstand through those times when you only see one foot set of footprints that's when i was carrying you you didn't have the strength to do it on your own i carried you on through until you were strong enough again [Music] i only let you walk when you have the strength to do it other than that i carry you you didn't do that yourself i was with you the whole time you're just so focused on yourself you didn't see me same thing there on the boat and they finally called out said jesus care you not that we perish don't you care about me at all don't you care about our lives you're just sleeping in the back of the boat think about it that's the faith jesus wants us to come to is the same faith the faith of the son of god that when the boat of life is so rocked and going through such a storm that it looks like it's going to go under that you're just at peace you're just sleeping in the boat you can are so you have so much faith in god's will for your life say lord whether this boat sinks or survives i know it's all in your will and none of the flailing around that i do will change that so i'm just going to go back here to the back of the boat lay down and take a nap and rest in your promises because that's the example he gave us because he stood up and he said oh ye of such little faith he said little faith little trust you had complete trust you were just pulled in the oars sat them down you all just continued your conversations together about all the miracles you just saw earlier today it just we would all just rested and slept and the boat would have gone where it needed to go but since you're afraid since you're afraid and you called on my name watch this now i don't know how many of you have been on boats before i haven't been on that many or even that rough of water i've been on a few boats on a few lakes with maybe a few waves but these waves were such that would sink a seagoing vessel maybe they were 20 feet high have you ever tried to stand in a boat with waves going through waves 20 feet high even four five six feet high jesus walked it says he walked to the front of the boat and put his foot on the bow he didn't stagger he didn't weave he didn't hold on to the disciples to help him get there like like it was the calmest ocean water the stillest mirror he stood up from his place sleeping walked to the front of the boat put his foot on the bow why because he knew the disciples needed to see him and needed to see a miracle to restore their faith they needed something from him and he said okay because of your little faith i'll do this for you i love you i'll show myself powerful to you i don't have to show myself powerful to be powerful if you would just believe it it would be so but i'll do it for you because you're my children i love you i'll prove myself to you once again even though you doubted even though you doubt it i'm going to show you no matter what life brings your way i'll carry you through i'll show you no matter how treacherous the waters of life it doesn't make a difference to me and he walks to the front of the bow puts his foot up on the bow and he says peace be still like that the storm clouds cleared waves went to nothing now if you've ever seen water after a storm just because the storm goes away doesn't mean the waves automatically die it takes time but when god speaks all nature has to obey the laws and physics of nature no longer apply the clouds cleared away the sun came out in fact i don't even think there was water in the boat anymore i don't know you can believe what you would like but it doesn't tell me anything a scripture of them continuing to baal they just said what manner of man is this they're in such shock and awe what manner of man is this that when he speaks the winds and the waves obey him you know many of us we we say we believe in god we say we know who god is we we say we know what he can do and yet that is sometimes our response because we're still learning to trust we're still learning to have faith it's still growing we're still maturing in christ and every once in a while he does something and we go what manner of man is this and we realized and then we realized this is not a man this is god almighty god himself wanting to show himself powerful to me let's just pray actually brother juan

he's sleeping waiting he knows he's aware but he won't move until your faith moves him he's waiting for your faith say lord i trust you i know you can bring me through i said well yes i can and here's how we're gonna do it [Music] he's just waiting amen saints let's just go with a bit of rejoicing let's sing that same song amazing grace how sweet the sound i made it over see that's the end of all this strife and trouble and issues and everything else the amazing grace of god that kept you the amazing grace of god that saves you it'll take you over so just like brother branham said we might as well start praising him now praising him for what's coming because we're going to be a part of it how sweet the sound i made [Music] i made oh [Music] was [Music] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] but something you're believing for [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] just one moment one moment no i know i do this a lot but but i i it means that much to me okay and so just chalk it up to my own foolishness if you will but let's start at the very verse first and just quickly we're going to read this song okay amazing grace how sweet the sound i made it over so we're attributing amazing grace to have made it over now over i interpret it as i've already seen myself on the other side why because of amazing grace [Music] like think about that we're singing about the saving power that gets us all the way there now i once was lost we can all identify now i'm found why amazing grace i made it over [Music] saints these songs i and i know i i i i beat a dead horse with this but if we can catch us a glimpse and a revelation of what we're singing either either we we're still working on trying to trust that this is true or maybe we don't fully understand it or fully identify with it yet because if we did if we do no one would be able to stop us go to the next verse because grace that taught my heart to fear i made it over this is not a fear like the world sees it this is you you've grace taught you i can respect and trust in a mighty god to take me over how precious did that grace appear i made it over you're remembering that time when you met grace at calvary and you were set free and you're saying because of that that moment in time i can remember the place at the altar because of that the saving power of jesus christ his grace in my life i'm gonna make it over i can see myself on the other side already i'm not waiting to get there but by faith's eye i can see myself over next verse give me the next one through many dangers toils and snares i made it over right you see we can look at this and we can see the what we've already gone through we've made it through that god's carried us through so we can identify and say because of that i know no matter what's ahead of me i'm still going to make it over his grace has brought me safe this far i made it over saying grace brought me this far he's not going to leave me now i'm going to make it over are we at when now now where this really takes faith are you ready we're no longer singing about the past we're no longer singing about the present but we're singing about the future and we're saying when we've been there 10 000 years let that sink in most of us i've only been i can only identify with about 30 some years and i don't think anyone here can even identify with 100. quantify to 10 000 years when we've been there 10 000 years i made it over when we've been there 10 000 years by faith i believe we've no less days to sing god's praise once we've made it over so the ten thousand day ten thousand and one will be the same as day one think about that so if we're going to already know 10 000 years is this the beginning of praising him what are we waiting for where are we at are we back to the beginning so put that in mind and now let's sing that song and sing it with that revelation of this is the i'm singing about the power to not only set me free and save me from myself and my sin but this is the power that's going to carry me through to the rest of eternity amazing grace how sweet the sound i made it once was lost but now i'm found i made it over [Music] [Music] when i made it [Music] through many dangerous [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] when [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] you
