[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] for [Music] [Music] a glorious thing to us the new hopes and and how great and just as I walked into the room back there this morning uh someone met me and said brother brandom you know the a little baby or a little child or someone was prayed for at the chiaka last year it had to have its heart removed and vows or something fixed on it said the baby was healed and in the building this morning in sitting here this morning so that's fine we'll have a little testimony from it just maybe before we strike the other service and we're just a happy people now um I'll ask brother nille if he'll get a uh scripture reading of Matthew or Luke one of the Resurrection if you haven't already read it have you brother no so while we're making ready for prayer and now following this service will be the healing service after this service is over then you go to your breakfast then after that we'll return again at 9:30 and begin another service and then healing service will follow that and then baptismal services will follow that and what a beautiful time it is for baptism oh my the resurrection that's why we are baptized because of he raised again I remember before we got our babst stre here I used to take them down on the river down here early cool Frosty like mornings and baptize the people down there on the river there something about it that just it's a sacred time Easter it's a great time I was looking at brother Pat Tyler sitting over here was just talking to someone last night at our last meeting in Oklahoma I have tried to trying now and I announce this to lay aside until God would call me to do it my old Ministry of discernment because I think beginning it's the new ministry is coming in the other night no one knowing nothing about it tested on a CH coming across the platform had been born blind a baby and was totally blind about a 16y old boy and just immediately he let us scream out brother brandom I can see you in there and Pat was TI standing near right with the boy when his eyes come open for the first time in all of his life amen and so I trust that uh you here with great anticipations with myself I'm looking for something God to do for us and bring us up to another level than what we have let us bow our heads now for prayer our gracious heavenly father as we have gathered this morning here in the little Church by the side of the road we are grateful indeed for thee for all this means to us and especially on this Easter morning if there had not been an Easter we would have not been in the condition we are today that Easter is what sealed all of God's promises it confirmed them to us everything that he ever promised it was all made a reality on Easter one of the greatest days of celebrations that we can have in the year we would ask Lord the day that you will Comfort our hearts as we sit waiting and under anticipations for the Holy Spirit who came after Easter to come upon our hearts and to comfort us and to restore our faith in great powerful measures that we might walk the life that Jesus is ordained for us to walk we would pray for each and every individual and especially for those who are shut in and cannot get to the services anywhere today God be with them and may may this Easter find a real Easter for them a raising from the bad and a new health that they have never known before in life granted Lord May every preacher every servant you have around the world today that's celebrating this great Memorial may they have unction and strength and power to bring to their congregations The Waiting sheep the food food that God has in store for his people granted Lord we wait for our potion humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen go to have brother Neville now to read the scriptures Matthew 28 in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Seiler and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and roll back the Stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his rment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the separer with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples were and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me now when they were going behold some of the watch came in into the City and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while he slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure him so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world Amen that His blessings to the reading of his word now we would uh say announce again now that the services and for the morning will continue on at 9:30 as soon as we are from the the this morning service now and then the we call this our sunrise service and we are have some great things to report to you about the the meetings uh that's passed and we want you that's sick and Afflicted all of you to come with faith this morning to believe that this resurrected Jesus lives today amen and he's just the same that he ever was he hasn't changed a bit now I want to read a little portion of scripture here found in the 19th Chapter of job beginning with the 15th verse they that dwell in my house my Maids count me for a stranger I am an alien in their sight I call my servant and he gave me no answer I entreated him with my mouth my breath is strange to my wife though I treat for the children's sake of my own flesh yay young children despise me I arose and they spake against me all my inward friends of orb me and they who whom I love are turned against me my bones clave to my skin and to My Flesh and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth have pity on me have pity on me oh ye my friends for the hand of God has touched me why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words now were written oh that they were pinned in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and laid in the rock forever for I know my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth though at the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for my self my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my reings be consumed within me I would like to take for a text there found in this job 19 I know the patriarch at this time was somewhat like we are today he had been in deep troubles as we call it high waters and he was desperate many days had set on the Asing and was trying to find words to console him trying to find something that would give him courage and something that would would be a comfort to him as he seen his life fading out of him first place he was an old man somewhat 90 years old and he has been stricken by the hand of God now we know that God had not touched him with his hand but that God had permitted Satan to touch him God only has agents to do things God wants an evil done he just turns Satan loose to do it and if he wants good done he has his servant he turns loose to do it and Satan had touched job for a purpose to try because he and God had had a debate and God told Satan that I've got a servant of the earth there's none Laing whatever I say to him he'll do it he's a perfect man and a just man Satan said if you'll just let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face job not knowing all these things going on it brought the patriarch into a deep distress yet somehow when all was gone from him he still maintained his position in in Christ I know my redeemer liveth he said amen now we come to those places we all come and I believe that today that we are together year for something like that same purpose we are all on the as sheeps we have our troubles and our ups and downs and our our bad moments and our sicknesses and our heartaches and our disappointments so we come like this of a mar morning uh this Easter morning to find words of comfort like job was trying to find from his friends amen and none of them could give him any consolation because of his trouble they were accusing him of being a secret sinner then in the midst of all that trouble God gave to his rescue amen job was questioning as he knew Not only was his sickness and his boils and trouble and heartaches from losing his family and all of his wealth were just about to take his life but he was an old man well stricken in years and knowing that he was going down to the grave and knowing that he believed that there was somebody who brought him on the earth he just couldn't come here by himself and he know that he come from a father and a mother but yet that father and mother had to have someone to bring them it would revolve on back to the original who brought the first one and then he wondered this it's a strange thing that here I am walking around the higher life than what the animal is and the high life and the plant life but yet we find that he said if the tree dies it'll live again and if a a flower dies it'll live again but he said man layeth down he giveth up The Ghost and where is he his sons come to mourn over him and to do honor and he perceives it not and and he was wondering what was the matter that that God would let life like that live again such as flowers and plants but a man could not live again all this had him trouble and if we will just draw from this conclusion this morning and that's what we're here for amen we've heard the Easter Story over and over and read it back and forth and today on your radio broadcast you'll your different ministers approaching it but what I thought for my little group this morning the Lord has given me I would approach it from a different standpoint if I could amen coming to a place of why do we come to these troubles what makes these things come why should a Christian ever be perple Le why wouldn't not everything just run perfect for a Christian but it doesn't and we know it in sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners of course it is written many is the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver him from them all thank the Lord come from PR many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that would be beyond our understanding but it's always done for our good amen just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be a faith to us we would go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and we believe by Faith his word that it's going to work some good thing for us amen if we could grasp that today on this this morning if we could grasp at all of our troubles and there's none of us immune from them and if we could realize that those things are for our good it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials are brought up on us are more precious to us than gold amen for it is God giving us these trials yes after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon on us is to perfect us for his glory amen am is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come amen I want to join in this morning with job to say that I've lived long enough to know that's the truth amen I have seen it in my own life that every time a great situation Rises that I can't get around it or under or over it God makes a way and comes out glorious I just wonder how his grace ever does it but he does it and remembering all these things Satan tries to make us nervous upset us to get us to think oh why did this happened why couldn't I have been like this a few days ago when I come out of the most prettiest and most gorgeous place I ever saw in all my life it was the great building of our brother or Roberts when I've seen that solid Marvel not a window in it nowhere but how it was fixed I've been in Hollywood and I've been in King's palaces and I been in everywhere could be hardly around the world and all the swinky lovely places and hom that I never seen anything any place to compare with it no where at all all the little aluminum wires weave the the inside together and all I have never seen anything so gorgeous in all my life when I walk through there and tuck my hands and rub those pole pilasters and and the great Granite all in the form of a trinity of the Father Son and Holy Ghost the carvings of it all those things I just come from Brother Tommy osbor and seen his Great Mighty uh work there for the Lord I stood on the outside look back at that building and I thought God surely I have become a hypocrite surely I have become an outcast somewhere for these men's Ministries come off of mine and I what maybe I am so untrusted Lord that you couldn't trust me with anything like like that even the little few dollars that you let me pay for the campaigns and things now they're trying to send me to the penitentiary F why am I such a hypocrite or why am I such an untrusted person I was on the ash Heap Jo was of old when I stood outside there with just couldn't hardly get my breath from such Majesty that a poor boy BN in a Dugout a Pentecostal could do and bring that into that great mammoth building and I thought oh God maybe I am not worthy just then a little voice came down through those quarters said but I am your potion and I oh Lord God hallelujah oh I just let that stay that way then Lord because I wouldn't have the intelligence to carry on a great work like that for you and I am an illiterate person but as long as you are my potion I am yours and you will lead me am I can notot lead myself but oh Lord lead me it's those crucial hours that press us on to those sacred Sands yeah it was in the Bible and remember no matter how great the distresses Satan cannot take your life until God has finished with you amen there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there is no evil can come unless God permits it and it's for your good he's working let's think there when the floods came to destroy the world it could not destroy Noah amen Noah could not be destroyed because it God had a work for him to do amen one day down in a great Nation Under a great bondage there was some Hebrew children that we know as Shadrach and mesach and abedo and it came to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done they had to their their faith was put to a test amen and when their faith is put to a test then don't fail stay right with what you believe and when their faith faith was put to a test and they went to a crucial hour not only did they go to a a a sheep but they went into a fiery furnace but Satan could not destroy them for God's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope I know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope here we are assured that God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to the image amen praise the name of Lord Satan could not take them he canot drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished Hallelujah he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished Hallelujah he could not kill job with balls and trouble until the purpose of God had been finished praise the Lord neither could the lions eat Daniel until God's purpose had been finished amen neither could death in old age take Abraham amen until the purpose of God had been finished Hallelujah and neither can it take you amen or can it take me Hallelujah until the purpose of God of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and why does God let troubles come God harness his trouble puts bits in its mouth amen and makes it obey him amen those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god oh amen praise the Lord there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in the float 40 days and nights in a storm in the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time amen the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he had went through the tribulation then he saw the promise hallelujah amen that's way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation I like that poem or song must I be carried home to heaven on a flowerly bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas Hallelujah we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations amen that's better than comfort in peace oh amen our Comforts is just beyond the river Hallelujah [Music] [Music]
