your seat and uh while we once again greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus we have a uh Victoria Thomas that's a sister uh marriage daughter visiting with us this morning good to see you vague praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord our victories believe in God for the complete healing and that the law will be able to to give her her strength back amen and uh that's that's all for our visitor later Sister Bridget called this morning she's not feeling well good to see sister Joy I learned she was not feeling well too so we will remember them in prayer that the Lord will will be able to strengthen our sisters amen I will go back this morning just before we get into the preaching of the word thank you musicians that would be that would be it for the mythical for now amen and then we would trust to see what will happen after the service praise the Lord but we thank the Lord and it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen and uh I will tell you a truth confession is the other uh I've not have not recovered for some reason I have not recovered from those meetings in South Africa I've just been uh kind of been struggling with my strength amen for some reason I mean I've not and I recovered from from those meetings here so keep praying for me and that the law will just kind of give me back my strength praise the Lord so uh this morning I like to go over some few things from uh from the tape that was played this morning we in marriage and divorce for many of you that have been following the pleasure of the tape and if you realize we were going through the entire series of the tips leading to marriage and divorce and after marriage and divorce so we end up in a serious year if you've been following the tip if that you are not doing good to yourself praise the Lord and uh if uh if if the the if the technicians back there have my my notes up I just want to go to their first tape there's something brother Brandon said it kind of confirmed something that I had on my heart so uh uh he said so yeah that uh um and now this morning is that great subject we we are to discuss on marriage and divorce and the reason I made it Sunday school now that caught my mind because if you realize we we for for for The Good Wife now we've been we've been playing tapes for for our Sunday school session it is not because we don't have teachers to do that but you will realize if you go back and you look at that uh uh you take Sunday school you will see that brother Branham was making those tapes on Sunday school he will say the other uh you know we take this subject as a Sunday school you know so he will come to the Tabernacle he would teach a subject during Sunday school and then uh and then uh later the regular service but anivia will be in charge of the regular service so most of the tips especially after the opening of the sales most of those tapes were taught for Sunday school and he says uh he says here uh this morning is the great subject we have been uh to discuss on marriage and Davos and the reason I made a Sunday school so that we could talk about it and take our time instead of preaching the sermon on it it is a teaching from the scripture so so uh and that's what we want to do that's what we want to do one of the reason major reason did is that I want the voice of the messenger to go forth from this Tabernacle there's one the second reason there is to be able to encourage you to listen to The Prophet amen if you don't do it on your own and maybe you choose not to come on time Sunday morning then you will not listen to The Prophet but if you come here during the Sunday School time you will have a such a short session to listen to uh brother Brandon and uh and and and again I would say is if you listen to anything on the table whether at home or during during the Sunday School period year and you have a question if you create a question in your mind not only on this subject or marriage and divorce but any tip that is played I remember brother Dan uh preaching one of his message he preached is that three minutes to midnight and he says you know I was listening to brother Brandon down and brother Branham said he picked up on tape he gave him my inspiration to preach so that's good praise the Lord I do the same also amen I do the same also and I think that's the way the Holy Spirit deal with us praise the Lord so uh if you if anything create a question on your mind just just write it down give it to the day comes and uh if it is necessary I will answer it before the congregation if not if I can be able to discern who write it I will call you and we will talk about it praise the Lord amen so if I can descend your writing and you don't have your answer then you get back to the Deacon or you come to see me then I know who wrote it praise the Lord so uh uh but it is it is in a place that uh you know uh let's encourage ourselves to to uh uh Place those tips it is very important amen it is very important even the ones that are playing here go back play it listing pick up some things ask questions praise the Lord because uh one thing that uh uh uh you know we we we want to know and instruct ourselves and there is nothing that we are forcing down your throat if God do not give it to you by Revelation there is no way you will swallow it the way God feed his children is by revelation we are not forcing anything down your throat no praise the Lord and if it is if it is the revelation of God's word it will be right in this Bible amen there are things that are being seen in the scripture uh uh that was one of the reasons why I brought that little picture last Sunday on design it was it was it was to show you that uh not only in the animals now only in the things that God created but you have to realize that everything was created by his word amen so the word is the designer God's word is is is uh is is a designer is is is is the blueprint praise the Lord so just like how you see uh uh the design in the bird that's another there's another animal I was looking at you know uh uh uh I I stumbled into these things as I'm looking up over the place with a kind of a curious mind and uh uh but I'm stay I'm still Gathering Gathering Man pictures and and things uh to to share that with you but it was it was very very very amazing very amazing I will share that with you as I get myself together on that a little little bit on the on the zebra no matter the zebra the uh how you can call it now the giraffe okay and uh is is very amazing very amazing when you when you look into some of the things that are that are you know that are that are there very amazing it has it has a very powerful blood pressure to be able to take the blood from his heart to its long neck and if you have that blood pressure you will die instantly if a human will have that blood pressure that runs in the giraffe to take the blood from his heart to to his neck to this head you would die but the the the beautiful thing there is there now and I was keeping this thing and I'm into it okay the beautiful thing there is the other when a jirai put his it's neck down to to drink is vulnerable with that blood pressure the brain should blow off with that powerful blood pressure when the giraffe put his neck down the the brain should blow off immediately but God puts something there in the giraffe's head like a sponge that control the blood pressure and it stopped that powerful blood pressure from getting down to the Giroud neck you know so for that animal to be able to bend his hair down and put his head up if there was not a design that controls the the blood pressure it would not survive praise the Lord so when David said have fearful and wonderfully that we are made there's a great intelligence behind that now so let me get through this whole uh uh Sunday school thing just to encourage you but bam said it again on that tape he said this morning out there some things that could not be said out before a mixed audience and some that are probably will say must be understand he said take it from me your brother to the best that I know you will sit in the doctor's office and listening to him and he who have to say very plain words to you praise the Lord sometimes that's not what you want to hear but the reason why you go to the doctor because you have confidence in him and if you don't have confidence don't go there because it's not going to help you it does not help you for you to sit down to listen to a person and you are doubting everything they are saying it does not help you praise the Lord it does not help you I don't know what you want me to say just write a note bring it to the office say this is what I want you to say if I have time I will slot it in but you have to be a calling to the word and it must be a revelation to me praise the Lord so you see there's a blood brand saying here you say you will go we go to the doctor we sit down and sometimes they have to say plain words to us to the best of their their medical study to their the best of their examination they have to tell you this is what I see praise the Lord amen but we also have the word of the great physician so you can think what the doctor says don't don't fight against it don't fight against it don't fight against it because if you fight against it and you bring it to the great physician it's going to be conflicting [Music] praise the Lord for you to doubt what the doctor says it does not give you a lot of ground to believe what the great physician says the right attitude is to say Lord this is what the doctor says and I'm bringing it to lay it upon your world because I know you have the fantasy [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord that's how Faith Works praise the Lord Faith does not work by deny denied is fear is fear sometimes that throw people into deny Faith does not works like that praise the Lord so what I mean uh there's uh so yeah but I'm saying this here you say damn you listen to him he will have to say plain words to You and some of you young ladies and young men I don't want you to get the wrong impression and that's that's what I took this uh uh because uh as you as you listen to the table what about home in home or a year I don't want you to get the wrong Impressions amen don't come to a full-stop conclusion until you really understand the subject you know because just like brother Brandon would say here he says I don't want you to get a wrong impression I want you to believe and just sit still remember truth has to be and Truth has got to be stated truth he says this scripture after he read the scripture he says this scripture the question confronting Jesus at the beginning of his ministry he will he will show us that this was a question through all ages it was the question from Genesis to revelation praise the Lord because just like it was a question in Genesis Genesis chapter 3 that's the same way it's a question in Revelation because we are seeing two women that are claiming to be the bride amen so it creates a question who is the bride so he says yeah this scripture the question confronting Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and a confront Moses at the beginning of his ministry it's a foremost question in believer's heart the Sinners don't care but it's to Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he knows how to do to live right before God therefore it's any question come up on religion then the marriage and divorce case come up see because it is the cause of the original sin praise the Lord amen the cause of the original sin there were two male one female if there were two males two female we would not have that problem but there were two male in the beginning with one female praise the Lord amen and by then when it came to our time is one meal with seven female seven women would take hold to one man in the beginning it was two mil to one female that's what caused the problem so that's what better Brandon is saying here is is that's that's the reason why every time that subject comes up it becomes very important so uh he says because is the cause of the original sins that's where sin started and that's the reason is brought up every time because it is the very beginning of the same question praise the Lord so we we will be going through the series like I said you know if you can make a year on time follow the portion that will be played in church you have a question write it down if you want to follow it at home you can follow it the the the the the services online you can play it drive into church and just to help create an atmosphere to get into the Sunday morning service let's stand on our feet and go right to the word praise the Lord as we will trust this morning that the Lord will just give us the strength to be able to bring something to you but uh earnestly requests that you continue to keep me in prayer that the Lord will just just give me my strength amen he will give me my strength I'm telling you I've never been wept out like the way I feel like being wiped out let's go to the word this morning Genesis chapter 15. Genesis chapter 15. praise the Lord praise the Lord amen if you uh you you get used to preaching with emotions and you don't have strength then you become a teacher you know you become a teacher and you take your time amen praise the Lord I realize sometimes I admired you know uh brother Jordan and brother Dan you know to stay right here and yet their word is forceful it looks like for me to push my word I have to move let's go [Laughter] but we are made different Genesis chapter 15 let's read after these things after War thing the Lord bless you you can have your seat Genesis chapter 14. let's go back [Music] after War thing after these things after one thing after the visit to Abraham so Genesis 15 will not make a lot of sense to you until you go back to Genesis 14 and see what happened before Abraham was brought to Genesis 15. so let's go back a little bit and then we we would read yeah we would pick up few of what took place here over we see here is where Abraham I'm his household to get his uh his brother lot uh uh uh that was that was that was ticking praise the Lord and uh because of that all right from verse 14 and when Abraham heard his brother was taking captive he am his trained servants born in his own house 300 and 18 MPS and persuade him unto them and he and he divided himself against them he and his servant by night and smoke them and and pursued them onto our Harbor which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the girls and and also brought again his brother Lord and his goals praise the Lord and the women also and the people and the king of Surah went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of the Chad doll lomites and all the kings that were with him at the Violet of Sheva which is the king of Dil and uh Melchizedek the king of Salem brought for Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God praise the Lord now after marriage and divorce brother Brandon we now preach for us who is this melchized so we'll have time to listen to there too it's all part of the series of marriage and Devils it's very is is is very uh uh unique in a way that everything plays out if I start talking and I will miss my trained off thoughts so let's just stay right to you and he blessed him because he said bless Abraham and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth now he's repeating to Abraham the very promise that was given to Abraham amen he's he's repeating to Abraham and blessed be the most high God which have uh uh delivered our enemies into the hand and he gave him TI of all and the king of Sodom said unto Abraham gave me the persons and take the goose to thyself and Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hands unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from take from a trade even to a shoe lashes and that I will not take anything that is dying at least thou should have said I have made Abraham rich praise the Lord save only that wish the young men have eaten amen the portion of the man which went with me now so that's what the Bible is saying after these things so you get the picture after Abraham has gone down there and uh uh he has he has gone to to rescue his Fallen brother now you have to remember now we've been talking around exceeding righteousness that's what we've been talking about so we we have to keep that subject in mind I know uh last Sunday I I saw the message there and and the title is uh something about design but that was just that was just above my notes but we stayed part of our series of uh of righteousness that we've been talking about exceeding Rogers and I want you to keep that in mind now as we look at the subject as we look at the subject from the very beginning there was something that I was driving there for us to be able to understand how God playing of redemption how God plane of redemption was the very reason of creation praise the Lord there are very few places uh Genesis uh uh over in Jeremiah in few places in the Bible what the Bible talks about creation but right from Genesis to Revelation Redemption is play out in types and Shadow and different ways so Redemption is very very important and I would say this this morning Redemption should be influencing Our Lives our action if we are if you are taking an action to do anything the question behind it is that how is this applied to Redemption praise the Lord amen just like I said uh Paul talks about uh uh if if I believe in wife wants to stay with an unbelieving husband he says the man will be Sanctified by by her faith what he says that what is the driving thought it's not just to keep a man in her life but the talk behind it is that for the fact that her faith will sanctify the man is redemption amen why will uh uh Jesus live in a bunch of Parables about forgiveness you know if a brother how many times seventy thousand why is there what what is behind the Redemption while we ask God for Mercy why we must leave our our our sacrifice our Altar and go and make it right with a brother or make it right with a sister to make it right with somebody that we have done why we should do that it's all because of redemption so if Redemption the thought of redemption is not influencing our decision you will realize that you will never glorify God in what you are doing because it is that thought of redemption that make us to do things even beyond our better judgment you are doing it because the word says so in uh uh Joshua paralyzed uh uh efficient parallel Joshua better Brandon would take this very scripture that we are talking about uh Abraham going out to redeem his Fallen brother you can go back and study that brother Brown would take that and he will say how God adopted Abraham Abraham experienced his adoption God put him aside and sent and sent mechanic to to do to to offer communion to Abraham because Abraham did what was in God's mind Lord was the one that brought the first about fighting over Carlos Abraham gave him the auction you choose wherever you want to go you go left I will go right what you you make the choice give him the first uh uh uh preference amen and Abraham where I mean lot went away and and and and and yerry said he got into trouble he never even sent a letter Abraham heard about it what was the Draven thought behind him Redemption so you will see uh uh behind behind lord of the types behind a lot of the times sometimes the times that are that that can even choke us up like the one we read there over in uh uh uh uh Genesis 38 there with with uh with uh with chairman there is something here uh in in line with that I want to show you if the if the I would attack people they can go to our our pictures you go go to the ones that have uh our boss Ruth Obel Jesse and David if you can put that picture up and then cut this light off you'll not be able to see it uh I hope you can see it better now this is Genesis where were we reading is it 38 or 39 was that Genesis 38 or 39 no no no no now what we read the story about tema that was Genesis today this is Genesis 38 in the Hebrew Bible this is Genesis 38 in the Hebrew Bible and after every 49 letter the fifth year letter spell boss because you have to realize that uh uh I loved it someone said every language go back to Jerusalem okay those on the west of the of Jerusalem derides from left to right and the other ones right you know so the the Hebrew goes from right to left just like Arabic and all the other language that goes from right to left and and we on this side of Jerusalem and we go from from uh from from left to right now so uh uh and then every 49 letter in the Hebrew Bible this this is this is very amazing I mean it blew my mind when I was when I was studying this I have I have a uh steady thing I use on uh what I try to do parallel I look through through the the you know the great just just to be able to help me you know in a way my mind my mind runs but it's it it amazed me when I saw this it makes me blew my mind every 49 letter the first 49 letter I spell out Boaz the next 49 after every 49 uh then you you know it spell out the word ruth is spelled out of the word Obel is spelled out Jesse is spelled out and uh uh just again again is for us to be able to see that this is God's internal thoughts hmm this is God's internal thoughts that write in their story that might look like an abominable story because it's not a decent story with all of the the Mysteries we try to to bring out of it is not a decent story it will have to it will have to be that God has healed something profound in that for him to Allure in his word praise the Lord amen and but to be able to see that is holding such I mean it brings out uh the the the the very you take this over to the Book of Matthew it brings out the very genology of Jesus Christ the Lord and for it to be able to line it up just exactly not not even missing it but for it to be placed just in the order and then and the reason why I keep bringing this thing is to is to bring that that emphasis which cannot be we cannot over emphasize but we will do the best that we can to to you know to to kind of impress our mind how the word of God is very important Heaven and Earth will pass away amen Heaven and Earth will pass away but now one jot of God's word will fail praise the Lord amen as you see that and that is the reason why we have I mean we we have to to brother bamboo talks about the importance of Revelation is because even our Bible that we have the Old Testament was translated from the Hebrew the New Testament was translated from the Greek and and and all of these men that did this translation they did their best to be able to bring us what was there but but you see men laboring to do their best we have heard the same thing around the message people that have tried to write the message in different languages that's where we have the birth of all of these false doctrines that have come come around the world because somebody listening to brother Brandon and they are doing their best with what they know in English to translate into German or something else they express and say something completely different and if the spirit of Revelation don't help them those people are going to do it in false Doctrine but because God promised that not one of his Elias will be deceived he will find a way to bring a balance to Thy Word amen amen we're getting and corrected from behind the pulpit and people will say I knew there was something with that I knew there was something with that glory be to God so I mean when I when I saw that I would just I mean all of these things they can just they can just finish the strength in me and I'm saying oh my God how can this be how can this be how can this be praise the Lord but we thank the Lord amen we thank God because he's faithful so yeah we read the scripture after these things and now we are going back to see the thing that happened that God is about to speak this word to Abraham yeah Genesis 15 after these things the the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision same fear not Abraham I am the shield and the exceeding great reward does something wrap your mind here when you read that why is God expressing himself to Abraham Abraham just refused a reward he just refuse something from the king of of of of Sodom and say I will not take even down to a shoelace I will take a thread I won't take a trade I'm not doing this because I want your favor or I want your blessing and God honoring Abraham amen and coming to him right after that and saying I am You're great and your exceeding reward let me tell you people God Rewards when we do the right thing God Rewards the Bible say he's the rewarder of them that diligently seeking he's not evil to forget your labor of love God Rewards praise the Lord God Rewards God rewards in good health praise the Lord amen God Rewards in also good homes those are some other things that we get into this morning I'm just I'm just I'm just so I'm just so uh all over the place and and just trusting that God will will be able to help me but I mean you just you just think about it you think about it and and and and you say so uh you know you and and and God coming to to to to to Abraham and uh and expressing himself to Abraham this way that uh I am your great and you're exceeding reward now what are we talking about we are talking about uh uh righteousness that exceed amen righteousness that exceeds Jesus is the righteousness I see the righteousness of the strap and Pharisees so we will look we will look at that word exceed exceeding what it means because it goes through the Scripture it does not only talks about uh righteousness the Bible talks about exceeding Faith exceeding power what does that means glory be to God are we together but I mean if I don't if I can if I don't say anything because I just don't feel like saying anything I just feel like holding you on this one structure on this one verse to remind you that God Rewards praise the Lord God Rewards glory be to God and if he followed the pep this morning brother Benham is talking about how thy young baptist boy came to him and said Brother Band of me you know this message that you have preached uh uh can be can be copied down as the 23rd chapter and why him saying that he just he just started prophesying over Broadband speaking in tongues and the interpretation came in uh and and and and their God is is declaring over brother Branham because because of this tremendous decision because of your choice they ask for fake eggs be unto you are calling to your faith it's the same as be it unto you according to your choice praise the Lord that's what faith is is the choice that we make based on God's word that's what faith is it's not this thing that we think there is I feel it no it's the choice that you make the choice you make to live your life the choice you make for the stain you take that's your faith praise the Lord fear that hey Brandon I'm your and uh and that exceeding great reward but Abraham had a question in his mind they have something that have been bothering him bugging him even though he could gather the strength to go in and and fight her for Lord but there is something in his mind there's a cloud in his mind there's a question in his mind and what is this question Abraham said Lord God what will thy give me sin I go childish praise the Lord what will you give me God is expressing himself I am your great and your exceeded reward you see it is that place where we have the word of God we know the Bible says God will bless us God will provide our needs he will take care of us but yet it saved us now answer the question that is in our mind the question is when when will it happen God I know you would do it but when that's the same thing that Abraham is asking God I know Lord he says he says I mean I I mean uh uh what what a what a dream water than experience you know what a God made Abraham on the bed whether it was by the dream or the vision whatever way that God was speaking to Abraham it was just a blessing you know it's it's almost like brother Branham said in the message I he says when you know what the word of God said and you do that what the word of God said he said it's just like eating honey out of the score of a lion that's what that's what uh uh uh something there the very lion he killed he ate honey out of the scar praise the Lord amen so it is almost like waking up and and God coming to Abraham and saying I'm your greatest reward Abraham getting the feeling oh thank God amen even if I was tempted to take what the what the king of Sodom gave me thank God I did not corrupt myself what could have happened if I would have taken what the king of Sodom gave thank God what a feeling it brings what a feeling it brings to you that oh God thank God I did the right thing God is saying I'm your great and your exceeding reward praise the Lord he said okay God but now now I'm childless all this thing we are talking I'm childish praise the Lord as many of you people are saying all this thing we are talking I'm not married yet praise the Lord I I don't have a job yet pray whatever whatever is is you are dealing with whatever is in your mind I don't have the Holy Ghost yet oh I don't have victory in this area in my life yet praise the Lord amen you see the thing there is the other uh uh people will always say if you are dealing with that it means that you don't have faith that's not truth truth our faith does not take away your reality praise the Lord Faith makes you to identify your reality and yet believe God you identify I'm dealing with this but I believe God is able to deliver me [Applause] that's not a Pentecostal fail it does not make you to deny your reality you identify your reality you identify your struggle but your faith raise your head up and said I know my redeemer lives I know he can deliver me foreign it means that you don't have faith that's not true praise the Lord some of us that say those things we are bad about things we know we are bad about it we try to act like we are Superman but you know you are bothered Faith helps you to identify your reality he said Lord God what will thy give me sin I go chalice and the only boy that I have in my house is Eleazar praise the Lord his and Abraham said behold to to me thou have given no seed and low one bone in my house he's the one that I'm bringing up praise the Lord I'm beginning to trust things to him he's becoming the leader of my house of Damascus praise the Lord so God so Abraham is taking God into a sincere conversation conversation he's not he's not struggling he's not uh I I I don't want to talk like this as if to say I'm doubting praise the Lord God already know your heart so talk to God the way you feel talk to God the way you feel inside because you can deceive him you can't impress him I I don't want to pray as if to say I'm doubting say Lord I'm struggling here I'm strong I need you I I need your help praise the Lord the scripture said verse 4. behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be done here but he that shall come forth out of that own bowel shall be down here's Abraham is having conversation God speaking back to him because this man is on speaking terms with God Amen praise the Lord he then not made his situation to weaken his prayer life amen the more that his situation is standing before him the more he's he's on speaking terms with God so he speak to God God speaking back to him amen praise the Lord and uh and he brought him where am I okay verse 5. you brought him for the brother and said look now towards the heavens and tell the Stars if if if if they'll be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be praise the Lord amen and Abraham believed in the Lord praise the Lord Abraham believed in the Lord and it was counted to him for righteousness after God God dealing with Abraham he got down praying and and and and and the word of the law spoke back to him after God God dealing with Abraham in that time of conversation or praying or whatever was going on Abraham woke up with a strength amen Abraham believed the Lord and it was counted unto him praise the Lord even though he have not received his heart desire but he still believed that God was more than able something from God's word brought Comfort to Abraham I don't know when yet but I believe it it was that attitude that God looks at encountered Abraham as a righteous man despite where his fears that's probably his struggles but God looks at the attitude of Abraham believing his word after he makes all his complaints after he confessed all his inabilities but yeah he can take God's word God is saying nor Eliza will not be the one you will have a son that will comes out of you looking at his age and looking at the age of Sarah and everything and yet God Abraham said amen God Hallelujah you spoke to me this morning through the message you spoke to me through your word amen and God looks at that attitude amen he looks at that attitude of of believing his word that's what he called righteous we look at the Arts of a person life and call the righteous the art of believing God's word that's what God called righteous are we together and he believed the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness Romans chapter 4. let's go to Romans chapter 4. praise the Lord Hallelujah let's go in Romans chapter four we can we're coming back to that Genesis 10 year I am that great and I exceeding reward so you see yeah God is rewarding Abraham with righteousness not because Abraham say God I still believe your word but Abraham confessed his inability to the righteous one and that's what God loved God love a sincere heart and that's what Jesus they're not appreciate of the Pharisees because he could see their heart different from the action with the gift that he was born in he could see their heart right there is Simon house he can look at some on heart and see that this guy just brought me down here to make a joke out of me and he can look down at that woman's heart weeping there even though she has a bad repetition but he can see in her heart that she identify that this is the Messiah this is a man of God he must not be treated like this if we will just realized that God looks at the heart if we will realize that it's not what we put on he looks at the heart and that's what Solomon said we must guide our heart you must guide your heart don't allow bitterness to get in your heart don't allow your heart to misunderstand things because a wounded spirit who can heal praise the Lord when something when something affects your heart it can bring sickness now what better bound with talks about how Warrior brings sickness the fear and all of those things Romans chapter 4 the Apostle Paul this great teacher will bring us down to this place oh Hallelujah you love the Lord this morning amen I'm not even started preaching here my time is off but that's fine I believe I've said something to help you amen hmm if you don't remember anything remember that God Rewards he rewards our actions praise the Lord he reward our actions and especially to you young people the Bible says obey your father and mother let me not go ahead of myself because I want I want to come to that scripture the reason why is that there are things just like what we did to understand why God is expressing to Abraham the Bible place it in a way after these things it makes you curious to go back Revelation chapter 4 the Bible says after this brother Branham say after what he said after the church ages so you will not appreciate Revelation chapter 4 until you go to see what happened oh my God it's the Scarlet that wrote the Bible that break them into chapter but in the original straw is just one thing that rolls on and on and on and on even in the in in the original straw where where the passage end when you come to our Bible sometimes it's a middle verse of another chapter so the grace of connecting the events how one event leads to another comes by understanding the context praise the Lord now so Romans chapter 4. what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh has found when we think about Abraham flesh we think about Abraham weakness in his lies and everything that he did what can we say that that he have found for If Abraham were justified by works amen he have whereof to Glory but not before God if he was just looking at his works how much what he can do then you know how much time he can pray how much time he can he can read and how come he if he if it was just those things that he was counting on he can glory in himself he can make himself to feel good but not before God but not before God so it will tell you that Abraham action Abraham action of Goring after a falling brother was not to be praised by a lot was not to have a connection with the king of Sodom he did it because he realized her brother has fallen from Grace praise the Lord and let him that stand there take Heat at least he fought also the best thing to do let me go and get him off so we can be too standing are we together for what Syria the scripture Abraham Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness that's what the scripture says the scripture they now speak of Abraham Works they did not speak Abraham believed God now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace bar of debt praise the Lord if we think we can pay the debt of sin by by doing paintings and doing this there was that was the cursed thing that the Roman Church brought and introduced into Christianity praise the Lord that they have that that is that is just that is just a robin over uh uh the the the the car Master movement saw seed and and people would think that if they can do these things then they can gain God's favor praise the Lord Hallelujah you have to realize that Grace is on meritable favor praise the Lord amen you receive from God something that you do not marry amen amen then you know what Mercy is Mercy is also you receive from God what you do not deserve because what we deserve is a whip and mercy that's not what we deserve when we look at our action we look at our stubbornness what we deserve is Judgment condemnation but when God gave Mercy every morning that's why we can be grateful because we don't deserve it praise the Lord it's the same it's just it's just uh you know what it's just coming both ways and leave us out there is nothing nothing of ourself now so the scripture says here now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace but of there but to him that walketh net but believe on him they are justifying amen they're ongoing his faith is counted that faith their faith is counted praise the Lord amen his faith is counted for righteousness your faith in the promised word let me let me read them your faith in the promised word is counter for righteousness but to him that worketh met Bob believed on him that justify it they're ongoing his faith is counter for righteousness even as David also described they were understanding that the way God was dealing with him he understood it that if God was dealing with me not calling to my iniquity I will be dead praise the Lord so he honest to it and he said blessed is the man unto whom God impute righteousness with our works blessed is the man that God will call A righteous Son of God a righteous daughter of God better man him said because you are believing in the righteous one you are confessing to the righteous one you are trusting in the righteous one Hallelujah amen can you think about it a man after God's Own Heart that God will Express that you know and and and and and and and and make a man to to realize that you are a man after my own heart his desire of bringing the world back into the camp praise the Lord and everything that David but to realize that in the midst of all of that he had one of the worst fault praise the Lord he had one of the worst fought that even even all through the scripture the Bible will always refer to Solomon mother as you re uriah's wife praise the Lord can you imagine what it is when David comes to church and the preacher will be saying something and says uh you know uriah's wife you know what happened couple of years ago with uriah's wife if you know how Debbie fed he says in the congregation praise the Lord but yet he honors too that blessed is the man to whom that God do not impute his iniquity even David also describe the blessedness of the man to whom God imputed righteousness with our work saying blessed are they whose iniquity are forgiven and whose Saints are covered blessed is the man to whom the law will not impute iniquity praise the Lord amen am that that uh how can we call it backslided or or uh uh uh uh you know the Bible belong such a unique place in the scripture praise the Lord unique place in the scripture that God is dealing with him balam dreams and vision his heart they are Vindicated by scripture because the only place in the Bible where you can confirm the styles that the wise men saw is by uh Balaam prophecy a style will rise out of Jacob praise the Lord it's not much of a false prophet as you would think he has a place he has a very unique place now even he showed up over in the Book of Revelation bellam knew that these people were blessed he knew that there is no word there is nothing that balak is going to pay him that we work because from the very time he prayed God told him those people are blessed praise the Lord amen he said I have not be held iniquity in Jacob I tried I tried I'm not saying nothing wrong but you know what Bill I'm dead you know what Bill I'm dead just to please balak he advised balak and told him you know how you will get these people send your girls among them praise the Lord he still wanted that favor so he advised Bala to bring them down to Barbour praise the Lord he said flesh is flesh I know they have a pillow of fire leading them I know there is Supernatural that is happening in their mess but strip the women naked praise the Lord just just get them to that place that's the reason why the Book of Revelation recorded villain and that's what the Bible says in the Book of Revelation he is the one that instructed by like that there is no way I can curse these people there is no way he went on the different types of the mountains every place that he went when you look at them he saw something Supernatural he can't see anything wrong why because the shout of the King was in the camp praise the Lord the Lord was among his people so he advised by like he says the way to get him is to bring them down to her feet don't stop them from coming true advise them just like how the Philistines wanted to know the strength of something what did they do the god of woman are we together blessed is the man in whom the Lord will not impure iniquity so faith is counter for righteousness when we can believe God believe God now not argue with the word of God not struggle with the word of God but take the word of God Lord your word is truth but I'm struggling Lord I believe my unbelief praise the Lord Lord I believe I believe the message of the hour I believe the word of God will help my own belief you know where my struggles are you know the things I'm dealing with don't put them off and think they will fly away supernaturally no address it identify it it's it's it's Grace it's the grace that is given to us in this hour because this is the hour of the Overcomers amen this is the hour of the Overcomers that's the reason why they're formed as the truth of God's word has come in this age like I said I've never even started preaching yet but it's it's okay we get it somewhere amen we are getting somewhere Hallelujah we are getting somewhere people glory be to God Hallelujah what if you if you heard my prayer requesting you and you said a word of prayer I can feed it amen I can feed it oh yeah I wanted to show you this also as I was talking on the emphasis of God's word Potter put the uh the slide up that have to do with Matthew chapter five uh I don't know how it's showing on you but it looks on my end it's the last slide uh is is uh it has that one jot or one title I wanted to show this to you because it's it's all part of our reading Jesus says now one job or one title will will uh we pass away okay if you want to just switch this light up again for us now so uh uh uh the English word say the Hebrew word is yuck and and it is just this apostrophe that what Jesus was referring to it looks like an apostrophe that I I will keep this in my mind there's another there's another scripture that I will bring to you to show you a York in in the Bible when Jesus said when they asked Jesus and he says my lord said unto my Lord what change that statement was just an apostrophe it's in the sense that Jesus is saying thing that I have come to destroy the Lord or the prophets have not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till heaven and have passed one judge one yard or one title not a period not an apostrophe of God's word we ever fail God will make sure that every dot in his word he would he would point he would put every God he will cross every team and just as how he would do it in the Fulfillment of his word that is the same thing he would do in our life praise the Lord he will make sure that every doctor needs to be placed in your life will be in place brother Branham said if he has to take you on the sick bed he will make sure he laid you down and put that dog across the team image the same way that now one dot our title will fall God will watch over his word and everything will fulfill just as he said it in fulfilling his word in the Bible and also fulfilling his word that is the purpose for your life he will make sure that every dot will be in place and every tea will be crossed you can trust him for that praise the Lord glory be to God are we together amen amen amen amen where am I where am I that let's go to an efficient efficient let's go to Ephesians chapter five Ephesians chapter five uh It's haunting my mind is haunting my mind Ephesians chapter 5. Ephesians chapter 5. now if you read the book of Ephesians brother Branham says efficient parallel Joshua he said just like how the book of Ephesians I mean the Book of Joshua plays the children of Israel rightly in the promised land he said that is the same thing that the book of Ephesians does a place to Believers right into the promise okay now so if you go through the book of Ephesians let's we will take that in in a kind of a fast way now in Ephesians chapter one that's where Paul talks about blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places so Ephesians chapter 1 brings us from the mind of God it's something that God did in his mind he blessed us I call him as he has chosen us before the foundation of the word so Ephesians chapter 1 takes us before there was a beginning it shows us what God did before he even brought you here okay that's what Ephesians 1 uh would do Ephesians chapter 2 what it does is there the Bible says you there were uh you have he quickened that were once dead in sin and trespass so Ephesians chapter 2 shows us our first birth we were born in sin and trespass but he have quick enough okay so better man is showing us that the Apostle Paul is placing us he's telling us that we we did not begin on whatever your birthday is your actual birthday goes back to the man of God praise the Lord amen now I'm not I'm not studying any Doctrine here and saying don't celebrate your birthday please please thank you your actual birthday because that religious groups do these things praise the Lord people get so fanatic I don't care about birthday I was born in the mind of God when they don't even understand what they're talking about they don't have a life to reflect it now so uh so uh Ephesians chapter 2 brings you into your your your flip Earth Ephesians chapter one goes back to the man of God something that we are not conscious of we were not conscious of it that God choose us in him for us to be holy we were never conscious of it now efficient 2 brings us to our natural birth that we were born and seen in trespass and and and as as efficient two goals uh in verse 8 it says for by grace are you safe through faith so it brings us through our effort joining to show us that we were born in sin and trespass but we are saved by grace because God rich in Mercy amen because God reached in Mercy now when you come to Ephesians chapter 3 I'm just trying to do a a quick run here in Ephesians chapter 3 you will see where we are placed in the body we are placed in the body of Jesus Christ so we are saved by grace and because now we are saved by grace we are placed in the body let me take my verse here in Ephesians chapter three I never I never thought about this or else I could have done a good job in in lining up my my verses but uh now look here the Bible says verse 14 for this cause I bow my knees toward the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is near what's the family name the Lord Jesus Christ so when we are saved by grace Ephesians chapter 3 introduce us into the family he puts us in the family the family of God praise the Lord now and and now Ephesians chapter 4 where Ephesians chapter 4 brings us now the Bible says there is one body and one spirit that verse four even as we are called in one hope of our calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God the father of the father of all who is above all and true all and in you all praise the Lord but unto every one of us is giving Grace according to measure so what Paul is doing here now he's saying the other I identified our natural birth we are born in sin we are saved by grace we are placed into the family of God then God put us under his protective kid of the faithful Ministry tonight goddess so in Ephesians chapter 4 he's going to identify a fight for Ministry that is lacking onto the charity the same with the Caribbean God the throne there is a fight for Ministry that must guide us to the treat of life gun yeah it's guiding us back to what is in Ephesians chapter one it's just the love story of redemption this is your actual life that's the reason why you were born wherever you were born the day you were born and how you were born and that's the reason why you went through whatever you are when because this is the Journey of your life God choose you before the foundation of the word that you should lay before him holy Without Blame not depending on your ability but depending on what he's able to do because that is his word that was his choosing he's more than able to bring it to pass what are you believing or not if you don't believe it you will only deprive yourself and you will be enslaved to your sinful nature and make excuse of it but if you believe it you become an overcomer so Ephesians chapter 4 noun introduce you a post you on the F5 for Ministry for you to be able to identify the gifts that is in you the Bible says here uh come on now help me praise the Lord he gives some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some Pastor teacher for the perfecting of the sins for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body till we all come to the unity of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God onto a perfect man not seamless perfection amen but on to a mature man because you see God did not made babies don't be out don't don't get me wrong now the Bible says God said let's make man let us make man in our image that's the reason why that very statement will tell you that there is no place for infant baptism in the scripture praise the Lord because the blood covers the child until they reach to the age of accountability that's when that's when gods are looking down upon their child to start breaking forth his work of creation yeah in your life praise the Lord every child goes right into the hands of God if you leave this life before the age of maturity so you see that the sins that is behind this is that the purpose of the Gospel is to make sounds and daughter in the image of God he's the one he used his word to work on us are we together praise the Lord so if we still want to play babies and be baby God is not he's he's not he's not attracted to that he's not attracted to that God is attracted to sonship here God is attracted to responsibility when you when you start learning to be responsible praise the Lord that's why he said tractor talk now bunch of complain and you complain about everything just looking for painting and looking for somebody to feel sorry for you God is not interested in that that's a baby you need butter to suck or we can give you a pacifier you pick this little thing you suck on it you chunky iron Crown wow wow wow when will we be a Son of God or the god of God still on God's word [Music] he can trust the past and look for the new beginning we say Sarah creating God he can give you a new beginning right now he can give you a new beginning [Music] always dragging things from the past just looking for some kind of attention to complain and whine and one and one you can never go anywhere with god with that kind of for attitude so we can come to the Statue of a perfect man onto the measure of the Statue of the fullness he says verse 14 there we hence for be no more children what no more children oh let me wait for the boys to put that thing up so we can read it together we can be no more children what the Bible says tall and fourth carried away with everything every small thing we want wow blow it out of proportion what kind of God we said that is not in control what can I call yourself that is not in control that whatsoever you are dealing with he can't bring it under control carried about with every toss about and carry it about with every wings of Doctrine praise the Lord but that's not why I'm getting to you let's travel so chapter 4 it Place us on a God's protection we are introduced into the body baptized by one baptism One Faith one hope so now we are under God's protection he gave us a four five four Ministry to guide us point us to the Tree of Life so we can start eating we can start eating we can start feeding from our to your family we can start going back to the beginning [Music] because he expects us to be mature chapter 5 what does he do he does he brought he brings us into a marriage now Paul always starts right here be here therefore follower of Maine as dear children and walk in love as Christ has to love us then he goes on then he brings us into the marriage coveting amen praise the Lord now this is where I want to I want to grab you just follow me he brings us here he talks about all these wonderful things and then he brings us at the end of faith verse 32 this is a great mystery I speak of Christ in the church he's talking about all the marriage now man like like Christ woman like the church and all of that he brings us right here he said this is a great mystery I speak of Christ and the church nevertheless let every man every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and a wife sees there she reference of her husband now look at what is going to happen look at what is going to happen people I want you to pay attention praise the Lord I want you to pay attention because when brother Branham says when the seals open the Bible became a new book it's not just a slogan it is not just a slogan it is because thou opening of the seals has make us to now pay attention when we are reading and make us to pay attention what what what is happening here what is this connection that Paul is going to bring from this great marriage great mixture of marriage and then he brings it right into children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that should grab your attention that you grab your attention and when we talk about gory was I see it right here that this Commandment that is with promise comes with the reward of God blessing you with a garlic marriage praise the Lord amen oh we know the devil right from the beginning he fights against marriage just like I said amen he was a serpent that was made without a wife he was the only creature that didn't know how to help mate God made him alone because he was designed for the work of redemption praise the Lord if he had a wife he would not bother with Adam why he will go on with his wife praise the Lord so right from the beginning he's not happy because he was the only one that was left out one time it was Adam and myself we were alone but after a while I see Adam walking with her help me I don't have no help mate praise the Lord but this is what I want to I want to assure you here amen the scripture fights I mean the uh shows us that the devil you know he he fights against it because he knows this is the progression this is the progression of uh uh many years ago I preached on intimate relationship when uh when I use the book of of efficient to just show how our relationship progress how God deals with us and then he expects also that our our relationship you know with our family we also progress praise the Lord no doubt many families they have high struggle over the years they were able to find promises in God's word that they fought for their home they fought for their marriages and God reward him because he said rewarded praise the Lord but some were rewarded amen and it goes It goes in in many different ways now don't miss understanding me now don't misunderstand me I want you to just us to just bring ourselves in a place where we can be able to understand all of these things because he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise the Lord yeah we're seeing a promise here where God is now time something year uh uh uh you know children obey your parents in the law for this is right honor your father and mother and Paul is making us to realize that this is a Commandment that is tied to a promise it's tied to a promise praise the Lord it's tied to a promise and especially for for many of our young people the the the place of Parenthood is a very beautiful design the reason why God gave us parents he did not churn Us From Heaven for us to just drop down in the hospital some of us would not even live the reason why he gave us parents is a beautiful design of God praise the Lord amen many things that we we deal with in our lives you know most most especially as children uh you have to go back sometimes just reflect a little bit your relationship with your parents now for many that did not hide that it can really create a struggle they can really create a struggle faith is not blind praise the Lord faith is now blind Faith instruct us Faith make us to reflect especially when we are dealing things dealing with things praise the Lord it makes us to reflect that's the reason why that great story about The Prodigal Son a laser place in Scripture a laser place in Scripture many of us are not from fought in their homes where we have everything that was provided for us but yet I mean some of us are even our parents were not we're not we're not Christians some were not dedicated Christians some were not message believers even the ones that were message believers they still had their struggle praise the Lord they still had their struggle you will see when Paul deals with this situation over in the book of collusion he deals with faith in another way he said parents do not provoke your children amen because you could stumble them you could stumble them you you go it can be almost like the Young Rich ruler brother Branham said their Young Rich ruler was successful until it came to the place where he was supposed to get under a Godly leadership that he did not even know his way he was he was stumbled by his parents they taught him everything right they make him a successful businessman but the leadership of the ministry he was honored the Pharisees were dwelling on on the things of all they could not identify the promise of the day yes so when he got to that place they stumble him he'll stumble him even though he fulfilled he obeyed the Commandments from the day he was he was just doing it because his parents told him to do it this idea from the days of my youth but how can I get internal life he knew that he was empty Within he was empty praise the Lord and that's why we don't want for you young people we want you to have an experience with Christ he want we want your experience to be a personal experience not just holding to your parents amen we want you to have a personal experience and that's the reason why I will continue to stand against it as Paris you are not the Holy Ghost for your children [Music] you need to point them to the Holy Ghost we are God we we are there I'm not your Holy Ghost either I'm not your Holy Ghost are we together this is the problem it's both ways is both ways train up a child in a way that he will grow though he can order he will not depart from it we supposed to be the trainer we're supposed to be preparing them because there are different stages in life brother Branham says the first teacher is the mother she's the Fifth Gospel that's the first teacher praise the Lord then the mother works with the school teacher amen and you you will find it you will find it in most home praise the Lord and then the next teacher is the father just when that charm is is is getting to their Teenage life is getting to that place of decision they need to have a Godly father they need to have a man that can point them back to the scripture they need to have a man that can wave they're talking before them you need to have a father that that the sea Goring told the doorpost and put in the blood on the lintel of the door pulls they need to see that they gave the child confidence are we together now you have to realize that I'm doing this because I promise you that I would do it I just did not know when I told you about all of these Wild Brothers to the series of marriage and divorce so that's that's what I'm thrilling on now so and uh so you you you see that okay yeah Paul have it right down yeah he have it right down here uh right here in efficiencies verse four and your father provoked not your children unto Wrath but bring them up in in in the nurture and ammunition of the Lord so you see here uh there's there's a great thing yeah I I have to find a place to close here uh uh before I kind of fall over overburden you but I I just want to grab your mind on this you know I was thinking on that the whole last night uh uh God telling Abraham I'm your great in exceeding reward God rewarding Abraham because he he did the right thing and the whole thing about reward is on my uh what's on my mind the hold of last night uh uh you know and and trusting the Lord how to bring it you know God rewards when we follow God's word and do the best you know uh that uh that uh we know how to do from a True Heart praise the Lord amen God never reward a rebellion spirit don't take off no form of rebellion Spirit to your parents because you know what it will wait for you in your house if you take out a rebellious Spirit it will wait for you in your house God told David because you did this your sons will do it praise the Lord disagreeing is not it's not being rebellious amen if you can just only says well because I don't understand it I don't see it that way and let me be to the place to pray for the grace for you to see it that's that's not being rebellious that's Being Earnest I don't see it it's completely different from oh I I see it but I'm not going to do it it's completely different and it's all in your heart it's all in your heart it's all in your mind so you see there is a connection here there is a connection poor cloud in this whole thing with a mystery of Christ in his church and it's a mystical body coming into that that mystical relationship we are growing into that mystical relationship that's the reason why we want to be acquainted with the word because this is the voice of our bridegroom this is the voice of our bridegroom are we together praise the Lord as as much as many times it's difficult is difficult when we get in debt cycle of uh as uh you know experiencing our emotion and the changes of feelings that we have in us as much as it is difficult to be able to trust anyone with the way you feel within you I will advise you don't keep it from your parents praise the Lord they're not going to make choices for you but it has to be on a very Earnest ground of conversation praise the Lord don't go on the shopping spree and everything buy what you want to buy and then bring it home no make it a conversation the prophet of God said we should have our homes open right minority friends of our if this is your friend yet it's my friend praise the Lord amen and as as we all growed we realize then we we don't become judgmental it helps it helps the parents to to know what you are dealing with and it gets they get down in praying for you now if you make if you have already made the decision so what is going to be now is that you you get you you are either going to accept what I'm bringing to you or you and myself we're going to be in trouble that's when most of the parents and children relationship becomes rocket praise the Lord amen but when but when it has got to that place where it says and and most of the time what parents are looking for is to realize that you are convinced of what you are doing if you can prove it to them that you are convinced it's not your ma now that your head is spinning on your shoulder but you are convinced because I can see it in the word of God you know the scripture says this and I did the prophet if you can convince them any parent will back up any parent that fear God will back up because they know that they cannot play God in your life they know that they have a son and a daughter of God that is in connection with God they are praying about what they are dealing with any parent will back up but if you just coming to them you know because they have a cracked Heating and their teeth is white in their you know I like their smell they know it's just like your hair just spinning on your shoulder because when your hair starts spinning you just see things you see things they just become so colorful to you praise the Lord that's what God bless he know that he have a son he have a daughter that have have done the ideal diligence they have prayed they have sorted God the Lord through God's word they are following this thing by the word of God it does not mean that you will not have battle you will have it but because you have started with the word you will always resolve it with the word it will not be difficult for you to come back to the world praise the Lord now let me let me let me go
