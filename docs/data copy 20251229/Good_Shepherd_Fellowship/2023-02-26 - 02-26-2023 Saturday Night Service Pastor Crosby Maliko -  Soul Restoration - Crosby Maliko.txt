kill it but the spirit giveth life unless you come and breathe your Holy Spirit upon these words Lord they will not bring the desired results we do not want to be like those folks who did not mix the

do not underestimate the power of a service the power of prayer the power of your presence in our midst we still pray that you might be comfortable to those families as well in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen and amen praise the Lord amen I greet you once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I truly appreciate once again the opportunity to preach and the opportunity to be in your presence praise the Lord amen I believe it was in the Book of Luke in the book of Acts that Luke speaks and says let's Fellowship around the things that we commonly believe amen praise the Lord we believe that we are in the end times even unbelievers believe that so it's I think that God has given us to share that one of these days the last prayer is going to be prayed the last song is Going to Be Sung it's going to be ongoing time yes praise the Lord so while we remain standing I'll ask you to tend to your Bibles to the Book of Psalms chapter 23 amen praise the Lord the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Steel Waters hear restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake praise the Lord can I reiterate the scripture the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leaded me in the path of righteousness for his namesake may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word you may take the comfort of your seats praise the Lord amen is happy to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord let me ask one more time I do not know what sport is in this vicinity uh if we were in Los Angeles I would have probably predicted that basketball is their thing we're in New York maybe basketball as well I do not know these parts I probably think ice hockey or something like that and I don't suppose when you go to Wizard is that right ice hockey what they call that uh ice hockey all right praise the Lord I don't suppose if you go to an ice hockey game you are muted and composed you are excited before the game even starts praise the Lord I come from a place where they love football and rugby so they start to get noisy and Rowdy just at the prospect of you seeing their star player coming out of the room you know just warming up not not not that it's even kicked the ball just warming up and saying right things are gonna happen you see the crowd cheering yeah yeah yeah yeah he hasn't even kicked the ball praise the Lord so I figured if I come to church I haven't even preached just uh uh just the idea that something is fixing to happen should get people in the spirit praise the Lord amen most of when fish we've had a song called Praise the Lord the The Shepherd of our souls and I have a sermon that's in line with exactly the song So it gives me to understand I'm in the spirit praise the Lord so that gets me excited praise the Lord and uh excuse me if I'm a little bit noisy and Rowdy that's my makeup praise the Lord I've prayed to be composed I'll leave that for some folks praise the Lord I've prayed to be a little bit on the quiet temperament I'm not like that so I like a bit of noise and a bit of shouts and amens and stuff like that praise the Lord so if it's if it's not your comfort zone I'll invite you just for this period then after that you can contact your comfort zone yeah that sounds more like it my sister praise the Lord and uh I'd like to extend special greetings uh one of my cousins decided to surprise me and I caught the wind that was coming so I blew the surprise uh brother Samuel Chester we come a long way praise the Lord his dad is a legend in our country hey man if you are in Zimbabwe and you speak about the message and you don't know brother Chessa will wonder what message you're talking about so he's here to support me so cousin could you help me with a few amens in case praise the Lord amen I'm just trying to get myself relaxed everything is in order now so how many is happy to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. amen he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures amen he leaded me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul amen just to bring Clarity to that scripture I have also put it in Amplified the Lord is my shepherd to feed guide Shield me I shall not let he maketh me to lie down in flesh tender Green Pastures he leaded me beside the still a restful Waters he refreshes and restores my life and in Brackets my life he leaded me in the paths of righteousness in Brackets uprightness and right standing with him not for my earning it but for his namesake amen now I have explicitly put the Amplified so that I add Clarity to what I'm about to say now if the scripture says here restoreth my soul and the Amplified says he restores my life and in Brackets my self it means there is something that needs to be delved into and made particular attention to based on that my title tonight is soul restoration praise the Lord that's why brothers and sisters I get excited when I come into a place like this and you hear a song singing Shepherd of my soul praise the Lord amen and most people don't understand the depth of dealing with your soul because in your soul is where there is the power of transformation whatever it is that you are supposed to accomplish you are not your body you are your soul amen allow me to throw in this quotation just before I get into uh my little lesson and then I'm building it for a foundation for what I'll say tomorrow praise the Lord if you understand who you are in your soul there is not very many things that are beyond your reach there is not very many things the devil can do with you there is not very many things you can't accomplish as long as you are in the will of God that is why the beginning of Salvation is the new birth praise the Lord not in your spirit but in your soul the reason it's got to be in the soul realm is that in there praise the Lord is where God dwells somebody say Amen to that so David in the psalm gives God the absolute he says Lord you are my absolute leader you are my shepherd because you are my shepherd I shall not want because you are my shepherd there is nothing that I would rather be than your sheep he understood sheep and Shepherd relationship him being a Shepherd himself knew that the best carer to ever care for anybody or anything has got to be a Shepherd now if you give and surrender your life to God to be not The Shepherd of your body but the shepherd of your soul praise the lord it's imperative and it's needed that at that point God has got to restore your soul to such levels that the real you will be able to do what you're supposed to do while you are here on Earth somebody say Amen to that we are not here on Earth to just be praise the Lord people that place second field or just items and objects at the messian pity of the devil where if he looks at your face and he thinks that well there's no need to tempt this one he'll let you go by we are here because God has a purpose we are here because God saw from the foundation of the world that there is a special breed of people that ought to be on earth at such a time after the seals have been opened in 200 million Devils have been released yet these people have the power to counteract every demon in Hell they've got the overcoming power whatever the devil says he can throw to us we've got the power over him why because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world the in the one that's in us where is he in is in the soul somebody say Amen to that and that is why there is any an urgent appeal for people to explore and understand what their soul is capable of achieving praise the Lord in the message things I'm in paragraph 26 says if we know the word of God we know where we are living just that statement alone makes me happy by knowing the word of God you know where you are living we know the hour we are living in we know what lays ahead we see what we have passed and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ he works through the edges that was up to the Book of Revelation and then his promises that is to come so all of his promises are true God cannot speak any word without it being confirmed in other words equality tests his own word he would never allow a scripture to be put in the scriptures or to be made in scripture to be put in the Bible unless he is Thoroughly Vindicated in himself he has a program that is perfect and entire he would never ask you for something uh to believe in something that he doesn't know that your faith is capable of reaching it amen so before there could ever be any Scripture be put in the Bible God had to troubleshoot it see its ins and outs we'll see if it's capable of still possessing the power of transformation in the end times see whether that scripture will be able to counteract every spirit that is in this day and in this hour so there is nothing Beyond God's power in this day and in this age praise the Lord and every scripture in the Bible praise the Lord if you know the word of your day you will know what God expects of you and when you know what God expects of you you will know what you are capable of praise the Lord praise the Lord I believe there are people that are in the army or have been soldiers before they know to trust in the ammunition of what they have right praise the Lord which gives me to understand that Believers should come to that level of having a thorough appreciation of the power that lays in the scriptures having an appreciation of the power that lays in the message of the hour once you have a full appreciation of what is at your disposal the devil is nothing but a bluff praise the Lord whatever he throws your way the first and foremost thing that comes to your mind is if you've come my way God's already measured and God has already known that he's already possessed in me a power that can counteract this power because he can't come and put in the Bible a scripture that says greater is he that is in you and then the devil whipped you at every turn it must mean that indeed greater is he that is in you praise the Lord that is why when David caught the revelation of who he was he wasn't a man writing that Psalm out of a situation of defeat or out of a situation it was inspiration that struck him and he said the Lord indeed is my shepherd to lead to guide to protect and to feed praise the Lord and then he goes on further and he says he will restore my soul amen amen amen why has there got to be a need for a restoration of the Soul because if you if you want the best out of a man you've got to delve into the soul realm amen you are not your body praise the Lord you are far deeper than what your body is amen hear what the prophet says in the message Messiah praise the Lord he says messiahship so has the eagle has got it we know what now you say is the man before I leave the subject the man what is he he's got a hand like God good eyes like God God eyes ears like God got a body like God he was fashioned after God he was given an if in the Dominion he was made God over the Earth to rule the Earth a Lesser God God rules the universe everything but man given the Earth to rule the Earth he was a messiah that's what he is tonight if he gets back to God if you get back to God you are a messiah he is a messiah a little Messiah if Messiah means anointed one and you are anointed then where are you that's exactly right a messiah we call it that just for the world's sake for the word sake till we get a little further down the scripture to eat all right did you ever think of this let me ask you something look at me for a minute this is my hand is that right that's right this is my finger this is my ear this is my nose but who's me that's not that's not me that something belongs to me see this is my end but who's got who's is me that owns the hand see this is just a house I'm living in amen amen what kind of well there is something to be something to be called me amen amen amen me it's got to be somewhere because he this is mine you see it me is somebody because I own something I have a hand it's mine well who's me that that belongs to that's right that's right that's your spirit well it depends on what kind of a spirit that is who you yield your members too that's whose servant you are now if you can crack a glass of water because you have telepathy or mental conception and a certain power that you can put off to a human being a power of mental Force that's unseen and are known of only through the cycle if you can bust a glass of water but the kind of a spirit a human perverted damned spirit because you are fashioned in the image of God what you can do do when you let God that Fashions you coming to you and control you see now you can bring every promise of God to pass let me just pause there for a minute brother Prime is making a comment I after having seen a telecom of concentration you looked at the glass and he broke it not having been near the glass just using the faculties of his bodies now program looks at that and he says if a man with a perverted Spirit can look at that and break it how much more a man with the spirit of God how much more are you able to make the promises so your power is not to break glasses but to bring Jesus on the scene and make a few promises in your life come to pass in other words if a man can concentrate on a glass and break it you can concentrate on your healing by taking every other scripture that has to do with your healing and if you concentrate on that enough you will get your healing are you getting it says you can bring every promise of God to pass yes sir every promise of God God promise will come to pass all right God's gift is in his word God's promise made a gift sent a gift you take the gift and then with this word there's your conductor with a gift praise the Lord allow me to step out from my Prophet so that I don't use my glasses because I really have to uh uh nail this the way I feel in my spirit praise the Lord Amen brother Brahm is going into this situation because he really sees how other people who are not Living Christian Are exploiting Spiritual things and getting results yet the believer he's got the scriptures with which if they are conducted with the word of God and their Spirit they can make that scripture praise the Lord step out of the Bible and come into their lives praise the Lord so he gives this example he says we are Messiah because of the spirit of God that's within us so if there goes on says now there's your conductor with a gift of God if God give you the gift of the Holy Ghost you believe that well the word of God is a conductor to use that power with which means as long as the word lies dominant in the Bible and there is no candidate with the Holy Ghost to pull out the scripture of what they require that thing won't come to pass so yours is to receive the Holy Ghost and when you receive the Holy Ghost you unlock you are you align yourself with a particular scripture with a promise you want to achieve and let me tell you 100 you will achieve exactly what the scripture says you are able to achieve somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord listen to this the word of God is a conductor to use that power with right praise the Lord whatever the Holy Ghost promised you that's what you can do are you with me next sister see that's the thing that delivers the word the word goes right out and the Holy Spirit follows the word well whatever the words preached see you see your pastor preach it the first thing you know blah blah makes a blowing sound across the building goes the Holy Spirit that's light it's the conductor of the word let me put it let me break it down in plain language your pastor comes on a Sunday with a humble service and simply says today we just want to deal with the power we have and there is a believer in there that says you know what actually I believe that scripture then the power that the Prosper is speaking about if it finds somebody that says amen over there the Holy Ghost says oh okay we are on duty now let's go and locate the person and then he starts to move then he moves from this person no no one is interested in this scripture goes on to the next and then he finds the actual conductor because in them is an identification of that scripture and if you can identify with your that scripture then the next thing that thing comes to pass amen praise the Lord that is why you find in the message no matter how powerful we preach the scripture of sister had to write will never apply to a single sister because there is nothing in there to conduct that but there's got to be a widow with a blessed and son and that better than mother that big children son is giving that Widow a challenge and then the pastor comes as remember Sister Hetty light that it becomes a word then that sister praise the Lord says Pastor I was listening to a type with sister healthy life I believe that then the Holy Ghost says right there is a charge over there let's go and fulfill that part of the scripture somebody say Amen to that it's the conductor of the word the word goes the word is the conductor of the spirit because where the word is preached the spirit follows it right whatever it goes why the spirit follows the word oh I like that I like sound Bible teaching and the Bible holy ghost coming back to church praise the Lord do you see that can I use this all all right praise the Lord tonight if the Holy Ghost doesn't confirm it then you got your wires crossed what is the prophet saying you will never anoint your pastor to come with a weight that's got no conduct whatever word your pastor receives or whatever word your preacher receives to come and give to you there must be a conductor somewhere a man because that's the order of the word and if that conduct that's why you find every service has different types of breakthroughs praise the Lord because when God has his mind on a particular person that he has been believing he he wants to make sure that the electrical wires are drained correctly so you must be a conductor not an insulator praise the Lord an insulator repels the power a conductor attracts the power somebody say Amen to that you can't sit in church and behave like a plastic and expect electricity praise the Lord plastic has been known by its qualities to be an insulator but a Believer has been known to be a conductor somebody say Amen to that amen that's why you never come to church without an expectation because you are coming as a complete circuit to something that God will energize and then you walk out there to make the scripture come to pass somebody say Amen to that it is God's method he never brings a word without a candidate he never brings an inspiration without a conductor we could all be audiences today for just one person who's got the right conductivity for what I've come from England to come and preach for you somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord amen listen to what the prophet says then you've corrupt your ass because you've got a ground somewhere see yes if you can get the wire hooked onto the Dynamo that great thing that puts out the fullness of the courage he will he will just set the little wire a fire for you that's right all it will do oh and it will do things for you a lot somebody asked me one time says brother Crosby what's your mode of preaching I said my mode of preaching is application I'm not so much into Mysteries I already know the mystics but I've seen Mysteries we have seen people with Mysteries and yet still go home depressed I've seen people with Mysteries still go home broke I've seen people with Mysteries go to a dysfunctional marriage at all I want to tell you brother we've got to now come to the point of taking the right components of the word so that we create a currency of the thing that we require It's gotta be manifestation that's why I said all all of Humanity's problems if you are a child of God they are all sorted out in the seven compound Redemptive names whatever you require it's got to be in the seven compound Redemptive names there is everything for everyone it's an open check amen say Amen to that family praise the Lord now that code I've put you will notice when the Amplified speaks about he restoreth my soul it says my soul is actually equated to my life or in bracket myself remember I'm in this message the Messiah he is now saying right who's me me is not my hand me is not my foot it's not my ears it's not my eyes me is not this is who these things belong to me who's me and the me is the soul praise the Lord so brother do we agree that if we know how to connect our wires correctly it will do things for us you want to go home and find stuff you've been believing God for done and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in my home [Music] praise the Lord praise the Lord are you watching me sister if you got good visibility next I figured I would be more time conservative if I I step out so that we read together praise the Lord amen if not okay hidden life so follow in the order that I've given you there is I'm not going to skip any quotes I'm just going to make sure that every quote has been well read praise the Lord now brother I'm in the message hidden here in life in Christ he says tonight I want to speak on the subject that's very close to me and nowadays we are reasoning I'm trying you know I'm trying to get we need inside healing before we can get we need inside healing before we can get he restore it we need inside healing before we can get outside healing I know that to be true from dealing with people we will have physical healing all right well that will take care of itself but first we want to have inside healing now that brings in perspective the reason why Psalm 23 is structured the way it's structured it's structured by David giving God the absolute leadership to his life the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures yeah and then it goes on to say he restoreth my soul and if you remember well last night we said there will never be no soul restoration unless there is proper diet and feeding of the weight is that right so the coming of the word is like you take a journey as a new believer you walk into church praise the Lord the first thing that happens is the word is preached praise the Lord and that word that preached praise the Lord takes away spiritual Amnesia then something within you starts to say I think I identify with that I am not there yet but something in me says that's nothing but the truth there is a familiarity with the word that I have received there is something in me that makes me think that you know what if I stick around a little longer these things will will add up is that right and once your soul is fed you will have strength to start making Christian baby steps then you start to move on like that a man man because you're on the road to saw restoration there can never be no soul restoration before the hearing Fest before the eating of the wet so now we are at the stage where brother Brahm says I'm dealing with a lot of people I notice that I've dealt with people for their matters for healing for their matters for needs for everything they require but I've seen one thing people need them inside healing and then the outside healing will take care of itself in other words if you get the soul restored the rest of the body will line up with what power is in the soul somebody say Amen to that it's never if you gave you heal me then I'll worship no no no no no no no no no we are not here to talk about the pools because that was for our Prophet but as far as we are concerned we need to give you the word because somehow God by predestination you are not an incident you just starting to identify yourself God knew you before you knew yourself God knew you before your mama and your daddy met God knew you before you were even born so as you hear the word something in you is starting to say you know what I can't understand let alone when you are in the message a little bit while while longer then you start to understand our Dragon then I will say I bypassed my theory off and says right but what starts first something keeps you coming to church despite despite thinking I'll never go back to that church they preached too long they are service Rises but somehow you can't stop from coming because the thing that's calling you is bigger than you somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord [Applause] says no matter how much how loyal will try to be how much we try to think that Christ is with us yes which is but yet it is something the healing has something to do with absolutely with the individual that's being prayed for has to have faith themselves all it will not take place unless it's a vision send for an individual you see for an individual case that God has his foreknowledge he has foreign and you know those things but even in Christ's time when he was here on Earth the Son of God it was according to their faith so let's backtrack a bit Faith cometh by hearing hearing from the words of God so what must start first that you must hear and then your soul gets restored it starts that Journey now praise the Lord praise the Lord and then he says here it was according to their faith unless the father showed the vision remember the blind man and the different ones if thou can't believe is thou Believers all things are possible if thou can't believe and so forth it's always based upon the faith of the individual then today the church is in such a temer oh my hate to think of it but it's the truth the church is in a terrible Tema I mean universally speaking everywhere you go it seems like that there's just something going on so what we need is an inside healing of real fundamental faith in Christ Jesus then the outside we will just automatically take place then the healing starts for the physical healing it will begin from the inside going out and then something will take place it will be lasting and something that will be real that is why David says He restored my soul he knew without a soul restoration he's not going any further let me tell you brothers and sisters I listen until we get a soul restoration within us a lot of the things that we claim We Believe don't come to pass and brother is not saying this statement as inspiration he's saying it from research because he's saying I've crossed the board when I've been going around I see this thing so it's a research-based quotation it's not if people had already shown that they understand there was no need for him to preach that quotation but because people were showing an ignorance they were putting the the cut before the horses and he said no no let's correct things let's have the horses in front of the cats most people put their physical ability their physical needs their physical requirements before they are sold that's putting the the cut before the horses praise the Lord when you deal with your soul a lot of the problems that you have issues with they somehow automatically disappear that is why the Bible says You must be born again you can kick out an addiction if your soul gets right but if you go for Rehab rehab is taking care of your physical you will go back you will go to a relapse you want another high because you are dealing with your physical but if you deal with your soul the drugs will beat you somebody say Amen [Applause] so you can take out 10 steps 10 steps to how to break free as long as your soul has not been conducted with the word of God you are wasting your time after a little while you shall go back to that rehab again you will start to get high coming from this search you will get high on the day of discharge after having been in there for three months because you are dealing with the physical you are masking symptoms you are not going to the cause but the soul possesses the power of transformation somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord how many believe what I'm saying tonight let's save my slides my sister we are going somewhere now listen to this very carefully brother brought him in the message countdown goes to a show like a Trade Fair like a science show and he sees something there praise the Lord remember our sermon is soul restoration every one of you right now has the ability to transform every situation in their life be it poverty be it addiction everything that is ever affecting you you've got the power if we just adjust your soul you will know that you've got the power somebody say Amen to that listen to this brother man says but my point is this what scientific things has been able to achieve they were there at the welfare showing by scientific research what science has been able to achieve in the natural things now we are here showing by spiritual research what God is able to achieve with people who will believe the word are you hearing that now to achieve scientific things you got to work in scientific life to achieve spiritual things you got to work in spiritual life do you believe us now this I don't suppose any one of you has ever seen coffee but we knew that coffee is here and we were all wearing masks we were all washing our hands we were all staying at home but nobody ever met a covet praise the Lord but science declared that coffee this day and we believe that science cannot be wrong because we saw people dying we were told symptoms if you feel no taste in your mouth and if you feel praise the Lord a little bit flourish with a bit of temperature and no taste go and check you could be affected and even when you you know your taste buds are already gone because you're old you just thought that because today I'm not feeling much of my eggs I could be having coffee you would have to go for a test and be told you are negative praise the Lord all that based on science how much more the science of the Bible what we tell you is going to come to pass somebody say Amen to that [Applause] listen to this now brother Brahm go back I don't go back to the previous coach I want to to put a continuity to it right it says we must operate in spiritual lines and then he goes to what he saw a it's the science fair listen to this now you think that that looked horrible which it did you should have seen it wish I had a picture of it so brother Brown sees he is going in a science fair he goes to the sideway there are having guinea pigs rats that they were testing for cancers and he goes there and he sees a care a rat that they put nicotine and poison and and cigarettes in there and then he says like you think he says you think it looked horrible you should have seen it and then he said wish I had a picture of it yes even to shop so brother wanted to take the picture of the rats that was infected with cancer from the science fair right so that he could come and show the church what it's like says right but notice because that red just lives a few hours some of them don't even live seven days out is that right but think of it you think that looked cankered you ought to see what a soul looks that turned down the gospel you ought to look what a hideous looking thing they are how a devil gets a hold of a man and can possess the Son of God into a hideous looking thing like he is in the eyes of God oh he might be a six footer tall or shoulders like I don't know what and tell her and what and that don't mean nothing it's the inside that's Lusty the outside just dust anyhow amen do you see how I've seen people we have been in situations of addictions and stuff if you ask them deep down there at they'll tell you this is not me because in there is the seed of God so they know that this is not me they are yearning for a way out so the only way out is to preach the word and if the word has been preached and the Soul says yes this is this is what I've been waiting for the rest of my life raise it up sister because babram couldn't bring the picture I brought the picture for you brother Brahm says right this is a rat this is a growth of a cancer that's how the soul of a person who rejects to rejects the word is like so every time you see somebody that's backslidden and you are very unkind you don't realize they need as much care as the person that's got cancer they have it in the soul palliative care they require next sister I brought two images look this this whole thing here this whole stuff is the elongation of the growth of the cancer and problem says I was not allowed to bring the picture from the world fair to show off the church how the soul of a person who's rejected the word looks like so when David said he restores my soul he was saying that God gives me a scriptural therapy not a chemotherapy the word is pounded on you in such a way that you are left with only one choice if this is the truth I'll walk in it amen says you ought to see I'd say he just looking to go back to the court and then come to the picture and then I'll take it up why we ought to have a soul restoration praise the Lord never underestimate the need to pray for somebody who's not in the position that you are in care for them and love them just like you do when you hear that sister so-and-so has cancer if a brother is backslidden know that their soul is now can cut they need just like those that have physical cancer they go for chemotherapy radiotherapy let me tell you my brother when you come into an atmosphere with the amens and praise God in hallelujahs it creates an atmosphere where all things are possible the devil can stay in that kind of an atmosphere praise the Lord praise the Lord and I give you to understand never judge a person because in them could be a soul of somebody if God gives his word therapy and if that's where the therapy works let me tell you you have a big better wonderful worshiper and praise of God than you can ever imagine somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord I tell you brothers and sister will you allow me to tell you a bit about my background since I've got a witness right here I grew up in the worst neighborhood in my town praise the Lord I was born there I was raised there I grew up there we were gangsters from start to finish praise the lord we were people that you could never mess about praise the Lord but when the word struck my heart praise the Lord if you saw me walking down the street you could never think that there is a preacher locked up in that sinner but all I needed was to hear a familiar voice a voice that I was with from the foundation of the world somebody say Amen [Applause] praise the Lord if you go to my neighborhood you need me to survive praise the Lord all the gang bangers in my neighborhood if I go about don't worry it's Crosby praise the Lord don't worry it's Crosby ask my my cousin right here the west of the West if you have a West neighborhood in a first world at least it has toilet seats that you can actually sit where I come from there's little holes praise the Lord in the shower upright you have to have praise the Lord Integrity of knowing that once I take a shower I don't move to the left or the right until I'm finished otherwise you put your foot where it's not supposed to go praise the Lord we saw people whose who were spilled buildings by knife fights praise the Lord you could never think that out of that environment can come out a preacher and when we were again banging we didn't like it from God but we were conditioned we bypassed our fear family so we we did what we had to do to survive praise the Lord but every time we went home something within would say is there no better life somewhere that was the result speaking now the body was testifying otherwise praise the Lord let me tell you brother never underestimate one guy that just steps into church you never know who your right Moody will come from you never know who's holding the keys to the Rapture somebody say Amen to that because until that soul is saved amen that's why we've got to have a soul restoration and don't underestimate when David says he restores my soul because this is a guy that was once caught up in sin such thing that wasn't something that happened on a private street corner he seen trended praise the Lord but when God dealt with him amen David had this thing in his heart no matter what happens Lord don't cast me away no matter what happens what creating me a clean heart renew the right kind of a spirit in other words if it's cancer in my heart you can heal it restore my soul he restoreth my soul that's why I'm preaching about Soul restoration let me tell you brother if you come out of church with the right perspective and value to your soul every other thing around you ceases to matter praise the Lord you start to concentrate on the the real you inside and the real you is a child of God that is why no matter what others did there were certain lines you could never cross your heart will tell you you know what I'm dead but I'm not that bad right praise the Lord praise the Lord amen are you hearing me tonight amen how many saying Lord we want a soul a restoration this gives you whenever you know somebody that was once in this church that's bexleyden don't write them off start to say almighty God start a chemotherapy in their life almighty God give them a word therapy in their life almighty God let the words be preached in their life praise the Lord that's why I thank God we're the prophet who could see things what he saw in those rats was able for him to see what the soul of a big sliding person looks like praise the Lord and I believe as I'm preaching this if the word has its customer tonight there is conductivity the Holy Ghost is going bench to bench looking for that person who says that word is me and if you say it's me you say Lord start the healing process it will be an inside out type of a healing somebody shout amen maybe you've never shouted for crying out loud but tonight it could be the trust you see when you are ill you go to the doctors they give you a prescription you don't question most of the times that why are you giving me this it's only when it has side effects praise the Lord but at least you try it have you ever tried saying praise God one time see what happens in your spirit have you ever said Hallelujah see what happens in your spirit your driver said I'll say thank you Jesus if I had ever thought to yourself that's how we all got saved when we walked into church everybody we felt like we didn't belong everybody looked like they were already saved because all my days these people wow wow they have it all together praise the Lord but when the word was being preached I forgot about the people around me I said hey the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want somebody say Amen to that I came out of my comfort zone [Applause] you see someone that came with you to Jesus because when you when the word hits your heart there's no predicting what you do see because you are not a plastic there is conductivity around you you are copper wires just waiting for the generator to be connected properly and then you shout out an amen even your wife say hey what happened today says I can't explain but there was some healing happening and I the doctor will say they are responding to their word therapy Hallelujah praise be to God you must have something within you that Echoes to the power of God praise the Lord Brother Brahma went into a place where there was a sister praise the Lord and that sister was in a Mental Health institution and that sister was given up by everybody and brother Brahm walks in and the sister says start with me says but sister you don't look like you need help he says oh no I'm far gone you know I was here I was once arrested I'm an alcoholic and blah blah blah you know the long story that your body tells you you are that's why today we are not preaching to your body right because we noticed that when we preach to your body you go back to your things but if we preach and address your soul you say Amen this is where I belong praise the Lord so he has this conversation with his sister what went wrong says Ah you know I was the child of a Preacher my grandma used to go to church but somewhere there I got into wrong company and when I got into wrong company things begin to happen and I went with so and so and this is this and now you know what nobody will ever don't you desire to be married one day be somebody's lover you know like the mother and somebody that someone will say I've got to rush home to my wife sure it says well who death me because obviously his story was on Facebook Instagram everybody knew her story it would be so ridiculous to say you want to melt that one so she already discounted herself out of the race so brother now is trying to now connect with her soul despite being in now you are not even in a mental institute you are in church in church on a flight where on a Saturday and right now people are busy yeah partying praise the Lord because I came from the ghetto I can do that a little bit praise the Lord people are busy right now stuff is going down and you found yourself in the house of the Lord it's because God he has orchestrated all our audience with you in mind [Music] praise the Lord you are the important one tonight praise the Lord so now the sister says nobody will leave me says no no no your case was diagnosed wrong that's what the prophet said that's the words he uses diagnosed so it means there was something about the soul that needed diagnosis for case was diagnosed wrong says okay right do you believe change you now says oh yes I've always believed somehow that but I've never had an opportunity it's okay let's pray and then the sister started praying and she was praying as if she's just been you know scratched she didn't realize that it's far more deeper so she prayed as if all she needed was a little bandage not thank you thank you thank you Jesus and the prophet stops it stop it pray until something happens then they continue playing now when she yelled out says it's done now it Prophet said I knew from that very moment that she is safe for all we know for all we know from that moment on you could think that it was the person you saw last night but from that moment on program preaches a sermon he calls from that time you can have your own from that time tonight Not Another Day tonight can be you from that time and you will always have something to say about your night from that time you say I don't know where brother one got this short crazy preacher he couldn't even stay behind the pulpit he was walking all over the place laughing and puffing but let me tell you brother there is always something significant when your soul says yes [Applause] Hallelujah right about now we are not asking you to join a church we are asking you to explore yourself we are asking you to decide to take the scripture say I'll give the word a chance I wish I could go and preach in all the rehab centers and by the way I'm a psychiatric nurse by the way I will know I wish I could go because you go there you are addicted to heroin they will give you a lesser substitute of the same drug they'll give you methadone praise the Lord which is the exact same problem you have it is less it's like a step down but it can get so much that at least you will know there are people who actually go and do what is called I don't know about America but in England we call it speed meth where you will go for rehab and you will get methadone and you drink it before the nest so that they can sign you off and you don't drink it you have a way of gargling it and holding it in and then as soon as you're away from the presence of the uh the nurse you go and spit it out in a little cell you can actually go and sell it oh yeah when your soul is like that right you don't mind drinking people's alive talk about hygiene you don't mind because all you want is your eye because it's not it's not any the devil is taken hold of your soul so your your soul is like you see cancer will make you do stuff that you never thought you would do so what you need is something that's bigger than that cancer so we've got to attack it from radiotherapy attack it from chemotherapy attack it with alternative medicine because cancer is stubborn that's what addiction is like whether it's addiction to drugs addiction to sex addiction to anything in addiction will wake you up in all the hours you ever seen anyone addicted to cigarettes nicotine they know how to light the cigarette with their eyes closed in bed faster sleep it's that drug it's that that's that cancer demon eating your nutrients right do you know that if you develop cancer in the body you will have a sweet tooth it's because the life of the cancer wants to grow and it needs sugar for energy so right now as you've been able to endure Church sitting there attentive paying attention right now you are more than an overcomer [Music] you've said the devil trying to make you say come on stand up go to the toilet and you're saying no I'm not going it's your soul that's now overcoming the devil's saying get out of church get out of it now come on get out you've heard enough it's taking too long and your soul is saying nobody goes to a concert and it's played for 13 minutes and they don't demand a refund where people are particular about things that they don't need to pay particular attention to I praise the Lord amen how many episodes are praise the Lord let me go back to my quotes my sister praise the Lord are we getting our little lesson yeah praise the Lord now brother Brahm goes on to a message the thinking man's future he says now to follow that in the continuity of the message the word of God the anointed ones in the last time the outside the middle cycle life cycle of the human senses the second cycle is the spirit's senses will self you desire that's why nobody is born with a love to smoke the first time you smoke you coughed like you had never coughed before and your friends there to strengthen his uh first timer don't worry you see your body your lungs were rejecting nicotiness you have to actually force it by your will until you become a seasoned smoker right alcohol is never tasty no you you can't substitute Kool-Aid with alcohol but along the way your palate palette gets used to it so brother I mean the message thinking man's filter says desire and sufferth but the inside is that oh help me open your mouth somebody help me preach the inside is that soul was predestinated this is where you say to a sister and a brother that's conscious don't judge me my friend we are all looking for the same Quest going back where we come from praise the Lord don't mind my hairstyle I'll get right one day leave me alone praise the Lord I need to identify myself listen to this so you can anoint this Spirit to make the outside body come into subject to the spirit but the soul that sinneth that Soul shall die in other words the soul that disbelieves that Soul shall die praise the Lord listen to this let's leave the rest line together the soul that rejects in unbelief the word of God which is a part of that Soul Child eternally is always I believe in an eternal death we know that it's it's forever same as I believe in Eternal heaven but not in eternal hell there is no such a thing as an eternal hell there is an eternal death for the people that many of them religious in the world today has always been dead think about places where they are gathering and not preaching the word of the day [Music] it's a an oncology word full of cancer victims because they don't have the right word that can bring a power of transformation praise the Lord listen to this the woman that lives in pleasure with a bobbed hand-painted face is dead while she's alive the Bible said so see she may be religious but she never was saved she's got an outward emotion she might sing in the choir she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and they have all these manifestations of the spirit but unless that Soul on the inside is a daughter of God and you couldn't be there is no better evidence that you are a daughter of God than the fact that God brought you today God brought you to church today because he knows in you is the soul of God so now you need a word to energize and conduct with your soul and then you make a decision somebody say Amen to that if the devil is saying to you maybe you are not a daughter of God it's actually evidence that you are because those that he has he never talks to them the devil has no business trying to convince his subject he will never have an effort to convince you that it's not you if he's already got you but if the devil is Whispering to you to say what if I'm not a child of God you are a child of God Amen right and let me reiterate that you are a child of God you see you never planned the same for me but you walked right into it it's not something that has come freestyle it's already been there remember I told you last night I'm preaching about the Lord is my shepherd I've been preaching about that since the beginning of the year I'm still on verse 4. right now I only skipped the other part to go to this one because I feel in my belief that it's far more important then tomorrow I'll keep it up with like with a sermon called I shall fear no evil because if your soul has been converted all your fears you cease to be a prisoner to them somebody say Amen to that says unless that's all on the inside is God's daughter amen see she is gone no matter what she does raise that my sister now brother brother was hunting one time and in his notes there was a little diagram scribbled he was trying to explain to the hunting party that he was with that listened Brothers for you to understand this so I've actually more like uh made it neater it's on a scribble note so he says like thou the greatest distance is like from the mind right to the soul yeah the mind is the womb of the spirit the problem draws this and he says if you if you notice if you notice only I've put it like wiggling like a snake he says every one of us has a little snake right that starts to affect from the mind and that's the snake you need to kill for your soul to have a chance it's in brother Brown's notes and that's the bed so he says the body has five senses see here taste feel smell that's the body now blah blah mean dealing with people he saw that people are concentrating on the body and they are concentrating on the spirit imagination these are the senses now if your mind if you just imagine that what we are saying is the truth yeah you've overcome the first step yes and then if your memory remember something good that than your life you know what this guy is from England he doesn't know me he just came with his sermon you can check it on my website I've been preaching I've been preaching this very sermon some three Sundays ago and I've brought it here and if you can reason to think to yourself that you know what what if it's the truth this is the Bible this man has said nothing but red quotes and scriptures praise the Lord I read for you the scripture the quote where problem says you know what I went to the world fair and I saw red skin card with cancer and I wanted to take a picture but they didn't allow me but I now today by technology I just have to Google and say rate with cancer and I brought the images she says that's how the soul of a person that rejects the word looks like in other words those rats with cancer are an x-ray into a big sliding soul say Amen to that somebody now brother Brahm says in the message there is barely ever fought says it's the Glitters where I ever thought it's in the mind right right now if I say make a decision to serve Christ the first thing you'll ask will my boyfriend agree what about my mom what about tomorrow next week we're supposed to go to uh Saint Paul's we got this party and you you might that's where the greatest battle is that's why the soul has to outrun the mind the soul will affect your conscience your conscience will tell you be honest be honest that's nothing but the truth be honest you know you don't like the life you live your conscience is kicking in your memory will remind you when you almost died coming from a party because both of you were drunk the driver and the passenger everything will start to point to your survival the things you've survived then if your soul says you know what I love the word yeah there is conductivity that starts now myself the real you is your soul the answer to who's me is your soul everything else can be subject to your soul [Music] praise the Lord and then your soul only has two senses Faith or doubt I never said faith in unbelief I say doubt because doubt is not absolute denial right it's pots complying and parts denying doubt is a lot more dangerous than unbelief doubts means at some point you say I see your point but you still don't agree and you contemplate other things right so when David was caught up in sin did he say restore my soul he said create me a cleaner heart and he said restore the joy of my salvation because once the joy has been taken away your mind will start saying you see you were never safe to begin with it wants to kick in the doubt sense so David by understanding his inner man he challenged that right right I wonder what would happen if we challenge our doubts yeah praise the Lord praise the Lord sister I'll have you come to our church anytime you respond very well there's something seasoned about you and this message praise the Lord do you love the Lord amen it's good when you preach and you know that it's sucking real in praise the Lord now when program preached the greatest battle ever fought he says Satan deals with your brain your brain considers what your friends will think about your decision right your brain thinks about so where do we go from here but once your soul says yes your soul behaves like buddy Robinson says I will not I will not go home until you save me that's right your song behaves change me [Music] praise the Lord brother I don't know what to say from this point on but what I can tell you brothers and sisters is that God is bigger and better and has better plans for our lives than we actually suspect raise it up sister I'm about to wind down listen to this listen to this very very carefully this is not skimmed milk things that are to be and if you ever was in the audience Israel China and all those places which I preached in there many times after the wedding supper still carried out on the way it was the bridegroom that all he has so many guests that is going to have probably brother cope probably you've watched it there in India see they have so many guests he is going to ask say he is going to ask 30 guests now the bridegroom has to furnish the robes he has to furnish them therefore there's a there's a man that stands at the door and you come up with your invitation he examines your invitation and puts on your Garment of a robe I wish we had weddings like that where when you are invited the one who's invited you send you a suit that's what they do in the audience praise the Lord that some of them are rich and some of them are poor and some of them are different but when they get the wrong they all look alike and you have to all be alike you ain't going to say a Methodist here I'm Presbyterian oh no you ain't going in the first place you see you've got to come by the door I Am The Shepherd of the ship no man comes to me but through the door and then after saying through the door he says I am the door [Music] praise the Lord and to understand the door tonight is the word that's been preached that's what ushers us in we came because we had a message yes are you with me I am the door to the shipfold I'm Pentecostal I'm this I'm that problem is being sarcastic that don't mean one thing you come by that capital D though and if you come by that door you get the robe and this man when he said how did you get a friend it showed that he comes some other way and come in the window come in the back way but not through the door not through the door the way that Jesus came through self-sacrifice giving you all to God and walking to Calvary and be crucified with him and Rise Again to where His Garment of sacrifice and death to the things of the world taking a decision to be a Christian wearing the Garment of sacrifice [Music] if you love the world all the things of the world the love of God is not even in you see if you still have the love of the world want to act like the world do like the world you are you you are you are in the church in the patch with wheat Shout with the rest of them Rejoice with the rest of them all the spiritual blessings is Right upon you you say well I prophesy so did carefus yes so did Balaam that is nothing to do because many people want to pin their Eternal destination to their experience that's what the prophet is denying right he's taking it to one thing I've got the baptism the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you what's the real gift let's leave that together the real gift is your soul down in there that was born of God that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God [Music] this is where I say I don't like church members I like people with the soul connection with God when your soul that's the gift the holy spirit is a temporal one it can flow in the wrong place but when your soul says yes to the word of God now we are talking amen praise the Lord and then he says the real gifts is your soul down there see that was born of God that controls the whole thing now brother Brahma is saying the real gift is your soul in 1965 1955 you are saying in dealing with people I've seen that they concentrate on the wrong thing because if you concentrate on the soul if your soul has been restored it means control has been given back to you that's right amen you can now control where you go you have the power to say no and you know is your no your body won't say no but we want it you've got power over your Cravings you've got power over addictions you've got power over desires you've got power over anything because when you don't have that power you are a victim you are a captive and the gospel came to set captives does your soul agree with the way tonight listen to this I feel like reading it again do you mind says yeah the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up see then you are a son and daughter of God you are a child of God and these things as you come up like the mother now you are in the powers of the Earth trying to come forth you are a son of God coming forth and you see the word says I should do this I should be born again well I belong to church that don't mean one thing so now with this I'd like to submit to you the importance of the restoration of the Soul that's where we've got power that's where all that the message is trying to address not your physical being your soul because that's the gift of God that's what came from God that's what that's what goes back to God as we rise to our feet okay praise the Lord your soul is yourself that's who you are the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures for feeding then the next thing is he restoreth my soul sing that song song leader my soul says yes [Music] say yes [Music] birthday s oh my soul say yes say yes say yes say yes my soul says yes yes [Music] you know my sources yes my soul say yes say yes yes [Music] the way can I give you a clue how some of us got saved there was never a day my heart ever beat [Music] like the day I walked into church I'd heard church I did preaching but that day it was like my life was made bare with my upbringing I wasn't even religious at all no one in my family was a church member it was so bad but the way my heart was under conviction the way it did it was as if this man that was preaching all he ever did was just address me here it was in a congregation as big as this one gave my heart to Christ and I've been 35 years in the message now since that time my life got right I married right I live right but I come from the west of the backgrounds what made me respond was if I don't respond to this what shall be my life after this with this that I know that I've had shall I clean this away from my life that was my point of conviction and when I told my friends that I've made my mind up I want to follow Jesus the correct way this wasn't a popcorn sermon where are you going says Jesus loves us we know he does but this is a question about the restoration of your soul there is no restoration of the Soul outside of the message of the hour because that's where the correct diet praise the Lord one of my sermons prior to this is led by a prophet Shepherd his brother but I'm in the message why it had to be Shepherds he dramatizes something that is so poignant and Powerful he takes the I the the drama of Exodus chapter 4. Exodus chapter 4. when Moses stood before the burning bush and the Ben burning bush spoke Moses said it who will I say has sent me he said the I am says well but the people who not believe me says what's that in your hand throw it down pick it up again and then after that he says take your right hands and put it inside take it out it was leporous a type of sin then he said put it back in then he took it out it was clear and the prophet of God says I don't suppose Moses was left-handed because program was now locating the fact that brother when he put his hand he was putting it to the left where his heart is it says right there it's the heart he was hiding the mysteries of redemption [Music] that's what he did at Calvary those three days was the hand coming in when he said it is finished it was the end coming out message the situation under control but not from another Corporal body a restored soul [Music] your soul has got to be restored to take control let's sing it one more time my soul says yes [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but my soul says yes my sources [Music] yes [Music] gracious father almighty God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we realize Lord that without the message of Malachi 4 5. Lord will be having diets that's not conducive for a body transformation father your word has come to tell us that when we feed in the stored food then it brings a restoration to our souls and if that transformation starts within if that makes us to understand Lord that all the other elements will follow suit father because the greatest gift you gave us is our souls therefore Lord we understand that we come from God and we go back to God it was so imperative and important for David to say he restoreth my soul and I pray tonight through these humble words you've allowed us to utter before your people may you so anoint them and give them conductivity in the hearts of your people and start a journey of Soul transformation may your people so be healed inside that it becomes an inside out job that Lord dear God if ever it takes a power of the scripture for a therapy May there be such a weird therapy that your people will start a journey back to the America like you did with that sister from that time May tonight be from that time for somebody Lord I plead your blood and I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Have Thine Own Way bless your people almighty God undertake for them undertake for our youth the young men the brothers the sisters Lord our mothers our fathers and all the Believers in divine presence Lord may we pin it down to the relationship of the word and the soul and we say tonight our soul says yes europa's Father restore our souls Lord the word of God can never be preached and returned to your Void but it has to accomplish that with your purpose for it I plead your blood and I pray in the name of Jesus Christ May Lord such a power of transformation begin to happen in the hearts of your people father as you are building us up for a climax tomorrow I pray that you might have your way in our lives Bless the people mightily in the name of of Christ we thank you tonight we bless your name tonight Lord we celebrate the gift of Life you've given us and
