Bibles we will go right into reading the word tonight and and uh we just want to share a few things with you tonight just to encourage you once again we want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be in the house of the Lord let's take that uh uh famous uh verse Mark chapter 11 where Jesus said when you stand praying forgive amen Mark chapter 11 uh for a good while we we've been having prayer meeting and uh uh I think uh I felt like I was robbing brother brother Lawrence from his position of leading Sons so I just thought that maybe he would just Le Sons an hour tonight but I'm I'm grateful that he was considerate of the time praise the Lord amen Jesus in M mark 11: vers 22 Jesus in Mark 11:22 and we want to greet you again in the name of the Lord Jesus uh both our visible and invisible audience we want to uh just thank you for being with us tonight let's read from verse 22 then Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God praise the Lord can we all say that tonight have faith in God for verily I said unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou remove and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he has said shall which he has said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I said unto you what than whatever you desire when ye prayed be amen am the word of believing is to leave it there praise the Lord you believe give it to the Lord leave it there believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive praise the Lord if ye have ought against any there your your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat tonight I want to I want to do something uh Psalm chapter 119 if you want to turn to Psalm chapter 119 uh let's let's go there tonight I've been I've been looking for the way to speak on this Psalm Psalm 119 oh I was uh I was going to bring my Bible from the office the reason there is that this this uh pet Bible that we have here do not display PSM 100 Chapter 19 in the in the way that uh is supposed to be displayed now you remember uh uh you remember the story brother brandham told a story I want to read a few quotes of brother brandham here and it will it will it will carry us in a way that we will understand where I want to go tonight he first said one time in the message uh you must be born again and uh uh uh he said this U someone was telling brother Brandon why are you now teaching the people spiritual gift you know the believe believe you to be a prophet so he said this he says uh why in the word don't you leave them women you know someone was telling brother Brandon why don't you leave them women and men alone to me said uh yeah bring it bring it thank you thank you I just I just want to show a picture of uh of of what I want to refer to tonight I'll show it to you now wrong with the Bible here on the pit just that it does not have setting display that's that's the reason why why in the word don't you leave them women and men alone to me and said why then the people believe you to be a prophet I said I'm that but the people believe you to be why don't you teach them how to receive Vision how to do the works of God like that I said how can I teach them algebra when they don't know their ABCs right amen now I want I want to talk about ABCs tonight in a in a way uh uh so that's that's the reason why I'm reading this um how can you teach them algebra when they don't know their ABC see how can you take a child out of kindergarten and give him a college education today teach him square roots and measure how can you do it when he don't know what ABC means you know what ABC means always believe Christ amen Jesus said when you stand praying believe so he taking us back to our ABC amen that is the principle thing when you stand praying believe ABC means always believe Christ that's right uh don't believe the church don't believe their Creeds don't believe their Doctrine believe Christ why to to him to know him to know him is life is that right not know his Creed uh he and got no Creed not to even know his word to know his word you got to know him know him as your savior in the New Birth so he's he's telling us it's important for us to know the ABCs of the scripture the ABCs of uh of the things of God you know the common things and and these are the things that are slipping away from us amen we uh we uh we we are paying attention to the Myster we are paying attention to the manifestation of the sons of God uh uh speaking things into existence and these things are slipping away from us but we have to realize that the ABCs are the foundation praise the Lord amen the ABCs of the scripture are the foundation if you if you get the ABCs wrong I mean there is nothing you will get right you see in your AR ra problem they put a uh uh to the square root of B and all of that that goes back to ABC so if you don't know ABC in the value of ABC there is no way you will know algebra praise the Lord are we together now brother Brandon will tell another story uh and this story is very familiar to us let's just read uh impersonation of Christ impersonation of Christianity a little boy one time down south there was a saying that he was kneeling in a road where he had been ploughing a clergy Man passed by and heard the little fellow repeating the alphabet A B C D and so forth and he was on his knees so the clergy man was uh very much uh uh Disturbed so he he heard the little boy repeat the alphabet and then say amen and so he got up while the clery spoke to him and said Sonny uh I'm a servant of the Lord and I heard you praying but you were only saying the afet and I don't understand why you were just saying the afret he said sir I can't pray I had a Praying I had never prayed but I h a Praying Mother and Father which has done gone to heaven and said mother she died when I was such a little boy but I remember of I remember of hearing her when she was in trouble she went to the Lord and she prayed and she died when I was so young so she couldn't teach me to pray and I have been given into the hands of an unkind person who beats me in a mistreatment and I thought maybe after I have learned my ABCs if I could take all the all the words or say all the letters maybe he could put it together and understand what I meant that's the prayer of sincerity not knowing how to pray but he's just saying his ABC and say Lord you just put it together praise the Lord once again going back to the ABCs that's the sincerity certainly he could put them together is not how we pray in our lips is the motives of our heart is what God hear he sometimes don't hear our lips he hear Our intention what the motives of our heart are we together this little L did not know how to pray but he he know he ABC so he said well I'll just I just repeat the ABC now he has a need he's being mistreated he's missing his father and his mother he has a serious just need and don't know how to express it to God Paul told us in the Book of Romans we don't know how to pray I don't know how how smart we think we are he says we don't know how to pray it is the spirit that make intercession it's when that burden in your heart is when you are engaged in that burden in your heart that is the thing that connects to the throne of God Amen that's the thing that God sees it's not our our English language or whatever language language we speak are we together now so what I wanted to do tonight I just wanted to just do something a little bit uh uh all of these thoughts came to me uh uh um I studying uh uh Psalm chapter 119 is the longest Psalm in the Bible and if I'm not mistaken it it should be the longest chapter in the Bible praise the Lorden uh uh uh it has about 176 verses if you study Psalm chapter if you study Psalm chapter 119 you will realize that the suit did something very beautiful he did something very very beautiful I just I've just been trying to find a way to bring it to you and I hope that the Lord will help us tonight he did something beautiful because the way that Psalm 119 is designed I wanted to show you it you see it it it breaks with little titles right all these little titles are the 22 letters in the aphabet in the Hebrew aphabet so the psalm took each letter in the Hebrew aphabet and he expressed praises to God praise the Lord amen he took each letter of the Hebrew alphabet I forgot I had a I had a image uh that that that string shorted I did not send it uh they will have shown you it I didn't bring my phone okay it's okay it's okay so I I will showing you what what he did is that the way he designed it the way the suit on the inspiration did is that from the first letter the first letter uh uh uh in the Hebrew alphabet is is Olive which is where Psalm chapter uh 191 start from so with that Olive if you look in the Hebrew Bible you will see every verse verse started with an olive every verse started with an olive then he goes and the Beautiful Thing also is that every verse every uh uh uh uh uh of those segment of verses in the in the in the Bible is eight verses praise the Lord I'm not a musicians but the musicians can tell you better on the on the piano the piano is designed in a way that it takes eight verses I mean eight calls in the space of eight calls in a space of Eight Keys you see she say there you go because I'm not a musician you know in the space of eight keys to make a call and every eight Keys is an alive now so you see this is a Musical musical design you think about it now yeah there is this little boy that don't know how to pray but he has been able to design a way to be able to speak to God lord you know my heart you know my needs I don't know how to pray but you know my needs and he says he kept repeating his ABC ab B C D or he gets to Z he goes back again AB b c d he just is right there AB B C D and and and and and and I mean anybody would think that he was he was crazy praise the Lorden are we together now so uh uh uh the psalmist just like I said every every uh every verse I uh I read this home with with the kids and we we did a very beautiful beautiful thing where we took each eight verse and then uh we had to repeat something just like he started in verse uh one blessed are the undefiled in the way who WTH in the laws of the Lord verse two he goes blessed are they that keep verse three will be blessed if then the next one will be praises to Him that is on the mountain praises to Him that created the Heaven and the Earth praises to Him that that gave me life praises to Him that wake me up this morning then the next one will be glory to God in the highest and that that's just how he went when you look in the Hebrew Bible that's how it's designed are we together amen now I'm saying this tonight to be able to tell you or encourage you the importance of going back to to the ABCs when I say going back to the ABCs I think is it's going back to those things of value going back to those things that that are fundamental and not uh not to be caught up in all of the uh not to be caught up in in all of the there is there is one there is one group of uh I'm trying to see if I can find it quickly there is only two if you look in verse 30 137 righteous are doubt oh Lord uh the upright and upright at the Judgment that testimony that testimony then he goes down to verse vers 40 Thy word then he goes down to verse 41 uh uh uh thy precept I I I'm smart and despised yet I forget not that precept in in verse 142 that righteousness in uh in uh uh uh 143 you will see thy commandment if you read down you're going to see it and and just like that now when the P was doing this he was not doing it for theological studies he was doing it as his expression to God as a praise I'm I'm going to take the the the the alret the the the 22 letters in the in in the alret and I'm going to just run the praise to God praise the Lord Amen brother BR would talk about uh uh uh not growing in a Christian home and when the Lord started dealing with him he says I didn't know how to pray it's a boy that was out there in the wooding and uh wanted to talk to God I didn't know how to do it but then I wrote on a piece of paper and I he say I stuck it on the tree and say God lord I know you can read when you pass by please read my not that is coming from a s a a death of sincerity this is somebody expressing something to God like Hezekiah said after the syan send him and Note and said we coming down there we're going to car everyone he go right down there put the note right to the to the Altar and said God this is what the king of Syria said praise the Lord I mean he can go on his knees and say Jehovah You Deliver Us from from from from uh H Ramset in Egypt you open the red seed Lord you were the pillow of Fire by night you were the pillow of cloud by day he could have done all of that praise the Lord amen but you see sometimes uh uh uh when you have a when you have a when you have a true burden when you have when you are overburdened let me say it that way when you are overwhelmed praise the Lord amen amen it is just it is just at a place where uh uh uh uh uh religion or the church you know has has designed our mind to understand that you know you got to get on your knees you got to close your eyes and you got to find this place where nobody will hear you you know and and and because of that we don't take the time to be able to say things to God out of our heart because we don't find our best place to pray the moment where we supposed to cry out to God and just and just let it out we don't do it because our mind has been so factioned by religion that we have to do it a certain way at a certain time at a certain place before God will hear it are we together praise the Lord going back to the ABCs now so uh uh uh I just I just uh I just thought on there I just wanted to encourage you a little bit like I said I just on that and uh uh uh you know just just to encourage you that uh uh I mean you have to invest on your prayer life brother bam says it's one of the sacri virtue that God gave to the church amen that's one of the sacri virtue that that God gave to the church he says that right here in invisible Union we have read that before I'm going to pick it up here he says now she has a sacred one uh I want to name three things here that she must not get away from he says I want to need three things that she must not get away from he says now I'm I'm I'm speaking keep the church in mind why I'm speaking this to the Natural Woman but what have we done we have left the church and we run after the Natural Woman praise the Lord amen oh say she might have a mother who say she might have a a woman who oh say she you know you know we have left he says keep the church in mind I'm only using the woman as a type but the church must not get away from these three things are we together now he goes down he says uh what what what a Sac chust I've spoken this before and uh uh h brother B taught us right there he says the reason why is because the promise of redemption was given to the woman it was not the man's seed it was the woman's seed that would bruise the head of the seing if we only understand the unique place that a woman H uh uh uh uh uh uh take before God I I don't want to get out of track tonight I I don't want to get out of track tonight there is something that is making me to say there but I will I might I might just address it let me stay right where I am tonight what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman see now see why she is a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtue to her husband the church has a Sac responsibility to prayer to the word to Christ and what he said from there the three things that she must not get away from praise the Lord she must not get away from because we we will just be having a form of godliness or having a form of message believer and and we will not have the power because a prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian there is no way you can bring this word to pass there is no way you can believe God for fulfilling his word in your life if you are not on speaking terms with God there is no way if you are now on speaking terms with God there is no way it it it would just become a slogan in our mou or the tpol the manifestation of the sons of God you know speaking missing LS back into place all of those things will just become a a slogan and that's why it has become he says three things that she must not get away from her responsibility to prayer to the word her responsibility to pray your to and to the word you have a responsibility daily responsibility to this word are we together okay that's not what I want to talk about tonight let's go to 2 King chapter 14 while I come to church tonight the Lord kind of drop little thing in my heart uh toss tonight and I want to pick on that because I've never told you what I'm speaking on tonight I want to speak on a parable a parable that uh a lady said to to David one time I give you the background of the story and then we will read the scripture David saw Absalon had stood against his father and uh uh and he have k kick David and the rest of the men out of Israel he was going to take and and joab joab uh if you if you know the relationship of joab to David you he will understand why joab because joab was uh he was like an uncle he was related to David even as as as an in-law Al so I will bring you to the real uh relationship but he was related to David that's the reason why he was very he was very very dedicated and joab was not happy when Absalon was misbehaving he was not happy praise Lord amen amen now you have to realize that nathon has already told David that the the one that will that will take the throne after David will be Solomon which of course it was not it was not highly you know uh it was not a highly favored thing because everybody knew what happened between uh David and BBA now but uh but that was that was the way that God designed it amen that was the way that God designed it because uh we our coming to the Earth would come through adultery the SE in Eve it was an adultery amen so God was also trying to to bring a type you know he was trying to bring a tipe now so so uh uh uh uh joab was not happy so uh joab decided that I I I get hold of this boy he knew David heart towards Absalon and uh uh so joab set up the man and he you know he he he instructed the man and did everything I mean joab work he worked behind the scene he went and told uh uh someone to go and and tell AIT that uh you know uh uh uh uh how the battle was going to be set and all of that and I gave a wrong counsel they never cut David he hang himself and joab was working behind the scene and finally joab will command that uh anyone that get the the board absolon you kill him he knew that was a direct dis order to the king but he wanted to deal with this mod so Absalon ran and absolon hang himself because he was he was out growing his head and he was trying to pass a tree and and his head got stuck in the tree he hanged himself and then he was killed David heard the story that David was weeping David was unconsolable nobody could consel him he was crying and crying and crying and uh and and and you know and and David called his man and ask them and says uh tell me is joab hand in this you know and uh you know and and somebody told joab I mean uh David that yeah you know joab this this is how joab instructed and this this this and all of that so so joab now being a wise man also a man of war he decided to go and meet this woman that's her story we will read here in 2 King chapter 14 let's go there quickly this is a Wednesday night we don't have a lot of time on our hands verse one which tells us now joab the son of zero perceived that the king heart was towards Absalon and joab sent to C and FH and fesh hands a wise woman and said unto her I pray thee frame thyself uh to be a mooner and put on now moon in the parot and anoint thyself with oil but be as a woman that have a long time mouring for the dead and come to the king and speak and and and and speak on this manner uh unto him so joah put words in her mouth he built a story praise the Lord amen and the the story that he built he buil the story using David condition but the woman is putting it in the place of her lossing her son are we together so he put words in the woman mouth and when the the the woman of tea speak unto the king speaking to David she fell on her face to the ground and did obedient and said oh King help oh king and the King said unto her what Li the and she answered I I I am indeed a wiow woman and my husband is dead and the head men have two sons and uh and uh they two stro together in the field and there was none to part them but but the one SM the other and SL him and behold the whole family is Raising against the hmet and and they said deliver him that stone his brother and we will kill him praise the Lord for the life of his brother whom he slayed and we will we will destroy the hells also and so they shall quench the C which is let amen you remember we talk about letting the Candlestick and now in the fire to go off so what actually she's saying here my husband is dead I having two sons one killed the other one and now the whole tribe want to kill my son if they do kill him we will not have a representative we will we will not have anybody to carry the touch of his father we will lost our inheritance are we together so she's she's making the she's making her case serious to the king that this is a matter of my inheritance are we together now uh verse 8 and the King said unto the woman go go to that house and and and I will give a charge concerning theed and the woman of said unto the king oh my Lord oh King the iniquity uh uh the iniquity be on me and on my father house and the king and the King and his throne be Guiltless and the King said what whatsoever whosoever said unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee anymore praise the Lord amen then said she I pray thee let the king remember let let the king remember the Lord thy God that thou who not suffer the the venge of blood to destroy anymore least they destroy my son and he said as the Lord liveth it looks like David was found to be you know taking taking place on the word because it was almost the same thing that naan did to him there as the Lord live there shall n one head of thy son fall to the Earth then the woman said let uh let that helmet I pray thee say one word unto my Lord the king and he said say on now it is almost like the king is giving his word he expect for the woman to believe it and go from his presence but he keep finding the woman coming back and keep bringing the story back to him again so pretty soon David is either becoming agitated or David is becoming concerned that this looks like a setup praise the Lord because the King has given his word praise the Lord and when the king speaks to you it is enough you don't need a pastor between you and the King amen if the King has spoken to you take his word and go with it praise the Lord but she keeps coming back again so watch how how the the the the how it plays out here and the woman said wherefore then have thou taught such a think against the people of God for the king dog speak this thing as one which is faultless now she turning the story on David how can you think how can you think about things like this on the people of God what is she saying somebody has taken our King off the throne and this very person that rebelled against the kingdom is dead and now you want to forsake your duty because a rebellious Man is dead that's what she's saying she turning the thing in the face of the king watch let's go ahead and a woman said where wherefore then have thou taught such a thing against the people of God for the king does speak this as one which is faultless in that the king does not fish home again his banish for for we must need died and as a water spilled on the ground cannot be gathered up again neither does God respect any person yet thus he devis means that his that his banish be not expel from him praise the Lord now so I'm going to just take a phrase from there water spilled on the ground cannot be gathered again that's what I want to speak on tonight so that's your story you can read the rest of it when you go home but I will get into my inspiration tonight amen a water spilled to the ground cannot be gathered what is done is done praise the Lord amen amen now Jesus said when you stand pray if you have ought against anybody forgive praise the Lord that's that's a very very important statement because brother Brandon says faith is the found I mean forgiveness is the foundation of Faith that's why he said in uh the statue of man he said forgiveness is the foundation of Faith praise the Lord amen amen you cannot have true faith that is expressed to God when you have all in your heart against somebody or holding something against somebody what has happened has already happened that's right praise the Lord and waterers spilled to the ground and you cannot gather it praise the lord it's the same way we've wasted time you can't get it if you waste your times you can't gather that time back that's the reason why Paul says redeem the time because the days are evil it's not to go back and get the wasted time but manage your time that's what it means manage your time be productive in your time because wasted time can never be gathered again are we together amen praise the Lord now you see what I'm coming to tonight and I hope that uh uh it's it's a blessing to you amen so uh uh this is a parable it's a it's a very powerful Parable a a a story of forgiveness and Redemption is a story of redemption praise the Lord amen if you read the rest of the story you you will realize that the Lord used that situation to get David off of his uh H how can I call it his Mooney bed and and his his grumpy State and and uh uh uh to get off of his state of uh uh uh uh regret and whatever whatever condition he was in because it was not a healthy condition praise the Lord the way that God ordained of bringing a king to a throne was not the way that Absalon followed for a while the people rejoiced and celebrated after him but I mean there were people in the land that knew that this is not the way that God ordained for us to have King are we together if Absalon is dead he's dead let's bury him let's move on they are important things for us to take care of Praise the Lord we need to save the kingdom we need to save the church we have our family to save we have we have things to pay attention to Let's startop wasting time on foolishness praise the Lord because it's not going to help you it's not going to help you for the matter of fact in the way that brother that Jesus Christ taught uh uh uh uh uh uh unforgiving unforgiving spirit he Tau about it in a way that uh uh if you have an unforgiving spirit in your life Jesus said you are tormented by demons simple he gave the parable about this man that was in his bus little money the bus forgive him but he will not forgive his friend what did Jesus say at the end of that Parable grab him and turn him to the tormenters that's right that's what Jesus said so what what is the what is the sense of that it is on forgiving Spirit expose you to Demons it expose you to being Ted amen dragging things in your mind even even with your own your own life it don't have to be somebody praise the Lord amen if you filed the Lord and you did something that was not right you get on your knees Jesus said when you pray believe confess your fault put it under the blood and be able to go past that because you see what it is is that uh uh uh uh many people are stuck in their past they are stuck in their past they cannot go they cannot go into a bright future they cannot go into a glorious future they cannot go into a Redemptive future that is waiting for them they are so stuck in that because their God is a God that you know a god of Vengeance that is so angry with them he's so angry that he wakes them up in the morning and he gets so angry with them he wake you up and he's angry with you why he wake you up then are we together so we we we have to we have to look at this and and the reason why I'm saying this is that because you have to remember I read right here where brother Brandon says he says that uh these three things that she must not get away from she must not get away from those are sacred VT those are sacred trust that is given to the church let me tell you you don't learn how to pray you don't uh uh uh you don't you don't you don't go to school for it you don't you don't buy it I mean I mean uh h h h getting on speaking terms with God creating a relationship with the invisible God believing that angels are come about you you don't pay money for that it's not your natural birth right it's not because you are born in a message that's the reason why we are becoming an intitle and we are losing those values we are losing them that's the reason why we are becoming powerless all we can do is to just F and back and for and back when we supposed to learn to take thing to take things to God In Prayer what a friend we have in Jesus that's the song We Sing take everything to the Lord in prayer what a privilege when we sing the song we are standing on Holy Ground amen and I Know Thy Angels amen is not a record amen it's a reality amen David said as the mountain surround Jerusalem so the Lord surround His People amen are we together we we take these things to be so common and and and and we are just we are just losing those things that that that that that that they are the fundamental value of our faith fundamental value they are fundamental value of our faith we must not hear the word of God to to just pick up a nugget people listening to the message just want oh why brother Bri said this and so they can be the first one to send that's not the reason we must be falling in love with Jesus we must be falling in love with Jesus it must be how we can apply that word to our life how can I apply it to me oh God speak to me let your word change my life now how much cat I can send to people to show how I'm reading the message and you know I'm so inspired and and I'm connected and I mean all of those things they are just wasted time that's right this whole thing is about relationship it's a father amen that called us as his children wanting us to know that there is none special we are all his children he love all us all the same Amen brother talk the story about scking his foot out and and and and and and Becky say oh I get all of that he says I stretched my foot out on the side and Sarah came all the side and and Sarah says you get all of daddy but Daddy get all of me and that's the same thing that God do to every one of us we all can have access to God there are no special men and with special gift and special we it's we must not limit God but what are we doing doing we are wasting precious things Jesus said it this way he says casting purse before swarms you see that's what we must not do that's what we must not do praise the Lord L amen amen there is no there is no uh H uh uh menu book that you read in the message how to dress and how to how to do this as as the Lord is giving Grace for us to to appreciate decency and and and and and and and create boundaries in our lives those those things does not come by your natural birth the reason why that that that Grace is upon you is because you are hanging around the word leave this word you will be surprised how you will dress to go out there leave this word or let the word leave you you will be surprised that's the reason why we still we still sit under the word and and I mean we we we are just we are just managing all our W and all our thing we are managing it why because we're getting away from from the things that were that were that were that were precious Paul says we are Washed by the Water of the word all of these things that Grace set before us give to us freely they they are no longer valuable to us it's all about self-impression we are all about wanting to impress somebody who you want to impress glory be to God Amen are we together I hope I'm making sense here amen see here let me read another story to you this this story I've heard this over and over and over but I did not grab it like I got it this time and I think if I listen to it again I will get it better but listen to this brother Brandon I have had Sund he talks about the story of this of this chaplain I had a chaplain friend that was telling me of a case in the second world now this is the story where he was talking about whatever you leave the Lord you have to go back that's where you will find him praise the Lord okay that's that's that's where he came up with the story talking about whenever you left the Lord go back then you will find you pick him up from there so he tell this um a chaplain friend of the second world and uh there had been a chaplain uh had been machine guned wave I guess about 50 caliber machine gun he was cut across the chest and he was dying and this chaplain was called to him they told him to go out to the tent and they did just pick him up in the hospital in the hospital tent that he was dying he couldn't live he he was he was already cut through with bullets and he couldn't live he was bleeding in Waring and so the chaplain said he got told the man where he was at and he said uh uh he said uh Captain okay it was a captain that was shot a chaplain and a captain is like I'm missing the two year he said Captain are you a Christian he says I used to be and he said you used to be why you should be now now that you used to be what what happening there he was stuck in his past I used to be I used to you are in the past you cannot make the past your hero faith is now Paul says now Faith is now what I was it's now he says you should be now because you know you are dying he said yes sir I know he said now now captain now think back with all now you better think fast cuz you haven't got much time but you you you think back all the way back to where you left Christ and right where you left him then you start right there and begin right there CU you will find him right where you left him now you might have left him on the doctrine of the Bible some uh something that something that you were told thou shall not Ste you walk uh uh right over it thou shall not lie you walk right over it and uh uh something another that you should not have done yet you walk right over it you will have to come right straight back and pick it up right there again and and so this Captain was bleeding in in W and the blood gushing out of his lungs and he was he was catching his birth fast and and he he knew he was going uh uh you better hurry the chaplain said you better hurry up Captain and he said I just I just don't exactly remember and after the while a light come over his face he said I remember I remember right where I left him said all right Captain start right there he said now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep and if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take and he dropped over where did he leave Christ at the Cradle see at Mother's feet that was the thing that struck me as a little boy because this thing he said it's a bedtime prayer that many parents teach their children that's right you see you see uh we we we get we get so much caught up in in lot of things that sometimes we are far from the reality I would tell you when when when I when I read this man I mean it just there with me the whole thing to realize that it is only God that can reconcile the soul of a man it's only God praise the Lord your duty is to tell people you can't reconcile you can't reconcile the soul the way that God would take this word I'm saying to you tonight and make it real to you I can do it I can't do it it's not by me shouting or bounding on this thing that is going to make it real to you I I scare you to death and yet it's not real to you but it's only God that can reconcile see that man on his dying bed that the Lord will take him back many years when he was a little boy and on Mama's lap when Mama will be praying asking him to pray to go to bed he will be making fun he never got the reality of it he just thought it was a religion he never got the reality he just thought that it was a religion to realize that all of these years whether he was was going to church I mean he couldn't even tell whether he was a Christian or not even on his dying bed is because his soul was far from the reality your body can dress the message but it's your soul that need to be in contact with God that's what this message was all about God sent a a a a prophet to put us in contact with God David said restore my my soul I The Creator at Mother's feet see as a little boy he had to go all the way back there to pick him up I was thinking about this and I and I just thought in my mind look at the teeth on the cross how would Jesus said be you tomorrow you will be with me in Paradise definitely God found a way to reconcile his soul God found a way to take him back to the m amen amen David to a and and uh H aimc is taking Sarah the very woman that's supposed to bring the promised son and that very night God will come down now I've always believed in my heart that God found a way to reconcile David praise the Lord God only comes in our defense when he has found a way to reconcile Us Praise the Lord amen message of great brother says God David repented he just he said it out of inspiration there is nowhere in the scripture that tells us that David repented but the truth about the matter there is that God is the one that reconcile our soul God is the one that can reconcile mortar there is no mortar that is able to reconcile himself with God or with another mortar there is no mortar that is able to reconcile himself With God all with another Mort I we together as said little boy he had to go way back there pick him up that's where you would pick him where you left him and sometimes uh we are leaving him right in these simple things we take it to be simple we take it just to be simple things not not not not only our assembly is something that is that is global around around the message people you know like I I took a time here to to teach on the church order a little bit you know uh that that time that time we we uh we we are gravitating to to uh uh uh uh laisha Church order then the church order that was given to us that time you know that uh that uh uh brother Bram says you know we we come in and we sit and we pray and and you know uh uh uh we we try to disengage our mind you know relax our spirit and all of that prepared our s that is the beginning of the service it's not when the song service leader come up here is the beginning that is the beginning of the service that's where we begin that's where the praying of the service begin read read both Church order you never find the place where brother Brandon talk about opening prayer he never said it in the church order why because the prayer open when when the brother is sitting down you're praying when the sister is s but you globally it's everywhere around around the world that value has gone away it has gone away and brother says he said if uh if uh if pharaoh and his and his men knew if they knew they would have taken that Ro from Moses hands when he dropped it down it turned to serpent they were so scared that I mean they could only impersonate but they could not come near if they knew they would have taken it and brother B said that's the same thing H just like how the rod was in in in in Moses hands that is the way the name of Jesus Christ is in the church that is the way prayer is in the church that is the way the word is in the church you take it away from the church you just have a bunch of gathering amen you just have a group of people that that belong to something they call the message that's what he's saying right here we took it completely from the church now we we we we we plague our poor sisters our poor daughter brother says you you get three sacrifice what's about the church he says I'm saying this thing to the church keeping the woman in tight she's just a type now I'm I'm not angry with you don't think I'm angry with you amen I talk like this and and uh people say well you were really blasting I'm not blasting are you I'm just I'm just trying to to deal with some Spirits amen you just take it like that all the time that I'm dealing with some Spirits I'm not angry I should I have no reason to be angry with you for you to leave your home come your Wednesday night and I just get mad with you I should be out of my mind I should be stupid to do that I'm not mad with you I'm just trying to call our attention for us to realize that we got to go back to the age BCS there were things that were so valuable to us when we believe the Lord there were things that we will not sleep over we will not sleep over we will not sleep over it but now it does not matter to us we sleep over and you know and uh you know have a little talk you know with our wife go to the other place and I mean how how are we keeping Christ then that's right how are we keeping Christ we give reason why we must not do what the word says we always find a reason we always find a reason to bring in a little bit of Wess we always find a reason and that is the thing that is making the church powerless that's right because you have to realize that there are spirits involved this is a spiritual warfare and when the people are not praying and not concentrating themselves you have more demon powers creeping on our shoulders and we come struggling and struggling and hallelujah praise the Lord and and I mean we can't even break through just like the preacher should break through when he's preaching you also have to break through when the preacher is preaching you have to be connected to the word you come for your soul to be fed it's not to come and watch somebody performing on a pit but I'm just here to encourage you tonight and says wasted water cannot be gathered when you waste time you waste these precious things praise the Lord I mean if people have to be to work and other things is that's good but if you don't have to be to work you just take the pleasure and enjoyment to sit home and and follow service online well I mean uh uh you have to you it have to be for some important reason the reason why I'm saying that is because uh one is because it's the truth praise the Lord and two is because brother brandom said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said life comes through the body praise the Lord life comes through the body when when when when when the when the when the when a child is conceived it's a life but it it builds that there have to be a body to sustain that life there has to be a body to sustain that life now if if for some reason the body is uh is is is paralyzed or is uh uh handicapped you will realize that it's going to struggle praise the lord it's going to struggle the church must not only rest on the musicians it must not only rest on the preacher we all makes the body we all makes the body I never one time believe in my mind that if I'm not in church there will not be a good service I never one time believe that I must never think that in my head I know it's my responsibility but I don't I don't put it in my head I'm not the one that make the service he promised that wheresoever two or three I gather in my name I will be there that's what he said and that's what we believe but again I'm saying it in this way just to encourage you you know uh uh precious things I mean every one of us we can go back every one of us us because every every son or daughter that is birthed by God there is a special moment in our lives I mean if you have not had that yet you got to check your birth and it is those things when the when they when when the enemy can take away sometimes it's hard to get it it's hard to get it that's right because it is not something that you can purchase it's not something that you can work yourself up to get no you got those things because the grace of God rewarded you with it that's how you got it and when it go sometimes it's hard for you to get it it's hard if I if I want to be honest with you I can even I tell of my own self you know there there are there are there are things that uh I think I lost spiritually and I want to get back to that place I mean the the the hour is so is so close the hour is so deceiving the hour is so you know there's so much pressure and I just trying to encourage you waste of time cannot be G get anymore waste the money you can't get it back so anything wasted is hard to get praise the Lord she told David all you doing is waste the water you can't gather it you can't gather waste of water what has happened has happened Paul says leaving those things in the past let's press onto the mark of the high calling the thing that is difficult for us is leaving no we we don't he said leaving we don't do leaving we do dragging instead of leaving we put it on our shoulder and we drag it as soon as we go through little things we go start Gathering everything from the past it it because I did this it it because you mean that the blood the the the sea of forgetfulness is so low that you able to put your hand there and pick up things what kind of see what kind of see is that I think we get bathed up not SE forgetfulness we get some of we just get little sink we confess our sins in little sink that we can just go and pick it up back because if you are putting it in a seed and the devil use all of these things to Rob us put us under pressure keep us under fear here yes yes when the joy of the Lord is our strength the Lord bless you tonight musicians you can come over if the Lord allowed us we will continue brother Brooks is having a special meeting this weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday and uh so I will be with him on Friday night but I'll be back here I'll be back home on Sunday morning so you just pray for pray for me pray for us we drive down let to go and support him those that want that will love to go there I mean now I don't know who's the preacher he never told me he just told me now he had some special meetings he

in mind what I'm speaking this to the Natural Woman as Paul is here in the seventh chapter of Roman she has a sacri trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord she has a SA what a responsibility it is to a woman to a church to the bride now see why she is a type of the church which is which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtue to her husband the church has a sacr responsibility to prayer to the word read your Bible and pray don't survive on the the the quot of the day it's good read the quot of the day but find your own time with the Lord read the word commune with God [Music] the church has a responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ we have a responsibility to Christ to the anointing to the headship to the leadership of the holy spirit because you can get in the word and you just just become the a theologian you just learning you're learning this you learning brother Bram said that the Bible say this
