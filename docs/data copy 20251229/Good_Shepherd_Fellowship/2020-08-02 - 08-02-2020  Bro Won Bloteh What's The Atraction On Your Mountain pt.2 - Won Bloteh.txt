believe that's what the holy ghost must do it must make everything feel like heaven to you amen the holy ghost will make every experience feel like heaven to you amen praise the lord because we get we get the earnest we get the down payment down here so you start feeling like that year before you get there if you don't have the feeling here i don't know where you would get it from amen because we start feeling like that year before we get there praise the lord that's why he gave us the promise of the holy ghost that's why he healed our sicknesses that's what he delivered us because it's an earnest of the inheritance it's a down payment when you get sick and you experience god's healing it shows that there is a lame where there is no sickness that's all it's about it's not to make a church we are preparing ourselves for a trip we are preparing ourselves to get out of here and i believe enemy man praise the lord amen amen you know brother branham says he says he says uh heaven is a it's a it's a dimension amen and it's just like hell hell is also the dimension he told us that hell is now on earth you find that's the reason why the people they always they have that language man if he likes hell amen when people are going through struggle or suffering you know why it's so hell i mean it's it's it's it's a dimension it's a word praise alone and if the word going through their trials and their difficulties can stop feeling hell on them the believer must also be feeling heaven in their soul amen no matter what we go through praise the lord amen praise the lord it's not the music that he likes heaven is is is the experience that is in your heart that feed likes heaven the joy unspeakable full of glory that feed likes heaven amen it's not the church gathering that feed likes heaven whether we are in church or out of church we must feel like heaven amen that's that's that's the earnest the earnest of our inheritance praise the lord amen god bless you you may have your seat because i've already started preaching so i might we might just pray and go home now amen praise the lord you know we were fellowshipping yesterday and i was telling but one that says there is one benefit that we have of this message the son of man ministry brought us one unique benefit they had that that were that were they were really experienced during the ages we know that paul he went to the tear heaven we know that that philip he was picked up by the holy spirit he was transported to meet the eunuch on on under on the river that was traveling away from jerusalem so you see in the sort of ministry you see brother branham traveling into people life he i mean he he will he would discern people he says i'm just waiting on that one he says okay i see you when you were four years old this is what happened to you now so the son of man ministry has brought us this unique benefit to transport us to transport us back to bible days praise the lord amen to transport us brother branham a question and answer on genesis he says well let me take you to the banister of time let's hang over the banister of time let's look at the galaxies let's start to see the things that god did before they were there the earth ever came to be what was he doing he was transporting us praise the lord that is the benefit of the son of man ministry that is the reason why when the holy ghost starts dealing with you you can be able you you can be transported to some of your past and transported to some things in your life that you did not understand and you say oh i see why praise the lord you know when you start experiencing that you know what is happening to you you are growing wings and one of these days you fly out of here praise the lord when you start when you start looking back into the past and looking into things that god been doing in your life he says oh i see why oh praise the lord your wings are growing just keep stretching them one of these days you're going to fly out of here praise the lord it's a unique benefit that the son of man ministry has brought us is to transport us praise the lord we want to thank the lord and so grateful we're having few prayer requests this morning we will now want to jump over them but wesley calling this morning sister carol was troubled a little bit a little bit with her blood pressure so they couldn't be with us and they wanted us to pray and remember them in prayer and also continue to remember the adult or sarah in prayer as well and i believe they will also appreciate the prayer for candy as well we will remember them the alice had to uh pack out of their house yesterday so uh i think that's the reason why they are now with us so they also asked for our prayers brother john bibi in his household having an unspoken prayer request they want us to remember them in prayer so they are now with us as well we would just remember these different families trying to see if i'm not missing a prayer request here and i think brothers brother scott said it all with that experience of that young lady this morning and and i i just believe that we have to realize church that we just we just did uh 25 years anniversary and i would like to say this you know a church it takes a while before sometimes and many times the people really grab the vision of the church the church is not the building it's not because we just come here and we meet you it is now also because we believe the message it's true we believe the message we believe jesus christ as our lord and savior but you see when god called the people together he gives them a vision and their vision becomes their burden that's the reason why the prophet says i mean solomon said we are vision the people perish because if the people don't have a vision they don't have what to live up for and in that way they can just go in come out you know i mean they can just treat church like like anything but when the people have a vision when the people actually understand why we are on 900 a humble avenue while we are on the corner of this street why god put us on the corner of the street if we really understand it i mean we will not have to be chasing people to come to church we will not have to be you know uh uh i mean looking forward to do this and looking for what to do there i mean everybody will get involved when the people really grab the vision of the church and sometimes it takes a long time it takes a long time but i believe we are heading in that [Music] direction and when it comes to that place word god gave us a baptism as a church where he gave us a baptism and and and unite us together i mean it would be so easy to preach it would be so easy to sing a song because the people already know where we are heading the pastor will not have to preach something and somebody get get ugly about it if they get ugly about it they just know that they get a wrong spirit on them praise the lord you know that's the reason why you know brother branham in the church order you know they are pre that there are purpose habits you come on the poopy you start looking for different things to do i hope this jail don't become my poopy habit amen praise the lord because i stopped pouring it on my hand amen and oh yeah yeah sister real yeah i think that's one of the prayer requests that was on my mind sister real brother jairo's wife she having an egg on her leg spoke with her yesterday and uh [Music] strange pain of burning uh you know pains and she did an x-ray and the doctors couldn't see anything so uh and it's so painful so she want us to to remember her in prayer you know so we put on on the prayer list this morning and we as we go to the lord in prayer now so you see uh i mean that's that's i i mean i believe that we're healing in that direction you know and uh i just i just pray like i said if god give us a baptism as a church you know we can have our individual baptism of the holy ghost but we need a baptism of a church you know i believe all those disciples 120 in the upper room they all had their different experiences of christ but when they were gathered in the ho in the in the upper room god initiated them together as the birth of the first church yes in the house of calendars he did the same thing again he could have met them in their rooms he could have met them in different places but he decided to to just initiate the first gentile group together praise the lord oh i'm i'm looking forward to that one of these days the holy ghost come and sweep through this building you shouting streaming over your words and don't even know what is happening you can't fake it because you fake it you'll feel so bad because you will know that it is not real but when the holy ghost get ahold of you and you can control yourself a humble you praise the lord because after you finish shouting glory to god when you come to yourself you just sit down quietly but when you fake it you will feel so bad because your inner man will tell you you were faking it praise the lord as we as we go i begin this uh a month of uh august this evening we will come together for the little time of prayer uh by which we would do uh a communion service and i will uh as the month goes on i would like to set up a time of prayers uh for the brothers come together have a time of prayers if we can be able to have a time with the sisters we will do the same and i'm looking forward to also have a time with the young people before before we go back to school i mean the entire school year is challenging with everything that is going on and so we are looking we've been working on it uh trying to find uh three days where we can get the young people together uh i will ask you i'll ask your parents to be for you to be under my kid praise the lord but those three days you will have to surround your cell phone if you can then just forget about it don't come if your cell phone is so dear to you then don't come we'll have to get off the cell phone and get have confidence with god amen because we want young people to leave those meetings with the baptising of the holy ghost that's what i'm desiring we're still working on it so we will let you to know i mean because of everything that's been going on we have now had our our couple couples meeting i mean i mean this demon calls coronavirus i just had just been trying to set everybody on the edge but we would tell him that we have been giving dominion amen praise the lord and so we will we would want to use put a lot of time to praying and encourage praying and dedication around this time as we go to the months ahead we don't know what is i mean what what other changes may come we don't know you know and so we just want to pray you have we have to realize and remember you know god place us here the position of the bride right now in the earth is just like uh uh uh uh esther you know uh uh and and just like uh uh abigail and uh she was the mercy you know hauling david back from bringing judgment on the earth and that is the position of the bride you know we we have to constantly pray and and keep praying and just keep praying praise the lord i know i mean we're trying to do everything to stay uh in in in order with the lord and everything but uh i just believe that the shout of the king is in this camp amen praise the lord and uh we stay we have a brazen second year that we can look to for our healing and uh there's a smitten rock you know that is doing wonders among his people so uh uh let's just take those prayer requests yesterday we had two of our young people uh elijah and an area got baptized yesterday and we thank the lord for that and we look forward to see many of our young people surrounding their life to christ amen taking their first step of a public confession you know accepting the lord jesus christ as their lord and savior and the scripture says they that are baptized shall be saved that's the promise we want to bring them honor until as the law will continue to deal with their heart amen praise the lord so we thank the lord let just be our house together as we remember these prayer requests pray for sister uh carrot and and that old devil that keep battering her with blood pressure but wesley let's pray that god we give our brother strength and and be with him let's uh remember uh sister real that the law would just touch her legs and then once again let's pray for that young woman that brother scared i mentioned you know i mean god just said it i mean it was just god that set it up i mean he's talking with the woman i came passing by he caught my attention you know and that one thing i told her i told her i said i said sister what you need is not really a church what you need i i believe what is happening to you is the god of heaven and earth is dealing with your heart and you need to start reeling your bible get down on your knees in your bedroom and find that god because if you don't find him church can frustrate people sometimes it can disappoint people but jesus never disappoints let's buy our house together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus

jesus oh yes my lord [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you let's stand on our feet praise the lord let's stand on our feet and read the word thank you musicians matthew chapter 5. matthew chapter 5 praise the lord praise the lord amen matthew chapter 5. praise the lord let's read from verse 13 matthew chapter 5 reading from verse 13. ye are the salt of the earth but if the sword have lost its silver wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden on the fault of man ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot behave ye are the light of the world and you are also a city that is set on the hill remember now we've been talking about what is your attraction on your mountain or what is the attraction on your mountain so here jesus christ is stopping you as a city and he's putting you on the hill you are just like the new jerusalem that's what he's trying to is he's saying here you are a city that is on the hill praise the lord yeah the light of the world the city that is set on the hill cannot be hid neither do man light a candle and put it under the bush shell but on a candlestick and it gave a light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven revelation chapter 21. can you remember we've been we've been encouraging ourselves that god has given us a lot of experiences from the day we came from our mother woman even coming forth from our mother woman was our first experience you know whether we were crying or whether we were shouting for joy but there was a noise when we came out and and as we grow and go along we had different different experiences and all of those things is a type of the mountains around about jerusalem because those are the very things that god will use throughout our life journey to be able to draw us to him praise the lord revelation chapter 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth and the first heaven and the first f will pass away and there was no more seed and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride a door for her husband a new jerusalem coming down prepared as a bride remember in john chapter 14 jesus says i go to prepare a place for you amen and we know in every wedding ceremony you know uh uh uh you know there is there is just that special thing the awaiting of the bride because there is a lot of preparation that goes into it amen so this this new jerusalem said i saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven praise the lord i i i okay let me just read and we pray prepared as a bride adore for her husband let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we just want to thank you and we ask your blessings this morning upon your word the the little time that we all will fellowship together in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen the lord bless you you can you can have your seed amen praise the lord i mean there is there is no there is no ministry uh uh or no pastor that will now want the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost upon his church you know because it makes things easy you know just like the bible says when solomon dedicated the temple the glory of the lord came down and even the preacher never had a place to preach the musicians never had a place to even play because the glory of god was just going through the building it was just so acceptable to the people everybody knew that god was in their midst you know and if god bring us to that place you know uh everybody will know that god is in our midst praise the lord amen you know and and just like every one of us god will keep us in a in a setting place for a purpose when that purpose is achieved then he takes us away or moves us to another place and i believe that that is the same for this local assembly i give you a testimony here brother andrews from shiva we we had him here before one of those alaskan village you know there in that part of uh the country and and the at church there has been going i think over maybe close to some 30 years now or or maybe a little more but what happened is that over the years you have to know that those people they live as a family because it's a tribe that is on the village and and and they respect their culture they respect their custom and all of that so when brother don't believe that went to be with the lord and brother willie and those different brothers started going to the island to carry the message and the entire village was a catholic village and now uh when it when they took the message there the the people of the village frowned at it because they just thought that they were bringing in you know uh a new religion or a new teaching that was going to divide their people sometimes that's the reason why people fight against truth or people fight against setting belief because the things that it would bring division you know it would divide the people it will it would break some of their culture they would break some of their rules and out of that praise the lord you know so uh uh uh uh what am i thinking on if you're feeling tired and you want to sleep stand back there and just relax yourself and come back in church that is the righteous things to do so uh uh so after after a couple of years you know brother andrews and few other brothers believe and they were just a small group of people i mean the whole village was against them you know the whole village was was against them and i mean the last time i was there then but andrew's older sister i mean she she had given her heart to the lord and and i mean she was she was just she was just weeping for the fact that she was one of the the other on the council and she knew how much they fought against the word of god being on that village but i'm saying in a sense that a small church a a group of people god can plant a seed you know i was just i was just studying yesterday and and uh and uh spoke on that before but it came back to mean again you know uh uh that that all of the trees you see around you the life the thing that transform is in the seed the power of life is in the seed and i believe this is the seed the spoken word is the original seed praise the lord the written word came after but in the beginning god said let there be and there was so the spoken word is the original see which means you have to take the promises from here and speak it as long as it's laid in this book you are just carrying sea in the bed but when you take the promises from here and you speak it then you are putting the seed from the bag into the earth and if it is the original seed of god no matter what comes or go there is so much potential in that sea to make a forest praise the lord amen so we uh we we're praying and hope that the lord will be able to to help us praise the lord amen so this morning we want to look at this subject before us here uh reading on revelation chapter 21 and uh uh such a fair if you if you want to put my code up there if you have together with you let's just read uh uh right there on revelation chapter 21 and uh uh satan's eating a little bit as we as we introduce what we want to speak about you know on uh uh wednesday night i was i was preaching on normal wall and and there were few few things that came to my mind sorry i never even sent it to share it with you this morning but i think i can do that quickly uh i made a mention about uh america in a type of jerusalem let's go to first chronicles chapter seven let's go to first chronicle chapter seven let's let's just back up this morning and and uh there there are some principles that i want for us to see first chronicle chapter seven are we together when you go over to first chronicles chapter 7 what actually yield is is uh uh it begins with now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house and the priest could not enter into the house of the lord because of the glory of the lord so uh first chronicle chapter seven uh starts with that first chronicle chapter seven starts with that and uh sorry i'm trying to struggle here and help myself i realized that i left something something out since the afraid i've just throw something back there uh sorry that i know i do that all the time now so solomon has just dedicated the temple and this is where god gave solomon the promise and he said if my people that are called by my name amen but let's drop down to the verse here that i want for us to get to get to god give this promise to solomon that if the people that are called by my name if they will humble themselves he promised them i will open my eyes onto this place let's read from verse 15 now my eyes shall be opened and my ears are in attendance to the prayers that i made in this place for now i i have chosen incentivized this house for my name may be there forever in my eyes and my heart shall be dead perpetually and as for thee if thou will walk before me as david your father work and do a calling to all that i commanded thee and observe my statures and my judgment listening to this i will establish that throne establish the throne of the kingdom i call him as i have i have coveted that with david the father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel but if but if ye turn away and forsake my statute and mine commandment which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them listening to this then i will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it a proverb and a bad word among the nations and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to everyone that passed by so that he shall say why why have the lord done this unto this land and unto this house now i was saying wednesday night that was the same way that god dared with this country america and the foreign fathers came they came with the biblical principle you know paying taxes is on the bible principle of paying your tithes and they establish all of those things you know for them to be able to get the blessings of god upon this lane but just like this because this promise year god also gave it to moses in deuteronomy chapter 18 28 and uh and and so the picture here is there the we are having all of this violence and write and and and and and throwing down of statues whatever that they are doing and it's it is a mindset that people think that they are looking for equality but let me tell you the uh the way that god established equality in the beginning was to make man in his image and in his likeness that was the way he established equality he made male and female in his image and in his likeness praise the lord now so all of those things but what i'm trying to bring to your mind here is that uh the nation has drifted away from the lord praise the lord and some of the reason is because the church that's supposed to stand as an ambassador for jesus christ has rejected their day they rejected their visitation they rejected the the revival that god has brought to this nation jesus said the gospel will travel like the lightning from from the east to the west after catholicism dominated over the church god break out a man luda he started right there in germany god started a revival trying to grab the people's attention back to the he says there is nothing about purgatory and paying money for the dead it is not written in the scripture he wrote his thesis with a little he knew from the bible and and put on the church and and god moved with that revival and john wesley dead in england and and god moved with that revival and then azusa street uh uh uh uh the pentecostal revival out of all of those revival there were many other revivals that came john smith uh uh uh the kibberlin revival and and and and different groups broke out of that but those were the major men that started the move of god praise the lord and what what was happening is that god was cycling the the the the promise that jesus made so with the gospel travel he was cycling the word and right on the west coast that's where the pentecostal experience came with those azusa or azusa street uh believers are we together and at that time god had i mean there were men that that uh i mean that were they were running a crowd across the nations going overseas and going word carrying the gospel printing bibles and i mean i mean they will just revive with every word praise the lord but when it came to the time where god raised up a ministry that was going to gather all the loose ends and bring the people grab the people attention bring them back over to to to the promise of the hour the promise of the day that we are living in recognizing your dead and this message most of them enjoy the the discernment they enjoyed the miracle but they wanted to have nothing to do with the teachings praise the lord they wanted to have nothing to do with the teachings of malachi 4. but this is what happened this is where i want to grab grab your attention to and because than the nation because the people rejected their blessing now you have to realize god is saying this word to to to solomon david has gathered this place david has made this place the capital solomon built the temple here the presence of god come then god said i've turned my eyes to this place i have sanctified this place i've displayed my glory before you but i'm still telling you that if you leave my word this very glory that you are seeing will become a shame just like how it was for israel just like how it is for america as a nation so it is for the believer so it is for you as an individual the thing that has kept you the thing that is keeping you in what you are doing and blessing you is the promise of god's word and just like how god did to israel and to the temple and to the house the same thing to the believer if you turn away from god's word the proud you have in serving god will turn to a shame and that's why we have people that were that were proud of their faith people that were proud of what the grace of god they are embarrassed of the same thing they were once proud of that's what i'm trying to bring bring to you now let me read this to you i mentioned this uh sister phil if you can put what i just sent up there i mentioned this on on wednesday night and it's is this thing where you know brother brandon was talking about uh uh packing a gun i i said on wednesday night you know uh all of these things that is going on but yeah he quoted that in california from billy graham you know he says look what darkness we are living in today look what is going on look at the murder the rape the strife why it come to pass i believe it was billy graham said in his last meeting in 10 years from now every citizen of california we have to pack a gun to protect themselves you can't you can't put enough lord enforcement the people has just got gone insane shooting murder rape everything it's just gone wide see upon the streets it's a day that we are living in is a sodom soda my day praise the lord amen and then in word for the part he picks that up again the same thing now what the the reason why i'm showing you this is for us to be able to understand the condition of our time what what what is creating all of these violins out there that they want to put under the statues of civil right but no it's a spirit of the age that is destroying the people and uh uh and just like i said uh wednesday night it is preparing them for the tear award it's preparing them for the great battle of america that's what brother branham said he says all of this rock and roll music that is filled with violence will prepare the minds and the heart of the of of the generation are we together now so you see this age the age is supplied with what would prepare the people for violence that is the same way you and myself god has given us what will prepare us for the new jerusalem that's what we want to come to because the spirit of this age is preparing the people of this age for their doom while the spirit of god will be preparing god's people for their kingdom praise the lord that is the reason why we have to pay attention to the attraction on our mountain we have to pay attention to the things that god is doing around our life to the things that the way he's dealing with us we have to pay attention to it because the very same house the very same house where the glory of god came down the from heaven the people could see the shaking of glory they witnessed it with their eyes that very same house people that didn't know the lord of god babylonians walked right into the house kim knew nebuchadnezzar and his men they talked the holy vessels of god the thing that keep you and myself is the word praise the lord amen is the word i was listening to brother brown last night he says he says uh uh it is now you receiving the holy ghost he said is the holy ghost that receive you he said it is just like when god accepted ebay of sacrifice is the word that has the keeping power praise the lord and uh and and and and israel and and and solomon were blessed with all of his wisdom and and and he he seek to know this he seek to want to know this and seek to want to go to this place and understand this thing and then he just got himself so makes up until his men and women took his heart away from the lord we have to use the word of god to guide our hearts praise the lord amen now so he says he used the same thing here over in the world falling apart he says and so will this age meet exactly to the sign and the wonder and the things that god promised to do in the last days the church itself will be ready and will go in the rapture with jesus because we we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken it cannot be moved heaven and earth will pass away but the kingdom shall not pass away amen i'm glad to be tonight he says in thy kingdom aren't you happy just think what could could you promise yourself today in another 10 or 15 years if this world shall stand if it does stand there every man in chevape every woman will have to pack a gun on the street now you have to know it is not the sense of people going to hunt it is not the sense of i mean there are people that grow in the west they are used to their raffle that is not the sense that brother branham is talking about what he's talking about here is gun violence because of the evil that will be so much in the land that's what he's talking about praise the lord and the same people that are parking the gowns are the same people that are killing himself the protection is not in the gum people the protection is in god's presence it's in god's word he says this back in in 1963 he says 15 years from now how many years has we've gone and if we will go more years what is it going to be young people that's the reason why the holy ghost is important parents that's the reason why the holy ghost is important are we together oh man and he talks about all of this he talks about a whole lot he talks about uh how you're going to stop it he says i was in new york the other day and went down through there for months was nothing but just teenage holloms with earrings in their ears rocking hairs and all of that girls the way they were dressed and you know and just all on the street what what what actually is happening what is he describing what is she is he describing you think about isaiah the prophet you know talking about jerusalem and then in isaiah chapter five he said there will be houses upon houses and roads that rolls over rolls and all of that you know i mean the prophet he's speaking on the inspiration of the holy spirit but also his that inspiration is just like a vision what is he looking at the horror the thing the spirit that is that is upon the age that is upon the young people drawing them into weight praise the lord as another young boy gets over to to uh uh three four years old the thing that died inside them is to pierce their ear because it's a spirit it's a spirit you find that the the the young girls on i mean they're not even 12 years old yet and all in schools and they're talking about you know our boyfriend this boy have a crush on me and all of that it's a spirit it's a spirit are we together praise the lord okay let's go over to satan's eating there are some few things that brother branham says here let me let's just go over it so i won't keep you uh i noticed it's very warm in here i'll keep you since we have to come back this evening now he's talking in revelation chapter 21. satan's eating over in revelation chapter 21 he said and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem discerning from heaven out discerning from god out of heaven there was no sea the first heaven and the first earth was passed away what is the first heaven it was the millennium was the first earth was this it it will be renovated just like it was baptized by walter in the days of the of of uh baptized by noah in the days of his preaching was sanctified by christ as he sprinkled his blood upon it amen to be renovated take all the gems and and and and everything off of it it will be renovated at the end with a baptist with a fire baptism that will kill every gem every sickness every disease every field that was ever on the earth now this is where my mind was when i was talking wednesday night on we were steady walls normal studying walls is not just america against russia or america is in germany we having uh out of this sickness they are walls amen i mean we we we we talked about gem warfare so when isaiah gave that promise in isaiah chapter 2 speaking about the law house upon the mountain and where the lion will be by the linemen all of that and he says we will sell the walls no more you know where they would turn their sword into plotting hawks and all of that it is at a place where it is true that now physically we are going to elaine that will be the millennium we are going to a promise we are going to a place where the scripture said satan will be bound for a thousand years amen there will be no sickness there will be no suffering there will be all of these things because satan will be bound because he will be bound so there will be no sin i mean there will not come an evil thought crossing your mind because satan will be bound but you think about this think about this in this promise of revelation chapter 21 god designed it in a way that he says that that city coming out of heaven praise the lord is going to be like a bride prepared for a bridegroom now he's comparing the city with a people because what is the use of a city if there is nobody to live there are you seeing where i'm going what is the use of a city if there is nobody who lived it amen so here john now looking at this new jerusalem looking at this city coming out of heaven he sees this city having such an appearance like a woman like a bride and jesus in matthew chapter 5 tells us right here you are the sword of the earth you are a light you are a city that is on the hill so you see that is the reason why in future home brother branham says the same process that god is taking the f through to prepare it for the new jerusalem that is the same process he's taking the people that will go to that city are we together let's look in the book of peter glory be to god amen i saw this said in the uh this is the last time praise the lord that that is in second peter chapter 3 second peter chapter 3 try to place this in scripture ii peter chapter 3. to save time let's drop to verse 5 for this the willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of all and the earth standed out of the waters the water and in the water whereby the word that then was being overflowed with water perich but the heavens and the earth which are noun by the same word i kept install reserved onto fire against the day of judgment and predation of the ongoing now so we are dealing with the same thing here uh uh uh peter yeah now is testifying to us he's pointing us back to some of the the the the the process that god has have taken the word through is first experience his first attraction was when when uh uh noah preacher messaged 120 years and the people didn't listen god visited the world with with a baptism he brought a judgment praise the lord and he learned that noah bought on top of the mountain proving that only the word of god will stand praise the lord and then peter also making us to experience here that the entire universe at that time went through that judgment because the word of god said it and the word of god stood and the same word that said he was going to destroy the world with water he's the same one that is saying he's going to destroy the world with fire praise the lord amen so if you look in here and you read this carefully you will see how peter brings out all like brother branham who says all the birth pains that the world has gone through and he make us to to understand that the same way that god is preparing this word he says heaven and earth will pass away he says it's just going to be a a renovation god is going to renovate the entire world and then that that city will come out and sit right down here on on the same earth where we are and god's people will inherit it but before we get to that setting it is the very same thing that he's doing with our lives he's preparing us for a prepared city praise the lord revelation chapter 8 revelation chapter 8 holds and understanding for us after the seventh seal was open and uh there was silence in heaven but let's drop down to verse 12. was no more relation chapter 8 verse 12 and the fourth angel sounded and the tear parts of the sun was smarting in the tear terror parts of the moon and the pteropaths of the stars so as the third part of them was docking and and they're shown that for uh a third part of it and the night likewise and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heavens saying with a loud voice world war war we know that word world over from the old testament is it's a kind of a curse word but brother branham says this was it was all of this angel sounding the three war walls were announced all of those walls was the first world the second world war and the third world war praise the lord the first world war 1914 the second one 1939 and and the one that this word is breathing in itself with all of the things that is happening are we together so you see just like there was a water baptism in noah's day there was a sanctification with a blood that was sheared and there will be a fire that will renovate the earth praise the lord and that's the same way that he's dealing with his people because he's preparing us for a prepared city he said i'll go and prepare the place for you praise the lord robert barnum says he says malta does not in inherit uh uh uh uh uh uh immortality he says so really it is not a house of breaks the first heaven will pass away and the first heaven falls under the space of time of the millennium because you have to remember is that one day is the completion the fulfillment of that one day that adam broke out of because until sin came he was still honored that one day amen and that's what will happen a thousand year reign god will give give his people just like i said wednesday night you know he gave noah a full taste of what adam had he had noah in the boat the door closed there was lion there was cheetah there was all of those animals but with the presence of the of the lord sin was kept out of the eye amen and the lion kool-aid by the lamb he gave him a full taste 40 days on on that seed with the outdoor clothes the lion never raised up his voice he's going to give us that experience amen being born into a word like like job said few days and fall of trouble few days and full of trouble is that a time that we have not seen trouble even if we have not seen it we heard it on the news amen few days just a few days we have to be here whether we ever go we're going to reach 70 years old or 80 years old but it is just a few days and it has been trouble from the day we got here from the day we got here it was trouble that's the reason why the baby comes right from the room and start crying because it's trouble that child is identified with trouble yeah praise the lord if the child have to come by see session the mother is in trouble it have just been trouble from one trouble to another trouble praise the lord and when we even thought that we gave our life to the lord jesus christ everything is going to be up hell break loose and the devil just turned every gun from hell on you it had just been one trouble to another trouble but god going to give you such a rest when the millennium day breaks you will remember your sorrow no more i don't care how we try maybe it's not natural not to listen to the news not to read the news feed on your on your on your phone you just try to just stay away from all the negative things somebody is going to drive by on the street and cut before you or they're going to come down the street with this loud music just full of insults it's just one trouble after another a few days that is full of trouble until jesus says for the elect's sake the days will be shutting because it looked like the trouble going to be multiplied upon the earth not a day gone by that somebody is not shot we've gone not a day gone by that an ambulance don't run down the street all the police are not called to the rescue a few days full of trouble oh that's the reason why we hold we hold this millennium promise as a treasure in our heart when the millennial dies breaks all our trouble will be remembered no more all our trouble will be remembered normal the lord but you see just like i said god is now waiting for us to get there before we experience it he has given us a down payment he has given us an earnest that while we are in this life oh we can draw to the word of god and feed the peace of god we can get there on our knees lift our hands sing songs and just feel that this is like heaven to me praise the lord this is like heaven to me i mean you get in that presence you just feel a warm atmosphere sweetness around you and then you remember i have to go to work praise the lord oh my goodness i have to go to work oh i'm getting late praise the lord then you jump out of heaven you come back to earth get back into trouble get back into struggle praise the lord you're trying to keep that feeling with you the joy of the lord is my strength i mean you're just keeping yourself so high and somebody wow what is that praise the lord and i mean the devil is just whispering all his angels get down the street that one is coming we have to distract that person and things are just flying all over before you get real you realize you just lost that sweet feeling that you had and for no reason you angry and you just get awful then the evening come you feel so sorry for yourself oh god man this morning i really had a revival praise the lord this holy ghost is real amen this holy ghost is real it's not your logic it's not your logic just like we were born into this world there is a new birth that can put you in the kingdom and seal you forever praise the lord let me continue to read this i will find a place to close here amen satan's eating we have to come back this evening for the prayer meeting paragraph 86 there there god will be with his with with his truth attributes sons and daughters there will never be no more sin there seen from there on let us strive hard don't be deceived this day but strive to enter in at the gate not that i get this kid you got to strive to enter in this gate strive to enter in to his promise this promise is unto you and to your children and to the many that our lord god shall call you remember jacob on his mountain when the angels came down extending and descending and all of the things that were happening he said this is the gate of heaven he says oh this is the git of heaven strive to enter in praise the lord there god will be with his truth attributes sons and daughters where he can fellowship with them in holiness with their eyes blinded to any sin there will never be no more sin in their on let us strive don't be deceived this day strive to enter another gate for all that be left out will be warmongers luster whosoever lost after the woman look upon a woman to lust after have committed adultery already in in uh in his heart outside will be inferior woman in elfin man and sulfur and all those that are redeemed and in the long book of life we enter in other good souls try friends don't be deceived in this last day praise the lord you know the deception that is in this last day is to take what what is happening as the not the normal life amen to to take it as well if they are doing it it's okay if other young girls are doing it it's fine if young men are doing it it's okay if the spirit is a lie of the of the last day spirit the actions of the society is being used to define what is truth when a group of people just run down the street they just gather right out there and and put their voice together and say this is not true the society honored that that because they have come to rebel so what they are saying is truth against god's word that is the thing that is appealing to the hearts of the young people because they see it on social media they see it on the internet so it looks like that is the way of life it's a spirit of the last dead age brother bryan says don't be deceived by that he says then in this new heaven let's look at it for a few minutes in this new heaven the sky will never be black again no that's from the curse he says the blackness of the sky is from the curse the sky will not be black again praise the lord never be black again with angry clouds wings will never blow across her again like that no she would never tear up a street will not have hurricanes this of trouble you know how many people have gone through that after those hurricanes come with their houses they come back and build and then after a couple of years it comes back again from one trouble to another trouble praise the lord she will never tear up treat or tear up houses and turn over things lightning and the wrath will never out of those things lightning comes striking we have one came through our place at the tree at the back of the house they split it into half but i'm so all of those things are from the curse all of those things are from the curse all are signs of judgment on the word that is fading away that is the reason why he says plan your future go to school thinking about raising the family but you lay for christ as if he's coming tomorrow as if he's coming this evening praise the lord lightning was struck across and kill the man walking down the road and and burn up building see no more there will be no more typhoon sweep down and storm and tornados and tear up houses and kill little children and things won't be normal trying to destroy it won't be there satan is cast out praise the lord you will not even have to judge between your thoughts you will not have to judge between your tops water is from god or whatever is from there from the devil there will be no mind battles praise the lord there will be no ill feelings there will be no hatred no bitterness try to get angry you won't because there will be no anger praise the lord amen let me ask a question why if we were taking the trip to an island whether in south america where we want to go or maybe jerusalem we get on we get an offer to go over to jerusalem an airline gave good shepherd an offer for us to go over to jerusalem they gave us a very good deal they're going to launch us into hotels they fly us over they're going to feed us you know how much they told me just 500 dollars that's what he told me five hundred dollars five for faith five for grace praise the lord amen if we had that offer i believe there is not one of you here this morning we want to miss that you're going to pick up hours you're going to work you're going to go into your saving but i'm talking about a land without money with our price i'm talking about a land without money without price and yet we make excuses people will fight to be the first one on the list they will want to make sure that they pay for all their family whether they will have to use their credit card or whatever when i come back i work and pay the money but i'm talking about a travel without money with our price the fed is already paid when he died on the cross and he said it's finished he paid the price praise the lord let the musicians come forward we have the opportunity to bring our dear beloved brother billy paul year for the testimony service and it is announced for us who have brother billy paul as son of brother branham the man that had the privilege to see the angel of the lord when brother branham woke up in the morning and said billy don't be afraid he will not hurt you he's right in that corner he had the opportunity to see eyes created in the socket when the blind gear was brought to brother branham he said honey i forget to ask you what color of eyes you want she said i always love blue eyes if we have that opportunity you will want to be the first one to the church door you will come running in to sit to the front seat because you want to hear for yourself you don't want to watch nothing on on on youtube and yet we make excuses we invite jesus here every sunday we invite jesus here every wednesday yet we make excuses what is the attraction on your mountain with all of the things that the lord is taking us through what is it creating in your heart what is the level of your desire for god can he come by by your house and say let's go for walk like enoch are you sure you can be to the place to have no regret to look back like lot wife are you sure that you have no excuse to give to him there is come in the day let's just bow with his all this peace forevermore on the high the golden shore water day glorious day that
