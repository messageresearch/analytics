for our brother it was it was surely the hand of the Lord because uh uh it was good that uh he choose to go and do the surgery because uh uh uh the doctor found that uh the the cancer was outs outside

our Bibles Malachi chapter 3 Malachi chapter 3 praise the Lord Malachi chapter 3 thank you for coming out uh this uh Wednesday evening for this little time of prayer meeting we do the best we can to let you out here at 9:00 just want to take a tou here uh continuing with what we we uh started on uh Sunday but I want to continue to set uh a foundation year you know sometimes you have you have a talk and it's not actually for you to preach it's for you for you yourself but preachers we always want to preach so whether it's for us or for the people we still preach it anyhow praise the Lord Malachi chapter 3 verse1 let's read that together if the the nation can put it up for us behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come said the Lord of host father ask blessing to this word tonight in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat now you can realize why when Jesus appeared to Paul on the road of Damascus and he said Paul Paul why or sa sa why persecute thou me he said woman thou because if you read right here in Malachi 3:1 the Lord whom you suddenly seek shall come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant so that messenger of the Covenant was the angel of the Lord that led the people L the children of Israel so so when Paul I mean uh being Saul said Lord who are thou and uh and and to his astonishment when when he heard I'm Jesus whom that persecuting it just it just blew him it threw him off of his hearse because uh uh he knew that that pillow of fire uh uh uh uh you know was the injured of the Covenant now so I want us to look at that verse closely once again and and uh behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way now uh uh uh uh Sunday we were looking at where Jesus uh uh St John chapter 14:6 he says I am the way the truth and the life praise the Lord now so what what we're trying to to bring out of this is that uh there is a path there is a path it's a supernatural path now if you if you if you listening to the message brother Brandon brother Brandon talk about this I wanted to draw it out and uh maybe we will do that as we we we go he he talks about uh uh I think in the message preparation how internet it's a cycle and he said time is a loop in the cycle praise the Lord am amen now so uh uh what we want to look at tonight uh Jesus said he is the way and yeah the promise there is a promise here of this messenger I will send uh uh uh the Lord saying behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way now this is a prophecy that referred to John the Baptist ministry he was that Messenger to prepare the way of the Lord are we together he was the messenger to prepare the way of the Lord now let's look at this uh also when Isaiah speaking about the same promise Isaiah chapter 40 uh uh verse 3-5 let's look at that and see here also we see prepare the way so John was to prepare the way and when Jesus came he says I am the way praise the Lord are you seeing the picture John was to prepare the way and when Jesus came he says I am the way now so uh let's let's read Isaiah chapter 140 uh reading verse uh uh 3-5 also talking about John the Baptist ministry Isaiah chapter 40 you have Chapter 30 up it's chapter 14 the voice of him that cry in the wilderness prepared ye the way of the Lord amen amen so we see another prepare so John the Baptist ministry was to prepared but watch this now prepare the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God Amen every Valley shall be exalted and every mountains and Hills shall be made Lord and the croak shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord Lord has spoken it praise the Lord so John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the Lord now you can see why the the the entire sahed Council both Sadducees and Pharisees they all miss it because when you make when you make the the promises of God uh so lateral lateral in a sense that uh you don't you don't you don't look at the the the spiritual aspect of it the the the supernatural aspect of Faith because this messenger that is promised to come here the scripture says he was going to make every Valley to be exalted and and and every mountain and Hills uh shall be made Lord and we never saw uh uh John the Baptist going around with a bosm right praise the lord we never saw him going around with with a bulldozer but there is another promise in Malachi 4 that says he will turn the heart so exalting the Low Places and bringing the mountain down they were all things that were going to be done in the human God was going to be dealing with us taking us from our high thoughts our proud nature taking us from our places of of complex praise the Lord amen that's the reason why you see John when he came even those people that thought they could not be touched I mean he spoke to herrow he blasted herodes he blasted the the the Roman soldiers he said you are exploting the people he was dealing with the the the the heart condition praise the Lord so he was to prepare the way of the Lord but it was not a physical path he was not making a highway in Jerusalem for the Messiah to come on but he was preparing the way because the promise here is that the Lord that you suddenly seek will come in his Temple while the Pharisees were waiting for him to come in the temple that Herod buil for them right God was going to come in a temple of a body praise the Lord are you are you getting the picture amen so so you see here that uh and I and I went back and I I look at this word I said a little bit about it on Sunday I look at that word way as I was looking there in the in the concordant study I look at the word way it has uh that that Greek meaning if if uh if I would take people can put that put that up there that Hebrew word and uh if if that's the right pronunciation Derek where Road distance joury manner way it could speak about a road it could be a way it could be a path it could be a journey it could be uh uh directions but pay attention to this one it could also means a manner of life a habit and I think I believe this is what John was coming to prepare amen if his ministry was to turn the hearts of the children back to the father if his ministry was to deal with the heart of the people from Judaism and bring them to what God was doing then his message was going to introduce a manner of Life yes right are we together his message was going to introduce a manner of life he wants to prepare the way now remember remember we says the cherubin was to guide the way to the Tree of Life the pillow of fire led the people in the way it led him even even beyond all their complaining and everything that that was God's mercy yes the people that were complaining against the leadership of God but yet he was still keeping them in his way how much we see around us is by the mercy of God we are not consumed how can we say we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we have the Revival for the hour and some of our thoughts are so nasty and and and and and and and even some of our thoughts we we we we limit ourself we think that you know what the weight of Holiness you you you got to be wretched you got to you got to suffer and and just just the mindset so you see the the the work of the Holy Spirit The Turning of our hearts to the hearts of the Father the work that God is is is is is is working in US is to put us on this path give us this uh manner of life that brother brandham called a bride material not just a church member but a br material a people that know that there is a Rapture a people that are expecting a Rapture any moment and people that are living daily for a Rapture it's a manner of life it's not something you can just conform to it's a path that God have to draw you in something affect your life you get on a path amen glory amen praise the Lord are we together see these people walking on a path to a promised land they are going to their promise the pillow of fire is leading them by Night the pillow of cloud by day praise the Lord even though they eating the man and and all the blessings that God is showing them but because their heart were not converted their heart were not converted to believe Moses as the leader they kept creating problem a journey That was supposed to take them couple of Base they had to go for 40 39 years they just going in cycle so you see their their nature their attitude took them off of God's way they were walking in their own way because of their own desire they wanted to go back to Egypt are there no garlic in Egypt that you brought us in the wilderness they see the pillow of Fire by night they can see the light they can see the glory of God but their heart was still in Egypt a journey That was supposed to take the couple of days they had to be going in cycle why because they were not in God's path they were in their own path by their own desires praise the Lord so you see SS of God this message is it's not just it's not to make uh it's not to make a church even no praise the Lord amen it's not to make a church this is the voice of God to call us in the path of God it's a manner of life amen it's a manner of life you don't need a badge to go to England and tell everybody that you are a message believer they was your life yes siren that's why these early Christian they were called they they call this thing the way that is called heresy that is the way I worship the god of my father that way that manner of life that people speak against that's what I'm identify with right amen are we together amen praise the Lord the Lord you suddenly seek I will send my messenger he will prepare the way the Lord you suddenly seek will come in his Temple you see because because they were not in the way of God they were not in his path they they couldn't grab join message they say oh if the zah come he will come to the temple he will come to meet caii the high priest because Malachi said the Lord will seek he will suddenly come to his Temple you're thinking about a physical Temple why John message was to prepare a temple amen amen amen praise the Lord that's the reason why when Jesus came there at Jordan and he baptized and Jesus when walking out of the water he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away he was identifying the temple he was identifying the one that the Lord that you seek suddenly has come endure in but everybody was just telling whoa that c son that guy fed a bench for me praise the Lord last time I both had a problem I went to his to his uh Father Joseph Shar are we together am are you seeing the picture so this way who means a manner of Life a habit it could mean a course of life it could mean moral and character amen and I think that's what it is here that's what I'm beginning to see let's let's just R few things here uh uh before we close tonight I I say I will let us go home at 9:00 amen praise the Lord Brother brand said this in perfect strength in perfect weakness let's read it together notice that it takes the the weakest and rejected and practically every hero God ever had in the front line was that type of person that's why brother BR says Mo Samson was not a muscle man right yes he was just a a little weakling boy with seven love BL hanging on his head praise the Lord David was just a Shepherd boy no military skills sh guy took a bone praise the Lord think about it that's that's the mystery of God that's God's mystery that he took weak things and he put Heavenly treasure in it amen he took weak things amen praise the Lord and they always tell you that if you want to hide thing the best way to hide face yes sir highly in the more common place right because it's so common they will not look there praise the Lord the best way to hide things put it in the more common place are we together the weakest and rejected practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient praise the Lord you see that's the reason why for God to bring an elect of every age he had to use full generation he drew you through the strains of four generation and that four generation your father grandfather great grandfather all of those things create the complexes that we deal with that's what made your spirit your spirit man is drawn through that are we together why because God was going to hide himself in there that if he did not show you you will not even find him in you that's right if God don't reveal it to you you will never believe you have the Holy Ghost that's right if he don't reveal it to you you will never believe that you are a child of God because there is just so much in our mind that happen in our body daily that is enough to condemn [Music] you are we together every person that God every person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person just in a good shape so God can start using him right praise the Lord amen but you see our mind struggle with that because our mind tells us we must be our best are we together praise the Lord so when whenever we are not our best the enemy comes right in there he condemn you praise the Lord amen say you're not even wanted to go in the presence of God you are just a storing black you are a hypocrite my and then we are we I mean we are overtaken by that oh my God I'm a hypocrite I'm a hindrance to the church oh my God may God help us amen a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person just in a good shape so God can start using him that's right is when they feel like they can they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them praise the Lord am God don't want your ability he want you to be available sir amen amen glory amen he don't want your ability but he want you to be available and say if you can use anything Lord you can use me praise the Lord is the mystery of our journey is the mystery of our life that's what we will deal with until we get a body change Lord that's what we will deal with until we get out of here praise the Lord amen oh does that mean that God don't want his children to be up and doing no he want us to be up in doing because he says we must replenish it means to be fruitful amen it means to be up and doing but if we are up and doing we are not relying on our ability we are not building h h h h just in our own mind we are trusting that God will be reflected in whatever we are doing by his grace amen are we together amen let's let's run through here love the Lord tonight amen when God can can can can can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can use us because we are wanting to do it ourselves praise the Lord that's the reason why there is a room at the cross for you whenever we made mistake go straight to the Cross praise the Lord and say Lord I need you amen the only reason why I made mistake because I tried to do it my own right amen I I put it back in your hands you take complete control and then start from right there and start running and then ourself we get these feelings and we think then that we are insufficient and we don't want to do it because we feel like we are insufficient we look at our abilities we feel like we are insufficient we are not qualified uh uh uh uh so we don't want to do it what what actually happening is that you will see right under this Cod that's where brother Brandon brought that statement of mastering human ability praise the Lord and the thought behind it there is that you have to know yourself you have to know yourself there is no there is no uh uh uh uh playing game about it you got you have to Know Yourself Praise the Lord because why the enemy he steing you yes he's telling us he know how our mind runs a common proof of it is your cell phone your cell phone pick up your search the things you search for constantly it picks it up so what what as soon as you go there you start to look for H H give me this song you don't even put the song name there and oh wow how did this the phone know I was I wanted to find this it already knew your thought party because it knows what you search for every day that's how our mind runs amen and the enemy know how our iRun so if he can just if he can just grab you in that little corner and says I'm nothing then he keep fooling yes you are nothing tell yourself you are nothing and yes s say I'm foolish say I will not make it I'm I'm worthless just just he just keep he will just pull down that channel it's just a channel it's just a channel praise the lord it's just a channel he open the floor Gates of every negative and nasty Spirit to run through your mind praise the Lord but right in the midst of that you can slam the door amen you can slam the door and says let the mind be in me that was in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus never T like this he says I am I I I'm a Child of God you can slam that door close praise the Lord sometimes it's hard to do sometimes it's hard to do why because we have been told that when you go through that you have to now confess your sin you go talk to the pastor you know you know you don't just like the Catholic church but in a more better way because we are not Catholic make sure that you go to church on Wednesday be on time and start praying because oh the thought that you thought was so bad my goodness that's not rapturing thought then you only waiting for Wednesday now to make it right when you could solve it right there again you can make the battle LLY right there and there you can pull back your swall praise the Lord and you don't have to wait for Wednesday night praise the Lord amen Lord if there is any time is right now amen amen you can take these things off of my mind right now you can cllean my spirit right now now so see what brother BR is saying here do all of this talking and don't breathe and then he says the other side so he's giving us the other picture now dealing with ourself the other side we get these feelings and we think then that we are insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of God praise the Lord your mind is telling you you can do it your your heart is Desiring to do it praise the Lord amen amen your mind is telling you you can do it your mind is telling you you don't have the Holy Ghost but your heart has a desire to be in the house of God praise the Lord are we together amen your mind says you are now worthy but your heart says Lord I need help Amen brother say listening to the call of God that's the way that's the very thing that God want us to get into now underline that into now because that's the way that's the channel oh I pray that the Lord will be able to help us there's a thought that yeah I pray that the Lord will help us let's let's just read yet a little bit before our time goes you said that that he says that's the very thing that God want us to get into that kind of a spear ship amen so we can when we are insufficient ourself then we are subject to yield to God what what is that healing to God what is that healing you hear you he bre B says I just I want to get out of the way what is that getting out of the way when we supposed to be in the way supposed to be walking in the way but I want to get out of the way so the Lord can can come in let the preacher get out of the way tonight that's the way we see it let the preacher just get out of the way let the Holy Spirit comes what is that language look there there is a channel whenever the Holy Spirit comes you know just like just like Jacob when he was sleeping that what we call Jacob ladder yes sir that ladder that ascended up to heaven where he saw angels were ascending and descending that's what happens when you are praying and you feel good the LA has just been let down to you praise the Lord am amen if you can just stay there a little bit you start getting lighter you find yourself start growing up amen amen amen amen and because you are a child when you get up you are scar every child that claims the L you start to be afraid but that's exactly Jesus told he told H H Nathaniel amen oh because I said I known you or I seen you before philli called you you believe it he said but from now you will see Heaven open so there's a path that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what the anointing is is a path Glory when that atmosphere is created for the believer we are lifted up in Heavenly places that path is open yes we can feel good we feel the joy of the Lord we just feel that I'm so close to Heaven thank you Lord praise the Lord the service oh you got to drive and go home there's one guy on that road he's speeding he's just going these people what I see this guy wa what are you doing praise the Lord you just came down from that ladder yes where you were feeling good close to heaven and you realize now you have to deal with Earthly things those people driving the Cars Are Not Angels even if they were one they are falling angels are we together are you are you getting the picture okay let me close with this now when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subject to yield to God's spirit as long as we think that we can do it if that self just get in the way you shut the door praise the Lord if I if I would say it in a kind of a strong way you greet the Holy Ghost if I would say it in a strong way when Paul say grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you are sealed that's that's that's a little little bit of an extreme I'm going tonight but I just want you to grab the picture are we together as long as we think we can do it then we can do it but when we get to a place where we know we can do it then we yeld ourself you just you just step step I will I I read I'll read something to you just now you will get the picture of it you he brother brand says I'm waiting for the angel to come praise the Lord amen what is he doing he's setting his will he setting his mind by gift by gift he was designed to do it it's not easy for you and myself if he was not born with that gift he will have the same struggle that you and myself are having right by gift he could do it suddenly he has a way in La Ministry he says he says there are just three words I I need to say many people have SE those three words they want they want that three words so they can be able to do they have not find it because it's not for you it's not for you you are designed your own your the way we are designed as Sons and Daughters of God is to master our ability know yourself amen know yourself when you see a little bit of that self coming you say Lord please help me I'm sorry I shouldn't have spoken like that I'm sorry I shouldn't have praise the Lord are we together let's let's just close this thing off tonight because you're making the atmosphere too sweet for me to preach an hour and I don't want to okay please don't tempt me tonight praise amen I have been several meetings from the clock praise the Lord but when we get to a place where we know we can do it then we yield ourself you know we yeld ourself now in in in the Pentecostal rain you know that yelding the said they say you got to you got to make your mind blank just make your mind blank right no think on the promise yes sir this mind can never be blank this mind will always think on on something if you don't put something there to think on it the devil will give you something to think about so it's not it's not Yoga Yoga just keep your mind blank I'll tell you I will tell of a fact as a young as a young believer a young preacher I struggle with that I try to keep my mind blank Lord I don't want no you know I don't know whether you have gone through that but I've gone through it I I really I want to I wanted to get to that place of healing I want to heal myself yield myself to the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost take complete control yield myself just put a promise on your mind and and and when you are thinking on that promise it will lead to another promise it will lead to another promise and the thought of promise to promise will start creating an atmosphere around amen but when we when we get to a place where we we can do it we hear ourself and he does it so then if so then if it's us trying to do it it trying to do it we will fail but if we just yield ourself to God then God can fail let's go to the path of Life five minutes and I close now listen to this now I'm closing my Bible but D always say I say I'm closing praise the lord we going to we're going to have a little bit of him this coming weekend haven't seen that seen that guy for a little while yet now path of life let's read this brother brandham says listen to this he says and brother and sister I was I was playing this message and I was just thinking on this entire subject I don't know I'm I'm I'm struggling to bring it to you the way it came to me and when brother Brandon started to say this I just I just bursted and started crying because it's it just I just said Lord that's exactly what I want that is what you want me to see I don't know if you would see it but let's read it together and brothers and sisters we can't afford to let people that we love people that we love and people who Christ died for get away from this life to die without eternal life let's do everything we can to get them into that place where that they can rise again in the resurrection thou will show me the path of life I don't want to come in because of time let's read the next one you Brethren are able to do it to your congregation I don't have that ability I have no ability listen to this now but a little gift that was given to me like to pull myself into a certain gear the ability that he had to pull himself into a certain gear the ability he had to to be attentive to pull himself into a certain gear listen that's where the people what they are thinking what they are doing and what should be done there a little way of my Ministry is just one of the little path that God let me use to bring his children over to that side that's why he could stand there before this person and tell them that that Grace of gift that was given him when he goes into that gear I seen you as a little child I see you in the hospital and the do said this to you what it does is that it takes that person entire spirit and he sit there and says that's truth if this man can tell me it takes them in a path of healing and he said we can do the same we don't have that prophetic gift but we can be salty yes sir we can be nice we don't have to be like Jehovah Witnesses H uh taking our Bibles and going around the street to tell people the kingdom is coming right just your manner of Life a life of consecration where somebody can say there is something about you yes it's an opportun opportunity to tell them that thing about you that is not me yes it's not me why are you always dressed like this a channel has been open praise the Lord Brother B said we cannot afford to to to allow the people that we love we have made the thing so much about religion people got to believe that brother Brandon is a prophet God sent us a prophet who gave you that commission who make it your ministry to go and tell that God sent a prophet we say oh even just like that little girl in Syria she said there was a prophet there was an opportunity that presented itself that's why the prophet of God will say when you meet the newspaper Man start talking about what is on the news and wait for the opportunity to present itself yes Glory talk to your friends about work just looking for that opportunity to present itself praise the Lord that opportunity will never present itself in Gossip forget about it it will never present itself in Gossip because God is not about destroying people we we can be a we can be a powerful witness but like I said on Sunday there's a price there's a price you can't be careless about it it comes with a life of consecration there's a price but you see we can pull people into that channel that's all this message is about that's the purpose of Jesus Christ to come and get Sons and Daughters back on the path of God again not to build churches not to build denomination where we just forcing and destroying one another is to set us on the path musicians you can come I want God's way to be my way though the road be Steep and rough where he leavs me is enough let's bow our heads and pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just want to thank you oh God for giving us this time
