ready to go into your word in Jesus name amen praise be to God God bless you musicians can we take our Bibles and just read the word before we take our seats whilst we are getting ready with our Bibles John 3 I have a reminder here brother Jason Watkins um is is preaching in Grace Ministry uh this coming Friday and a Good Shepherd has been invited so if you have the time and you can make it to Grace Ministry uh it would be nice to go and fellowship with the Brethren there praise the Lord the service day starts at 700 p.m. and uh brother one has asked me to extend his greetings to every one of you and um keep him in your prayers um praise be to God uh John 3 5 and 6 John 3 five and six Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word praise be to God shall we be seated God bless you all for coming tonight um it's been a tough week so far but the Lord is mindful of us and it's always a blessing to come before his throne of grace in spite of the work Lo in spite of the the demands in spite of the difficulties um the things we have to go through that we can still make it a point to come to the house of God when the doors are open praise be to God I know that are a few that would still go to work but even then they try to tune in um we thank God for what technology has done for us praise be to God and um very very very grateful to see every one of you and uh we are just here to encourage ourselves and tonight we are just going to talk praise the Lord yes um I just went into something I had down I didn't know where to start from I just picked something from the beginning went to the middle picked something went to the end and I picked something and put all that together I don't know how that is going to come together praise be to God the intention is not to finish uh of course uh what I have extracted I hope to can come to an end of I mean bring it to an end but um hopefully by the time we are done talking I believe you may have heard the voice of God in one way or the other praise be to God the days are getting to ahead time is running out when you are used to listening to news I don't listen to news per se but there is a place that I can trust their news so much that once in a while I go in and I listen to what is going on and I remember telling brother um Tim when he came around that scientists have discovered that the core of the Earth stopped spinning in the direction it was going and I liked the way the the news caster put it what the newscaster said was the Earth has a change of mind because it stopped spinning in the direction the the that is the core the the the the the core of the Earth stopped spinning in the direction it was spinning and now it is spinning in the opposite direction and science has no clue what is going on apart from coming to that realization that the core of the earth is no longer spinning in the direction it was going so I was just saying that even the Earth has to realize that there is no time for it and the Earth has changed its mind mind how about me and you that are walking on this Earth and that are looking forward to building um a castle on this earth when this Earth has already started folding ITS m time is running out so fast we have heard this time and again till we hear it and it doesn't mean anything to us time is running out oh I have heard it a thousand times Jesus Christ is coming very soon oh I have heard it a thousand times I was a year old when I started hearing this and I'm 40 I'm 50 I'm 60 I'm 70 and he hasn't come time is not on our side when you get up in the morning it's good to do an introspection examine your life on a daily basis Search Your Heart if there is anything to repent of repent of it don't wait till another time that another time may not come I have heard stories of people just being in the in the in in the in in traffic and there is a stop sign or traffic light red they stop and that is where it ends and I told you guys of a story if it wasn't for the grace of God I wouldn't have made it home that day when I stopped and my heart just I don't know you know the story praise be to God so if there is anything to repent of don't wait till tomorrow tomorrow may never come when you go before God remember sometimes we think we are before another man remember you are before God he is looking in the inside he sees you as you are as a man think in his heart so is he God sees you inside out there is nothing to hide before him so what have you got to hide when you go before God get clean everybody is dealing with one thing or the other the fact that you are dealing with something doesn't mean that you are not a child of God God wants you to be better he wants to make you a better person count yourself worthy count yourself blessed if God counts you worthy to put something in your life to deal with it God has also given you that strength to overcome it God wants us to see his glory it doesn't come on a silver platter the Bible says that Christ Ed obedience by the things he suffered and the Bible says that if any man comes after him he should take up his cross daily daily and follow him praise be to God it's good to take stock of our lives and you can see where you are going by the grace of God God when you compare yourself to the word tonight I have just taken a little subject as I said we are just going to talk and I have titled it dimensional influence I was listening to the message demonology and I got to a place and something came it's been a while that I I don't even remember anymore but I started writing and when I started actually I was looking at a threedimensional influence a threedimensional influence that man is a tring being you have a body Soul and Spirit living the three dimensions God works in three the devil Works in three and that was where I picked up from but for nice service I thought I should just um go a different way uh so um bear with me and pray for me praise the Lord so as we have just read verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God this was when Nicodemus asked the Lord Jesus can a man go back into his mother's womb and be born again the second time praise the Lord and he went on to say that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit so we have a physical world and we have a spirit world now do not confuse the spirit world with a spiritual Kingdom the kingdom of God is a spiritual Kingdom that aside we have a spirit world praise the Lord now God gave man five senses and I'm talking of mankind praise the Lord God gave everything every man every woman five senses and these five senses are given to us to contact this physical Dimension now you can see you can hear you can feel you can taste you can smell these are the five senses and these senses influence our lives greatly they are physical but they influence our lives greatly what you see influences your life so much that is what adverts are about when you are driving on the highway and you see a billboard maybe with some um nice meal sometimes you are not even hungry but as soon as you see that your eyes go on it and then it communicates you to your brain and then then you realize that you are hungry signs have noticed that and they are cashing in on it so the things you see influence your life so so much and also the things we hear that is why we ought to be careful what we give he to as much as we ought to be careful the things we see I remember at work once upon a time it was just the beginning of this year I went to a place to place an order and then when I was seated with that gentleman a lady walked in and I saw his eyes scanning around her and I was looking at him like this and when he turned to me I said what were you looking at and then he saids something I said that was wrong he said no I mean he's just I mean some funny funny stories and he tried to argue and I told him your motive the motive behind the looking is what makes it evil I say it is not just you looking I said the motive you have for looking I say it's what makes it evil and then he said no you are right you know sometimes it's amazing that you can even talk to unbelievers the way you do and they don't get so much offended that sometimes if you want to talk to a brother or a sister you have to fast and pray so they don't get angry who are you to talk to me that way so we ought to be careful the things we see the things we look at it is not everything you see that you should give H to you can pick up a spirit just like that and you would have to deal with it for the rest of your life if God does not help you so the see the things we see influence our life so so so much and we ought to be careful pray for God to anoint our eyes that we can see through the lens of God that when you look at something and you know that no this is not what a child of God should be fisting on take your eyes off it don't go looking at it again so oh the brother said maybe if you look at it the second time that is when there's a problem so since I have my eyes on it for the first time let me just stay there you are a dead man praise the Lord if it is not pleasing to God it should not be pleasing to you remember who you are that you are a child of God you are here to express praise be to God God before the people God is counting on you and me he knows he has a people here he is counting on you and me I have not gone any anywhere at all praise the Lord the things you hear has so much influence on you the music you listen to somebody can just listen to some music and then they get up out there and they get a gun and they start shooting people because the music says they should go out there and kill and you you see them behind their cars and then they are just relaxed and you hear Boom Boom Boom and they behind the steering wheel and you wonder what it is that they are listening to but they enjoy what they listening to so all these five senses the teste you have the feelings your feelings influence your behavior so when you look at these five senses they are not given to you to contact God these five senses are given to you to contact this Earth how be it sometimes we want to use that to contact God we serve God based on the things we see we serve God based on what we hear we serve God based on our feelings that is why sometimes you can just tell yourself oh I know I am a child of God because you just feel like it another time when you don't feel like it then you begin to wonder who you are your feelings should not dictate your relationship with God it should not dictate your work with God it is just a physical or a natural element that is giving you to contact this Earth praise the Lord as I said oh I I we praise the Lord okay now so we are talking about a dimensional influence and the three dimensions in which man lives so as the prophet of God told us or taught us there are seven dimensions and we live in the first three dimensions praise the Lord and even the first three dimensions as physical as they are they also come with their influence when you talk of time time comes with its own influence things you know today or probably okay I just started school today so I don't know much by the time I get my U my bachelor or my masters now I know a lot that now becomes an influence I'm just born I'm just crawling I have nothing I'm just a child I don't know what I'm doing I grow I have a mind of my own and that changes my life I mean we can go into that but that is not even where my attention is tonight there is a place I want to get to and that is my motivation tonight and that has to do with the fourth dimension praise the Lord so time has not been our friend it will never be our friend and it's not going to be our friend tonight so I am just going to do some little exercise here praise the Lord okay okay so now when you look at the Spirit man man has a soul he has a spirit and of course he has a body the spirit man is also given five senses and they are reasoning memory conscience affection and Imagination now the physical is given to contact the physical and the spiritual is also given to contact the spirit world note that the five senses of the spirit are not giv you to contact God they are not giving you to contact the kingdom of God they are giving you to contact the spirit world there is only one thing that is given you to conquer the kingdom of God and that is in your soul and that is Faith when it comes to the five senses of the spirit it Wills a lot of influence if I don't know if we can take them one by one if time would permit us we'll do it now when you take imagination you would ask yourself how can my spiritual sense of imagination how can I use it to contact the spirit world sometimes we wonder sometimes we ask questions now you can be seated here right now and not be here you can be seated here physically but then you can engage your sense of imagination and you are anywhere in the world but this place that you have such a wild imagination that it doesn't matter what what we say here you will walk out through these doors and would not remember anything sometimes you can sit down and then you begin to imagine things and it gets so so real till sometimes you can begin shedding tears you get so emotional and it's just your sense of imagination that is at work you have entered into the spirit world you just entered into the spirit world that somebody can just walk to you and come so close to your face and you don't even know they are there because you are absent in the body it is such a strong it it C so much influence on you you can take memory your sense of memory you can go down memory lane and then pick some trash in your laundry basket and then you relieve it can you imagine that before you met Christ or before you gave your life to Christ the life you lived or even when you started your journey what you went through nothing to be nothing to be proud about and sometimes you can just go down that memory lane and then you pick those things up and then you are living in it you just went right back into the spirit world you have just gone into the spirit and so does reasoning you can just sit down your mind will pick something and then another thing and then another thing then you keep going and you keep going and you don't even know how you got to where you got that is how powerful these senses are and sometimes again we want to use them to contact God sometimes we want to use these spiritual senses to contact God we want to just imagine God we want to imagine our Salvation we want to imagine just raisen raisen things out just try to fantasize with things in the spirit and want to use that to serve God a dimensional influence and all that I'm doing is to get to the fourth dimension praise the Lord that is where all my interest is tonight not not so much about any Dimension tonight my interest is actually so much on the fourth dimension in the message leadership 1965 1247 look here you are a outward person you have five senses that contacts that outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home see taste feel smell and hear then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets conscience love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contact is the physical your spiritual contact is the spiritual but inside of of that you've got a soul the soul is that Gene that comes from God praise the Lord now I just um talked a little about some of um the spiritual senses and um how you can just you know forget of yourself and W into the spirit without even realizing you did praise the Lord now inside of the Soul you have either Faith or doubt and the only way we know you can contact God Is by faith and Faith also has a lot of influence praise the Lord Faith would make you dress differently faith in God would make you speak a Heavenly language faith in God would make you see life completely differently faith in God would order your footsteps that even though you have the right to go anywhere you want to go but because of the faith you have in you based on the word of God There Are Places you would never carry yourself to Faith would make you see something and turn on the other side because something in you tells you that this is not right faith has so much influence that people would look at your life sometimes they'll make fun of you but that does not deter you because you know where you stand and what you have believed that is what faith does it doesn't matter what they do you are not going to conform to their norms faith has so much influence they will look at you and say you have lost it and yes you indeed have lost it because you have to lose your mind to get the mind of Christ because they look at your life and they can't just put that together with what everybody is doing that they think is all right faith in the word praise be to God would bring you to that place where this world and all its fantasies and what have you would not mean anything to you that is how much faith is the prophet of God said is the super sense not the five senses of the body not the five senses of the spirit but faith in your soul hanging on the word of God praise the Lord and God has given us Faith to contact him now the fourth dimension has a lot of influence on man now remember that influence can be positive and it can be negative so you can be influenced positively or negatively the fourth dimension is a very very busy Dimension there is a lot that is happening in this Dimension and it's happening so so fast praise the Lord this Dimension is a gateway either to heaven or a gateway to Hell we are getting into it praise be to God the fourth dimension is a gateway either to heaven or to hell but it is certain certainly a Gateway the Bible says broad is the way that leaded to destrction that way is not here in America it's not in Asia it's not in Africa it's not physical it's not in any of the first three dimensions it is spiritual that Dimension is in the fourth dimension straight is the gate that leaded to life it is not physical it is spiritual and that lies right in the fourth dimension as to whether or not that your life on Earth comes to an end and you go to The Fifth Dimension or you go to the sixth Dimension depends on what you do with your life in this fourth dimension remember we live in the first three dimensions we don't live in the fourth dimension but the fourth dimension has so much influence on us that it is not even possible to live our lives without it it has so much influence on us and that determines what we do while we are still alive and that determines where we go when this life comes to an end whether to the fifth or to the sixth Dimension the Fifth Dimension is for the lost souls the sixth Dimension is for the redeemed Souls Souls that are redeemed praise be to God so what is this we are talking about here tonight God operates in the fourth dimension God operat there and also the devil operates in the fourth dimension remember it is a spiritual Dimension God is a spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth the devil is also a spirit they don't live in this first three dimensions they are in the fourth dimension which is a spir spiritual Dimension which is just all around us it's a dimension it is not a physical location that we can say that oh this is the first Dimension up to this this is the second dimension this is the third and this is fourth that you know the geographical location of it no it's a dimension is all around us right here right here it's a dimension God is here right now in that Dimension the devil is here in church right here in that Dimension you can sit in church tonight and may walk out of the doors without receiving anything why because you didn't enter into that Dimension to receive it for you to benefit from it you must get into that Dimension to be able to tap into the blessings of God to receive it you must enter in but when you come and you are still in your physical element and you are still sitting down I mean um it doesn't matter what they say you may walk out of the door and you don't even know why you came the blessings are in the spirit for you to be able to tap in and get anything you must just go in there so God operates in the fourth dimension the devil also operates in the fourth dimension praise the Lord now God will take His prophets or his servants into this Dimension to give them Visions to give them prophecies and to give them dreams about things to happen or things that are going to be this is where God takes them to show them these things the Bible says that the angels of the Lord have encamped right about us they are around us when you take a step out there they are with you they are around you the reason you can't see them is because they are in that they in that Dimension your eyes this eyes here cannot see anything in that Dimension except God opens your eyes to see it you cannot see it that is why we don't believe that sin is believing the fact that I don't see it doesn't mean it is not there when Elisha's PR I mean when Elisha Elisha's servant came out one morning early morning and he saw that they were surrounded by the Syrian Army and he run ran in and he told the prophet oh there is trouble we've been surrounded by the Syrian Army they are here to take us elishah said they that are with us are more than they that are with him that didn't make any sense to him he didn't know what that was he didn't know what that meant and go Elisha prayed and asked God to open his eyes so he would see and when he went and looked again praise be to God he saw angels on chariots ready to go to war they were there in that Dimension so they are there they around you never think you alone the fact that you are not seeing them doesn't mean they are not there if God should open your eyes to see praise be to God but a lot of the times that doesn't happen but they are there in that Dimension all around you in this Dimension there are angels that we keep bumping into them here and there without even realizing it the Lord Jesus told his disciples that this words I speak they are spirit and they are life now listen 1963 0606 show us the father in that message the prayer of God said when Jesus Christ spoke these words they never die science claims in 20 years from now they can pick up the literal the the literal voice they can pick up the the the literal voice they will be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus is still in the earth CU see is ascending post you are then there has to be a receiving post and if you can be a receptacle see receiving post to receive the word of God so the words that the Lord Jesus spoke they are still here because they are Spirit a man comes and he does everything he has to do his time comes to an end he goes but the things he says are left behind they don't go away they don't die words don't die words are Spirit the words that the Lord Jesus spoke they are here in what dimension in the fourth dimension not in the first not in the second not in the 10 not in the fifth not in the sixth in the fourth dimension those words are here they are spirit and they are in that spiritual Realm I think we are doing good on time praise the Lord so the pr of go goes on to say it's it's real and then he says that Abraham picked that voice you are going to have a baby by Sarah your wife praise the Lord have you ever wondered I was thinking about it today that you in the house maybe doing some cleaning or maybe you are cooking or maybe you are meditating upon the word or maybe you are at work or maybe you are just behind your steering wheel and then all all of a sudden your mind picks something a word and an inspiration just comes over you and that sweet feeling that sweet feeling that anointing just comes and then you just you just begin to shed tears and sometimes you cry like a baby and you don't even know why you can just tell you just broke into that Realm you just broke into that realm it is not physical praise be to God something just happened to you you had an Angelic visitation God just paid you a visit praise the lord we bump into the spirit of God just every day of our life praise the Lord now this is where it gets more interesting that we are not only bumping into angels and into good spirits or the spirit of God but we are also bumping into demonic uh demons demons the Bible says in Ephesians 6:12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places these are the forces we are wrestling against we are not only bumping into angels and bumping into the spirit of God we are also bumping there was a time I think it was somewhere last year a colleague came to work and then he showed me something on his phone he said his phone vibrated he had um a a doorbell a doorbell camera and then his phone VI ated and then he looked outside there was nobody outside so he went back to bed when he woke up the following morning he said let me check my phone and see the phone vibrated probably there was a deer or something that came close and when he looked at it it was something else you know what it was just like the form of a human being that looked like smoke that was just pacing away from the camera in front of his door just pacing away and he just see my camera my dog camera just picked up a spirit and I started wondering how many times do we run into such atmosphere that you don't know what you are getting into that you you are just walking with your eyes on you don't see anything around you and then you are walking into things like this it's amazing what God delivers us from we don't know what God delivers us from this is not to put fear in you if those things could do anything to your life you will not Beed here tonight the fact that you are here tonight shows that they did not have any power over you and they will not have any power over you we are Sons and Daughters of the almighty God our father knows what is ahead of us even before there was time and he has made Provisions for it you don't have to worry about that we have enemies out there praise the Lord your enemy is not your brother your enemy is not your sister we have enemies out there to fight we are wrestling with spiritual forces evil spirits these are the forces we are fighting against can you imagine living this life without Christ can you imagine living this life without Christ why you are wrestling with evil spirits you are wrestling with forces of Darkness you are wrestling with principalities forces you don't see it's even unconventional for them to put a boxer in the ring and put a spiritual boxer and in and ask them to fight it's going to be a oneway fight I don't know how that is going to look like so can you imagine that you are fighting forces That You Don't See but we should be thankful to God that the barrle is not ours the barrle is the Lord's barrle he is the one doing the fighting just make sure that you stay with the word it doesn't matter how much the Devil Comes roolling Around stay under the umbrella of the world and see the protection of God praise the Lord so in this in this in this Dimension there is a lot of good things happening and there is also a lot of bad things going on in the message enticing spr 1955 0724 just recently even cancer has been declared to be a for Dimension disease so even sickness sickness and diseases are fourth dimension diseases and brother BR said that sicknesses are what demons they are demons you cast out that devil the sickness goes so in this Dimension there are sicknesses there are diseases that we are fighting against there are demons forces that we are fighting against and this is just the spiritual side of things now when we go further this Dimension is also a dimension of Science and Technology there is a lot going on in this world through Science and Technology there is no way of telling what goes on in this Dimension because no man can see with his eyes what is going on but what we cannot see in this Dimension science and technology has made it possible for us to see it what we cannot hear in this Dimension science and technology has made it possible for us to hear them because they have developed machines and gadgets and technology that by tele the use of television now there are there are there are pictures that are going through this wall there are voices that are going through this wall but they is so fast that we cannot see them with our Naked Eyes but they are here the Olympics is going on right now if you want to be part of it all you have to do is just get your phone go on the website or get a television station L onto the channel once you get that channel the picture comes to you you tune into a radio station K KT um there's one channel I love so much you just tune in and you catch everything they doing real life they don't have to record it on anything to send to you but before you tune in to that channel those pictures were just flying around before you tune in to that radio station those voices were just going around somebody can sit somewhere in Africa and be part of today's service all they have to do is go on YouTube go on um our website and then catch this event and they are listening to it and watching it in real time and all this is happening in the fourth dimension all this is happening in the fourth dimension now I have a code here there is the Lord um let me see where to start from I think I lost the part of this I lost the part of of this but uh what the prophet of God is trying to tell us here is that um just as we tune into a particular TV station or a Channel or radio station I'm just paraphrasing them now um to catch a program um he's saying here that there is the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God standing here and the reason that you can't see him is because our house hasn't become tuned down to it and the reason we can't see the television pictures our bodies are not set as in as instruments to pick up mechanically mechanical sent things but when our body becomes in tune with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of his power and omnipotence he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants Fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth and he's Desiring to Fellowship again with his Fellowship by Redemption PR praise the Lord like in the Garden of Eden so as we just tune in scientifically whether on the on on the internet whether on the television station whether on the radio to catch a real time a real time program the prayer of God is saying that the Lord Jesus is in our midst here and now the reason why we don't see him is because we have not tuned down into that Channel Once you tune in into that channel it's a spiritual Channel you are going to see him you are going to hear his voice praise the Lord in the message Fellowship by Redemption 1955 043 in the four dimension people can prove that right through this building now radio is going okay I just we we just um talked about that um so now you look at it there is no television here or should I say a television station right here that if there was a program we could tune in and get the program so because we have the television station right behind there there could be a television station somewhere in Australia the farthest end of the world and then you can tune in and be part of that program it is not because that television station is here with you God does not live is not in the fourth dimension God is in heaven but he operates in the fourth dimension that you can tun in and tap into his blessings you can tune in into that Dimension and see God you can tune in and hear the voice of God like you tune in to catch any program around the world this Dimension we are talking of has become so so so dangerous that the devil is using this dimension a lot against the children of God when you look at AI that is artificial intelligence and what they are doing in fact it's it's it's it's just a dangerous place to be I can't imagine how this world is going to be 50 years from now if Christ car that they are coming out with very very dangerous theories and what is the devil trying to do the devil is trying to just F you with technology to get you to sleep off get you away from the promises of God just kill your spirit kill the influence of the white in your life all the devil is trying to do is take you away from the word if the devil can succeed to take you away from the word he has no I mean you have become a friend and not an enemy and now they have their version of life eternal and what they are saying is that they can put a person's pictures together from their infancy all through their life and the things they have gone through and then they store that you know artificial intelligence works with algorithms it's not a program you feed it like uh we used to have with our I mean computer programming but with the age we are living in if you ask the machine to tell you something and it doesn't have the answer it goes looking for it and they say that the machines are sent which means that they are aware they exist and man is getting to a place to hand over his authority to machines that one day machines are going to rule our lives and already they say the dest machine is smarter than um who is this scientist this scientist U physicist Einstein he had an IQ of 160 and this machine already have an IQ of 3,500 in Einstein's time when he started talking about those theories 99% of the world didn't know what he was talking about because he was in a different class and now men are producing machines that are going to be 100 times smarter than us so why where do we stand and then what they are saying is that they have their own way of eternal life and they say that they will store all these things on a machine and then your grandchildren if they want to talk to you they will just come and they go and they put your I don't know what it is they'll put in and then you would come on the screen and then your grand child will ask you hey Grandpa how are you remember he is dead and gone he is dead and gone but here your grandchildren your great great grandchildren would come go on a machine and then they'll put in whatever it is and then you appear on the screen and they'll ask you Grandpa how are you oh I am fine Grandpa when you were small at this age how was life and then M will be talking to you and you are seeing the image the picture the real picture of your grandparent whom you never saw and they say that is their verion of eternal life the devil will always make sure that he gives you a substitute he always has a substitute for you and people are falling for it people are falling for it who CL and sinker the other day at work I was talking to somebody and he told me somewhere in St Paul they have um a scientific a scientific there's a church that worship worships a scientific God I said what did you say he said there's a church that worship a scientific God I said what what is a scientific God it's just it's just it's just shocking where we are it's just shocking where where we are anything the devil can throw at us he would make sure he does it everything the devil has to throw against us he will make sure he does it and we ought to be wise we ought to be wise the devil can trap you in this Dimension he knows he can't get you to disbelieve the word of God he knows he can't get you to turn away from the word he knows he can't tell you there is no God he knows he can't bring that foolishness to you that eternal life is taking your picture and doing this he knows he can't do that but do you know what the devil can do he can trap you in there that you will spend your precious time wasting your time in that Dimension going from one website to the other going from one website to the other whether it's a movie you are watching whether it is shopping you are doing whether it is whatever it is that you love doing on the internet whether on Facebook whether on Instagram whether on um whatever you know this size more than I do he can trap you there that you would Waste Your Precious time time you should use seeking the face of God time you should use praying and consecrating your life time you should use meditating upon the word you will spend this precious time oh it is not sin I am just shopping of course that is not B you spend your whole day not that you spend your whole week we and sometimes you don't even pray you get up you don't pray you don't read your Bible you don't listen to your messages but you don't forget to take your your your your your your phone and WR in you are online you are in that Dimension downloading everything and watching everything and listening to everything the devil is using that to kill our spiritual lives that you will get to a place and you ask yourself how did I get here I used to be on fire for God I used to be a PR a prayerful Christian I used to be on the Firing Lane how did I get here you know the best way to kill a frog don't just hit it with a mallet and kill it right away put it in water it loves cold water and then put fire under it it will be there enjoying it it doesn't know when the water is getting hurt by the time it realize Hur is done that is what the devil does he knows he can't just come and right away get you he has been in this game for long he just comes in ways you don't expect oh yeah no I have control I have control you have control over nothing you have control over nothing praise the lord the devil is using this Dimension so much to destroy our relationship with God that even when you decide to pray you are thinking of some some show on the internet there are people that can just go all through night all through the night they can't even keep a job why because they are playing games with some faceless people people they have never seen in their lives and they are playing games with them and they in the they will just play games in the basement all through the night and this even affects people's homes it affects marriages it affects relationships why because you have wife sitting there have husband sitting next everybody's on their phone everybody's on your phone for hours you not even think there is anybody in the house then you open and then everybody's good no relationship anymore you wonder why relationships are breaking you wonder why marriages are not working we ought to have time for one another we ought to have time keep the technology aside we are in that age I'm not saying abandon it all together some people cannot go a day without their phone they will go crazy as soon as they get out of the home and they R their phone oh my phone they have to get it at all cost it's like they have lost a love one it has become part and pel of Our Lives we are so engrossed in it and so so consumed in it that technology is what is driving Our Lives now as if we have no life technology is what is dictating what we should do no wonder people are worshiping the god of science because that is all they beli in there was a story of a little child who want start by his mother and then he started crying then the mother turned to him and said why are you crying then the mother just started petting him no talk to me he wouldn't talk no what's going on he said mommy in the next world I want to be a phone then the mother said you a million times worth more than a phone to me he said no I want to be a phone then the mother said why he said because your phone is getting all the attention and that is what is happening in our homes the phone is getting all the attention in our marriages the phone is getting all the attention why wouldn't he say he wants to be like a phone everyone everybody wants to be loved he saw that his mother is always on the phone and daddy is always on the phone he goes to Daddy Daddy go go to Mommy I'm busy he goes by me oh I'm coming I'll be with you very soon and they never get to him this Dimension can either make your life or or make it it can make you a better person or it can make you a worse person all the good things and the bad things are out there it depends on what you go shopping for and sometimes when you go shopping you go with a good intention you know what you are looking for and the devil brings an advert a popup and some of us are quick to follow it and before you realize oh I didn't intend to be here and you are already there and your soul is feeding on something nasty you have to guide against it you ought to be a wise son and a wise daughter of God you have to use the technology don't let the technology use you know when you are out there know what you are fishing out for it's a dangerous territory to be in that you can be in the Dangerous Waters and you don't even know it before you aw you are getting drowned it's a dangerous place don't allow anything anything that you know deep down in your heart that is against the word don't allow that to be your source of entertainment we ought to be better in our work with God on a daily basis you get to a place in your life you have to take account of your life see how far have I come with the Lord how many years have I been in this how many times have I been going back and forth have I made any progress am I doing something that is pleasing to the Lord am I in his perfect will these are questions you should be asking yourself on a daily basis we should keep consecrating ourselves we should keep praying for one another we should keep fighting because we are here to fight we are soldiers in the army of the Lord we know no defeat praise be to God just realize that that fourth dimension there is a lot that is going on already there's a lot of battles there do not add to it be wise when you go shopping in that Dimension when I mean shopping I'm not talking of going to buy clothes or going to buy food when you go there and you are you are browsing that's what I mean know what you are looking for know what you are looking for you could get yourself into trouble this is not to scare you it is the real reality of our time we are living in it be careful do not let technology be your wife do not let technology be your husband do not let technology be your friend use it don't allow it to use you the devil is behind all this trying to kill the influence of the word in your life and when you get to that place where the influence of the word of God in your life is killed I wonder where you are praise be to God it's 9:23 I think it's a very good place to close I would ask the musicians to come over as we think over these things praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord dimensional influence it is the grace of God that has brought us this far there are a lot of things we are going through but he that has promised that he will be with us that he will never leave us nor forsake us he is more than able to keep his word just trust and Obey just trust and Obey do not let this world have a part of you we are called to live above this world we know the Lord Our God in whom we have put our trust we are serving a living God not the god of science that there is life in the word of God we know better we know better we know better if we choose not to serve God tomorrow we can never blame God because we know how loving he is how faithful God has been to us you look at our lives and you can tell the love of God in you the grace of God upon your [Music] life and the prophet of God said if if it will cause God to bankrupt heaven for your sake he will do [Music] it and God has given us the best the best he gave us of himself for heaven and Earth shall pass away but his word will never pass away in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God he gave us nothing less of himself praise be to God you are blessed you are blessed it doesn't matter what you are going through you
