========================================

[Music] [Music] you [Music] good morning Saints god bless you greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior we are one more time to worship the Lord and give him honor and glory thank you for all that he does every day at least I can say that I'm here by His grace and His mercy and his love I as you know I had a little hard half a week just to I sure you all know I that's Wednesday when we were here I also led the services and it's just it just amazes me how God works and how he does things and sometimes we don't even pay attention we don't even see him we miss him but last Wednesday just to give you a little story here to tell you what's going on with me I have this this little cat and not cast but support we all left and of course brother Johnny here had a flat and his car and and I got ready to leave and actually I left but I usually I don't leave my Bible anywhere I carry this wherever I go and specially when I come to church and I was down the road down here on my way home and I realized I left a Bible over here by now coat hangers and I said uh-huh I'm going back to Turner I turn around and come and get him take you home and come back not knowing that brother Johnny needed a ride to his place because of the flat brother Juan was gonna give him a ride but he said hey brother 1 you going that way can you give Johnny a ride you know I sure so just to show you you know that when you have a needing whenever you least expect it he's there to help you you know all you have to do is ask him you know especially to the ones are always household you know his his people his children so I that was the Lord that brother Johnny neither helping he used me to do it so but anyways that same night I am I went home the one were like usual you know I went home and I got home and about two o'clock in the morning I got up feeling a little bit kind of a not feeling good well it turns out turns out that I had I had a burning in my chest it was like somebody put a iron in my chest I knowing what it was you know I I took two aspirins I I was getting ready to go back to bed it's hard for me to like say it's hard for me to to knock the hardwood down you know a tree down so I I said you know no I'm gonna I'm just gonna go ahead and go to the ER and check have this checked out so I went in there and they got me one of the stations and the nurse came in and she drew some blood I waited and this was 3:30 in the morning which bank it came back negative so they were looking for that inside when when the heart something happens to the heart it's it's the only organ and I think in the body that puts out that enzyme that lets you know that there is damage in the heart and so I say oh well I'm good we'll go home you know so I put my jacket I put my jacket on and got ready to go home you know and and and and oh they're badgering the nurse you know and I told her get you get the doctor it can t release me so I can go home it's already this is costing me money that you know and so and so uh and so and so she said so I'll get right on it and I'll hit the doctor you know so she I could went back out onto the station and sat down and I was looking at my phone you know and then the doctor comes in with a serious face I said oh she says you're not going anywhere I said oh okay why your enzymes are just a little bit too high so something happened to your heart you know and I said okay well praise the Lord I these two hours that I've been there I've been singing and giving praise to the Lord okay that I've been in that station just within myself just praying and asking the Lord for help well sometimes help comes not the way you want it but the way he wants to give it to you and so I I said well okay it's just so get back on that bed and you're the only place you're going from here is to the second floor to call me vascular so I said okay so they took me up there and they started telling me this and that some happened one doctor comes in and then another lady comes in and draws more blood for me I think I got more holes in my my arms that are Swiss cheese you know so and so I said I said I said well Lord whatever you want you know the the doctor said I had a little a little I'd rather say a little mini mini heart attack it's a mini heart attack okay okay meaning heart attack so they scheduled me for one of those angioplasty plans but something yeah that's what they call that you know I'm all scared you know because you know they're the one doctor comes in and says wait you know the cardiology comes in and says you know this is this it's not without risk you know I mean you can die in the table and they send the other say you know what I told I told her you know I don't want to hear that just tell me what you're gonna do and leave it at that that's it I don't want to hear that don't come over here scare me you know and so so I so I say Lord you know I don't want to go through this but now my will you will and so I I just as I was I was sitting there you know I just laying down on the bed [Music] got so good I feel like I'm sitting there and I saw this light in between the wall and the window and just just one little white light just bling you know and then another one behind it and then I say Lord I'm at peace because I knew he was there just to let you know I knew he was there that one of the nurses came in and he made a comment he said this is the only room that the temperature is normal if you go to the other rooms they're all cold said this is the only room that has a constant constant temperature it's just right and I said Lord thank you and so they came and got me yesterday yesterday at 10:30 in the morning reeled me down there and I just said well they put that tranquilizer in Hindi IV and I just said but I was talking the next thing you know I was out going out the door so they put a stent in me and now of course when they put a stent in you you gotta be in all kind of medication so praise the Lord I guess he fixed me I'm still here among you and I'm still here to give praises to the Lord and give Him glory so he had a we had a purpose for me to keep me

Saints alive and worship in the Lord Jesus and and loving him certainly enjoyed the brother this morning out exhorting the testimony of the brother healing touch the beautiful song specials in tonight oh brother blood tape he puts me in a very difficult position that's a hard act to follow because we believe it's really the acts of the Holy Spirit in his people so if we can stay in tune with that same spirit here and then continue with those same acts by His grace and mercy this morning you may have your seats just for a moment that was listening as the brother was speaking on on prayers morning it certainly touched our hearts to hear anytime the word of god is spoken in a brought to memory a poem that Lord had given me a few years ago is as you sit and study and read on the Word of God sometimes and from the struggle of life mount up on you and you're just looking for something to speak to your hearts you know and as i sat there studying and thinking pondering it seemed like my thoughts couldn't go past the ceiling of that bedroom then I just felt has the Lord to say pick up thy pen and write and when I did then I become a scribe for something the Lord would want to give me and if he gave it to me then I'd like to share it with you this morning and the poem is called sunrise to sunset and these are the words he allowed us to write sunrise to sunset I will seek your face knowing the victory that awaits me when I make you first place fasting and prayer is where I'll wait for you in my prayer closet where your promises come true it's not a busy place where the multitudes abide it's the secret of your pavilion where bride and groom reside I know what's the best wait and yet I try it lasts only to be defeated by Satan's ugly blessed I dedicate myself again to the prayer closet with my friend who listened so intently to every word I say but when I listen quietly to every word he speaks it gives me all the strength I need to hear him say you're free free from the sickness free from the pain free from the lust free from the shame freedom freedom freedom free at last in my little prayer closet when I close the door at last so the brother speaking this morning provoked my memory to share this with you all to God be the glory for the things that he has done the Word of God is it's a book it's written in allegories it's written in Proverbs it's written in in parables visions and symbols of all kind so what's a book that can only be revealed by God Himself bringing to us a revelation of his word if you remember in the book of Matthew and in chapter 11 the Jesus speaking there and verses 24 and he says but I say unto you verse 25 and at that time jesus answered and said I thank thee Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes 2 things that he has done definitely done he has hid them and he's revealing them even so father for it seemed good in thy sight to both hide it and to reveal it to the world this morning it's a book hidden a mysterious book but to his people this morning within the walls of this little room it can be come to you a revealed word and there was there was a way that the Ministry of the Son of Man unfolded even connecting and dovetailing with this very same scripture here in st. Matthew 11 and verse 33 it says another bro another parable spoky unto them can the team kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet so his method of ministry had been spoken through the words of Isaiah of how he would minister what his method would be and the method was he was to come this Ministry of the Son of Man of Nazareth and all that he would say would be in a parable hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent scripture dovetailing now connecting for us he said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world but these utterance would be in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that if so with the good seed is the son of man and he began to reveal to them the things that he did not reveal to the multitudes but yet he spoke the truth to all all heard the truth but there was an ordained and elect group of people his disciples those that chose to follow him to me said come away into this little house here this house that I built what house will you build me that one where the son of man can meet you and reveal his word to your hearts an example of how he hid his word in the mysteries of God in parables scripture well known to all of us would probably be the easiest example to share with you Matthew 28 and 19 so when you go to your Bibles to the young people you see read letter on white paper I want you always to approach it and say it's a parable there's more there than just the literal word spoken there's a deeper meaning in the words of Jesus because what he speaks here was in a parable and Matthew 28:19 says go ye therefore and teach all nations Jesus himself the last Commission to his church disciples go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost the correct water baptism teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world and the majority of the Christian world today baptizes in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and they and you asked them why they said what better reason then jesus said so what better reason than Jesus said so how do you baptize the same because he spoke it in a parable and the prophetic word works in this way one prophet speaks something here another prophet speaks something here and it adds detailed it adds detail to the Word of God it makes the picture full where you can begin to see all the characteristics coming together of this revealed word now this in Matthew 20 19 was a word spoken in a mystery disc was a divinely hidden truth because he spoke it in a parable but on the day of Pentecost in acts 2 and verse 38 on a pass so in a profit is given the revelation of the parable and he said can repent and be baptized in the name of the Father and the son of the Holy Ghost which happens to be the Lord Jesus Christ not scripture conflicting but now scripture dovetailing and bringing forth a revelation the revelation of the probable that was spoken that Isaiah said he would speak in parables and he would say nothing but what it would be in a parable then how do you get the revelation this is how the disciples did it they said Lord Jesus we don't understand what you said either he said let me push the multitudes away and you come to church Sunday morning little group I'll see to it the doors closed where I can speak to you in private could it could it be the same Jesus the same yesterday today and forever doing the same things the same way for his children that you might become a disciple of years and then go out he into the world and preach the same gospel now the revealed Word of God oh my do you love them this morning with that said if you'll stand to your feet this morning that was just a few foundational statements so I haven't begun yet but now I am starting Matthew five and verse 48 and with that concept in mind we'll share this from the Word of God with you I entitled it perfection two restored friendship for a title and for the subject adoption the process perfection the capstone Matthew five and verse 48 it reads like this be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect as we bow our heads Heavenly Father if you said and required it of us then surely you'll make away this morning and we thank you for that in Jesus name Amen you may be seated thank you sir ah very nice very handy and so simple perfection - restored friendship adoption the process perfection the capstone Matthew 5:48 said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I think the word perfect the Greek it means to make perfect it means to finish it means to consecrate to make perfect to complete to carry through completely to accomplish something to bring to an end a goal of some kind that you might have to bring or to close or to bring to fulfillment by events the prophecies of the scripture perfection a definition from Webster from Greek theologians but in the fact here an age brought them brother Branham said this exposition of the church ages in such tribulation worketh patience he said how highly God regards us outworking of our patience is seen in James 1 and 4 but let patience have her perfect work now you may be perfect entire lacking nothing prophet said God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development so perfection has a process and the Lord Jesus was the first ever to bring us an intense teaching of all the components that take us to perfection the process is called the adoption of sons and daughters of God the process to arrive to adoption is called the three steps of grace justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost it brings us to the born-again experience it is a process like the seed being sown in the ground there's a process to my the way what looks like the seed becoming undone is really the seed coming to perfection Hebrew 718 Paul told the Hebrews for theirs verily additional e'en of the commandment going before for the weakness and improv herbalist thereof yes he was speaking of all ten of them the commandments and Jesus in his parable and adoption and perfection also mentions him tells us how they were being dissing 'old Hebrews 7 19 and the reason for the law made nothing perfect Apostle Paul said but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God now we can see it in the words of the Apostle Paul the reason for a new covenant for man had been gone far from God as the parable of the prodigal son when the father said and he seen him afar off he seen him afar off in sin he seen him afar off in divorce he seen him afar off as a poor father he seen him afar off as a drug he seen him afar off a son but he determined to bring that son back through our process to perfection from the miry clay to a perfect son and daughter of God here it is the admonition of God when he's opening the book that Adam last I'm telling us things that had been hit since the foundation of the world for the first time since he spoken to Adam once again lip to ears to Adams fallen race you'll get to hear it this is what Adam heard that day in Eden just before the fall he heard God the Father tell him Adam biggie therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that's what Adam heard now the second Adam is telling you the same thing God rich in mercy these are not just New Testament admonitions this was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world tell me what Word of God that's written in the New Testament isn't an eternal word tell me what statement he didn't make to adopt and bring you back into his fold isn't something he didn't speak to Adam tell me something that he didn't say that he didn't tell Adam and when the first Adam fell and his wife failed God the Father wanted to bring you to that same place with him a restored friendship with the father Matthew five and six and seven is Jesus teaching on perfection and the process is to take us there adoption by the Holy Spirit adoption by the father justification by faith sanctification by the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a prophet told us you've just begun your Christian walk and your friendship with her father just begun Matthew 8:1 says when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him they followed him because of the teaching he had brought his teaching to a closed and finished with a comma and the multitudes followed him because they knew there was more oh that's why we should follow him today every time you hear something from the Word of God it should bring you to a place I want to keep following him because I know what he said but he put a comma so there must be more for me in this Christian walk where Jesus began was in Matthew 5 and verse 1 in Hebrews 6 and 1 Paul tells us let us go on to perfection and Paul was speaking of the things that Jesus had already said that was the perfection Paul was speaking of Matthew 5:1 when we read Matthew 5:48 he says go ye be he therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect the therefore part is because of 47 verses prior to the 48 the therefore part is because of the prior 47 verses because of what I've already told you because of those 47 verses of a parable wherein lays a revelation a divinely revealed mystery for you because of those 47 verses if you can catch the revelation you can enter into this process a character-building process unto adoption perfection a body change a translation to be quick and change and translated by the power of the Holy Ghost but you've got to be able to Caesar therefore when all you see is biggie therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect that's a young boy growing up to holiness churches in the Pentecostal movement but I want to be ten you'll forget it you're just a boy you don't understand it we cannot be perfect but Jesus it stopped you're just a child you don't understand he was right I didn't but now I realized that he didn't either neither one of us did neither the young or the old in the parable of the prodigal son there's a great mystery lain in there there's a way of the younger there's the way of the older and there's God's provided ways it's God's Way that we want not even the way of the older always is the better way but the father's way so therefore he said because of these 47 verses that I've spoke to you if you can catch the revelation that can be come to your divinely revealed mystery truth you will be made perfect so where Jesus began in his teaching of perfection because the concluding statement declares what he was speaking of in verse 48 he reveals to us that the forty seven verses have to do with you being perfect as the father's perfect great theologians read through it processed it wrote books and they finally said let's call it the Beatitudes I say I like the name but they were looking at from a different perspective not being made perfect just maybe better human behavior will teach not perfection affection is beyond psychology and good human behavior it's beyond for one is only natural you're trying the other is supernatural you're overcoming Matthew five and verse 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto Him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven what is it a parable it seems so plain to read it and yet it's a parable so if a parable then a truth is laying in there that's been hidden since before the foundation of the world the father alone to a restored friendship can make known to you and he opened his mouth to taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Paul said in Hebrews five and nine and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation all to all them that obey Him so we're being taught by him that was made perfect in a flesh body who is also the author of eternal salvation so the perfection is promised you as he achieved it in his own flesh body so that you could know it's possible for you to achieve it in this flesh body oh what a teacher not just in word but in deed an in power of the Holy Spirit and the thigh Theory interchange of profits is this once again how highly God rewards regards is outworking of our patients have seen in James when for he said but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lacking nothing James caught the revelation Paul caught the revelation Peter caught the revelation on perfection God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God waiting for God this is the process of character development when we have a restored friendship with the Father Matthew five and three blessed or the porns spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven in spirit means to encourage enliven someone now the word in spirit in the text of Matthew 5:3 is separated as two words but you know the word in spirit is also a correct word when you put it together and it changes the meaning and when you combine them and dovetail them together in spirit means to encourage and to enliven blessed are the poor that I will encourage and enliven for theirs is the kingdom of heaven by simply removing the space by simply removing the partition and running them together the word in spirit changes the whole context changes the meaning and that principle holds true in many scriptures and prophecies of the Bible when our prophet came to us in this day and just by moving a comma turned a word turned a prophecy that in the eyes of great students and learned it men of the English language saw it perfectly grammatically correct and yet made it prophetically wrong hmm yes someone I can hear him saying show me an example of that turn with me as we terribly jump off our subject for a moment and go to revelations chapter 5 we will see where a prophet would change the grammar to give us the correct prophetic meaning of these divinely revealed word and verse 5 and 1 of Revelation says and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , and on the backside sealed with seven seals so now in the context of how this is written grammatically it looks as though there's something on the backside written and the backside part is sealed and when a prophet preached it in 1962 sirs what time is it he leaned that direction because of how was grammatically written but when you've followed the line of the word he preaches the breech and another quotes from the message he says no he says there's nothing written on the backside everything must be within the atonement of what Jesus did for us and when he read it again in the breech he read it differently and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within now a comma and on the backside sealed with seven seals so what was grammatically correct but changed the prophetic meaning now becomes prophetically correct and grammatically wrong who wants the revelation or who wants to speak a perfect English I speak English your espanol auntie Francis but what I want is revelation going back to our subject in spirit remove the space put it together one word now means to encourage and enliven someone we have five senses of the Spirit we have five senses of the body both are given to us to contact this earth we live in and other human beings but not God being poor in spirit is a time when as men and women we come into desperation through discouragement and we no longer have the confidence in our own cells a person porn spirit the five senses of the Spirit our memory imagination conscious affection reasoning when through these five senses we can no longer encourage ourselves we need God to take control and come on the scene and it's a good place to be for the believer it's actually your Exodus journey the beginning unto perfection it's not your end brother sister it's your beginning in Genesis 18 Sarah found herself a woman poor in spirit a woman that she felt she could no longer be encouraged or enlivened in herself and in Genesis 18 and 1 the Word of God says and the Lord appeared unto him Abraham in the plains of Mamre words are interesting we can take them to extremes of course and I dare say I've done it myself sometimes to make a point but the word mom reached when used as a verb it means change it means change so let me read it in that context and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of change and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground fast forward to verse 9 Abraham speaking to them and they said come to him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him or she was behind him and he was in front verse 11 now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah left within herself saying after I'm waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also here was a woman poor in spirit after having waited on Abraham's inspiration and hope almost 25 years of waiting and it didn't happen in what she thought was a reasonable amount of time Abraham my husband I love you but you don't get it you're not getting that Abraham I don't feel a thing nothing personal her memory told her she couldn't ever remember a woman as old as her that had ever had a child in her imagination she couldn't imagine her being the first her conscious said this is unconscionable her affections said at my age I don't even desire to take care of a little baby anymore it's too much in her reasoning she had reason her all the way and she had laughed within herself when she heard the brothers that had come over to speak with her husband's there they are again they come over they say they want to talk about the word and here the Abraham starts in telling him about I'm still gonna have a baby and there's tell him they're all saying amen to it what about me don't these men get it I'm too old and so was Abraham she was a woman Sarah and her spirit I'd hit poverty level she didn't feel like she was at the threshold of a promise no more but that she had passed it up the door had shut she was left outside a laughingstock to all around the emotions that were running through her or many disappointment this Korea angered the other women laughing you're so great Sara you can't even have one child I have had ten it was a major issue in their day they didn't want another dog they wanted children Genesis 18 and 13 and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have a surety bear child which I'm old God was not discerning her condition as a stern rebuke he was telling Abraham my daughter's discouraged or in spirit all her senses are telling her it's too late and there's nothing I can do about it in verse 14 he says is there anything too hard for the Lord at that time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son a woman discouragement a woman with no hope and God takes it all in his control Amy it's not up to you Sarah you're a chosen vessel to receive this promise it's not up to you Sarah the Lord was a promise so close reminded them blessed are the poor in spirit when you let me have full control you're going through a struggle school work family husband wife children bless that are you in this heart trial when you let him have full control blessed are you in this hard trial when you let him have full control it's okay to say don't you understand pastor I can't do it the pastor raises up perfect because he can now give him full control Genesis 18 15 then Sarah denied that's when you know a brother and sister are poor in spirit and beaten down when you asked him did you say this they tell you I did not they're lying to you but I did say a brother or sister if you're mature enough to handle it you can't you'll still regard him your brother and sister if you're mature enough to handle it you'll still love them if you're mature enough to handle it you will wait you won't dump all your guns on them you'll say is that so brother yes that's all very good then we'll just let it sit there for now you say you're pulling back also to give God full control of their hearts and minds you don't think they feel condemned the minute they told you that you don't think it brought it brings them more pain that night as they're thinking about what they told you but you did the right thing you stop for a moment and you let God have control then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid she was discouraged hmm she was afraid it caused it to lose hope it caused her to lie and all the time a daughter of God ordained to the promise of God yes that was the first time this woman born spirit laughed but it would not be the last Genesis 21 and verse 1 and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him God always keeps his word to his children and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto Him whom Sarah bore to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised the son Isaac being 8 days old as God had commanded him and Abraham was in a hundred years old when his son was born unto Him verse six of Genesis 21 and Sarah sat down God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me there was a time when she couldn't hardly come to church she said they're just laughing at me I greet the sister and shake her hand first thing that sister does give me a smile she's laughing at me she's laughing at me the brother came to mind said God bless you said good to see you can he's smiling and I could see if I can see right through him he's laughing at me that's all she could see they're laughing at me but when God brought the promise to pass she said God had made me to laugh again so that all that hear me will laugh with me now the sister shakes her hand she laughs oh you give her a hug she's laughing with me who changed Sara changed who was transformed Sara was transformed who was quickened Sarah was quickened so now though all that laughs laughs with her and she said who would who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah she should have given children suck for I have borne him a son in his old age I have borne him a son in his old age and to this spot in the sermon this morning as we're speaking the Lord Jesus has given me a discernment of the condition this church is in Bellotti I could tell you one at a time and stand you up or I could do you one at a time one at a time or all at once because of what's taking place here I can tell you where you are in this Exodus journey by this contents of Matthew 5:48 unfolding now and dovetailing it with the Old Testament I know just where you are in your Christian walk each and every one of you who shall I choose this morning to show you I speak truth whoo but my friend brother blockade brother blah pay in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I tell you in your Christian journey in this Exodus walk like Sarah you are somewhere between the first and the last in his mercy anyone somewhat between the first lab and the man praise the Lord amen my goodness we want to thank the Lord I don't know what to say this morning that I know it is true that the Lord Jesus praise the Lord one thing that I noticed truth is that the Lord Jesus loved you and he sent brother Daniel to tell you you were right between your first line and the last line praise the Lord amen you know yesterday evening there was some few brothers they were having the Bible study in from dear but Moses brother Dan Ariel for a year on a myself I slid in and now you know we were just you know just talking some some structural things in it was it was good he meant it was going to see the brother sit in the only I mean we had a Bible in Emmy we were just calling in it interest and just chilling those Patriots prays alone sometimes it's good to have the Bible speaking for itself praise the Lord but what a basically like this morning I mean it almost took me off my seat you know if it was those days you are seeing something different I would have taken off my coat and truly get across the pulpit when I used to be radically because how how when we were just talking basically centered around Matthew 28:19 just those things of Jesus our conversation was centered around how on earth how on earth that the preacher who come flew in yesterday come to the spooky this morning and go right to that scripture how it's a sign that God was pleased with our conversations amen and he just came back to tell us look you guys were talking something that was a parable oh I just enjoyed that I could not focus this morning my mind was just growing my goodness praise the Lord I just call him focus this morning something was just happening inside of me man when you see God coming on the scene like that I don't know when you you know what you waiting for to see God but when he comes on the scene like that my goodness and I don't know what I don't know what happened to the rest of the brothers I just know what happened to me amen praise the Lord amen and I think that I'm closer to the last life than the first life I'm somewhere in between but I'm more closer to the last life than the first life I tell you that was a petty sermon praise the Lord amen you know when you come to church and you are not afraid to be discerned praise the Lord is a sign that we don't have nothing to hide but we want to thank the Lord this morning musicians you can count four don't give me room to preach just come up come up let's worship the Lord because I could just go start right here and take you to 5:00 p.m. this evening because so much presence in this house amen I mean there is so much that was said this morning that we can just go back and preach until the rest of the rest of the evening amen but we want to thank the Lord praise the Lord we want to thank the Lord all my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness praise the Lord do you think of that do you think that of yourself that you are somewhere between your first life in your last life Amen you know what it is and and I mean you know the presence of God and that's what I say all the time brothers you know all we labor to do around it is just to keep the right atmosphere amen praise the Lord when we when we fry our certain things it's not it's not just to be indifferent it's because we're trying to protect an atmosphere praise the Lord and the right atmosphere will always bring the right result amen I was thinking just listening to the preaching of the world the one that had the promise when God gave Abraham the promise that you will have a son they wonder had a promise she had to get into a spirit of sorrow the very one that God was going to use to bring the promise she had to be despised she had to be laughing at the very one and not only what people say our people were thinking what even she herself was thinking if everyone so you see sometimes our action complaints are given faucets
