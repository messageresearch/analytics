Bible but there is only one who can make it live be real and that's you father we're looking for you to do that tonight bless us in every way our hearts are so full of joy as we see the time approaching when we're going to meet him face to face the one that we've loved and live for all these years many new converts Lord has been made understanding that a great hosts 40 or 50 is to be baptized in your name in the morning from the service last night oh God please continue we pray until every predestinated seat of God has seen the Gospel Light and come into the full we ask you to hide us tonight behind the word blind us to the things of the world and let us see Jesus May there be a mount Transfiguration experience among us tonight that we see no man save Jesus only we ask that in his name and for his glory and a Vindication of his gospel amen you'll be seated I'm just going to turn this mic or this desk just slightly sideways if it's all right so that I can see both sides of the audience I guess I can get these microphones around here right all right Justin we are greeting from the main Auditorium here tonight our friends and Arizona California Texas and across the United States by the way of telephone this is going Nationwide this service tonight by the way off telephone so we trust that God will bless us can you hear back over to the auditorium to the left all right they're going to check now the telephone system to see if it's working all right everybody happy tonight that's fine on this side amen I'm so glad to see that you're all seated comfortably and now tomorrow night if the crowds keep increasing they'll also be telephone direct there is tonight I think some of them is down there at the Tabernacle and tomorrow morning the services cannot be had at the Tabernacle because the it'll be a force there a decorating the church for a wedding tomorrow afternoon and they have transferred the the services in the morning up to brother ruddle's church one of our Associates and up on the the highway here 62 I haven't been announced it's been announced if it overflows up there we'll take the rest and send another Minister down to brother Junior Jackson's down in Clarksville the reason we had it brother ruddles it's close here and we can um and we thought you could find that easier and then we'll take care of it in some way and be sure to get all those baptisms in Puerto tomorrow and I hope there'll be another hundred or two added to those for baptism tomorrow and now tomorrow night I never like to announce anything you speak on ahead of time but one night in the service or one day I want to speak on the subject of who is this Melchizedek because it's a subject that I think we're living in the time when these Revelations of which has been the question down through the age of who is this fella and I believe that God has the answer who he was some said a priesthood some said a king some but there's got as long as a question there's got to be an answer to that question which is right cannot be a question without first being unanswered now we trusting that God will give us a blessing tonight out of his word as we read it and you've had Billy told me to tell you that you sure had fine cooperation with the peoples here that's been in the parking system the police and everything keep it up that's very very good we hope to see the time maybe in the near future when maybe we could bring the tent here to the city and put it up out here in the ballpark where we can stay for some length of time maybe for three or four weeks Revival constantly here we just merely get to know each other and then we have to um say goodbye and we go again but I'd like to come and stay an extensive trip one time where you can stay so we don't have to close out a night or two but just stay and teach day and night day and night on and on maybe somebody go home and feed the chickens milk the cows and come back next week and continue home with the service I like that so the Lord be with you now before I leave perhaps Sunday morning or Sunday night or sometime one of these Services I know you're all waiting to hear the message on the truth about marriage and divorce which is one of the great problems of the day just as sure as I'm standing here I believe that the correct answer is in the word of God and I believe that that's what I promise to come back for and I suppose knowingly as far as I know I want to have another service here and Jeffersonville on Easter Sunday and we'll for Sunrise Service and then Easter Sunday so we'll announce it ahead and try maybe to get the auditorium if possible or somewhere as far as Sunday May become Saturday and Sunday had to fly in and back out because it's near the time I have to check it first with the schedule I have and one of my my itinerary in California and then immediately I've got to go down into Africa so um keep in touch and pray for us now tonight I want to call your attention to a potion of God's word found in the fourth chapter of Saint Luke the fourth chapter and the 16th verse it will begin Jesus speaking this day is this word fulfilled in your ears now we want to draw from that uh conclusion of Howard Dynamics is the word of God God now we all can figure out the mechanics but it takes the Dynamics to make it work we can figure out what the mechanics of a machine automobile but then it takes the Dynamics to make the wheels go to operating and moving now Jesus had returned to to Nazareth where he was brought up on down in the scripture share we find that they said we ain't heard you did such and such over Capernaum now let us see you do it here in your own country Jesus said a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and of course that's where you're brought up at and where people know you and there he had a a bad name to begin with by him being born without an Earthly father they called him an illegitimate child that Mary was actually pregnant before she married officially Joseph but that isn't so we know it isn't so and on this scripture what caused me to fall My Eyes Upon This was uh something had happened just recently in Phoenix Arizona it was the last day of the service that I was to speak at the International Convention of the Full Gospel businessman and in this convention there was a visitor with us which was uh Catholic bishop which is uh is uh of the child eating rights all the apostolic Catholic Church the most Reverend John S Stanley OSD um he is the Archbishop of Metropolitan United States in the Catholic church this had to be his card and his and his address and he was a visitor uh with the Christian businessman and I had seen there the day before and when I was speaking on Saturday night I believe it was or Saturday morning at the breakfast and I as I was speaking he uh kept watching me I thought that man certainly is disagreeing with everything I say and uh you know you get you could just see me keep his head up and down but I didn't know what was just exactly working on him so on Sunday afternoon when I got up to speak I was going to take my text on birth pains where Jesus said that as a woman Intervale with a child she's travailing in birth and uh so I was going to speak from there as birth pains the subjects saying that the world is in birth pains now although old has to be done away with so the new can be born just like a seed has to rot away in order to give New Life how the pains birth pains struck um the world in World War One she had a terrific pain because he had poisoned gas and so forth that almost could destroy the world and in World War II she struck another harder pain it had Blockbusters and also an atomic bomb she cannot stand another labor pain with these missiles and things today one more war will throw out into space for she will now be delivered and there will be a new Earth the Bible said there will be honor ever prophet's message Israel God of birth pain because these prophets have come on the scene after the theologians and clergymen would have the church all in an organization form and when that prophets come on the scene with thus saith the Lord they shut down churches and she had a birth painting finally she had birth planes flown up until she delivered a son of the Gospel which was the word itself made flesh so the church really is in birth pains tonight again for the Deliverance of the son son of God to come again all of our theologians all of our systems all of our denominations have rotted right out from under us so we are in birthing and a message from God always towards the church and have your pain but after a while she's going to be delivered of a bride that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride and then thanking this man to disagree with me so much when I raised up to speak this message uh turned in my Bible to find the page and my wife had just given me a new Bible for Christmas my old Bible is about 15 years old and the thing was just about Torn to Pieces the pages every time would open up and fly out of it and but I know just where to find every scripture so I study closed in that Bible and I just picked up the new one because the other looks a ragged to go to church with and when I started to turn over in Saint John where the scripture was found I started to read the 16th chapter and the verse that I was looking for wasn't there so I thought strange I turned back again still it wasn't there and brother Jack Moore from Shreveport Louisiana bosom friend of mine he was sitting there I said brother jack isn't that found in Saint John 16 he said yes and this Catholic priest got up out of his seat from about a hundred clergymen sitting on the platform walked over close to me with all of his robes and gowns and crosses and so forth and got right up close to me and he said my son Be steady God is fixing to move I thought a Catholic bishop telling me that he said read it out of my book and I read the scripture out of his book and talk by text and went over preach my sermon afterwards when I got through he got up after I was gone and said this one thing has to happen after that the church has to get out of the mess it sits in or we have to get out of the mess the churches so one of the other and uh I was on my road home back down to Tucson that evening the kids was crying for a sandwich and I stopped to get a sandwich a little standing my wife said bill I never was so nervous in all my life to see you stand up there Plumbing to that Bible said didn't it make you nervous I said no I said I know it was in there somewhere they just didn't have the pages of misprint and she said to think that I got you that Bible and looked like every eye in there was right up on me and I said well you couldn't help that there's a misprint in the Bible I said they just never put the page in well I got out and looked at it again just perfect see if it could be but the 16th chapter ends potion the portion of it it's about three inches from the bottom over at the 70th chapter on the other side does the same thing and being a new Bible those two pages had perfectly stuck together and I was reading from the 17th chapter instead of the 16. well I said that's all fine it's for some cause and just as plain as you could hear any voice a voice come to me and said he entered into Nazareth the word he was brought up at and went into the synagogue as it was his custom and the priest gave him the scriptures to read and he read Isaiah 61 and when he had read the scriptures he sat down handed the priests back to the Bible the book and sat down in all the eyes of the congregation was upon him and precious words proceeded from his mouth and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled how good is the scripture if you'll notice this in Isaiah 61 1-2 is where our Lord was reading from Isaiah 61 1-2 but in the middle of the second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped or said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year then he stopped why the other part to bring judgment that didn't apply to his first coming but is Second Coming did the father how the scriptures never make a mistake they're always perfect Jesus stopped just where the scripture stopped because that was exactly what was to be Vindicated in his day now is that first coming the second coming he will bring judgment upon the Earth but not then he was to preach the acceptable year notice the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the Word of Promise for that age how strange amen the Messiah standing up before the church and look at these precious words when he says here to preach the acceptable year the acceptable year as we all know as Bible readers was a Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were uh been taken prison and I had to give a son to pay a debt our daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they'd been in bondage or how long they're supposed to stay there when the year come of the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free they're free you are no more slave but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post and it took a awe and board a hole in your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how it's far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can't go free when you hear the dry gospel trumpet sound out you are free but if you turn your back upon the message and refuse to hear it notice you were born in the ear with an awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave do the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year now the other part of it is I said didn't need to be answered because this coming Messiah time now is when he will bring judgment now how could those people ever fail to see who he was how did they ever miss it how could it be when it was so plainly made known and showed how could they have ever missed seeing one what a word think of it this day is this scripture fulfilled before foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
