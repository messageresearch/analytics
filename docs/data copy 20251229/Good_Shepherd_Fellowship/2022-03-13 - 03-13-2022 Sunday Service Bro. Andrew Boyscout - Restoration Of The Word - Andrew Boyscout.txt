the lord amen amen may his word be fine in you amen amen it's good to have brother andrews with us praise the lord you know you read you read about bible characters brother branham said in crisis the mystery of god revealed those old testament characters david and the rest of them you know they never knew they were playing that christ you know psalm psalm chapter 22 then you read the psalm you see david saying my god my god what have that forsaken me under inspiration he said those things now realizing that hundreds of years after jesus would say those very same words there on calvary and but it's also at the place you read about noah you heard brother brother what's his name brother dicks was here the last time preaching about noah how he was building the ball tennis his uh you know his children said oh daddy can you go and play basketball with us and go and play and then he comes back and by doing that he attract his entire family over to building the boat and you know we until we get on the other side we will never you know get the full picture of what uh those those uh bible characters you know are but yet we realized that uh we set the god that is the same yesterday to them forever and uh and and there are people in the very little way nowhere to be compared to abraham moses noah you know there's no comparison to those people but they are just people that god has blessed and given the privilege to be able to serve the lord in a very unique way amen and i think uh brother but andrews and his family you know uh uh have done the same in our generation you know uh you know they have they have held the boundary of the message in the air in the village there uh in shiva and uh our brother he's you know he's a humble brother as you if you stick around here you will know that but you know he's highly respected among his people you know and then uh [Music] just like noah to his generation you know and just being there and learning some of the things of how the message came to the village and some of the sacrifice that they made and and now uh uh you know compared to to the population that they have there we can say they have they have a big church there you know not in big church anywhere we see it big but if you know the size of their place you will know that and and i just think it's uh it's all uh in honor of the faith of the person you know praise the lord and many of us who have uh who have loved to have uh you know even even if if the prophet was alive we would have loved to having come to our church and you know and and uh even if we if if people if we have billy paul in town you know we we wouldn't have had space here you know every everybody message believers around the city will have come in here to see billy paul for the first time but i would say i have the privilege to see someone that i admire amen yeah i admire our brother brother andrews just being there with them and seeing the kind of quality of work that they have done in the village i admire that the last time i was there i was there to visit and right in that time his dad passed away and you know we went for the funeral i just sat back i just look you know you know look and i mean i was just absorbing in like a sponge you know just absorbing in the quality of the people you know you go there then you see you know the ethics you know the a manner and you know and all of that he's someone that uh admired so uh that was one of the reason why we're having to come by you know i just wanted to spend some time with him even though i did not spend much because i have my own things going on but we were able to spend some time together praise the lord the bible says blessed are the feet that brings good tiding so all you need you just need a man filled with the holy ghost to walk into your present you know that's all you need amen you don't need mysteries you don't need uh some kind of a preacher that was painting your head around your shoulder and man your hair not supposed to go around your shoulder it's supposed to stay like this 10 left and 10 right if you're having someone spinning your head around your shoulder then you realize that uh you you caught up into some kind of a mysticism amen so uh we we appreciate our brother and then his his uh precious wife back there uh sister burning and daughter grace and we appreciate having them with us praise the lord amen like like i said you got to you got to put on your wisdom cap because uh uh brother andrew speaks with a lot of wisdom amen if when he speaks one you got to think 10 times praise the lord so on a preacher like this you don't sleep because you're going to miss it you know you just you got to put on your wisdom cap amen praise the lord i always enjoy listening to him ministering the few times that i've i have uh listened to him listening to our feet and [Music] amen it was amazing grace let's sing the end no now i made it over how sweet i say [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god [Applause] praise god [Music] heavenly father we thank you for your amazing grace father to know that it's only by your grace that we are here and we love you appreciate you thank you for all you've done for us for your mercy and and father lord you're calling to us father god at this time lord i know it's a hard age and so many voices but father lord it's just something in us that we're tuned to this truth we thank you lord god for that that ability lord god the the opportunity the privilege to be able to hear this message father god lord we thank you for all you've done for us we're looking forward to that finished work father god we know it's already done in your word but father we look for it and we pray that you'll just come lord even just be with us this morning and lord you know all that we need to hear we know you know all the things we need for you told us that faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god and father i pray we'll just just once more look into our hearts and meet the needs father god you know our hearts desires and father you know we're it's reaching out to father maybe a family a friend whoever it may be father lord i pray he'll just come and just meet that need but father above all we just need you father even this morning in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord well greetings in the name of jesus christ god bless you all coyata dialogy thank you for coming let's turn our books to uh i'll start with the word here let's general leviticus chapter three uh this morning we'll start from there lord willing will give a testimony and leviticus chapter 23 verse 10 the bible says speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you be come into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it and father your blessings to you this evening this morning amen god bless you you may be seated praise the lord you know if we've written the message on brother man i'm talking about the waving the sheaf uh the first fruits you know he's he's standing there talking about the priest taking the first fruits of the the harvest and these are the first ones that are ripe and he waves them over the field and what and what is he doing he's waving it over the field knowing that this field is going to become ripe just exactly like the first ones and that's something that we're looking at here and i want to speak on the restoration of the word lord willing this morning because i know back in the time in 1992 that's when we first heard the word out in chibak nobody came out there we got a church age book that came into chibak and that's how we got into the introduced into the message and i mean that that was exciting that was exciting for me uh for anybody that has been called that recognizes something that's exciting you know just to hear the message to hear the truth you know that's something you've been looking for all i mean for me i looked for it for so many years and you know i came across this word and said here it is this is what i've been looking for this is what i've been looking for you know it's i've gone to uh tv evangelists you know i've gone to putting my hand on the television and praying with the preacher and ordering the ornate oils and cloth and i've done all those things looking for the truth i'm i i had this burden in my heart and i'm gonna i want something that's missing and when i read this church age book from the very first page i couldn't put it on it showed me things that i've been looking for and and and i told my brother-in-law that we needed to do something the very first thing he told me was we need to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and that's what we pursued from that day and the following week we got baptized named jesus christ we found a brother uh who who was one of them that brought that message brother willie mcgowan from white horse in canada and he was the one that labored out in chibak for four times a year i think it was for how many years i can't remember so many years he labored all the way from white horse to chivak and that's not cheap you know it's expensive just to go to chibak traveling from here to anchorage is cheaper than traveling from anchorage to chivek you know it's cheaper it's much cheaper so just just for me and my wife to travel to the anchorage is almost close to two thousand dollars and that's a lot of money for us you know that's i mean from here to anchorage you know that's less than that but by god's grace you know he's god's been merciful to you know for for the group out there at the time when the word came out to chivak uh uh i mean you got to know the excitement you know when you find something you've been looking for the excitement i was excited to share with my brother my older brother you know he's about 10 years older than me my dad was a catholic deacon you know the village is a catholic village so you're going to know the pressure that we felt and once once chivak found out that there's a new religion in chibak so you got to know the pressure that came out my brother when i shared in my the message the godhead i shared him i was excited my brother's going to see it you know there's no way that he could not not see it i'm so simple so clear i shared it with him excited his wife was thought i was drunk you know it's his wife thought i was drunk and i was so excited sharing it with them walking back and forth in their house you know with holding a bible you know the only thing that he told me was i got to talk to the father first my brother-in-law my wife's older brother he was the one that gave me the church age book he was there with me and he was thinking yeah we got to talk to the father you know my brother was talking to the pre about the priest so those were the beginnings and i think about march may of that year brother willie mcgowan was the first preacher that he went out to chivac and i mean i was excited we we got our own little place to get together and i sort of advertised it set it up set up chairs i know people are going to come you know i'm excited just only a one two three four came they found out and the way we communicate in chivak at that time i mean it was popular used as cb uh radios so every house basically had a cb and that's how we communicated so this guy found out what was going on he advertised through that cb that there was a new religion or something going on in chibak so the tribal chief got together with his counsel and invited us to go to a meeting that evening that's the second day that brother wheeler was there the paris council for the catholics were there and you got to imagine you know if i were to pick somebody here if i were to ask brother juan to pick out all the elders here in this assembly and pick them all out and put them in one place that that was trivac group that came to the meeting every elder in chibak every respectable elder in chibak i love the elders i love them i'll do anything for them my dad is one of them in being a deacon they all gathered like this sat down and the tribal chief said you know why do we not have this many people when we have our tribal meetings i mean we had a full house so all they did was they told us uh experiences of you know the apparitions of mary their uh somebody getting healed from that apparitions you know those kind of stories that's all they could tell me was experiences you know what the healings that they had you know they received that holy communion and they got a healing or the holy water and they got a healing those kind of testimonies and that's all they could tell us and that by the end of the meeting they told us to go back to the catholic church and make our confessions and make things right and go back but i couldn't do it because i got a revelation i couldn't do it there was no way i was going to go back to the catholic church there was no way you know when god moved and from that day we had we had the community that had nothing to do with us from that day my wife in the beginning was the only one with wearing a skirt so you got to know the pressure that she was getting you know outwardly she's dressing different from everybody else my oldest daughter she was about 50 i don't know close to 15 somewhere around there she was the only little girl that was wearing a skirt with with my other niece so you got to know the pressure that we were getting from the community i mean they called you devil they call you demons you know they're they're persecuting you you know because of what you're standing for we did nothing and all we did was just we were the best people in the world but they're calling you know we're they're calling us demons they're calling us devils and uh so that one that went down for years uh but that wasn't gonna change you know a few of us that believed in the message that saw something in this message uh we did work in a couple of one other community that was about 20 miles away you know we traveled by snow machine to preach to the a little group in that village and i did that every sunday you know storm rain wind blizzard you know i went to that place and preached to that group uh my uncle henry my dad's older brother he must have been close to 100 years old with his wife sister clotilda they were the only ones that were the eldest members in that area that embraced the message and my auntie clotilla she would tell me you know if i die just throw my body into a trash can somewhere you know it's because my my spirit will be with him you know she would say you know that's she got to the point where she would just testify those things and say they embraced the message uh and there are four boys i think it was four boys three boys you know just remind your queen brother uh brother juan was just talking about mentioning noah my uncle henry was sitting there watching one of my ministry videos that they would they had and he just stood up and started pointing to the screen and said that's noah that's no you know those were i mean to me those were special times like peter said you know there are more precious than gold and you go through trials praise the lord more precious than gold you know just to realize everything that god has done put through us because if that pressure was not there we would have not been solid i really believe the persecution at that time gave us that strength to be able to stand against anything that was coming our way because that's that's what the bible that's the greatest thing for you is to go through trials that's what the prophet said that's the greatest thing for you is to go through test things you know we can say the greatest thing in my life is like i met my wife you know i i earned a few dollars more than before or i got the greatest job in the world and but the prophet told us the greatest thing that can happen to you is trials and we need to understand what that means to go through trials amen praise the lord in the in the book of exodus in chapter 14 the bible says and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you to show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace you know if you notice the way moses approached the people with the word and saying god is with us you know he had such faith i'm in such faith to where we got somebody who's going to fight for us you know and that's many of us you know we believe in many ways when we when the word of god comes to us i know god is with me and god is going to fight for me and everything he's going to work with me all the way through because i believe because i know he is real and he showed it to me he showed to me he spoke to me he made it real to me that god is real and moses said the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and verse 15 he said and the lord said unto moses why are for christ though unto me and here moses was just explaining to the people we have a god who fight for us and and moses said what are you crying for what is what is god telling moses you know if you notice the way god told moses he says speak unto the children of israel that they go forward in other words what is he saying you you've been commissioned you've been commissioned speak amen you know and here moses was just saying the lord's going to do it all for us you know we're leaning on him and and god comes along and rebukes them you know if we realize no i mean for being a young christian you know that's exactly where we stand we got such faith to where we got god with us god doing things for us and god doing all the work for us just like when we were little babies you know i got mom to take care of me i got that to provide for the house and he's taking care of everything but then as time goes along he says you're on your own i got i gave you abilities i get i gave you the ways to do it i gave you the word i commissioned you i gave you the authority to speak and go forward you know we we're a people that have come to the place we need to realize who we are you know you think about that wave shift it's ripe it's it's where it's supposed to be a wave sheath you know it's it's waving over to the to the this rest of the field that needs to be ripened but there's there's a way that we need to come to that place right and everything has to do with him we're leaning on him to come to that place and you know many times we're we're so caught up with works you know working for god you know doing things for god cleaning the church for god and you know it's just like for a preacher you know we're studying for god and you know we're you know we're spending time you know taking care of things for the church and we're you know we're so busy to do something for god that we forget to talk to him you know just like for me and my wife you know we you know i spent so much time at work and i i forget about my wife you know she's then spending time at home taking care of things at home and i'm too busy somewhere else and i forgot to have that relationship with my wife and we get too busy to do something for god that we forget to hear that still small voice because we're too busy too busy too busy doing the work not realizing that we we need that faith to know there's a god that we forget that we have faith that we can we have something that we don't see but we know that he's there that we forget that we're too busy with the things that we see in this world trying to make some money trying to make somebody happy we're trying to do something for something then we forget that there's a god so in other words good things could be bad you know good things could be bad i mean because we know that we have many preachers out there in the world the denominational world they have no idea who god is but they're so busy doing missionary work they're so busy doing something for god they're working for god but they never had that birth a birth that is something that we all need to realize we need that second birth a birth that brings you into the kingdom of god to the point where you can realize that you need to discern the body of jesus christ not just looking at the picture and say you know that's the body of jesus christ is right over here but then we forget where is he at where is he at you know how can i discern the body of jesus christ it's right here i i need to discern the body of jesus christ praise the lord a deity we talk about deity the last time i was here i think it was a deity in flesh amen praise the lord you know bro you know the bible says in revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcomes will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also am overcome and am i sat down with my with my father in his throne to him that overcomes there's got to be something that we need to overcome first right before we can sit with to sit with him in his throne he said now this is from the church age book now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how how no it's it's not what we are what we are to overcome it's not what we are to overcome you know so we can look at the giants and say that goliath i need to overcome this guy he says no it's not what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome how we overcome right praise the lord amen now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we are to overcome praise the lord i want to blow my nose and the microphone guy is going to it's not what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for what for for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at the scriptures which involve the lord jesus overwhelming overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of jesus by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that come you know corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word so all these had to do with the flesh all these have to do with your spirit and flesh everything about you all those are involved with something that you need to overcome praise the lord you know it would be so nice no i'm thinking it would be so nice just to do the works you know for him right just just to do things for me it would make it a whole whole lot easier praise the lord it will make it a whole lot easier for us as human beings with what we can see doing things with our hands what i see what i feel i mean it would be so easy but then to realize there's something that we need to realize with our sixth sense you know something that we cannot see it's gonna come by faith it's got nothing to do with our hands our works you know what what you do you know it's got something to do with you looking at something the the unseen you know you think about adam in the beginning adam uh he was a supreme ruler supreme authority in the beginning before the fall he had everything all under control everything was perfect he had a relationship with the father you know like the prophet said every evening he would go to church every evening cool of the evening he would go to church he would communicate with the father all was well everything was good he was obedient to the word obedient to the word now he was not a robot living in a garden of eden he was a man obeying the word of god he was following the father he was following what the father said he was not just there just because uh you know he was not created to do just good things only he was making choices praise the lord he was making choices to obey now he could choose not to obey as he goes along and which he did you know as time went along he he disobeyed the word i eve was tempted adam disobeyed right our lord jesus christ overcame by the word but he learned obedience he learned those things the greatest man ever that lived on this earth had to learn obedience he had to learn those things right and where does that place us if there was a greatest man ever on this earth the greatest one that lived in flesh had to learn obedience praise the lord you know i thank god for you know it's not me that have brought me this far it's the grace of god just to know that by the grace of god you know we're here you know back in the time you know when we were being persecuted by the village of chivac you know uh you know my my dad he's he's a deacon to to the end he was a deacon to the catholic church uh but he never said anything against the message the only thing that he ever said was if this is not of god it's going to disappear i mean he was he had wisdom you know this man he had wisdom to say that if this is not of god it's going to disappear and years go by he watched our little group you know start to grow he's watched a little group you know just doing something that he knew i didn't drink like everybody else and he knew he saw those things to the point where my mom you know when 20 years of people complaining about us he says why don't you complain about those drinkers out there [Music] i mean they're they're so there's so many out there you know chivak is a brother blatt might have told you all these things chivak is totally it's uh exposed to the world uh it's got you know wi-fi and cell phones and technology and you know it's running waters and all those things you know it's it's a comfortable place you know if you think about comfort of this age you know it's comfortable to live there you know it's not a place of dark teams and igloos and you know that's back years ago you know i don't even remember those things you know but but we're we're a place where everything is exposed to the world you know you you watch those young people they're watching they're watching those uh streets people in l.a you know there and then you start to watch them with hoodies on and they're that kind of walk you see i mean these these are little chubik eskimo boys you know they're walking around trying to impersonate those in l.a and listening to those rap musics and you know they're so exposed to the world and the thing is even for all of us here we need to be exposed to the message because every one of us we are in a place where we we need to know that from the time that we were in mom's tommy we were in a comfortable place when we were in there i mean the temperature was perfect the food was perfect everything was perfect in that environment everything was just until one day you come out to this world you feel the cold you feel the discomfort you start to get hungry you start to feel those things and your you're learning what it means to when you scream in a certain way you're going to get your food when you're screaming a certain way you're going to get this one here you know you you're learning these things to the point where you're grown up you got your own definition of what everything is so when somebody comes to you and asks you a question you give your definition by experience because many learn like like for us out in chiba you know we're being eskimos you know uh and i've come across people to where they would ask do you guys still live in the goose do you have top teams you know do you you know i've come across those kind of people you know they're that's all the information that they have of alaska you know their their perception is that's what the eskimo has igloos and dark teams you know that's their perception that's their that's what they learned that's their attachment i mean for me from that place i'm uh i'm the local alaskan i can tell you everything about code alaska is because i am from there you know i can tell you everything that we eat whatever we do the activities you know because i'm from there you know there was a guy there's some kids that i gathered with down in hawaii and they were gathered together they were asking questions and they asked us if we were living in igloos and i told them that yeah we live in two-story igloos and i told them yeah and one of them burned down so so they're so they're all listening and one of the boys you know there must have been about you know these boys age and was it electrical uh i just made me laugh you know just just to hear those kind of things those questions their perception of you know what nesca moyes you know the the thing is we're we have a message that have come to us and we came into the message with all these attachments attached to us i came into a message with catholicism doctrines and teachings you know that came with me but then i knew i didn't need those things because i got something new i got something new that i got to get into that you know just like paul said you know all these teachings i got is like dong i got to put them away and take this for for what it shows me but the thing is brother branham goes into him into this this revelation and he came out of the pentecostal world and many of us even for me i got into the pentecostal world to where we're so caught up with i need to get these gifts in my life i got to speak in tongues and i i need you know these gifts operating in my life and if i don't have these gifts operating then i don't have the holy spirit you know even i need to speak in tongues you know how come i didn't speak in tongues you know then brother brandon comes along it's got nothing to do with feelings it's got nothing to do with those things but that that you receive this message and you know this is the truth that's all you need and to understand that this message that you that have come to you don't require speaking in tongues don't require you know for you to pray and then it's suddenly a miracle happens or it don't require those things but all it needs is for you to have your eyes open to the place where you can confess the truth that you know from your heart that this is the truth if you walked into chibak just like brother juan told you you know he's been there he saw things he's been there he knows the environment he knows the atmosphere he he knows what's going on there all you have is word that's all you got he's been there but you have just the word right i'm a trooper i showed him around i showed him a few things and he shared those things with you see a prophet of god comes along and he showed you what he saw he told you by word this is what there is this is what he saw an experience that he had moses he says he saw he made this tabernacle in the wilderness because he saw it in the heavens the pattern the same pattern saint john goes into this very same place he saw the very same pattern that moses saw right because they've been there he shared that word to you praise the lord i mean brother man i'm talking about i think it might have been him but the story i hear there's a couple of boys there watching a ball game but there there's a fence and there's a little hole right up there and he puts one of the other one of the boys gets on the other boy to stand up and look through the hole and he's watching a game and he's telling the other boy down the bottom here this is what's going on hey they hit the ball all right he's watching he's sharing what he's seeing praise the lord how we are to overcome i mean you go back to the restoration of the word of god you know jesus told our disciples elijah shall first come and restore all things restore all things and you think back to the time of the uh the pentecostal age in the time of peter james john paul you know the outpouring of the holy spirit and you know you go back to that time you know they're they're speaking in tongues they're uh they look like drunks on the streets and they're they're experiencing those things but then when you think about it you go back to the beginning the first adam he had supreme control of all things he was walking with the father he communicated with the father like the prophet said every day communicating with the father every day second adam comes along he says i do nothing unless the father sows me [Music] you know you go through scriptures to where i'm just going to use these for my from what i can remember but you go through matthew matthew talks about some certain things that jesus did and he was just doing things because you know we know that's him jesus christ he can do anything that he wants but then luke comes along and he tells the same story about what jesus did in matthew but luke tells that he prayed first before the work he prayed first talked to the father first before the work and he says i do nothing unless the father shows me so that brings a question to me you know many times we say lord willing which lord are we talking about many times we do things and we approach god to ask him what we should do even though we've already decided i'm gonna do this praise the lord many times we approach god to decide what to do when we've already decided already what we're going to do now listen to the way in matthew chapter four you know brother branham saying a quick look at the scriptures which invade involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of these three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word you know if you notice those things everything uh that the devil showed jesus was perfectly exactly the way jesus would want things to happen okay just just follow my words i'm not saying that he would listen to the devil you know just follow my words because if you notice everything that the devil shared jesus was scripture it's all scripture right you know according to scripture the son of god would be you know he he's got power and authority to do all anything that he wants like turning the stone into bread right he's able to do it the devil knows the son of god can do those things if thou be the son of god turn these stones into bread now he's he's quoting scripture you know he's quoting scripture right praise the lord he's quoting scripture you know whatever everything that he's saying is scripture but jew what did jesus say i mean he's hungry he's tired he had 40 days of fasting i mean it's time to eat you know he's hungry you know he's tired he's got to eat and the devil knows that what did jesus say man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god it is it also says jesus said the devil comes along and tells you certain things he tells you lies but you can tell him and say well he's it's all so sad praise the lord [Music] so everything that we have in this life you know it's it's a battle it's a battle we're going through battles everything that we have in life the greatest enemy that we have is or us personally we are the we are the ones that we need to overcome we our personal selves our own lusts our own desires our own abilities our own everything about us we need to overcome that because my personal desire is to serve god but if i don't do it without him involved it's all in vain i need to have been involved with everything that i'm doing every decision i make i want to have him involved amen i mean we can go back to scriptures to where like ahab you know he approaches hezekiah i think it is that's i think i got the names right and he says you know these philistines philistines you know they have our land you know god gave it to us you know and since it's our land you know let's go and take them out of that i mean that sounds scriptural right but it's not according to the word praise the lord everything that we do we want to make sure it's according to the word of god amen praise the lord on the message on questions and answers he says now we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication on the anointed ones at the end time he says now notice the very day when this messenger now when he starts on but when he begins to declare the message his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the mystery is revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third poll was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it it is then in that day when this thing is to be take place that janus janice and jamborees the impersonators will appear again just like they did when moses appeared with the original word to say they appear to impersonate it just exactly right now you see that in matthew 24 the anointed ones praise the lord first pull second pull third pull the opening of those words amen see when you think about the first pull before i get into these things you know we were talking about attachments when you go when you when you go into this world you're attached with so many things you learn things and you bring pentecostal teachings into the message and even within the message you know we've come out from certain groups there are so many denominations within the message so many denominations within the message you know we can say yeah jesus came and he preached the word and out of it came for the methodists and the pentecostals and the presbyterians and the catholicism and the on and on and say well yeah that came from thou jesus from our jesus brother branham comes along and he preaches a message and then there comes along i don't have to name them i'm pretty sure you know names and they got their own denominations teachings their cretes and dogmas in other words they put a period at the end of their doctrine amen they put a period at the end of their doctrine you know it's it's an attachment that we came out of and we bring those attachments with us into the opening of the word we bring it with us and that becomes our interpretation of the word of god when he said we need to get rid of everything that's been taught to us and get into this open word praise the lord there's so many uh when i first came into the message and i i got involved with uh a group uh uh john martin was he was a the share of this group you know down in idaho and they got they have the church over and uh you know you don't mind me talking about these things brother over in uh eagle river right out of uh outside of anchorage alaska and i went to that place and uh i mean it was exciting to be among believers that's that's all i saw was believers billy paul came into that group and he testified and we had some exciting times and uh healing ministries and you know one of the brothers testified that there were demons coming out of the sick people and you know i mean it was exciting to see those kind of things happening but then as time goes along you know you realize there's different groups in the message and and that group had a had a i may call it a bishop for you know different groups and they couldn't do anything without that bishop approving it you know as time goes along we realize you know we need to get out of that place and you know just follow the word to the point where i realized i'm you know reluctantly you know i was chosen to be the pastor for the group reluctantly i didn't want to be a pastor but as time goes along you know the the name stuck to me the pastor and one of the things that i learned in that time was to learn to lean on him our lord jesus christ learning to lean on him because back in that time i i depended on a lot of ministry like brother lonnie jenkins and brother tim pruitt and brother berry coffee you know those brothers you know i call pillars in the message you know whenever i had questions i would give them a call and they would give me answers one of the things that i had a question on had marriage and divorce and i was working with a couple and i had some questions so i called her brother lonnie he gave me his answer and i was thinking maybe i called another brother so i called her brother tim he gave me a different answer and i called her brother i think it might have been ron peterson he gave me another different from those two i had five different answers where did it bring me on my knees i had to approach him for the answer what did he tell me i cannot lean on no man but him you see you know where i mean these these are respected men they that brother lonnie gami was perfect for that for that couple that they dealt with it was perfect for them what brother tim told me was perfect for that experience that he had it was not my my experience right so each one had their perfect reason why for that experience it was not the wrong answer it was the right answer for that particular experience so you know just to see those things you know coming to pass you know to realize i need to lean on god and my brother my brother-in-law he was my my lean on brother you know day god took him away from our group left me with no body to the point where i realized god is showing me that i need to lean on nobody but him until i learned then he came back you know god will do things to get you in line god will show you things to get you in line there's so many things that god has shown us to the point even to the even for me to realize you know a re reality of god when one night you know he visited our home i think i think it might have been it could have been a vision or dream i don't know you know i i'm not a i'm not a vivid dreamer you know it's every other dream is always faded and don't remember and but this dream or vision or whatever you may call it was so clear that i could just see him when i was lying down in bed he came a light came into the room and to the point where it brought fear to me i was i was in fear i covered myself in the blanket but that was not a good covering i took my wife and i took his arm and pulled him up right close to me but that wasn't even good enough you know just to realize god knows everything everything about me there's nothing that i can hide from god the reality of god working in my life and in trebek and everything that's going on you know it wasn't easy with all the persecutions and even to the point where i had to uh just make things right in chiba with the people that i dealt with the people that i knew that i had to make things right you know it would have destroyed my life you know just making those things right but it made things more perfect in making things right you know the things i had to work with my with even with my wife and i had to it could have destroyed our life but it just made things better it just made things better before i came into the message i was a rock and roller or or leader of a band my brother-in-law was a keyboard player my deacon in the church was a drummer before we heard the message we got to the point where we were becoming popular in that area you know the way we played you know we were we were pretty good my wife used to sing some of the songs back in those days and uh and that rock and roll spirit is a very bad spirit it's a very rebellious spirit it's a bad spirit and i you know and i was right in the middle of that spirit from drinking and drugs and you know you know just those things a really bad spirit so it brought a lot of things in life that would have destroyed my life in such a in such to the point where i mean totally destroy my life and my family that's when the message came into my life [Music] [Applause] and and the miracle is overnight i never touched a booze in my life from that time i never touched drugs i smoked cigarettes and chewed tobacco and all those were just gone overnight [Music] from that day the only thing that i wanted was i want to get to know more of the word i mean that's a miracle and i mean for me you know it's it's it's not for everybody but that was for me god was preparing me for the ministry when he took away everything i mean i was starting to make my own brew you know i was starting to do those things i was getting that bad but overnight god just took everything everything away my wife will tell you from that day i never touched those things i never even thought of using those things it just totally took him away by god's grace it had nothing to do with me it was god's grace god wanting to use me for ministry the way he took care of those things and and the thing that when god came into my life and i quit drinking smoking i had more calls than ever you know you want to come and party you wanna you wanna smoke people that never called me start calling me and says you know you want a drink you know that's the devil once you once the devil sees you walk away he's going to do everything he can to bring you back bring you back into that circle again he'll do everything you know my wife will give you testimonies too of her life my brother one of the brothers he used to be a just a daily drunk and people were afraid of him when he drank i mean just a regular old drunk uh you can't approach him you know you got to walk away away from him just to pass by him right now he's the most respected man in chivak when he heard the message that took that away became the one of the most respected men in chile what the word can do for you praise the lord you know it's been a it's it's been wonderful for us to to have been a part of this message but the thought that i had when i came here i was thinking uh you know it's it's uh it's not you trying to be a christian or to be like christ it's not you're trying to be a part of this body it's not trying to get there it's for you to recognize that you are that you are a body of jesus christ you are part of that body and not trying to be but that he's working with you to make you recognize that you are that you came from god and you're going back to god and that's exactly what he's doing today to make you recognize because you know when when i tried back in that time i was trying to be a you know a good guy i was trying to be but then i realized no that's not what he came the message you know he didn't bring the message to make you try to try to be better than bad you know he he wants you to recognize that you are the bride of jesus christ amen he's come to make you recognize that you are the word that you are the word a part of that word regardless of what the devil tells you regardless of all the mistakes you made regardless of everything that looks so bad in your life you know god is showing you that you're a part of that life you know i have a i have a son who back when he was 16 that's at least close to 20 years ago 15 more than 15 years ago he came out of our he walked out of our life he was 16 years old and got involved with the rowdiest boys in chibak the roadiest boys and that group has become the roadiest in chibak today they call it you know they they claim that they own chibak you know they own the cops they own you know things like that they're that routing he's gone through things that you don't want to see your family go through your voice but the thing is he's still my son when he comes wanting help i help him out he comes in drunk you know help him out as much as i can if some other drunk comes along i kick him out and call the cops but for this boy he's my son no matter how bad he is no matter how rowdy he is he's still my son that's me in the eyes of my father that's me i don't belong to nobody else but to my father one revelation that i had had to do with when i was rock and rolling back in that time when i when i realized when when i was playing the rock and roll up in the stage you know playing that electric guitar and singing those rock and roll songs my father in heaven is looking down and saying that's my son that's my son and here am i playing the rock and roll maybe high on drugs or something you know playing rock and roll but here's my father looking down and saying that's my son he was not looking at the flesh he was looking at that promised word amen no matter how bad i may have been alisa was that perfect seed inside inside this flesh and that's what he's been working with and that's the one that's becoming displayed today it's becoming displayed why because i'm feeding on the word i'm spending time being aware that i have a father that i can talk to every day in the tabernacle i'm going to close with this thought in a tabernacle in the wilderness when you go into the tabernacle the outside is open space and it's exposed to the world you know when it rains it gets wet when it's sunny it's you know you get dry and uh but it's on the outside but you go into the second court you know right within that is uh the the candles the seven candles and the the straw bread you know and the incense and the bible speaks of that incense where it has four kinds of plants that goes into that incense and and the those four plants they they have what they call the resin that comes out of the plant and that resin is the one that they collect and they prepare it to become an incense and they would take the fire from the altar the sacrificial altar they could take that fire and put it on the incense and it would be it would be a sweet smelling savor to our lord right and they would do that every single day they would burn it every single day and in revelations it talks about the sweet savor the prayers of the saints when the incense is burned it's the prayers of the saints so it didn't say saints of the old he just said saints saints so that's including you the saints and those four plants they would take the resin from the plant and they would prepare that would be something within the plant not the flower itself but it's within the plant something that comes from within and and that resin when they prepare it it's burned by the fire that came from god no other fire but from that fire that came from god they would put it on that incense and it would make the incense burn the incense doesn't burn by itself it's got to come from god creating that to burn so it'll smoke and that's a sweet smelling savor so every single day they would do that and that's our calling that it's when we approach him it's got to be from within it's got to be us the resin within the resin from the inside not just the man on the flesh on the outside it's something from within calling out to god why because he gave you that revelation that fire that fire makes it alive and you're approaching god every single day and you're speaking to god every single day not just something that you do because you're so busy that you forget to do something for god that's which is important and that's to approach god because we can get so busy with life work trying to make some money which is not sin it's not a sin to do missionary work it's not a sin you know to do something for the people but if we forget that there is him that we need to approach to talk to him to go into the holiest of foleys where you are you are you him just him and you only everything is cut off finances are cut off relationship are cut off everything is cut off your testings are cut off just just you and him just you and him in that in that closet just you and him and those when you come into the presence of god what does it do every little sin becomes a giant every little thing that's wrong becomes a giant where you just need to get rid of those things when you get into the presence of god what are you doing you're cleansing your life every single day okay the cool of the night brother i'm talking about adam in the cool of the night he walks with god he walks with the father every single day our lord jesus christ goes up to the mountain and prays before anything happens and if we were just to get to that point where we can go into the inside that tent just me and him alone with him in the closet just alone with him everything brother i'm talking about when the priest goes into that hole is the foliage and the curtain drops everything of the outside is shut off no sound no nothing just the priest and god praise the lord that's my desire to just to have that relationship with the father to be able to have that relationship with him every single day is that something that we all need is to have a closer walk with them to the point where that when you think about it it's going to require faith a revelation to go into a rapture but what's it going to take it's going to take faith and faith is something you cannot see it's something that is not your works it's not something that you do it's a faith that you know that there's a god that you can approach and have such a relationship with him praise the lord you know we shouldn't forget that we should be aware of that every single day i need time with him i need to get time alone with him every single day praise the lord if if you can take time to to spend a little time on your social media how about how about get social with our father for some time let's borrow it let's pray heavenly father lord what a mighty god we serve father we we

powerful than his message the life of a man because our life speaks louder than sometimes our words praise the lord praise the lord you you have to stay you have to stay the rambert andrews to know the kind of a man he is uh he's uh he's a man of uh of uh of great caliber he's a man that god has given grace and we thank the lord for that amen we thank the lord for that let's let's look at saint john chapter 6 jesus speaking right there amen that's verse 28 praise the lord the disciples seeing jesus seeing his ministry you know uh seeing the miracles that were happening you know and and and and sometimes that's the first thing that that that grabs our mind you know you come you get closer to the lord you hear of him answering prayers and you hear of him doing things in the life of people the first thing that grabbed our mind you know just like simon the sorcerer in the book of arts he wanted the miracle he saw those things happening i mean this man that's being paid magic and sorcery was never able to do those things so he asked the disciple how can i do this you know how can i do this he wanted to he wanted to purchase the power and and and and you see since i say this over and over because uh i've i went through that face myself you get exposed to the message of the hour you read you listen to the tapes it is so easy for you to get caught up in the supernatural you get caught up in the supernatural the works and and really don't meet the man it's so easy for to get caught up in the supernatural you want to produce those things you think about a man speaking to a wide board for the ball to be kind you know bumping into uh uh you know a beast net and saying oh i'm sorry for bumping into your net and then pretty soon you you you we have the tendency to want to to impersonate that in some sense says if god can do it and even even things that we read in the bible you know but we have to understand that uh those things were not produced by those people by themselves they came into a relationship you know they came into a relationship they grow into a relationship they never thought about it you know it was something like like i said jesus jesus never went about doing miracles he was living his normal life you know jesus was not a a kind of a miracle worker and say this service is going to be a healing service no he was just living his normal life it was normal for him to pray for the sake [Music] praise the lord it was normal for him to pray for the sake so yeah these disciples being attracted to jesus life and the miracle they said then they said unto him verse 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god you know what what can i really do so i can i you know i can i can be in you know serving the lord i can be in the message and you know and and and jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him he have sinned and sometimes it's difficult as easy as it sounds it's difficult praise the lord amen this is the work of god for you to believe the one that is more closer to you praise the lord amen this is the work of god how can a a wife or a husband grow in faith you have to believe that one that is close to you [Music] you have to believe that god plays a husband in your life or a wife in your life as all part of the work of god because believing the work of god believing whom he have seen it's easy to just stop it to the pulpit believing whom he have sent it's easy to just stop it at the prophet god send a prophet you have to believe him who whom god has sent but even the ones that god placed in the local church god sent them for you for your growth god sent them for your growth they are sitting in a local church for your growth is is all part of the work of god to bring you to maturity because that person will do something that you don't like praise the lord [Music] and then it will touch that area in your life that god need to work on that's the work of god we have to believe ourself we have to believe our children we have to believe our wives we have to believe our husband now when you start growing in that level of believing then now is going to put more trust and confidence in the god that you can see praise the lord you have to believe in a prophet a man that god has used in this generation for an age for a prophetic message you have to believe in your local pastor the lord now but you cannot grow to that level to believe in a man in another mortal man until you start believing in the ones in your closet environment the ones in your closet environment because that's the work of god we're talking about the work of god the work of god now what you do the one that god is doing god work the china that he will use to work on you christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham said let's read that praise the lord he says why do you hunger church why do you church it is the father trying to reveal his si his head is secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that you know that way down in your heart you are thirsting and hungering more for god you want to get closer to god praise the lord [Music] instead of instead of breaking through these barriers instead of pulling them apart pulling these curtains apart we stopped right there because of you know people attitude what the pastor said the way he looked at me praise the lord amen when you don't even realize i have a cross i might not be looking at you when you know that way down in your heart you are testing hungering is god's trying to reveal to you when you start having a burden in your heart you are having a desire is god trying to bring you in a more closer relationship [Music] praise the lord and just at that time there are a lot of things that might happen you know loved one by forsaken you know uh uh you might be down in your budget and and you need to put in some hours and and but it is at the same time in your heart you feeling like i need to get closer to god and humanly we are so easy to turn to the way of least resistance we are so easy to follow the path of least resistance but you see before the airplane can take up it needs enough wind in its way it needs to fix where the wind is hitting it and it got to hit that wind to get up in the air the plane does not go in the air on least resistance for you to get up in the lord you need to go behind barriers you need to fix it and don't make people your problem don't make people your problem praise the lord andrews god bless you take our greetings tell the people of shiva we
