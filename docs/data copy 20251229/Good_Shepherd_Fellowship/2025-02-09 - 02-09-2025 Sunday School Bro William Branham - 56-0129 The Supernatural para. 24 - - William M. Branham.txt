========================================

for [Music] in the Assembly of God Church amongst Pentecostal people now I've learned to love the Pentecostal people they're my brothers and sisters but many times find in our own race of Pentecost that sometimes our atmosphere becomes an emotion instead of a worship and that soon dies out and the members become one thing and another but if we could ever get a group of people together what would jel wine Holy Spirit atmosphere of sacredness and sincerity and worship and the men and women sitting in there are God conscious and know that the great omnipotence of God God is present ready to do all things without one Shadow of Doubt they even have an effect upon the unbelievers that's setting in their seat you can never come into that atmosphere without something happening I was preached here not long ago the tape recorders here the boys was with me they took a sermon on the hidden Life of Christ how to get into Christ and how that some people has ups and downs you can't there's a place you have to find the outer courts produce Mana sure many people are living right in that Mana they eat in the Mana but they don't live the right kind of a life they're up and down they have ins and outs and bad days and good days but you've met people that absolutely don't matter what the weather was or what the conditions was they're on our Housetop all the time he found that secret he's found an atmosphere to live in in the Old Testament how that the congregation was F from bread out of Heaven they live in three different atmospheres in the court in the of the manif and the Israelites eat Mana he eat the same Mana that did in every other place same Mana but remember that inside the courts in the ark was a place fixed where the the man never did get old elwi it got old it wouldn't last till 9:00 in the morning if you didn't grind it up into meal and make some cakes out of and eat it and we find out before the sun went down they were hungry if they didn't gather enough and that's what matter the people today they got the campground cramps they go to a Revival and have a great time the first thing you know a little after that before another revival can come along they're back in the world again a certain man wrote an article about me not long ago which perfectly all right I love him don't say that to be a hypocrite I said it because it's the truth John Church you Nazarene people man he said it wrote against Divine Healing he said one of their key man Mr brand said I've never met the man in my life and to think of a sensible man writing an article about a person he had never spoke to in his life that shows me something wrong our law says how can we judge a man without we hear him first he said I don't know a man never heard never seen him in my life but a a man come to me and told me that he was setting he wanted me to pray for him that he'd be healed of a prostrate trouble and he said I was heal one and said he told me the story he said I was sitting in a meeting and said uh way back in a balcony and said it's Mr brandom's meeting and said all at once I begin to feel a strange feeling come over me and said then the man turned around from where he was preaching and said the man sitting up there is so and so a certain man from a certain place and said he's praying that he'll be healed of a prostrate trouble and said if he'll only accept it and believe it now he can go home and be well he said something struck me I'll Never Felt anything like it in my life he said and for a solid Year my prostrates never bother me and he come on me again Mr Church said that don't you see that shows that Mr Brandon is fault if God healed a man he'd heal him for life I thought Mr Church how many times you come up on the silver Hills Campground and get all those nazarin Sanctified this year next year you sanctify another bunch of them maybe didn't have it to begin with then God wouldn't be real see Divine Healing and sanctification and the powers of God is as long as your faith lasts in it when your faith fails then your experience is gone it's faith that way simply upon the finished works of Christ the calvary you're Sanctified is as long as your testimony is right as long as you live a Sanctified life and believe that God sanctifies you you're Sanctified count it all to his grace and his Merit and as long as you can accept healing and believe your healing and and goow on believe it like that you'll be healed as long as you believe it and you start doubting it and you take a a man setting here this morning it's not a bit sick and let him begin to get in his heart believing he is sick they'll pack him out of the building as your faith is so be it unto you that's not Christian Science I'm not meaning mind over matter but you see the thing of it is is the atmosphere that you live in now this man that we're going to speak of for just a few moments then I want to give you a testimony this man Elijah the great prophet was a man who lived in that constant atmosphere he was a car man of Nazarite birth all gifts and callings are without repentance it's nothing you can't make one hair black or white you can't add one pupic to your statue we only have carnal impersonation when we try to impersonate something that God hasn't made us if we try to do something that God hasn't called us to do we'll be a total failure in doing it if man would try to make himself woman woman man how would you do it I met that woman that was they supposed to have the surgical test and be made or manm made a woman whatever it was and Italy and Rome that she was a disgrace to being a woman drunk as she could be walking up and down the street or a harvest site you ever seen notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be anything else is an impersonation therefore if your conversion is on because you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you're only playing the part of a hypocrite until Christ has actually come to your life and changed you and brought you into an atmosphere that's the different that's the reason we go through so many different forms and saying they have to do this Jesus said he that Hearth my word and believeth on him and sent me has everlasting life not a make belief it's absolutely something that's happened and in conversion of the heart that changed you and brought you into another realm men are misunderstood Christian women men boys and girls are misunderstood who live in those places because it's contrary to the Natural run of life among people of the world I'm sure we all want to live in that atmosphere look the people who eat the Mana out here on the ground was eaten the same Mana that the high priest eat in under the shakina glory but this Mana withered away out on the ground but that in the hi place never did wither a away it lasted through the spans of years and a man who walked in there and the high priest went in beyond that Veil that Veil that separated the Hol from the holiest of holies when he walked in there the veil dropped behind him that man he it was even soundproof he didn't he shut off from all the world and the surroundings he know nothing in there but the living in the presence of God and a man or a woman that ever walked into that CH kind of Glory of God the whole world shut off behind him no matter what the devil says you don't pay any attention to it and he's living in a different her atmosphere he lived in there where they put Aaron's rod and it was nothing but an old Dead stick off of an olive tree but once laid in the presence of God it yielded what it was supposed to be in the beginning and one night time blooded blossomed and brought arm that's the same way that an unbeliever a sinner is ever laid in the presence of almighty God or the influence of the Holy Spirit he becomes a new creature right then his life becomes fruitful Fresh Life comes in and he yields what he was supposed to be a Son of God we were tuck off of the tree so was that Olive bran he would talk off of the tree about Sinners and and lukewarm Church become dry sck with some kind of a memory that sometime there was a supernatural of God in the past they had life and way back there but if you believe and lay in his presence it'll produce the same thing to you you will realize that you were born Sons and Daughters of God and will yield the fruit of the spirit but you can't do it out there in the court you got to do it in here on the inside hit away the man out the course he walked by daylight some days it was like this rain other days it was sun and Shine the night time it be dark and stormy he had is ups and downs that's the way you see people oh they say we're eating the good man of God that's right but where are they living they're living out there eating it in an atmosphere that they should not eat it in the next man he had another light as the mat the all it was lit by seven golden candles take some little lamps and sometimes them lamps burnt low and they smoked up the chimneys you know how it lamp does smokes and goes out and a man who comes to the place where he comes into the church out of the courts out of a just a lukewarm church member and comes up to live a pretty good life in Christ he separates things but he's still living under lights that will get demm and smoke up and artificial life but when he once walked in behind that holiest of holies walks into the presence of God and the veil falls behind him there's a pot Mana where he can eat every day every hour of the week that's where he's living in the Shina Glory where in the inlock wings of the Turan the great Pillar of Fire in the China rested there and he's living under there he can't be nothing but a real January Christian anytime atmosphere many and women who live in there are misunderstood you see it they become peculiar they don't hear the things of the world if they do they don't pay attention to it they just move on God never put that in there for nothing God never come for just any halfhazard way prayer is not a uh perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God pray is not get down shut your eyes and think about your washing or your work you're doing and say Lord help me and John he Miss Jones and so well that's not prayer that's repeating some words the prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you're moving to them in the deepest of sincerity first is the worship oh Jehovah how I love you is it it then after the worship of prayer then you come with the sincere heart asking if ye abide in me not go out behind the curtains in the world today and run around try to get back in the curtains tonight if ye abide in me my words abide in you otherwise if you're like Aaron's rock that's pulled up to the kind of Glory by the golden pot of Mana where you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yeling abide if you abide in me my words abide in you then ask what you will it'll be given to you to see your failures of the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist the Baptist and all it's a failing to that abiding grace of God so night you'll shou and clap your hands and dance in the AIS speaking tongues that's gift gift is no good unless you're abiding in the sh Glory those things are fine I have nothing to say against them they of God shouting and blessing God wonderful speaking in tongues or translation of tongues or I mean interpretation the tong it's the same but uh and all these other things Gifts of healing prophecies all these things are marvelous but they're no good they're not fruitful they can't yield the right unless you're living in the presence of the Shan the atmosphere around is Godly that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to these things because you'd go out here and call a blessing over something God had cursed or or curse something God had blessed it's an abiding presence to know the will of God then don't look what the world's going to say about it's what God thinks about you then you're living in his presence in the days of this prophecy a prophet rather God has never been without a voice or a mouthpiece somewhere on the earth and Elijah was his mouthy and as far as I know during the time of the backsliding of Israel they always got cold and farmer and backslid because it goes to show Friends that yeah we have no continu in city but we're seeking one to come not long go I stood look I used to be at Pug as you know fights I won 15 professional fights not bragging I'm ashamed of it but 15 professional fights through out losing single one nine of them Knockouts I had my picture there when I in my very best muscles over me and black shaggy hair hanging around my neck and I looked and I thought my little girl come in and see my picture sitting in the room she said daddy you don't look like you used to sure not oh yeah we have no continuing City this Mortal body is fading away where used to be strong old age fat begins to slip in I once remember of a great tree that he used to stand by his great shirtly branches I said it'll live forever and today it's a snag I stood not long ago in Rome where once rule the world and there that great city has now become nothing but you'd have to dig 30 ft feet under the Earth to find the ruins of it now one of the weakest degraded nations in the world and not even self-supporting I stood in Athens Greece where another great Empire once stood and there's not even hardly a symbol of that Empire left I stood in the Cairo Egypt where Egypt once known and rule the world and the St of pharaoh and there nothing l but the sinks and a few of the pyramides spanding as relic of the once great worldwide Empire brother and sister our Great America and our great economy that we have is rottening one of the foundations and Someday My Feet in the making right now shall lay in the ruins and you young men today you young women what's the beauty youth the bless of the young sheep the Folly of the young heart but one day will mold Y in a graveyard somewhere why because all Mortal has to give away to immortality every nation has to fall because there's coming a nation that will not be rule by man but by Christ these things fall Israel fell and it fall or just before it fall this great T great prophet raise which was a fanatic among the people but he lived in an atmosphere that he was constantly in the presence of God and he served God away to himself almost like an isolationist and I can imagine the people talking about him I can imagine saying you believe that story about the bird seeding him up there you believe all these different things in the days of Noah you believe the rain Story how it's going to come water down out of that fanatic but he lived enter the atmospheres of God and not of man and then when it come time there was a the syrians came over and took a little girl over into their nation and the great Chief captain of the army the Bible said he was a mighty man but he was a laer out in these this world today right here in Owensboro Kentucky there's man of great influence in your city here I do not know them but a city of this science could not yield hardly unless it would be a modern Sodom without having man of influence but it depends on where they let this influence dwell at what kind of life it produces if it's under politics which I can't say anything about him we need politics and so forth but whatever he is if he lets his of this influence lay in the right atmosphere you are to lay in the presence of God notice this na was a great fellow but he was a Le there's so many people today even I'm sad to say but even in the pit this great man but listens to man's theology instead of staying in the presence of God and still a leper having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof influential speaker forceful but still never knows what it is to be born again the AR of believe in the Supernatural and cannot understand it and except they come into the kingdom of God you'll explain it way through reasonings every time or he's never lived in this atmosphere but a man ever comes Mar he has to become a son and daughter of God and his nature is like God who believes the supernatural so they had a little girl there and I want to show you the force of the testimony of a child who lived in a nation or perhaps a family who was under the influence of God she loved her master and her mes so when she seen Nam probably a good-hearted good-natured man as far as we know according the history Elijah had never healed a man with Leprosy there had never been a lepr case heal in his days but the little girl being raised and brought up under the influence over in Israel get an alien she was conducting herself as a believer and that's the way we should do all the time is conduct ourselves no matter what our position is conduct ourselves as Believers ready at all times to give an answer for the hope that lies within you you see it here's some kind of go down in the South the Germans or the Dutch brought over the Dutch colonies over to America Negroes Out of Africa and sold them in the southern states for slav and they become personal property to the slave owner and they work at the calls of the days and their cars over them from whips and sometimes unkind Masters and they were burdened and away from home many times they wouldn't want to work and they would make them and force them to work and on a certain Plantation there was a great owner who owned many hundreds slaves two or 300 slaves on this great Plantation you buy St slaves and one day a buyer came by he said I would like to buy from you that certain slave that I watched him in his conduct so he walked straight you never have to whip him said he's always willing and standing ready to do anything he said he seems to be such a gallant person said perhaps you've made him the boss over the rest of him he said no he's just a slave said maybe you feed him a little better what makes him act different so no he eats with the rest of them so what makes him act different here it is Breen so no I wondered myself what made him always with his chin up test out ready any time never dropy never moping but I learned that he is the son of the king of the tribe though he's a alen though he's away from home still he conducts himself knowing this that he's the son of the king he keeps the morale the L of him high for he knows he's a son how much that ought to be to the Christian church this morning and while tell them no matter what other man do and what those do profess Christi does we must walk as Sons and Daughters of the king our morale should be wonderful we should never act as the world or live with the world we should keep our courage High knowing this that we are aliens we don't care about the world and what they think we are aliens pilgrims and strangers but someday we're going home [Music]
