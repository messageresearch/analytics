Our Lord and our Savior Jesus, we thank you so much for this moment. It's always a glorious moment to come before your throne of grace because that is where we belong. We have spent all our time chasing dreams, chasing the shadows of life and we never get tired when we are out there. The only time we are weary and tired is when we come before you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we pray have mercy upon our souls, Father. Have mercy upon our souls. For if we truly belong, Father, it will be a time of joy and gladness to come before you that for us it will be a way of life, not a burden. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be begged to. Wonderful Jesus, what a great and mighty God you are. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We thank you so much. &gt;&gt; For our voices that have risen before you in songs of praise, thank you Lord for being in our midst this moment. &gt;&gt; For you have said in your word, what two or three are gathered in your name, there you are in their midst. And you are here this morning &gt;&gt; because your word is true. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. We are so grateful that you have preserved our lives and have preserved our souls unto thee. Have mercy upon us, Father. Forgive us of all our sins and of all our iniquities. Forgive us of all our stubbornness and our foolish ways and our choices. Lord have mercy. Grant us all a closer walk with thee. And let us walk before thee, Father, and never miss any step before you. The steps of the righteous are ordered of you. Let every step we take be ordered of you. &gt;&gt; Touch every heart this morning in a very special way. You alone know &gt;&gt; what is on the hearts of your children. I have no idea. &gt;&gt; Father, come down. Take your word off my lips and place it where it belongs in the lives of your children. &gt;&gt; That as many of us that have come would never leave your presence the same way. &gt;&gt; Some of the saints are not here in our midst. Wherever they are, we pray be with them. Those that are following the service online, Father, for one reason or the other, we pray may your grace be extended to them this moment. &gt;&gt; Your servant, Father, oh God, would be coming sometime in the course of this week. We pray that you will be with him as he makes his way back home. We pray that you will send your holy angels to meet him wherever he is and escort him safely into our midst to the glory of your holy name. And we know also, Father, the Ingongos are not in our midst. They are troubled. Wherever they are, Father, be with them. And Father, we pray that when their journey is over, you bring them safely back home. Also, Brother Ben has asked for prayers for his brother Joel. whoever he is and wherever he is and whatever it is that he's going through, you know all about it. We lift him before you, Father, as a church of the living God. And we pray that you would minister unto him, Father, this moment, Father, whatever the need be in his life. Minister unto him accordingly in Jesus name. And let him know that there is a God who answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. As many of us have gathered, Father, oh God, we open our hearts before you this morning. Let there be a highway, Father, oh God, this moment from your throne, Father, straight into every single soul. And we pray that you would minister unto us. Praise the Lord. Thank you, dear Lord Jesus. We are so grateful that you've heard and answered our prayers this morning in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, saints. God bless you, brother Lawrence. We give God the glory, Sister Naomi, says Joy. God bless you. And uh that'll be all for the song service for now. And uh while we are still standing, if we can open our Bibles to the book of John. God bless you all saints for coming &gt;&gt; and whatever your heart desires are. I pray that the almighty God would minister to you and grant your heart request. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. John 3 1-7. John 3 1-7. I read There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Verse six, that which is born of the flesh is flesh, &gt;&gt; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Shall we be seated? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My theme this morning is ye must be born again. Ye must be born again. We all have our experiences with God. Whether you came by way of dream, whether you came by way of a vision, whether somebody invited you for the first time, whether you were just walking by the road and the spirit of God picked you up, whichever way it was, we have all had our experience while we are here. As wonderful as some may be and as simple as others may be, it doesn't make one more superior to the other. &gt;&gt; Because it is God who is doing the calling. &gt;&gt; It is God who is behind it. It's not a a man's work. You are not seated here because you like it. Something is driving you. That is why you are here. As a matter of fact, some have come to a place in their lives with a lot of questions and some maybe have reached a point of giving up. But before you are aware, you are in the next service. It is God's doing and not a man's doing. &gt;&gt; Some of us have been ordained onto this message. Forget of what people say about the prophet and what people say about the message. Some of us have been ordained onto this message to believe what we believe. It doesn't matter what happens. We are not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been ordained onto this message. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I have shared that story time and again how I came to this message. that when I heard the word, I went back and told my Muslim friend, we were roommates. I said, "Muhammad, all my years I have been looking for something, but I have found it." &gt;&gt; Thank God he didn't ask me what it was. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I knew I had found it, &gt;&gt; but I couldn't explain what it was. &gt;&gt; If the prophet was in error, Some of us have been ordained &gt;&gt; to believe that error. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And thank God it is the truth of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; We have not come to test the waters. &gt;&gt; We have not come to test the waters. We have not come to see how good is going to be or how bad is going to be. &gt;&gt; No, we are here to stay for life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have not believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Kindly deise tables. &gt;&gt; What we have believed is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have come to show our appreciation to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is a good thing &gt;&gt; and we will continue to come till we come no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows when the last day is going to be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are closer today &gt;&gt; than we were yesterday. &gt;&gt; That is sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But before then, ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He must be born again. And if there was a time in the history of the church of the living God that we ought to emphasize this, it is now. &gt;&gt; Because we are closer to the end more than ever before. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; We have heard of wars &gt;&gt; and rumors of wars. Nations have risen up against nations. If you want to start counting them in our day and age, we are going to take 10 minutes of our time away. But nations have risen against nations. The Bible says that in the end time knowledge shall increase. Indeed, knowledge has increased so much till when I sit down and I begin to think I don't know what the next thing is going to be because knowledge has increased so much. All of us are witnesses to AI revolution. The race has just begun and more than 100 thousands have lost their jobs already. Why? Because machines are taking the jobs away from humans. &gt;&gt; In 50 years from now, if Christ carries, we will be gone. &gt;&gt; Those that will be here, I don't know how life is going to be. &gt;&gt; Seek God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seek God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Have a relationship with God now. &gt;&gt; That things are good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That in the days of trouble, &gt;&gt; you know where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowledge has abound in the end time. Knowledge shall abound. Knowledge has abound &gt;&gt; without a question. There are earthquakes in diverse places, not only on land, but even in the sea. The first time I ever heard of tsunami was when it happened in the Philistines and I think over 200,000 people lost their lives when the sea waters just over invaded the land and people just in a matter of time lost their lives. I believe in a deathbed repentance because the prophet of God talks about it. &gt;&gt; But don't wait for one. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for one. It may never come your way. &gt;&gt; Now that you are hearing the word of God, now that you are hearing the voice of God, if there is anything to make right, make it right with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If a man should gain the whole world and lose his very own soul, what has he gained? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All is vanity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have come to the end of the road. I look at it and I tell myself that the church of the living God has come to a cordisac &gt;&gt; and a cordisac is just the end of the road. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Seven church ages were ordained to the gentile church. We are in the seventh church age. There is no more church coming after this. It is the last. &gt;&gt; There were seven messengers. &gt;&gt; One is to a church age. The last brother has come and gone. &gt;&gt; There is no more prophet coming after him. &gt;&gt; We are at the very end. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; At the very end, &gt;&gt; any day &gt;&gt; could be that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. When King Nebula saw that vision, that dream, the head of gold, the breast and the arms of silver, the stomach and the ties of bronze, the the the the legs of iron, and the the feet iron mixed with clay. Talking about the Gentile kingdoms. We are not here anymore. &gt;&gt; We are not here. We are not here. &gt;&gt; We are not even in the legs. The church is in the feet. The feet iron mixed with clay. Now when you take the body of a man and you start from the head coming down and you get to the feet, where else do you have to go? That is how far you can go. That is how far the church of the living God has come. We are at a place where that stone was healed without a hand and it came and crashed the image on the feet. Praise the Lord. That is where we are. Everything is pointing to the end. Everything is pointing to the end. Any spirit that will tell you there is time is not the spirit of God. The spirit of God would tell you that time is running out. &gt;&gt; And time is not only running out, but time has run out. &gt;&gt; There is a song that says Israel is awakening. &gt;&gt; Proudly at the time the song was composed. Yes, Israel was awakening. Israel is wide awake now. I believe if the author was going to recompose that song, he will change that line. &gt;&gt; Israel is wide awake now. &gt;&gt; Everything is pointing to the end. &gt;&gt; If there was any time, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; that men should seek the face of God, men should mean more business with God. If there was any time we have to seek the Holy Ghost more than ever before, if there was any time we have to put food aside and have time to fast and just praise the Lord, it is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't fast because there is no food in the house. &gt;&gt; Elsewhere, when there is no food, people will fast. But it becomes more difficult &gt;&gt; when you have a lot &gt;&gt; on your dining table, you have a lot on the center island, you have a lot in the refrigerator that everywhere you turn, the food is calling you. And then you want to have time to just say no to food and to seek the face of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if it happens to be in your comfort zone when you just pass by maybe to go to the restroom and you see something, if God doesn't help you, that's the end of the fast. If there was a time that we should be talking about the Holy Ghost baptism, &gt;&gt; he must praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He must be born again. brother told a story in Vancouver, British island, British Columbia of a bicycle race that they were going to give a prize, a swing bike was the prize to anybody that would win it. and they were supposed to ride their bicycle on a 12 in wide um trailer, whatever you want to call it, over 100 yards. And then the real bike bike riders just came. He said there were some that will go grocery shopping for their mothers, take the groceries, put them under their arm, and then they will ride back home without even holding the steering. That was how good they were. And so when they came, oh, every one of them knew they were going to win the race. And then this one will start and then drop. This one will start and drop. This one will start and drop. But there was an old CC boy as the prophet of God would call a mama's boy who was just standing. Nobody gave him a chance. But he was standing and he was looking at them and he realized the mistake they were making. &gt;&gt; So when it got to his time and he jumped on the bike, he just went straight and then he won the race. Brother said he did not even wobble and when he won the race the people just came around. How did you manage? How did you make it? And he said, "When you guys were having your turn, I was just watching and I saw your mistakes." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, just imagine it. &gt;&gt; He saw their mistakes. It's just amazing &gt;&gt; that we Christians, we see people doing the wrong things. We see their mistakes and instead of advising ourselves, using that to advise ourselves, we seek to be like them. &gt;&gt; We seek to be like them. &gt;&gt; We fall for their rottiness. &gt;&gt; We fall because, oh, he's my brother. We believe the same thing. He has messed up. Oh, I can also mess up. &gt;&gt; No. Instead of using that to advise yourself, &gt;&gt; instead of using that to learn a lesson, &gt;&gt; but when he look at, he learned a lesson from it. And they asked him, "What was it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "When you guys were on the bicycle, you were looking down." &gt;&gt; But when I took my turn, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I looked to the end and I held steady. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He looked at the end &gt;&gt; and he held &gt;&gt; steady. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; I pray God to help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we shall not look at our present dangers, &gt;&gt; but we shall keep our eyes &gt;&gt; to the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we shall not be bothered by the present circumstances &gt;&gt; of our time. We shall keep our eyes on the end &gt;&gt; that we shall not be bothered by our health problems. Whatever that may be, &gt;&gt; we shall not be bothered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By what is going on in our lives, &gt;&gt; we shall keep our eyes to the end. &gt;&gt; And keep steady. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep steady. If the time has not gotten rough yet, &gt;&gt; rougher times are going to come. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on him. &gt;&gt; So long as your eyes are on him, &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He is going to see you through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself. &gt;&gt; You are a failure to begin with. &gt;&gt; I am a failure to begin with. Keep your eyes on him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are we talking about this morning? &gt;&gt; Ye must. Ye must. You must be born again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. You must I was at work one time and a phrase came to me and the phrase goes born again with emphasis on the word again. It was so good I started following it but I got lost and then I just went about my business and as a matter of fact I forgot of it. I don't know whether it was the following week but sometime not too long after that I was working again and then the same phrase comes again. born again again with the emphasis on the word again. And then I got excited because the first time it came, I took something. So when it came again, I started following the trail. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I didn't go too far and I left it. I think it happened three, four or five times. I'm not sure. So the last time I said no I have to sit and look at this. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I sat and by the grace of God I saw something which has led us this way. It was so good. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray God I don't ruin it. &gt;&gt; If I ruin it, blame it on me. If it goes well, give the glory to God. &gt;&gt; I hope I don't ruin it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. Ye must means you must. &gt;&gt; When the word must is used, &gt;&gt; it leaves you with no option. It doesn't seek your opinion. &gt;&gt; It doesn't ask of your contribution. &gt;&gt; You must praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must have that in mind. Ye must. It is of absolute necessity. Of absolute necessity. You either do it or you do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, what does it take to make a Christian life? The prophet of God speaking. Now, I want you to know this. In the beginning, when God our father looked over this bleak earth and it wasn't nothing but one great big ball of water and God sent the Holy Spirit to the earth, the logos that went out of God and it began to brood over the earth. Now the word brood means to make love. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Or just like the dove to cool and the great Holy Spirit over the earth as a mental picture. Just trying to give us a mental picture of what that looks like. Sorry. I've been trying dealing with some little cold here and there. Uh yeah, I just make sure I wash my hands and um I put uh how do you call it? Sanitizer before my Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope you're not seeing it. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now the word brood means to make love or just like the dove to cool and the great holy spirit over the earth as a mental picture. We are going to make it like wings with with his great wings around the earth brooding over it making love cooling. Come, come. &gt;&gt; The father has ordained you. Come. I'm coming to perform what the father's word has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this so in? The prophet of God is asking. Is this so? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have come to manifest what the father has spoken. &gt;&gt; Brood. And after a while, there begin to come some petroleum moving across the earth and a little bit of this and that and a little instantly comes up in the earth. What brought it? The friend of God said the holy spirit brooden. Then come along the Dalia and the Aalia and other bush. Then along come the vegetation. The Holy Spirit brooding. &gt;&gt; Then along came after the vegetation came the trees then the plants. Then after a while bears began to fly from the dust of the earth. The Holy Spirit brooding them together and sent them into the air. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then along came the animal life. The Holy Spirit brooding. Then what happened? Along came human life. All of our bodies was all laying right here on earth at that day. If we come from the earth and we do and our bodies are made by the earth. So the prophet of God was just trying to lay down the order of things. But I want us to take a step back and go to Genesis 126. Genesis 126. Genesis 6. Genesis 1:26 and I read, "And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Verse 27. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and the man he created was a spirit man. &gt;&gt; Keep that because we are coming back to it. Now in the garden there were two trees. In the midst of the garden were two trees. The tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life was Christ. &gt;&gt; And man was supposed to eat from the tree of life and live forever. &gt;&gt; But man using his right &gt;&gt; to choose. &gt;&gt; Wow. his right to a free moral agency. &gt;&gt; Men rather chose to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. When you read from the scriptures that the Bible says he came to his own and his own received him not. In other words, he was rejected. You will think that it was just the children of Israel that rejected him. &gt;&gt; But long before he was rejected, right in the garden, he was rejected. &gt;&gt; The tree of life was Christ in the midst of the garden. They rejected him and instead they ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And that's why the whole world is in the messages in we are in today. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Christ was the rejected was rejected right in the garden. The Holy Spirit is Christ. Suffice it to say that the Holy Spirit was rejected. Now, brother said that the Holy Spirit has never left the earth. &gt;&gt; He's always been around. In the message 5510001, expectation, your Holy Spirit never left the earth. The Holy Spirit has never left the earth. Remember the Holy Spirit was breathing over the earth and cooling cooing coo everything every living thing into existence. The Holy Spirit in the midst of the garden, the tree of life, rejected right there and then, but still he did not live. And when you read Genesis 3:22, if we can just take that real quick, you can just listen. Genesis 3:22. Genesis 3:22. And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil, and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever." Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. Verse 24. So he drove out the man, and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims and flaming sword which turn every way to keep the way of the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Man was kicked out of the garden. He was sent packing out of the garden. But God did not take his holy spirit away. He sent cherubims and flaming s to keep the way of the tree of life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit has always been around. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was the Holy Spirit in Moses when he stood before Pharaoh and he said, "Let my people go." And then he called place upon place because no man could do that. It was the Holy Spirit in Joshua when he spoke to the sun and the moon and the thought. &gt;&gt; No man could do that. When he spoke to the moon and the sun, I believe they heard the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The voice that created them, the voice that brought them into being. When they heard that voice, they said, "Oh, our creator has spoken." They had no choice but to obey. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was God, the Holy Spirit in Joshua. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God &gt;&gt; in Elijah &gt;&gt; when he said there would not be rain or deal until I called for it. &gt;&gt; No man could do that. &gt;&gt; It was God in something. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he was just one tiny man. But any time the spirit of God came upon him, he was a different character. It was the Holy Spirit at work. &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Spirit in the prophets. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit has been working. We just come do exploits, take a man, work with him. He doesn't come in to dwell to stay because men had sinned. Man was supposed to eat of that tree of life and to live forever. But man chose to eat the tree of death. Death set in So even though the Holy Spirit would come down and do exploits, come down and work in men, but he wouldn't come in the man and stay or reside. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit has always been around [Music] Now things are going to change that at the Jordan When the Lord Jesus was being baptized by John the Baptist, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost came down like a dove &gt;&gt; to dwell in the man Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that has always been around. The Holy Spirit that was always working in man but would not dwell in. Now at the baptism of the Lord Jesus, here comes the Holy Ghost coming down. And then the Holy Ghost just came down. And there was a voice that spoke from heaven. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost in the Lord Jesus that spoke with the authority that he spoke. &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost in the Lord Jesus healing the sick and performing all diverse miracles. It was the Holy Ghost in him &gt;&gt; because he said I do nothing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But what the father shows me. &gt;&gt; It was the father in him and the father is the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; It was the holy ghost in him that raised the dead back to life. When he stood at Lazarus's grave and he called Lazarus, &gt;&gt; Lazarus heard the name of the father. He heard the voice of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that day is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we shall gather together by his throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And hear the voice of God, &gt;&gt; we would know, oh, I have known this voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You would know that was not the first time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will know that oh I have done this voice all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Lazarus heard that voice, &gt;&gt; oh my master has spoken. He has called Lazarus come out. It was the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the father in him that was doing all the miracles. John 3:3 The Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; except a man be born again." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again. Underline that. Now then he went on to ask, can a man go back into his mother's womb the second time and be born again? Except a man be born again. Now in this flesh, in this flesh there is no again &gt;&gt; in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; From glory We have stepped in this flesh &gt;&gt; and we are going to live in this flesh only once &gt;&gt; and we are going to step out of it &gt;&gt; in this flesh. there isn't again. It is a one-time experience in this flesh. The new birth which is the Holy Ghost baptism is not consecutive to this flesh. &gt;&gt; You cannot be born again in this flesh. The Lord Jesus in Nazareth said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit &gt;&gt; is spirit. Nicodemus was trying to confuse the two. &gt;&gt; He had to just separate them. &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. Praise the Lord. Now the word again means once more. Praise the Lord. Is used to indicate that something is repeated or returned to its previous state. &gt;&gt; How many are follow? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word again means once more. Something has repeated. In other words, it is not happening for the first time. It must have happened before else the word again would not be applied. If it has not happened before, the word again would not be applied. &gt;&gt; So it's happened before. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was driving with Emmanuel and Godfield. They were behind that was in my old bone shaker that um that truck that forerunner we were driving on um not bus lake somewhere there getting to 610 and um I was just behind there was traffic and before I was aware I was getting so close to the other car because the light was on and I hit my brake and pretty much they just I mean everybody Somebody almost jumped out of the car and the man was behind. He said, "Not again, Dad." I said, "Oh, when it comes to life that there's no small. &gt;&gt; Not again, Dad. That means it wasn't happening for the first time. That means it happened before. &gt;&gt; Apparently, I don't keep records, but he didn't forget. So, anytime you hear the word again, that means it's not the first time. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to your house again. &gt;&gt; That means I've been there before. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we go to that uh joint? That means we have been there before. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This means a lot. &gt;&gt; This is where the Holy Spirit just grabbed my attention. That's why I'm emphasizing on this and I don't know how else I can emphasize on it more than I'm doing. Else I would. So keep that in mind. So in other words, it is an experience that is returning you &gt;&gt; to a previous state. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is returning you to a previous state. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So what does it mean to be born again? Now the new birth is the spirit of God in your soul. So to be born again is an experience that is bringing you back to life again. &gt;&gt; He is the tree of life &gt;&gt; which man was supposed to eat and live forever &gt;&gt; but instead men chose to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. That was where death set in. &gt;&gt; Man was given the choice. Choose between life and death and men chose death &gt;&gt; because the very day you eat of it, that day you shall die. &gt;&gt; Men chose death &gt;&gt; and they died. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, as we said a while ago, in the beginning, God said, "Let us make man in our own image." So, God created man. He was a spirit man. The man was created full of life. He had the life of God running through his veins. &gt;&gt; The spirit man had the dearly of God. &gt;&gt; Life of his life, spirit of his spirit, born of his bone, flesh of his flesh. He was the spirit man that was full of life. He was eternal as much as God was eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man was fully aware of himself and his God when he was created, he was a mini God, vested with power and authority. So much so that even when God placed him in the flesh, that did not change. that he could just go to bed and wake up in the morning and then uh there he's trying to look for the sun and then there's a mountain in the way said no come on move go to the right and the mountains will obey &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; so man was fully alive he was alive &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we think to be alive is to have to be breathing air, oxygen in your nostrils and then you on your feet going up and down. That is no life. Without Christ, that is no life. You can be alive and yet you are dead. You can be alive and yet you are dead. &gt;&gt; So it is not taking in oxygen breathing in and out. No, that is no life. In sin did my mother conceive me? Every man born into this world was born directly into sin. And sin is the sting of death. Sin is the sting of death. So we were born directly into sin. As a matter of fact, any man born into this life was born directly. It was it was how do I call it? A death sentence. &gt;&gt; A death sentence on arrival. &gt;&gt; But the the the the the sin sin is such a dangerous thing. So dangerous that it did not only affect our relationship with God, but it affected all the creations. The animals that were living in harmony now started running after each other to swallow them, to eat them up. &gt;&gt; Everything changed. &gt;&gt; Sin is a dangerous thing. We were born directly into death. into death. And I think that the sin impaired our way of reasoning so much so that we human beings rejoice when a man is born and the day they die we cry. &gt;&gt; Is that a normal thing? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? A baby is born. Instead of you rejoicing for that baby, you go and stand and you are crying &gt;&gt; and then you wear morning clothes. All the way some the day somebody dies, you don't cry. You are you you put on white and then you are laughing and praising God and jubilating. They'll say you are mad. But probably that is the way things were supposed to be. That a man is born into death and then we rejoice and then the man comes into this life. They give their life to Christ. They repent. They receive God. They receive the Holy Ghost. They are at peace with God. And the day they leave this earth, then we are crying and mourning as if the world has come to an end. But that is what sin has done to us as a people. &gt;&gt; That even though we have believed in God, that we know when we stand with by the grace of God and we know that when we come to the end of the road, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; that that is not the end of life, we are going to live again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet still, yet still when somebody passes, it is not an easy feeling. It is not. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when God created a spirit man, he was fully alive. fully completely alive. When the fall happened, any man that was born according to the desire of man was born into what? Sin. Was born into death. Remember sin is the sting of death. That was why Paul could ask that all death, what is the sting? old grave. What is thy victory? Praise the Lord. Because there is life beyond the grave. We are no longer at the mercy of sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you sin, it's a choice you have made. It's a choice. We've been given enough power and authority &gt;&gt; to bring the devil under our feet, &gt;&gt; to bring sin under our feet, &gt;&gt; to bring our desires under our feet. &gt;&gt; We've been given power and authority. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are getting there. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Now, when John was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and he saw that there was no man that was worthy to take the book from the hand of him that sat on the throne, and to loosen the seals thereof, and he started crying. And one of the elders told him, "No, don't cry, for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to take the book, and to open the seals thereof." When he looked, what did he see? He saw a bloody lamb right in the midst of the throne. Right in the midst of the throne, God sent his son to die for you and me. And that happened a little over 2,000 years ago. A little over 2,000 years ago. that he died before the foundation of the world on God's calendar. &gt;&gt; It was gone. It was done. That was why when he came, brother Bar said he could have chosen to stay and raise a family. But with you and me on his mind, knowing the purpose that brought him here and that he was here to serve the purpose of God to do the will of the father. When he prayed, he said, "Father, not my will but your will be done." &gt;&gt; And the will of the father concerning him was that it was already done. &gt;&gt; So long as God was concerned, that was settled before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And he had to die for you and me. The lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. Not 2,000 years ago. The atonement was made before the foundation of the world. He knew us before the foundation of the world. We were saved before the foundation of the world. God asked Job, "Where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy?" Before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy? &gt;&gt; We are seated here and we don't remember it &gt;&gt; that before the foundation of the world, we shouted for joy. Yet we don't remember it. &gt;&gt; But the day is coming &gt;&gt; when we shall know &gt;&gt; that. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Before there was a foundation of this world, my soul was saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is nothing in this world of time &gt;&gt; that can change that. &gt;&gt; Nothing can change that. Where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy before the foundation of the world? You may have accepted Christ maybe a year ago, maybe 10 years ago or 20 years ago, but before the foundation of the world, you were already in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everything you go through in this life can only bring you back &gt;&gt; to who you really are. &gt;&gt; If you are predestinated unto life, &gt;&gt; nothing can change it. You were not only called to a finished work, &gt;&gt; but you are a finished work yourself. &gt;&gt; You are a finished work. &gt;&gt; You are a finished work. &gt;&gt; I am a finished work. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are a finished work by grace. Praise the Lord. To every child of God, there is an appointed season. When that season does not come, the devil can just play you around. &gt;&gt; He can just toss you from left to right. Just play you like the way we used to play soccer back home. &gt;&gt; Just play it into the swamp. Go get it. Bring it back. And play it against the wall. Bring it back. play it till it's tearing apart. You stitch it together and play it till it cannot be played anymore. That is what the devil will do to you when that time has not come. &gt;&gt; But when that season comes, when that season comes and the word of God strikes your soul, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It brings you to your reality. Praise the Lord. It brings you to your reality. And nothing, absolutely nothing can change that. Just like the the the eagle in the hands coop. The eagle didn't know who he was. He was just with the hands and the chicken in the in the in the h coop scratching the ground. It was trying to pick some grains because of the beak. It wouldn't be able to pick it. And the rest were laughing at it. He didn't even know who he was &gt;&gt; until one day he hear a heard a cry of mama eagle &gt;&gt; screaming in the air &gt;&gt; that you are not a hen you are not a chicken you are an eagle &gt;&gt; you don't belong there you belong here &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; and when the baby eagle saw mama eagle in the air he just flapped the wings &gt;&gt; and probably the first time it dropped &gt;&gt; try to flop. Oh, it dropped again. Mama, how can I say? Don't worry. &gt;&gt; I just want you to know that you are an eagle and not a chicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm coming back again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And all the time, baby was there. Said, "Oh, I now know why. &gt;&gt; Something has happened in here. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I know where I belong. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I am not a part of this group. just there waiting because mama is going to come again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Mama Eagle comes around again. &gt;&gt; And then he had a scream in the air. Just looked in the air. Oh, he said, "Mom, I'm here." Say, "Okay, just flap your wings this time. Try." He just tried. And then he come on 10 ft up. Oh, praise the Lord. Kept going. 20 ft. Kept going till it got lost in the sky. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is not your doing. It is God doing it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you hear that voice &gt;&gt; and that voice strikes you, &gt;&gt; your life will never go back the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will never be the same again. He is the author and finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; To be born again is an experience taking you back &gt;&gt; to who you really were. &gt;&gt; Amen. before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; To that man, that spirit man of Genesis 126:27, that's your spirit man. That is the life of God. Brother said that we had the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And also say that eternal life is a perfect circle. It is a perfect circle. It is a perfect circle. So this is where I am. And I moved from here. It doesn't matter where life takes me. It doesn't matter whether I go down, I go up. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter whether I am half dead or half alive. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But eventually, &gt;&gt; God has designed it. &gt;&gt; That I am going to come back here. &gt;&gt; It's a perfect circle &gt;&gt; because this is where I belong. &gt;&gt; He is the author and the finisher of our faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the author and the finisher of our lives. &gt;&gt; He is going to bring you and me to an expected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop the program of God. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is a perfect circle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the Holy Ghost is the life of God in you. &gt;&gt; And that is a mystery that God and man, God and man have become one. God and man have become one. The Lord Jesus said, "At that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that you become a spirit for that matter. No, we are still in this flesh. But the Bible says we are already seated in heavenly places &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus. And it is not a time to be reckless. &gt;&gt; Oh, I have the Holy Ghost. I can misbehave. I can go anywhere. I can talk anyhow. I can sit anywhere. I can dress anyhow. No. &gt;&gt; It calls for caution. It doesn't mean you have to be reckless. &gt;&gt; When you see somebody say they have the Holy Ghost and they can do things contrary to scriptures, it shows they don't have him. &gt;&gt; Because if you have the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost will direct your footsteps. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not allow you to do something that he will not do. The Holy Ghost will not send you to places where he would not go. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not make you to say things he will not say. &gt;&gt; He is going to dominate your life so much so &gt;&gt; that people will look at your life and see God in there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It calls for a sovereign moment, a life that is dedicated to the word that you feed on the word and nothing but the word. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes in, you are a carrier of his life. &gt;&gt; It is no longer you that liveth &gt;&gt; but Christ that lives in you. &gt;&gt; You are carrying the seed. You are carrying the life of God in you. Much like a mother that is pregnant with a child, &gt;&gt; once you are carrying that child, the way you used to dress, you don't dress like that anymore. &gt;&gt; Even those that still believe in wearing pants and then they put under their belt, you can't dress that way anymore because the baby will not allow you. There is a life in you that will not allow you. Some will just wear the heel just as long as this. &gt;&gt; You can't wear those heels anymore. Why? Because you are carrying life. So you can't wear that anymore. Some wear tight clothes, you can't wear them anymore. Why? Because you are carrying life. Some there is food they love so much that they have to eat it every single day of their lives. They will eat that and they have to go and throw it out. Why? Because there is life in them and the life in them doesn't want that food. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So even the food you are eating, you are eating it not to please yourself &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; because of the life in you &gt;&gt; to are making that adjustment. &gt;&gt; There are mothers that probably they will they will not even sleep. They will go to the nightclubs and do things. But this time you are so humble that you are home. You don't even go anywhere. You don't even desire it. 8:00 you are in bed. Nothing bothers I mean you don't want to go anywhere. Why? Because you are carrying life. &gt;&gt; And when you are carrying the life of Christ, &gt;&gt; it soers you. &gt;&gt; It takes away every pride. &gt;&gt; It humbles you. It will make you speak right. &gt;&gt; It will make you think right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will make you behave right. &gt;&gt; It will make you dress right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are carrying the life of God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is no longer you that liveth, but Christ that lives in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye must be born again. You must be born again. It is a father's good pleasure to give you the Holy Ghost. It is the father's good pleasure to give you the Holy Ghost because he said in his word that in the last day I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask him. &gt;&gt; You didn't. Now, even the disciples, the 120 that were in the upper room, when the Lord Jesus told them to gather there, they didn't even ask him for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He told them because he knew the challenges of their time and what they were going to go through. &gt;&gt; He knew what they needed. &gt;&gt; God said, "Gather there. Carry ye &gt;&gt; in the city of Jerusalem. Don't depart. until you are endued with power and authority from on high &gt;&gt; and you think that you as a son or a daughter of God that you can ask for the Holy Ghost and God will not give him to you. &gt;&gt; Then why would God make that promise? Why would God make that promise only to deny his children of the Holy Ghost knowing that that is the only thing we need to be successful in our walk with him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If men being evil know how to give good gifts unto their children, how much more would our heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him for? &gt;&gt; Amen. God thinks of us more than we ever do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is the father's good pleasure to give you the Holy Ghost. Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Brother Brandham said that God is more willing to give you the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, the same thing. Then you are ready to receive him. Sometimes you think, "Oh, I have prayed enough. I have prayed for far too long. I've been crying out to God. Oh, to baptize me, give me the Holy Ghost, and nothing is happening." Do you think you need the Holy Ghost more than God is willing to give him to you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God is willing to give you the Holy Spirit more than you are willing. &gt;&gt; The problem is not with God. &gt;&gt; The problem is with men. &gt;&gt; It is not how long you've been in church. &gt;&gt; It's not how long you've been around the message. There are people around this message that probably behave worse than the people we call unbelievers. &gt;&gt; They have come to the knowledge of the truth and yet the word has not taken effect in their lives. It's not how long. No. When your heart is right, &gt;&gt; Christ is going to come in any &gt;&gt; inside there is not clean enough. &gt;&gt; There are a lot of things you have to deal with. You have to wash. You have to just allow yourself &gt;&gt; to be cleansed. &gt;&gt; Before he can come in. So God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you are willing to receive him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now if all we have So remember that it is not our strength because we don't have it. It is not our personal righteousness. We don't have it. It is not about what we can do. because we can do nothing. &gt;&gt; We are dependent on him. &gt;&gt; And Christ died to have you and me. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of him dying so he can have you and me. You see why he will not deny you his Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He left his glory above. &gt;&gt; Came into this life, &gt;&gt; took upon himself a human veil, walked this earth. Everything he went through, everything he went through, his death on the cross, the humiliation, the persecution, everything he went through, the reproach because of you and me. And you think that God would give his only begotten son &gt;&gt; for our sake and the same God would turn around and close the door on us. We throw God out. God doesn't throw his own out. that he stands at the door and knock pleading to come in. Why? Because we have cast him out. He is pleading to come in. If any man would open the door, he will come in and suck with him. God never throws his own out. We human who throw God out and even when we have thrown him out because he so much desires that relationship, he still cannot go. He comes back knocking at the door &gt;&gt; pleading to come in. the King of glory, the Lord of laws, the Almighty God, &gt;&gt; knocking at the door of your heart and pleading &gt;&gt; to come in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you turn such a God down, if you turn him down on that day, what is going to be your excuse? For God is so good. &gt;&gt; The Lord our God is so good. There is a song that says, "God is so good." Yeah, I wish to sing that song. We come to the end of the Lord our God is so so good. He doesn't want any man to perish. But that we all may come onto repentance. &gt;&gt; If a man goes to hell, it is not God that has put that man in hell. &gt;&gt; No, God does not decide to see any man in hell. &gt;&gt; Hell was prepared for Satan and his angels. If you go to hell, it's a choice you have made. &gt;&gt; But the Lord our God is so so so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Christ died for you and me. He rose from the dead to live again. This time in you and me. Praise the Lord. You know when he has come in, you will know it. It is not something that is hidden. If all we have of his resurrection, If all we have of his res resurrection is an empty tomb, which is good, but of what is it? If that is all we have, the evidence that he rose from the dead and is alive is the Holy Ghost baptism in you and me. &gt;&gt; That is the evidence that Christ rose from the dead. He rose from the dead. The evidence that he is alive today is you and me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the evidence of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; We live in him. We talk like him. We walk like him. We see through his eyes. Praise the Lord. So do not stop at an the empty tomb. Don't stop there because more than an empty tomb is a risen savior. And more than a risen savior is the Holy Ghost. The same spirit. The same spirit that came up from 120. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that raised Christ from the dead. The same spirit, not a second person, not a third person. Ye must be born again. It is of utmost necessity. It is of utmost importance. And when the Holy Ghost comes in, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The devil knows &gt;&gt; you don't belong to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he died on the cross, he died with you and me in him. Don't worry how you are going to overcome the world. &gt;&gt; Don't worry how you are going to overcome sin. If he died with you in him, you are going to die to this world. &gt;&gt; It is not your choice. &gt;&gt; It's not your choice. If he died with you, in him you would die to sin. And if he rose from the dead with you, because when he died, he died with us. When he rose, he rose with us. &gt;&gt; That we are seated in heavenly places already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he rose with you, you are going to rise above sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will rise above the circumstance of our time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will rise above them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, it is not your choice. &gt;&gt; It's something the Lord our God has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can only just fall in the right frequency. &gt;&gt; If we can fall right in there, we will see the glory of God in a way we have never dreamed of. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye must be born again. It is not about you living habits. It's not about you living habits. How do I live this? How do I stop this? It's not about you. A lot of the times people will leave something and then they go back for it. &gt;&gt; They left it. If you leave a habit, you can go back for it. &gt;&gt; But when that habit leaves you, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will look for it and never find it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you want to trace the steps &gt;&gt; and you can't find it because it left you and it left you for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we need some of the times is just to stay on God's grail for just a little bit longer &gt;&gt; and get baked. Just get baked and stop the complaining. &gt;&gt; Just get begged a little more. &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask the devil to get out. &gt;&gt; The devil is going to jump out &gt;&gt; because life is going to be so uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; He can't stand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will jump out for his dear life &gt;&gt; because that life is so filled with the word &gt;&gt; so filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That word &gt;&gt; is no longer you but Christ in you. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory &gt;&gt; that the devil cannot stand that heat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is power in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is power. So much power in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know what happens when you keep feeding on the word. &gt;&gt; You don't know. But something happens &gt;&gt; when you eat. All you know you are eating to satisfy your hungry stomach. &gt;&gt; Is there anything that shows you the food you have eaten 10% is going to the brain, 10% to the muscles? No. You are not even conscious of it. But something is happening. &gt;&gt; And also when you starve yourself and you are so hungry and thirsty, your system begins to shut down. That is how it is in the spiritual realm that when you are not feeding on the word of God, men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. If you are not feeling on the word, you are starving your soul to death. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel it. &gt;&gt; It is the reality. &gt;&gt; And when you are feeding on the word, something good is happening. &gt;&gt; You may not see it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to see it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; Know ye not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost? For God does not dwell in temples made of human beings. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The temple of God. The temple of God is not this building. And think about it. We give a lot of respect &gt;&gt; to this place, don't we? &gt;&gt; Because this is a place we come to serve our God. We come to hear from God. We come to worship God. &gt;&gt; And when we walk in here, we have some reverence, some respect for this place. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, God does not reside here. &gt;&gt; This is not the temple where God lives. &gt;&gt; God lives in you and &gt;&gt; we are the temple of the Holy Ghost. Ask yourself, &gt;&gt; do you treat yourself with that reverence &gt;&gt; knowing that there is a God who resides in there? &gt;&gt; Do you treat that God with respect so much so that you reverence that temple, the temple which you are, knowing that there is a God in you and I will not use this God to go and do this. I will not drink because no the God in me will not like it. I will not do this because the God in me will not like it. I am the temple of the Holy Ghost. I will not go here because he wouldn't want it. Do we have that reverence? Do we have that reverence? Do we have that respect? We are the temple &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wants to come in. The Holy Spirit, the musicians can come. The Holy Spirit wants to come in. He is just sitting looking in probably waiting for one thing you have to make right in your life. He is probably sitting and waiting probably for one thing, one action you have to take. He's probably sitting and waiting for one step you have to take. Just waiting for the right moment to come in. And sometimes we get so close instead of taking that one step before we realize we take two, three, four steps backward. And now it becomes more of a difficult task. The Holy Ghost is waiting to come. &gt;&gt; Are you getting yourself prepared for the Holy Ghost to come? Because God would not lose anyone of his own. &gt;&gt; He must be born again. God has to carry you back to who you really were before the foundation of this world. You must be born again. This is not who you are. God is determined to restore you to who you were before this work began. You must be born again. You must be born again. God cannot afford to lose you. By one spirit are we baptized into one body. We are all a part of him. That body of Christ is a complete body. That body cannot be deformed. It cannot be deformed. It cannot be deformed. Every part of that body will be there. That body is a complete body. Every member of the body will be present. So being born again is a must. It's not a choice you have to make. It's a must. It's not something you have to think of. It's a must. It's not something to decide on. It's a must. It's already been decided upon. It's a must. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody can replace you in that body. To be born again is to return to your previous state. Who you used to be. Who you used to be. That son of the living God. Spirit of his spirit, born of his bone, flesh of his flesh. That is who you are. That is who you are. And God is determined more than ever before to carry us back where we belong. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Death would not reign over life. The only way death will take over is when you reject life. And because you have rejected life, what is life but death? [Music] Harden not your heart this day when you hear the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God has spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God has come to us. Search your hearts. It is no longer time to play church. Brothers and sisters, it could all be over before we get home. It is no longer time to play church. There is only one body that is going in the rapture and that is the body of Christ. We are all members of that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only way you get in that body is to be born again. &gt;&gt; Yes. to be born again. [Music] It is time to mean more business with God. [Music] Age doesn't mean anything to God. Age doesn't mean anything to God. To you the young ones, age doesn't mean anything to God. [Music] When your heart is right, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is going to come in. Age doesn't mean anything to God. [Music] God can come in any day, any hour, any minute, any second, any day. We are just living in a borrowed time. In a borrowed time. As a matter of fact, all the signs the Bible has given concerning the end, they are here with us. Is there anything you can think of that is left? [Music] They are all here with us. We are witnesses to them. We are seeing them. We are at the very end. At the very very very end. Not to scare anybody. It is the truth that we are at the very end. If there is anything to do, you do it now. [Music] If you have to give your life to Christ, you do it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have to repent, you do it now. If you have to make a mess with your brother, with your sister, you do it now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because time waits for no man. Time waits for no man. I want us to talk to God. God is a prayer answering God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know what you had on your heart before coming to church this morning, but one thing I do know that God has spoken. The word of God has come to us. I would want us to go before his throne this morning, this afternoon. Talk to God. Ask for his mercies. ask for his forgiveness. [Music] Let's pray. Talk to God that his word says that we must be born again. Pray. Ask for the Holy Ghost because he himself has said in his holy word and the word of God is true. God does not play with words. If men being evil know how to give good gifts to their children, that they will not give a stone for bread or a serpent or snake for fish, but would give any good thing they have. How much more how much more would our heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him for? Shall we pray? our Lord and our Savior Jesus. We thank you for another opportunity to come before you, Father, and to hear you speak. I never thought of this sermon.
