[Music] we're going to have a brother but a book carried with us this morning but uh i think he couldn't make it down from uh uh from fargo uh he's supposed to be traveling on on a mission trip so he thought he will pass through here before he he goes so i hope we'll be able to see him before he leave as i attract to 40 i want to i just want to read a few verses there just uh for the scripture reading let's read from verse 17 all nations before him as nothing and and they accounted to him less than nothing in vanity all nations before the lord told to whom then will ye lacking god all what likeness will ye compare unto him the walkman melted grieving image and the goldsmith spreaded it over with gold and caster silver chain he that is so impoverished that he have no oblation chooses a tree that that will not he seeketh unto him according walkman to prepare the grieving image there shall not be move now men building their own images have ye not known have ye not heard have it not been told you from the beginning have ye not honest to from the foundation of the earth it is he that seated upon the cycle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshopper they are stretched out the heavens as a curtain and spreading them out as a tenth to the word in the brinkette the princess to nothing and make it the georges of the earth as vanitas let us pray heavenly father lord we just read this portion of the word there is no body that we can liken you until this morning you are the god of the universe father lord the very giver of the breath of life to us this morning father lord god and just to acknowledge lord that everyone of us lord will not be in this building this morning if lord god you did not alter our life and father so we uh we we acknowledge that lord we bowed our hearts and our heads to you we appreciate you we say thank you for the breath of life in the midst lord god of uh of of everything that is happening lord sickness is all over the place father god lord but your grace has been gracious to us and oh god father we are counting on that grace this morning lord father to be able to uplift us o god precious lord father we're being taught by your word the prophet isaiah said lord god when the enemy come as a flood the spirit of the almighty god will raise up a standard and dear lord of father god your prophet of the age also told us lord that god father every time the enemy come as a flood is because we are at a junction whether in our life whether in the church whether in the nation oh god father lord jesus we are the junction lord god and sometimes we get caught up lord father in the wave and get so confused and don't even know where to turn but in that very same moment lord your spirit is is ready to lift us up oh god so father lord and he said lord that's the time where the only potency is ever visible lord father if we can be able to identify it almighty god and we believe lord your unimportant power is so visible with us oh god we want to thank you lord god because you are our sustained lord you are father god oh lord not a god that is so far away but you are so involved in everything that concerns us lord you are so much involved oh god we just thank you we will ask your blessing this morning come lord father take your word break it to our hearts let something be said this morning of internal value something that will bring us closer to your father lord oh god we just praise you we thank you we love you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed and again we we are grateful to be in the house of the lord [Applause] we will want to take a little subject this morning i was actually thinking about i was going to speak on the depths of god and the depths of satan and but while i was studying i got i got uh uh i got driven into into church history that was i've been i've been uh kind of uh reading a lot of church history during the week and you see uh uh uh just like we were reading and we all know you know uh history you know reminds us you know of things that have passed and and if we if we uh uh get ourselves into reading history you realize that just like solomon said there is nothing new under the sun what has happened is is what is happening and and when you get yourself into church history and you read about the church fathers and and all of that and you look at the date and the time that we are living in you realize it's just the same old thing repeating just different people being involved amen praise the lord so this morning i would take a talk that i will i would entitle the cycle of revival and death i want to talk on the cycle of revival and death and that's the reason why i read that scripture where isaiah said that god set upon the cycle of the universe he sit upon the cycle of the earth and uh i want to i want to talk about the cycle of the cycle of revival and death and why and while looking at while looking at that there were few other things also that caught my attention and [Music] i want to uh i realized there were there was some men there that wrote about the cycle of nations now if you watch the cycle of nations and uh and you and you look into that i mean i was like i said i was reading a lot of those things and and i kind of copied some of them that we will we will project and and you will see the trench of thought when you when you look at that i mean uh uh uh many years back there there are men that have been they have been looking at how the leadership of the nation's been going you know and and the people you know and and the economy and all of that and as as they look at what is happening in the present time and go back and read in history to realize that you know it's just something that is you know uh uh you know revolving it keeps it keeps happening it's in a cycle so uh some men that wrote about the cycle of nation you know elizano tyler he wrote the cycle of democracy in in 1770 you know uh and then in 1778 there's another guide edward that also wrote about the the decline and the fall of the roman empire and then another person wrote about this called the study of history and and but what i showed he was looking at also was you know the cycle of nations and then in 1936 another person wrote about the story of civilization and jim nelson black wrote when nations died in 1994 and in all of these a historical account of how men have looked at just like i said that the nations you know when things are happening you know and and they have been able to come and when you when you read through these things you realize that they are all aiming at the same thing they are all driving to the same place to show that there have been cycles you know nation goes through cycles people go through cycles you know we go through cycle of life you know uh uh uh every seven years you know there is there's there is there is changes that take place in our life that's that's our cycle you know so uh uh we have we have 10 cycles to get off the clock praise the lord three scores and 10. when we go to round 10 cycle we're supposed to get off the clock but god has given grace to some to stay on the clock after 10 cycles praise the lord so you see and just like how the nations go through cycles and people go through cycles the church to also go through the cycle of revival and death praise the lord amen and jim nelson black he wrote he said in his book the nate when nation died he point out the three decay of a nation the three major things that kill a nation he point out [Music] social decay and on the social decay he pointed out the crisis of lawlessness he's he also pointed out on a social decay the the loss of uh economic discipline the loss of economic discipline and the rise of bureaucracy those are some of the the things that destroy the nation social wise when people start becoming you know lawlessness they don't have no value for courtesy they don't have no traditional values they don't they just don't have value for anything not even themselves you also point out cultural decay the decline of education when the educational system start declining you know we know there was a big turn turn in that in the 1960s when he took the bibles out of school it it just it just shrinked the entire cultural system and uh uh i mean when when when you know when education uh decline in in young people are not taught morals and that taught courtesy and respect you can just you can just see the kind of a future that that would be for the generation to come the weakening of cultural foundation the bible says solomon says do not remove the old the ancient landmark you know it was not only talking about our cornerstone on our property but the ancient landmark was a principle that the early follow the early fathers have planted you know and then the loss of respect for traditional values that also go back to the asian landmark so when the nation lost these three things we don't have a culture we don't have a culture praise the lord when the nation loves these things you cannot be able to tell who have just come in and who have been here all this why praise the lord because sometimes it's the culture of the people that tell us who owned the land who have been here and then he also point out moral decay social decay cultural decay and moral decay the rise of immorality the decay of religious belief praise the lord amen when when when when just when just the respect the sacredness of worship places is no longer to people you know people can walk into the church and you know they want to smoke their weed they want to you know bring guns and kill people when all of those things have gone from the society there is no morals hospitals and churches used to be safe heaven for a nation when a man no matter how evil he is if he's able to run over to a a hospital for the father he got to the hospital means that he needs attention he needs help praise the lord amen for the father he runs into the door of a church means that he needs help it used to be safe heaven but is no longer animal safe heaven and human life has been devalued there is no value for human life praise the lord we see there on our news every day all the road rages that is taking place i will advise you pray behind your will before you get to driving amen just pray behind your wheels and keep christ on your mind because uh it's just it's just becoming on an everyday thing you know and and i mean some of those things are just crazy you just you just see how lord we have become and is a global thing it's not only an american thing it's a global thing you find in every word there is no value for human life you know they can destroy the male life just over a piece of bread the decade of religious belief and the rise of immorality destroy the morals of every nation and every people praise the lord and our so sorry my mind uh mine uh uh okay brother jordan can you switch this light off i don't know if if it makes any any clarity to you but just put up the cycle of nations for me now i want to use that as praise the lord are we together amen now alexander tyler was the one that uh that uh that publicized this cycle of nations and in instead in the cycle of nations he says we come from bonnage and i don't have your super pain yet but jordan but that's okay we comes from bonnage and then we goes to spiritual uh faith and then uh from there we go to courage and then liberty now as i was as i was reading this i i try to put in one of the easier picture is the children of israel you know you just put it in you just put it put it in the picture for you to be able to see it you know if you can if you can be able to grab a scriptural uh uh grab a scriptural picture you will be able to understand uh the children of israel you know uh uh there in egypt was in bondage then brother brahm talks about aaron praying you know uh when when the uh when the burden was increased you know spiritual faith started building you know bondage will always create some sense of spiritual faith when people are just deprived and people are just low to the bottom they make them to cry out to go oh god if you save me i will save you the rest of my life bondage will always create some sense of spiritual faith they will be going to church sleeping in the church amen then there will be a sense of courage that spiritual faith will start building a sense of courage are we together and and right here under this courage you will see that's where it took moses to kill an egyptian okay it was a whole lot of courage to do that because what was happening there now the uh uh the hebrews in some sense started started resisting the tax master oh i said i said bill the i said i said beat the break what if you kill me and i would just die you know it will take courage for you to stand before someone that is suppressing you and and you know and respond back to them and then right after courage comes liberty moses gone in the wilderness they came back here in the era and let my people go let my people go now as we as we go through this as we talk this i want us to apply to our own lives because we also to go through this cycle we go through this cycle so labor time you can you can you can uh uh uh put a sinner right in the bound and sin and then whether he hears somebody preaching the gospel or he visit the church a sense of spiritual faith starts to come he starts getting courage to go to church every day and and and then pretty soon he get a touch from god he feels a sense of liberty then the next thing that comes is abundance praise the lord and as soon as abundance comes then people stop being complacent the lord we start becoming complacent now just like i said uh uh uh this is this is uh you know if you study history you will realize there was something that you know that i realized you bring it down even to the church ages you realize that in the 1700s look up look at the map of the church ages when the church ages reign you will find out that uh that age that is honored the man's anointing that was the age where god inspired men okay it came it came right down to the to the time of the printing press you know all of these things for us to have papers for us to have books and now we are getting away from paper and books we are getting over to you know uh uh high tech and everything is the cloud and all of that but there was a period of time were god used what was happening at that time go and find great literature you will find that men in the 1700s because they were all under the men's anointing they had such an insight and and and i mean they were on the the age to publicize and most of those most of those men wrote great books praise lord i mean great great writers came out of that that age because it was the anointing that was on the edge the anointing where men took their pain in right and because it was under the anointing it was inspired that's the reason why the man can write this in 1700s and we can look at it and say oh wow wow that's truth wow i can see it that's what inspiration does so after complacency man gets to that place of complacency and right in there we start to feel a little sense of entitlement you know we start to feel a little sense of entitlement but what happened here is that as we as we go up as we go up there are changes that are taking place that we no longer feel the the the pressure that we used to feel yeah in bunach now when we got over to spiritual faith there was some sense of desperation because we had just come from out of bondage we become so desperate so zealous but then when we get to complacency you don't find that anymore yet in bondage we were not sleeping very long but yeah now we oversleep you know we oversleep and even we start taking pills to sleep more because we have arrived praise the lord then after a complacency you can see the cycle i want to go into that into the church you know into church history a little bit because it involves us we we are in uh the time of the gentiles the laodicea church age scripture wise that's where we find ourselves so uh then man comes down to empathy and then after not too long he's back to become to dependency at one time he had abundance but now he comes down here to dependency and according to history it takes 200 years for a nation to go through that cycle praise the lord amen so we we want to we want to look at that this morning we want to talk on the cycle of death the cycle of revival and death we want to dwell mostly on the cycle the the cycle that we go through the cycle of life that we go through but because we're bringing it from uh church history you you that's the reason why we want to we want to use that as the as a cycle of death i was sitting back there this morning and listening to what was streaming play for the church ages and and i talked to myself i said i said i said lord i wish the people are learning from what they are listening to i hope they are listening and they are picking things that can stay on their mind and they can go back and look at it into the church book and look at it into the scripture praise the lord because those things are very important this morning their brother bran was talking about where uh where we have this whole uh uh virgin mary thing that have come into the church and become a big thing of the catholic church how it was a roman history before it became part of the church it was actually a roman history you know it was something that that rome brought and the church embraced and now it's a big thing among catholics in that that leads the people into idolatry and all of that you know so we we we look into those things and you know we learn you know we learn we must always have a heart to learn praise the lord so as we look at that you will realize the other let me let me find my little uh cheat sheet here i was i was writing some things down uh in office while i was i was meditating and i wa let's go to our bibles thank you brother jordy if we want to re we refer back to this we will ask your help praise the lord if you can give us some light here praise the lord amen as chapter 2. now as as we look at this subject together what what i want to bring also here is the other if you look in the scripture you will realize that the church the church studied is is its very foundation is very foundation what i want us to go through is to look at a few scriptures in the bible where it talks about the church in the house because that's the very foundation of the church the foundation of the church is the home praise the lord amen the foundation of the church is the home but we term to get it in a reverse is what we are in our homes that we bring together on sunday that's the very foundation so you will see that the early church in the beginning they started from from house to house as we look a few scriptures here as chapter 2 verse 46 let's just run through through those ones quickly 2 46 and and they continue daily we've won a call in the temple and breaking bread from house to house now you see that the the container wanna call in the temple now the temple year you will realize that the early church was was made out of jewish believers so in one sense they will stay attached to their temple stay attached to the synagogues praise the lord but pretty soon they will realize they have the people in the synagogues is not is not embracing them pretty soon they will realize that they are under persecution they are looking for them and now they are going to they are all going to sink back now to this house to house fellowship we want to call in the temple breaking bread from house to house they eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart let's look at uh as chapter eight as chapter eight verse three as chapter 8 verse 3 as for saul he made a havoc of the church entering into every house he made a havoc of the church entering into every house so because it was known that the early church the believers were gathering from house to house so that's how saul when when he took uh the commission to persecute the church started going from house to house persecuting the disciples praise the lord i throw in another scripture year uh that will that will back that up but let's let's stay in the book of acts and then we will come to that one as chapter 20 20 as chapter 20. say 2020 i might have got it wrong or wrote it wrong or so as chapter 20 20 there's a reason why how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but uh have shown you and have taught you publicly and from house to house so that was paul talking to the efficient editors uh one of the last time he would talk to them first timothy chapter 3 verse five okay let's leave that one let's leave to matthew chapter three verse five i know why i put that there now in first timothy chapter three verse five is where paul was talking about the qualification of a deacon if a man would not be able to keep his house now so you see the way they were choosing their deacons is because they were seeing how the how you know how the family was ordering themselves in their in their home you know how a man was taking the responsibility of his home and bringing his home under the hair ship of the world the way his uh his children was you know you know so from there they were being able to get so that's what i kind of dash that one in but let's go to romans chapter six romans chapter 16 verse five and uh first corinthians 16 verse 19 uh uh you know and paul is greeting all of these churches in the house of this person in the house of aqualia and priscilla in the house the church in the house the church in the house the church in the house now so it it gives you the sense of how the home is the foundation of the church praise the lord is the backbone let me say that way is the backbone of the church praise the lord so uh uh uh now from this you will realize that uh the the the the gathering of having uh uh church building in in the sense of uh you know how we appreciate church building today actually came uh after the time that constantine has got himself involved with the church you know when he got himself involved with the church just to be able to get a control of the people you know uh the they offer them buildings for them to come together and also it was in the time of i think king gregory when the state decided to now stop paying the preachers there was actually word uh uh uh you know preachers started getting on on salary you know in the in the in the book of arts there you know the like the scripture says you know delayed their gifts are the apostles feet now all of that was at a time where state and church starts to merge the state was trying to get hold of the church and detect i was just reading in in in the office just before i came out of of uh one of the king wu's wives among his many wives one day and she was the hair wife and and she was a christian so what she did was she built uh a monastery right beside the palace and and and and she brought in preachers to preaching and and then when she died the king wept out the monastery because she was a queen she had she had the power to do that are we together so there was a time where the state got a hold of the church and uh uh you know and and and i mean we are rolling right back into that we are rolling right back into that so you see all of that so there's that the concept that i want i'm trying to bring here with the church being the home being the backbone of the church is the other we come together we sing the songs we fellowship the preacher preached the word but now it's up to us to take that word take it home meditate upon it raise our family in the fear of the lord praise the lord amen raise our family because i won't see you again until wednesday night if jesus is tired and he give us another wednesday that's when we will be yet and then after wednesday service we don't come back again until sunday now so uh uh i mean that it will not be justice for a man to hold the pastor response responsible for his children misbehaving when it when they only come on wednesday and sundays you have the responsibility take the word that being preached to you and establish it in your home build family artists fellowship around the world are we together now so we see we see those things happen you know we see those things happen so we we get into into our our subject here praise the lord i'm trying to take my time this morning because i i woke up around four o'clock this morning with such a headache on my head i just have a kind of a headache but uh you know i just i just thank the lord how you know i just you know kind of for waiting there and seeing what how the grace of god would help us so i was i was just saying wow where this kind of a strong head came from this morning you know but uh we thank the lord that we can we can be able to draw strength from him so i would take my time this morning it shouldn't stop you from pulling amen i've always tell you if i died i know you can raise me up i believe in the church that can raise me up amen praise the lord amen amen so let's let's take efficient church age here and re read a little bit here let's take this first i'm having love from ephesians church age but the cycle of revival and death never fail that's what i took my inspiration from the cycle that cycle of revival and death never fail all you have to do is recall this last move of god in the spirit when men and women dressed like christians went to church pray all night talk to the street colonels and wearing a shame of the manifestation of the spirit they left they are all their churches and and and and and worship in homes or all store buildings they had to build find new churches no they have reality amen but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in the choir instead of singing unto god for themselves and gowns on the choir they organized a movement in and and rendered by men they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bar the goats come in and took over the cry of joy was gone so you if you go back to our cycle again you see how how they left from from bonnage and and and then pretty soon now they have got themselves back to this place again praise the lord we will look at that in a little bit here the crowd of joy is gone the freedom of the spirit is gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the black the blackness of arches is about all that is left amen they can only talk about how i was on fire how this place was on fire praise the lord but all that is left is just the blackness and arches are we together amen so we see that uh uh you know uh uh uh history tells us that these things do happen and just like i said it happens in church life it happened in family life it happened in individual lives we go through those cycles praise the lord amen but you see the move of god in every age is to break the cycle praise the lord is to break the cycle now the concept there from from the prophet isaiah of how the law sits on the cycle of the earth he's not in the cycle he's out of the cycle praise the lord he's out of the cycle so it takes the one that is out of the cycle to break the cycle and that is the reason why in every age god raised up a man we can talk about the time of moses we used that right there in our cycle they were in bunachi and and all of that a man grew courage and he went down there and saw uh uh uh uh two i mean an egyptian fighting with an israelite it was it was a lot of courage for him to stand stand uh against a slave master and challenge him if you hit me with that thing i would knock you back well you can kill me but i will hit you back if you touch me one more time and moses saw that and says enough is enough praise the lord he got down there and he slayed the man and dragged him in the sand and pretty soon he went in the backside of the desert but courage brought liberty because a man took courage it brought liberty amen and when the people were were freed praise the lord if you can just dash our our cycle back cycle the mission back on on when the people were freed what happened they went right into abundance the pillar of fire by by night the pillar of cloud by day amen they went from bondage spiritual faith courage he's too against the egyptian moses brought liberty let them across the red sea into abundance man of falling in the morning just take the basket take as much that you can when we're eating uh the still bread in egypt now they have choice oh no i don't want this one i don't want this one i don't want this one and they take and even they take more that they can't even finish that's what happened abundance brings greed yes praise the lord and they're going through that cycle now they have abundance praise the lord so now they became complacent they have all the time to sit down with korra and dayton and plot against moses they are now complacent they have all the time on their hands and who he think he is who you think he is moses aaron is this thing is this family thing now praise the lord when they had the whips of the egyptian on their back amen oh seeing one another was so precious to them praise the lord now the in the wilderness there is no egyptian band that is waking them up in the morning they can sleep and snore drew from their mouth to their feet they have all the time to sleep and i want to wake up oh what a good day oh what a good day i just hate to get outside it's moses again i don't know he thinks he's some kind of a commander he gave instruction to people oh my goodness when he come to him say i'm sleeping i'm sleeping you have all the time to sleep may god help us let's take another one from the ephesian church age have you ever studied the history of revival if you have not try you will enjoy it now a revival signify the move of god in spirit for every time god moves satan is there to move also it never fails praise the lord it never fails so you realize that right in that cycle as things are happening it's a move that is taking place as we go into every stage are we together it never fails in the days of the great revival and most people don't know this because you see why people while most people don't know this is because oh my goodness there is something i wanted to include in here but uh uh i did not put it put it in my notes i would have really loved to include it in here uh well okay we might have another time to share that with you but uh uh uh what why people did not realize what was happening in in the welsh revival is because people were only looking at uh you know uh uh uh the the positive side of the revival they're looking at how many people got saved you know how i mean it was it was such a powerful revival you know if history can record it is because it affected the it affected the the welsh people they affected the nation you know and in all our time i mean men were traveling over there to to uh to see the move of god most people don't know this the insane asylum filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil powers to take away the attention from god praise the lord amen now what i wanted to share with you uh it was it was uh uh brett brown was talking about the ram he was talking about you know all of these men that that were great poets and great writers he was talking about the power of inspiration how these men when when when they get under inspiration and it is the inspiration of the almighty god how it lift them so high they get to the place like see david prophesy my god my god what have that forsaken me he's saying the very same exact word that jesus was saved hundreds of years on the cross praise the lord he's saying those exact words which mean god had lifted him up in the spirit so much that he's saying word for word and he talks about man that has great gifts and people that have been used under the power of inspiration he says what happened is that when a man is sticking up into that spirit and and and i mean he he's been he's been lifted above his mortar ability he gets into the supernatural and he starts to write things it's a fountain filled with blood drained from emmanuel vain and and all of these men all through the ages even sometimes preacher you preach all the inspiration just to that place you know to that level he says what happened is that there is the man is down here on the frame that place of the supernatural is up here in the tail level he sits right here in the middle there is a rain now most times when men are lifted up in the spirit and they don't have the grace to be able to come down they get caught up right here right in the middle here he says that's where sometimes they lose their mind praise the lord amen that's where they lose their mind now because i just like apostates and and he calls it on the prince of the power of the earth praise the lord there's a reign there's a dimension right in between between the two the airflow where where we are uh uh you know uh uh under this uh three dimension and there is we can say four dimension now and and but but there is a reign here that we will call you know the the the fifth dimension also you know and and sometimes when men are not able to to get back to themselves you know he talks about you know the one that wrote the fountain filled with blood how after being under inspiration he took a bleeding you know and and and committed suicide and and you know he talks about uh even even jonah you know being on a such an inspiration to bring an entire nation to repentance and at the end he was asking god to take his life i rather died you know i mean these people you said you were going to do this and all of that so that's that's what he was talking here and now when the move of god like brother branham was talking about all of these people that were caught up in in the the the insane east institute you know it's it's it's people that uh you know you you get under the grace of god and and and god deeds with the manhattan and the power of god is is pawn on the person a person is in a revival sitting under the preaching of the word the holy ghost comes you know and just and just pull the spirit of conviction on a man or deal with the man heart and all of that but what happened is that many times people don't have the grace you see you get that little experience right in the meeting you get aside oh praise god you shouted when you have never shouted before and you just go under the impression that i received the holy ghost that's dangerous that's very dangerous praise the lord because you have to realize that the gates of hell reward against you every devil in hell we want to destroy your confidence in that experience you have had praise the lord amen so if if the grace is not there for the person to be taught that it was a truth experience no doubt it was the move of god but now you have to be taught amen like peter says the holy ghost fell on those men as chapter 10 he says then who can forbade this one from being baptized you see he brought them back to the principle of the word he was oh they received the holy ghost mind they are just like us no he brought them back to the very foundational principle of the world are we together so let's read this talking here on the cycle of revival we go through that we go through those cycles in our life in our christian life god brings us out of bondage by the by the preaching of the word by god dealing with the sinner's heart praise the lord we feel some sense of spiritual faith we can read our bible we can get down on our needs and pray we get some sense of liberty things i used to do i do them no more praise the lord amen and pretty soon we start getting to that place of abundance and when the person gets to that place of abundance you start condemning other people because now you think you read your bible you understand you go into a church oh my goodness the service was on fire all those denominational they are they are they're all dead denominational praise the lord we have never never learned how to sustain god's blessing how to be able to sustain the presence of god when it's dealing with you how to keep it praise the lord it is written that in wesley there is the people who do most peculiar things that were definitely of satan to try to mark the goodness and the power of god in in luther day it is said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protest protested the roman catholic church but the miracle lays in the fact that he could and did stay sound in the midst of all the fanaticism that was around praise the lord just like i've said to you before men like zwingling he taught that luther he says you know he had a great move but he had backslided you know and he took he took that move of of luther revival in such an extreme to produce what we have today as the amish people he took it to such an extreme we don't want to have nothing to do with the state and that's what had produced the amish people we have today they came right a product from luther's revival and many of them praise the lord amen even uh man of simon you know uh that started the the midnight he also was a catholic priest he went into studying what luther received as a revelation praise the lord and what he does was he says i will not go in a way that zwingling is going so he tried to grab a balance between what luther was preaching and what zwingling also was preaching so you see it's it's history it's a cycle it has always been there you'll find man that goes right into the messenger's message and think that they can preach the message more than the messenger it has always been like that praise the lord but in the midst of all of that now people thought that luther was actually creating a revolution against the state no he was not against the state he was against what the church was preaching that was not in line with the word praise the lord so when the state led to give luther an offer of a job people thought well he backslided he has backslided you see the thing the thing is keeping with god's word it's not starting a revolution against the state or again one group of people no stay with the world because those things can only last for a moment but the word will never fail the word of god will never fail are we together now so we see here luther was able to keep himself sound in the midst of all the financing that was going around and if you have been aware of of the last his ministry you will have noted the same invasion of false and wicked spirit that's the invasion of the devil he creeps in under the quietness of the holy ghost creed creep in all of the quietness of the holy ghost and find a seat that is called the seat of the scumfall he sits there and resent everything and scoff at the word praise the lord amen that's the invasion of the enemy praise the lord amen you know it will be a beautiful thing if a child takes their bible and read and then come to their father and mother and it says mama the scripture says this bible says this okay take for example the bible says uh paul is there paul there they're either inefficient or uh uh uh or collusion where he says uh parents do not provoke your children amen praise the lord but yet also in hebrew he says provoke one another so you have to look at you you have to look at what the apostle is talking about praise the lord and and and just like i said it's it's done in many ways when we as parents don't understand that that young child needs to grow in their understanding of the lord and now you want to use your understanding and your revelation and then you know but the bible said we shouldn't do that that the message said we shouldn't do this now it will be a beautiful thing for a child now to read your bible take something in the scripture and come to the parent and says but dad or mom see the bible says this or i was reading this or listening and and you know and the message these days praise the lord that will be a beautiful way where you realize that the grace of god is beginning to deal with that child then for the child now to just sit in a stubborn seat amen they are not saying anything but they are saying a lot they're not saying anything but they are saying a whole lot i would just put it in a few words however what you are saying and get it from my face praise the lord they have an innocent face looking at you praise the lord it would be a beautiful thing for a child to take what that parent said and say let me see if this thing is in the bible when you have all the resources at your hand you can take your phone go to search put that word in obedient and and your search engine will bring you 300 times obedient is used in the bible the laziness of not being able to read through it praise the lord and then if the child can be able to find a place in the scripture and says and says and says and says papa oh mama see what the bible says oh may god gave grace to the heart of thy mother all grace to the heart of thy father to be able to learn even if the child is not bringing in the right way you must see that the holy ghost is dealing with the heart of that child to be able to look in the word look i'm your father i'm your father you do what i says praise the lord the invasion of evil and wicked spirits it has to be that way now i hope i trust that you are spiritual minded enough to get there and capture to last on it praise the lord amen the invasion of evil and wicked spirit it has been there in in the cycle of the church what did the bible say acety mean the bible called it a settlement and his wife asked chapter five didn't give his name they called him a setting man praise the lord i mean in so much that luke never had no re record of his name because he was this kind of a person that showed up in church and we never see him again until he show up another time praise the lord but yet he was always getting home and you know and in south africa you see that i think that pastor was talking today the guy and the team is smart they think they're smart this is your saying that so we can give ourselves to praying and to steady they're just lazy that people money they won't be living on they don't got anything this much praise the lord that we should say all our things and go lay our money at their feet praise the lord so forgive me i don't know where i'm coming up with this thing but just forgive me we are talking about the psycho of revival and death the cycle of revival and death praise the lord wednesday night we were talking about possessing your vessel you know because they were not constantly giving themselves to the word whether in church or at home they could not control their conversation and their tongue will cause the death of the settlement and the death of his wife their tongue will cause their death yes sir it takes your your dedication your submission to the world to be able to bring every member of your body in suggestion praise the lord if a person is having mind bottles and you cannot stop thinking nasty thoughts just give yourself to the world [Music] just read a verse and try to memorize it you will realize that every time a negative thought is coming to your mind that bible verse will pop up the word now will start fighting thoughts in your mind [Applause] praise the lord amen if a man have i mean just just a kind of evil desire lost and and i mean you always want to be indebted things let me say it this way just try if i mean if if you just think that you just the whole fasting thing you can do it just give your breakfast just keep breakfast let me see that way just keep breakfast even if it is from nine o'clock until 12 just hold yourself a little bit before god just keep your breath fast and hold yourself a little bit before god and say god please take this dead spirit from me the word is the one that fights our battle the word is the one that controls that made this body so the word has what it takes to bring this body on a subjection the cycle of revival and death some have experienced god in different ways in some in great ways praise the lord but somewhere down the line we have got to a place of complacency and we no longer pray and we think we can pop the bible in our minds so we don't need to read the bible anymore praise the lord and the revival of death starts to step in amen the revival of death when you get to that place in the cycle of abundance but jordan if you can throw that cycle up for me again praise the lord if you get to this place of abundance this is this is a junction it's a very serious junction in your life you need your own importance to help you here you need your own importance to lift you above the floor that comes because right here when a man that has suffered bonus starts to experience bone abundance god don't help him he can be arrogant very arrogant the man that experienced bondage when he starts to experience abundance if god don't help him be disrespectful so this is a junction where we need your own importance to help us but bam says at every junction of time if the people of god can just look in history that's why he brought seven junctions to show us if we can just look in history history will tell us at every junction of time god comes down on the scene because because the junction is a place of decision the enemy comes as a flaw there are a lot of things that are happening praise the lord amen we need the grace of god right here to lift us above their abundance to lift you above the abundance that it will not have effect on you [Music] oh abundance of revelation then the man thinks he's next to the prophet abundance of grace to pray for few people in the sake he has a healing ministry he want to be the next elijah praise the lord is a junction in time when a nation has abundance you know another thing that comes with abundance abundance a create a spirit a demon of any day comes around you everybody that sees your abundance starts to envy you praise the lord america came to this place one time she was greatly envy by the word amen israel is at this place now in israel and all the nations joven and all the nations around her invade her because god has turned her desert to blossom like a rose praise the lord amen and this place because you have all of those those those uh uh demons of invade around you then what happened is that like uh america used this now to become the police of the world because we had we the the nation had abundance so what happened is the other at the moment it says uh you know this nation and that nation is is is they are fussing with one another then we stop in we step in and says uh stop like the police can blow the whistle or the referee the empire you know praise the lord amen that's what abundance would do to a man praise the lord it has a spirit of envy that is warring against it and then he has a spirit of pride within when the spirit of envy appeared to your abundance if god don't give you grace the spirit of pride step out now i'm the one that can solve all their problems if you have a problem just give me a call praise the lord then the spirit of pride steps up oh glory be to god like i said i'll take my time this morning i'm i don't have a lot of energy but it's not energy we need we need a word amen let's let's let's take another thought here as we talk about the cycle of revival and death efficient age again is another piece here from efficient age now history keeps repeating itself why it keeps repeating itself because it's on the cycle yes sir praise the lord if the wheels don't turn on your car you don't worry anywhere praise the lord amen you can pedal all you want if it does not turn you are not going anywhere or if it's turning in you i mean maybe your chain is off or so now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of israel we see we see revival in one great generation only to see the fire fading in the next the book of judges will help us to see that in the history of israel we see revival in one generation just to see the fire fading up in the next because every time that god will raise up a judge he will raise up a man to deliver the people it would take not too long they will go back into complacency only to see in the tear generation an amber may be glory cycling by in the fourth generation there may be advantage whatever soul of the original flame then god light the fire again and the same process is repeating the cycle the cycle the cycle praise the lord it is simply the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren praise the lord because what happened is that these people that that experience the reality of god thinks that they can pass it down to their children by just telling them by just telling them they think that they can pass that reality down to their children by just telling them so verb is saying with this cycle it's the truth that god don't have grandchildren we can pass our experience down by lecture and testimony praise the lord amen because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord amen we can talk about uh you know what you know what uh with the prophet and you know god did when i gave my heart to the lord this is what happened all of those things are beautiful they are beautiful sometimes i think we we dwell on the glory we dwell on the glory when people are in tight us people are struggling with habits and things and we are here all you know how god filled me with the holy ghost and how god did this to me instead of getting down there and tell the person testifying or how god delivered me from lust and how god that this man that is struggling down with the same can say the god that delivered him that same god can bring me oh we like to talk about the horsetop everybody should see us how wonderful we are i mean the lord woke me up at four o'clock i woke up i sprayed for two hours and other days and and then you know and all of that verb says tell how the candle got lighted praise the lord maybe that maybe a flame will spark out of your testimony and it will light the next main candle amen glory be to god god don't have grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth praise the lord i have my children in the message what does that mean praise the lord amen what does that mean [Music] and you see those things and they get it in their head they are born in the message because we never talk about being born again so they take being born in the message as being born again praise the lord if you were talking about the life you were in before god gave you the new birth when you get born again that child is going to capture that thought and says i want the same god that my parents have praise the lord how i used to lie and how i used to stay how i used to run around and god got a hold of me praise the lord god don't have no grandchildren praise the lord he want to bring them through the same birth that he brought you through give them the same experience that he gave to you praise the lord such things has killed it has killed family life praise the lord because the the the parish you see the thing about it there is that you don't know i don't know how god is dealing with this brother or dealing with this brother i want to know how god is dealing with me and that's the same thing you don't know how god is dealing with your children so you cannot take your experience for their experience salvation is not passed by natural birth anymore then there is a truth in apostolic succession amen people that think because i was ordained by this person this person was ordained by this person this person was ordained by this person means that i'm in the truth praise the lord you can have god call man it was jesus that sent out his disciples and judas was among them when he commissioned them but yet he became the devil so no matter who lay hands on you not the one that lay hands on your head is the one that lay hands on your heart that matters it is in the word you start out with truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they are no longer just plain christians you hear people say well you know it's our time to enjoy we suffer for this gospel praise the lord they just show where they're on the cycle amen this is our time to enjoy we suffer for this gospel let me tell you those days praise the lord the devils of those days have not they are not dead yet amen they are not dead they have just become enforced we suffer for this message may god help us may god help us praise the lord when one generation come along they are no longer plain christians but but they they have taken a denominational name and now they have baptisms of melody etc that's exactly what they are too they are not christians you have to be born of the word of god not of the word of man to be safe praise the lord amen oh my now so you see all of that you look you look through the the you know uh the the history of the church you see these things keep repeating you know as i was as i was reading through history or i was actually listening to uh to an audiobook and i mean there are things that would be said i would say wow you know i was wow man i mean those those those guys like like even uh you know i was i was listening to other dating and and and heard about uh my tires you know people take their statement you know better balancing my tires never did nothing no he was a martin amen what happened is that on on a on a scriptural other there is not a place where he was involved now those apostles would not choose that man if they never thought that he was a man that had a credit among the disciples praise the lord amen even though scripture did not give an account but history have an account he died for this world he did not backslide it he did not betray his fate sometimes this is is when those one caught to your logic can put us in trouble you just read it one place and then you fly out with it you have an understanding now to be blasting people oh people we need to learn what a prophet ministry is praise the lord the cycle of revival and death praise the lord how god has raised man through the ages and he will move and do things praise the lord amen look at david came from a humble beginning he was just a boy following his father's sheep and israel at that time was on the threat of a man called goliath he all he had the entire nation spellbound let us not have bloodshed i just want only one man there is no need of destroying lives just one man if he killed me you rule over us that was goliath challenge just to have one man praise the lord the lord raised david up turning him at the backside of the desert everything he was going through it was because of that challenge praise the lord he got the head of goliath in one hand and got the sword of goliath in another hand because he never went with a sword [Music] and before he even got back to the town they have they have made new music there's a hymn where they where they put goliath i mean david name in him they are no longer singing about jehovah has delivered us now they have made a song david has delivered us david k 10 000. they're now singing his name praise the lord amen the place where god's name supposed to be in the song they took god's name out praise the lord all the singing the same way mighty warrior you are great in battle but they are not thinking about jehovah they're thinking about devi when they sing mighty warrior instead of thinking about the god of heaven and earth they are thinking about our pastor coming to preach this morning mighty warrior great in battle praise the lord they have got out of bondage spiritual faith is rising in the people liberty has come david it's crown king in the days when king used to go to war david became complacent and he decided to stay home and sleep i have fought i fought children i have fought come let me tell you how i came go live praise the lord amen you know how when story is told over and over sometime now you start to see things that were not in the story and you start adding it there oh children oh children i can tell you god was so real to me it was just like that morning i had a vision it was not a vision that took him there he was to carry food for his brothers but he became complacent and pretty soon he's down with uriah's wife he had to kill him and now he's depending on job and his man he's down to dependency that his his own son absalom is running him from the throne he's down to dependency don't depend on me in church don't depend on me praise the lord god is real and he's visible for every one of us we must all have access to god the cycle of revival now he's down to dependency see you here come come come now you have to go because you know attitude that god is his wisdom is just like an oracle you go and and and tell him this he's depending now on the men around him to bring him out of the bondage that his complacency has sent him back to oh my we can read on and read on i have to find a place here to close how to find a place here to close have we closed with this quote from faith brother you ought to have an old-fashioned rare heart prayer meeting a testimony meeting men and women out praying and house to housework and on the street doing something for god we have lost our zeal we have lost our love that is the aid jesus said it because iniquity shall abound the abundance of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold we are indulging ourselves in things that we should be ashamed of praise the lord we are indulging ourselves in things that we should be ashamed of because we want to make our kingdom here on earth praise the lord you have to remember the kingdom is in your heart it's in your heart that's the only affliction you will ever have of god is the one in your heart you can have all the world wherever you get one of the the martian there on beverly hills praise the lord a man that has that kingdom in his heart can live in his little apartment want a two-bedroom and have so much peace in his heart praise the lord why are you looking for deals and cheating how to pay for your beverly hills home praise the lord god can bless you in your little parsonage can bless you with a little sweet family give you the appreciate the privilege of having a vehicle to take you out and come back in but it's that kingdom where the king rules on the heart are we together musicians you can come we have lost our love we have lost there the things that god gave us the things that were dear to us the things that hide us on fire for god laying our face before god and seeking his face and crying out and saying oh god help me [Music] i need you we have all gone away from that we have become smart preachers because we get smart phones praise the lord become smart preachers because we're having all the apps we can just go there put in the word it gives us the scripture all it used to be when man was still on their knees and prayed and inspiration would break from heaven i'm not saying it from history i'm saying it from experience [Music] preachers get their their messages on their knees [Music] the revival [Music] the cycle of revival and the cycle of death what are we talking base we've been talking about possessing [Music] our vessel talking about uh our inheritance and our vase and getting over to the promise and experiencing god we have to realize that people went through those cycles [Music] when they got to the promised land they start to compromise and start to you know get into leagues with the nations around them that's how they lose their inheritance oh people of god [Music] jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] i believe we can experience him afresh every day because his mercy renew every morning we can get a fresh drink from the fountain of life every day you can get a fresh experience from god he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] praise the lord oh i pray that god like david said in the psalm revive my heart again lord revive my soul let those things that used to mean so much important become important back to me revive my heart again stir up my spirit back to falling in love with god back to seeking the face of god now being
