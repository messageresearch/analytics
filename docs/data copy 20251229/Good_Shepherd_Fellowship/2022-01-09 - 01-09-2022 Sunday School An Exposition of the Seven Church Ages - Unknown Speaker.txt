========================================

[Music] him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone and in this stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it each message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer encouraging him to be an overcomer and thereby be rewarded of the lord in this age the spirit is promising the hidden manna and a new name written in a white stone now since each of these messages is directed to the angel human messenger a very great responsibility as well as a wonderful privilege is his lot to these men god makes special promises as in the case of the twelve apostles sitting on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel then remember paul was given a special promise that of presenting the people of the bride in his day to jesus second corinthians 11 2 for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ so it will be with every messenger who has been faithful to the word of his hour and his age it will be so in the last day it will be the same special reward that was given to paul i think most of you remember how i said i had always been afraid to die lest i should meet the lord and he should not be pleased with me as i had failed him so many times well i had been thinking of that one morning as i lay in bed and suddenly i was caught up in a most peculiar vision i say it was peculiar for i have had thousands of visions and not once did i seem to leave my body but there i was caught up and i looked back to see my wife and i saw my body lying there beside her then i found myself in the most beautiful place i have ever seen it was a paradise i saw throngs of the most beautiful and happiest people i have ever seen they all looked so young about 18 to 21 years of age there was not a gray hair or a wrinkle or any deformity amongst them the young women all had hair down to their waists and the young men were so handsome and strong oh how they welcomed me they hugged me and called me their darling brother and kept telling me how glad they were to see me as i wondered who all those folks were one beside me said they are your people i was so astonished i asked are all these branhams he said no they are your converts he then pointed to one lady and said see that young lady that you were admiring a moment ago she was 90 years old when you won her to the lord i said oh my and to think this is what i was afraid of the man said we are resting here while waiting for the coming of the lord i replied i want to see him he said you can't see him just yet but he is coming soon and when he does he will come to you first and you will be judged according to the gospel you have preached and we will be your subjects i said do you mean i am responsible for all these he said everyone you were born a leader i asked him will everyone be responsible what about saint paul he answered me he will be responsible for his day well i said i've preached the same gospel that paul preached and the multitude cried we're resting on that yes i can see that god is going to give a special reward to his messengers who have faithfully discharged the responsibility he has placed upon them if they have received the revelation of the word for that age and faithfully preached in their day and lived what they preached they will receive a great reward now with this thought in mind look at the verse again i will give him the hidden manner we all know that the manna was angel food it was what god sent down upon the grass for israel at the time of their wanderings it was perfect food it was amazing how those little pellets of food kept them in perfect health no one got sick it was all they needed when the ark was made they put some of that manna into it then the ark was put behind the veil and only the high priest would dare approach unto it and then he had to have the sacrificial blood the bread from heaven symbolized by manna one day came down from heaven and became life for all who believe on him he said i am the bread of life i am the living bread that came down from heaven if any man shall eat of this bread he shall live forever when he went away he left us his word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god his word was bread it was the perfect manna which if a man live by he shall never die but right after the death of the fathers no one seemed to know the exact truth and in a short while this manner seemed to have become hidden to the people but in every age god began to give back by revelation that which was hidden until in this last day according to revelation 10 7 a prophet will come and reveal all the mysteries and then the lord will come now in each age i say the messengers received hidden truth but they did not receive it for themselves only but it is as it was when the disciples were asked to serve the multitudes loaves and fishes jesus gave them the broken food but they in turn gave it to the people god gives his hidden manna to the overcomer it cannot be otherwise he would not open his treasures to those who spurn what is already revealed what i have been saying about the messenger of each age receiving from god some of the original truth of pentecost is typed out in the old testament where moses was commanded to take up three and one-half pints of manna and place it in a golden vessel behind the veil of the holy of holies there the high priest of every generation could enter with sacrificial blood then he could take a small portion of this manna for it did not corrupt which was part of the original and eat it now in every age the messenger of the lord to that age was given the revelation of god for that specific period once the messenger was enlightened by truth he would bring that truth to the people and they whose ears had been opened by the spirit would hear that truth believe it and live it now then there is also the thought of the future partaking of the hidden manna i think it will be the eternal partaking of the revelation of jesus christ in the eternal ages to come how else could we begin to know the unsearchable riches of his own being all that we have longed to know all our unanswered questions all that will be revealed it will be from christ who is our life that we receive it oh sometimes we think we get to know a little of him and his word down here and it is so good it makes us rejoice but one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we had never dreamed possible it also says here that he is going to give the overcomer a white stone and in not on the stone a new name which the owner alone knows now the idea of a new name is a familiar one abram was changed to abraham saraya to sarah jacob to israel simon to peter and saul to paul these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change it was only after abram and sariah had their names changed by the lord but they were made ready to receive the coming son in jacob's case he had to overcome and then he was called a prince in the case of simon and saul when they had received the lord their change came and today each one of us true believers has had a change in name we are christians it is a name common to all of us but one day we will have another change we will of a certainty receive a new name it could well be that name was our true and original name written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world he knows the name but we do not one day at his good pleasure we will know also a white stone how beautiful here is another picture of this saint receiving recompense from the hand of god for his trials upon earth you know after constantine the false church was able to dip its hand in the state treasury and thereby erect beautiful buildings full of lovely statuary these statues made of white marble were actually roman idols renamed as saints the churches and their furnishings were exceptionally beautiful even as one sees today but god was not with them where was god he was with his saints in some little home or in a cave or some wild mountain area where they hid from the false church members they did not have beautiful buildings gowned choirs fine clothes and other worldly attractions but now in this special promise to the true believers of all ages god has declared he will give them rewards of great beauty and eternal duration let the wealthy look down on the poor let them give large sums to the church that it in turn might honor the donor by placing a marble plaque or some statuary in their honor on public display that all may applaud someday the god who sees and knows all will once more commend the widow for giving her all though it be but two might and he himself reward with the treasures of heaven yes hidden manner and a new name in a white stone how good is the lord to us to reward us so wonderfully and we so undeserving oh i want to be ready at all times to do his will and to lay up treasures in heaven chapter 6 the thiatian church age revelation 2 18-29 and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches thyatira historically the city of thyatira was the least noteworthy of all the seven cities of the revelation it was situated on the confines of missio and ionia it was surrounded by many rivers but they were full of leeches its most commendable feature was that it was well-off financially due to the corporate guilds of potter's tanners weavers dyers road makers etc it was from this city that lydia the seller of purple came she was paul's first european convert now the reason that the spirit chose this city as the one already containing the spiritual elements for the fourth age was because of its religion the major religion of thyatira was the worship of apollo tyram naos which was joined with the emperor worship cult apollo was the sun god and the next in power to his father zeus he was known as the averter of evil he presided over religious law and expiation means of atonement making amends for wrongdoing or guilt plato said of him he explains to men the institution of temples sacrifices and services to deities besides rights connected with death and after life he communicated his knowledge of the future and his father's will to man through the prophets and oracles in thyatira this ritual was conducted by a prophetess who sat on a tripod chair and delivered the messages while entranced the hold of this religion was remarkable its formidable power did not lie exclusively in the realm of mystery but lay in the fact no one could belong to the guilds which offered the people their living unless they belong to the temple worship of apollo anyone who refused to join in the idolatrous feasts and licentious orgies was barred from these first century unions in order to be a part of the social and commercial life one had to be a practicing pagan idolater it is most worthy of note that the very name thyatira means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world the wisest man the world ever saw was solomon and he said i applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even a foolishness and madness and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands who so pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this i have found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man amongst a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found ecclesiastes 7 25-28 paul said i suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp authority from the garden of eden onward woman has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man and right today it is a woman's world with the goddess of america being a naked female as the female idol falling out of the skies remember her arms were iron bars characterized the first or ephesian age so her power has grown until she has gained absolute authority such authority being usurped by her iron disposition now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pulpit which it is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she is of being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true and every man's word a lie amen let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one they were not a pair adam had been made in the image of god he was a son of god as a son of god he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so god took a byproduct of man to cause the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was produced from man and when god caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she is called the bride of christ on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god and on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and blue that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a and in this dietary and church age she is a dominating female she is mystery babylon she is the great she is jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to god christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the bibles and worthy essays of the godly she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over kings princes and nations controls armies and insists that she is the true body of christ and that her popes are the vicars of christ is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others she is the bride of satan and has produced his bastard child religions all through the dark ages she has dominated for over 900 years she plundered and destroyed she killed the arts destroyed the sciences produced nothing but death until the light of the truth was almost entirely gone and only the barest sliver of light remained the oil and the wine had almost ceased to flow but though she dominated the world kingdoms and demanded that all men find their citizenship in her there was a little group who belonged to god and their citizenship was in heaven and them she could not destroy god kept his little flock they could not be destroyed this church of rome was as heathen and wicked as queen aphalia who tried to destroy all the royal seed and almost succeeded but god preserved one and of him there came more of the faithful so god preserved a little flock in that long dark night and of their truth there finally arose a luther anyone who knows anything at all about the roman catholic church and its form of worship can tell why the city of thyatira was chosen by the spirit to represent the church in the dark ages there it is right before our eyes the age the thyatirian age lasted the longest of them all about 900 years from 606 to 1520 the messenger the church had long been split into two groups western and eastern every now and then a reformer would arise in either or both divisions and for a while lead some segment of the church into a deeper relationship with god such a man in the west was francis of assisi truly successful for a time his work was finally put under by the hierarchy of rome peter waldo of lyon a merchant who renounced his secular life became very active in serving the lord and drew many unto him but he was thwarted in his work and excommunicated by the pope neither the western or the eastern groups had within them a man who could possibly be the messenger to this age when examined in the light of scripture however there were two men in the british isles whose ministry in word and deed could stand the test of truth they were saint patrick and saint columba it was to saint columba that the lot of being the messenger fell though the messenger to the thiatarian age was saint columba i want to dwell a little on the life of saint patrick as an example to us and also to give the lie to rome's claim that st patrick was any more one of her than was joan of arc patrick was born to the sister of saint martin in the little town of bonavern on the banks of the river clyde one day while playing on the shoreline with his two sisters pirates approached and kidnapped all three where the sisters went no one knows but patrick his name was sucket was sold to a chieftain in northern ireland his duty was to tend the swine to do this he trained dogs so well trained were his dogs that many people came from far and near to buy them in his loneliness he turned to god and was saved then came the urgent desire to escape and return home to his parents he formed a plan that put his ability as a trainer to great use he taught the dogs to lie on him and cover his body carefully and not move until commanded thus one day when his owner sold several dogs patrick commanded the dogs except the leader of the pack to get into the boat the leader of the pack to which he then gave a secret signal ran off and refused to come aboard while the master and the buyer attempted to get the dog patrick got into the boat and signaled the dogs to cover him then with the whistle he brought the leader of the pack into the boat and on top of him since patrick was nowhere to be seen the buyer put up sale and moved out to sea after making sure that the captain was too far out to turn back patrick gave another signal to the dogs which caused them to riot then he came forth and told the captain that unless he would put him ashore at his home he would command the dogs to keep rioting and he would take over the ship however the captain was a christian and when he heard the boy's story he gladly put him ashore at his home there patrick went to bible school and returned to ireland whereby the word and the power of god in many signs and wonders he won thousands to the lord at no time did he ever go to rome nor at any time was he commissioned by rome the truth of the matter is that when rome finally gained a foothold on the island and when they saw the time was opportune they killed over 100 000 christians who had over the years grown out of the original group that had come to the lord under saint patrick about 60 years after the death of saint patrick columba was born in county donegal [Music] [Music] you
