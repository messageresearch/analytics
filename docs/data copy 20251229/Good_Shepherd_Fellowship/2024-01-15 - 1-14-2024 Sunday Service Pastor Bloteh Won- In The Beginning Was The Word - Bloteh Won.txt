read together let's read uh uh uh from uh verse one to verse 5 St John chapter 1 reading from verse one to verse 5 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehend it now let's pray together father We Just Want to Thank You Lord what a sacrifice of God what a love that you have placed in our hearts Lord that we can be able to love you that we

amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen we've been we've been speaking on uh uh the subject of in the beginning uh uh we've been going in between Genesis chapter 1 St John chapter 1 and first John and uh we just been traveling uh all between uh uh those chapters this morning we want to we want to talk talk on in the beginning was the word just like sorry just like John said in the beginning was the word we want to uh gave ourself a title this morning and said in the beginning was the word and uh uh uh okay now so as we as we look at the subject this morning and uh I wish that uh uh I was I was I could do a good teaching this morning instead of doing the preaching the the weather is just good for for for a good Bible teaching but we will try to do the best that we can this morning to be able to bring the word of God to you and uh uh talking about this subject of in the beginning and uh uh we've been we've been looking at it like I said uh from from from different place but this morning I want to look at it a little bit from the from the from the place of uh uh of information science and uh uh I hope the the the the young people can help us back there um praise the Lord if our our young technicians can look back there I just send you an image that has uh information measurement if you go back to your mail you will see it and if you see it and you can project it up for us uh that would be beautiful we want to start from there now the reason there is that uh we are we are we are in such an age the the the generation the age is is all to this place of uh of uh uh uh of information science we are in this age of uh uh uh you know technology and uh especially with the AI uh uh this artificial intelligence and uh uh and just to realize that the age the generation is dealing with this you will realize that uh as we will look into the subject this morning it is not strange that uh uh John will start his writing like I said from what he saw on the island of pmos that he was said in the beginning what was the word praise the Lord amen in the beginning was the word Microsoft gave us uh you know uh uh an engine that we can use to write you know and give us construction they call the word and uh uh and all of that I'm not I'm not a tech guide but uh uh I'm using my ignorance to to to speak on some of these things but uh uh uh as as uh as the technicians are working on that so you will see here that uh uh Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that was what we we read we we went into that direction last week Sunday but for some reason uh I got off of my my subject and then uh I started going uh in a way that I was inspired to go but you will realize what we were trying to bring to you is that uh uh you will see that there was a difference between verse one and verse two because verse one make us to know that God created the Heaven and the Earth and then verse two come and let us know that the Earth was without form and there was just darkness all over the Deep and uh so we show from the word Hebrew the Bible say all God works were finished from the foundation of the word and uh so the picture there in Genesis chap 1 verse one is that it shows the picture of the intelligence that's what I want to bring to you this morning the intelligence that was behind creation and that is the thing that defeat the the two the of evolution praise the Lord the thing that defeat the theory of evolution and all the theory of science the big bang and all of that is that you cannot have design without intelligence there cannot be designed you cannot have order without intelligence praise the Lord amen amen if you were not smart this morning you will not be dressing cute as you are but you did well though you did well your tie is not hanging in the back your tide is hanging right before you you might not be mashing but I mean you're not you're not butting your shirt at the back your shirt is butting in front of you and intelligence make you to do that you are not even wearing left and right shoes you could find the right foot to put your foot in and intelligence make you to do that you can never have order without intelligence praise the Lord so Genesis chapter 1 verse one is all about the intelligence that was behind the creation are we together amen amen are we together why why are we waiting now for our our our young technicians to to gather uh the information and share with us so that's that's what I want us to see and now uh uh John here in in in in St John he's pointing to that beginning he's pointing to Genesis chapter 1 and he says in the beginning was the word now we know that a word is a thought Express praise the Lord are you are you getting the picture the a word is a thought Express so uh uh there there are there are two words in the in the Greek that is used for word and that's that's what we want to dwell on this morning uh uh I'm I'm I'm a little bit getting ahead of myself beautiful beautiful I knew I knew that those those smart uh technicians back there will get it amen amen praise the Lord those young people they are they are very smart now so uh uh in the in the in the information science in the information word this is uh the way information is measured and uh uh you have uh the information here and uh contrary to the information they call the entropy and uh uh so in the way the the the the the measure information is in the sense that uh uh okay okay yeah it's in the sense that they says uh uh uh for you to get the right information let me say it this way let me let me bring it down to my own simple mind uh uh uh for us to get the right kind of information we have to have things in order let me say it that way and entropy that contrary to uh uh information it will be this order praise the Lord now uh uh you have you have you have signal that uh that that that signal you you know uh your your your filter go off on your your refrigerator it makes a sound and uh uh uh it makes a sound to Signal you that the filter is off you need to change it it keeps beeping uh your your fire alarm keeps beeping to make make you to know that there is smoke in the house it makes thinger praise the Lord but then when you get noise you really don't know what it is noise create confusion praise the Lord noise you are having uh more than one two three signs coming from every word it create confusion praise the Lord there there's there's some smart guys in this place that can break this thing down and make you to understand it better than I do amen but just bear with me praise the Lord the same thing with music and the same thing with uh uh uh uh Cosmos now you you hear Brother brandom use this word most of the time uh uh talking about the the word that was created the cosmos amen the cosmos now if you look in Genesis you will realize the Earth was without form and darkness was on the Deep what was that chaos praise the Lord when God brought an order to the word then it became a cosmos the word took shape the sun can come up at the time the moon can come up at the time the night and the day it took there was an order praise the Lord I have a I have a friend that always uh use this word actually this is this is is word the word cosmetic is taken from Cosmos praise the Lord amen so the sense behind it is that cosmetic is to bring order to our this praise praise the Lord is to bring order to our disorder and then uh you have design and then uh you have Randomness now so that is that is the measurement in the in in in the information word that's that's the way they look at it that's the way they look at it is it's a smart guy that built this thing I'm not the one that built it uh uh I I I took it from uh from just just looking at uh what he was presenting now so uh uh uh so when we get back over to Genesis chapter 1 I I really want you to grab that picture in your mind in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that's the first verse in the Bible God created the Heaven and the Earth and then verse two give us this picture of of of a disorder of a chaos Darkness was upon the Deep the water covered the face of the earth and the spirit of God moving upon the Water but then pretty soon we will see that God will bring an order he will separate the water from the land praise the Lord give the water his boundage this is how far you can come and then from the land he will brings out uh uh uh seeds and fruits and trees and and and and and animals and and and then he he he brought such an order that it became the Earth that was in in in in a place of chaos now became an Eden it became a paradise praise the Lord so this is what H H uh uh information science tells us there is always a drift from year to year as we stay in this life there will always be a drift from year to year praise the Lord amen amen example good good good example we have uh uh some of our sisters that dedicate time to come and clean the clean the church uh before we get here then uh they come on the weekend or sometimes during the week whatever time that work for them but uh you will realize that uh I mean uh uh uh uh they have to come they have to make a schedule to come why because every time it's clean uh uh before the next service they need to clean it because why it's dirty so we always have this drift praise the Lord amen amen arrange your closet put everything in order give yourself a week or two yeah there you go this order there is always a drift is we always leaning to that praise the Lord we're always leaning to that that's the reason why we have to put switch your phone off back there uh because I mean you are not intending to call anybody but if you leave your phone on is going to make noise and pretty soon everybody will be distracted why because we are always always drifted to that are you getting the picture I'm using this as a bit I want to I want to get a hold of you so don't think that I'm I'm smart I'm just using it as a bait so I can be able to get a hold of you and uh uh design that's that's one of the biggest thing that we want to dwell on year and uh and the reason why is that there is no design without an intelligence praise the Lord that's the reason why every every every close you word there is a TI on it and the t is to show you the intelligence is to show you the signature of the designer praise the Lord is to show you the signature of the designer even this our body has a tag on it if you look for it you will find it you find the signature of the designer in your soul praise the Lord now if if we if we despise design if we in know Design This is what the big the big bang the brings to us that the word from an exp explosion praise the Lord there was an explosion Randomness everything just happened it just happened and what you believe it or not is a spirit that is that is on the generation on this age it's a spirit that is on our Edge is it's something that is haunting every one of us us word people expect things to just happen amen they don't they don't believe in faith there is nothing like Faith but thingss can happen by Randomness things can just happen so if you if you if you go by Randomness you will also find Lock chance amen amen people want to be locked you know chains and all of those things we want we want those things to happen there's a place I'm getting to by bringing this to you in the beginning what the word in the beginning was the word and a word is a thought Express praise the Lord amen that's the reason why when you don't think before you speak you sound foolish even to yourself a word is a thought Express so keep that in your mind thank you thank you let's let's take this down let's move on a little bit praise the Lord I think uh uh like I said I was using that as a bit I think i' I've got I got a little bit of your attention let's let's look at uh uh uh that code on the SE shall not be heard let's let's take that as as a beginning year this is a late service so I'm not supposed to hold you late but I'm I'm praying that I can be able to say something that will be a blessing to you something that will also resonate with you see is not here with the shock like in the beginning God God dwelt alone because he was the innal one wasn't even God he wasn't even God because God is an object of worship and the logos pay attention to this and the logos as we call it the word that went out of God like I said it's one of the words in the in the Greek that is used use for word when a word is spoken it's logos there is another word that is used in the Greek when the word is spoken is called Rema that is uh r h e m a Rema and lust is just as it is spelled there l o g o s now the difference between Rema and logus is reman is any word that is spoken a word that is spoken it's a reman logus is a word that is spoken with the thought behind it it was it was very strange that uh I checked through uh uh as I was studying last night I search All Through uh the best that I C I never found brother Brandon using the word Rema he never used the word Rema and the reason it hits me because Rema is uh is I I I will give you an example a very good example of Rema and I just I just added to my note while I was in the office this morning even though I was looking at it last night but a very good type of reman is Matthew chapter 4 okay Satan came tempting the Lord Jesus and told Jesus that it is written he was cutting what is written he's saying to Jesus what is in the psalm he's quoting from the psalm that it is written the Lord will give his angels praise the Lord and Jesus said to him it is also written so when Jesus said it is also written Jesus was using the logos when Satan said it is written he was just reading what is written but there is no good intention behind it when God said in Jeremiah I know the thoughts I know my thoughts towards you which mean every word that I have spoken to you I have a positive intention behind it are you seeing the difference it is not just speaking a word what is the T behind it what is the motive what is the intention are we together in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the word we'll do it a little bit here I mean we will we will pick up uh uh a little bit here on on the reman and uh and the logos but let's go ahead here with this reading and the logos as we call it the word that went out of God anyone knows there that was the angel of the Lord now that's what I'm I want you to pay attention to because there is a connection here there is a connection and uh uh I I will I will we will talk about it but just pay attention the logos as we call it the word that went out from God he says John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise the Lord amen it's easy to see a trinity it's not a trinity there is nothing about Trinity there it's all about expression it's all about expression Hebrews chapter 1 let's read Hebrews chapter 1 quickly there is nothing about three person no it's not three person is one person expressing himself are we together Hebrews chapter 1 Hebrew chapter 1 verse 1 God who has Su times and inav manner speak in time pass unto the fathers by the prophet have in these last days spoken unto us by his son now that word his son if you look at it you will what will come to your mind is Jesus of Nazareth that's what would come to your mind when you think about his son what would come to your mind is Jesus of Nazareth but don't make that conclusion yet until we finish reading let's go ahead again have in this last day spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed Hees of All Things by whom also he made the word so what what what Paul is saying here he's trying to say that the son that God is now speaking unto us by is the same one by whom he made the he created the word so that was not Jesus of Nazareth that was the lust are we together praise the Lord let's go ahead a little bit it will explain itself whom also he made the words who being the brightness of his glory this is what I wanted to give their Express image their Express image when God was expressing himself from from thought to being when he was expressing himself from being invisible to visible that is what is called a son you are a son of God because you are expected to be an expressed image of God people must see you and says he's a child of God she's the daughter of God praise the Lord you must have some sense of expression that's that's that's where the word Christian derived from they saw their lives and they said these were Christians they look like Christ they live like Christ they talk like Christ it's an expression it's not a title Christianity is not a title it's an expression praise the Lord amen you must not tell people you are Christian they must say you are Christian they should call you Christian now you carrying yourself as a title on your back I'm a Christian no they should look at your life and said she has an expression he has an expression that is different the express image that is what is called the son praise the Lord am hallelujah praise the Lord are we together do you see the picture amen so let's go back to our qut now so you can be you can be able to follow follow the expression God expressing himself and the logos as we call it the word that went out of God anyone know that that was the angel of the Lord now he says it was the lust and he say it was the angel of the Lord let's go on again all the word the word of the Lord so he's saying the angel of the Lord or the word of the Lord praise the Lord amen that follow Israel through the Wilderness the angel of the Covenant the lust that went out of God and then that logos was made flesh ured Among Us that was when it took on the name Jesus Christ when it took on flesh and dwell Among Us that's when it took on the name Jesus Christ but it was traveling right from the beginning when it came out of God it took that first form as a light an amber color light the logos is the same as the angel of the Covenant it was the amber color light that came in a burning bush and just blessed it became a burning bush to Moses praise is the Lord it was the Amber cut of light in the night it Shine over Israel as a pillow of fire in the day it was covered by the cloud it became the the the the pillar of cloud it's not it's not different thing it's that same logos from the beginning praise the Lord are we together it's the same lust that took the form of a constellation of stars that led the wise men are we together what is the logus let me say in another way so so we can be able to understand it whenever the thought of God taketh form praise the Lord that's the reason why you will hear that statement the pillow of fire became a man amen amen the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel in the wilderness one day met Joshua as the captain of the Lord hor because the Bible says when they enter into the into the promised land the pillar of fire ceased to show by night but one day Joshua met this man and he says who are you identify yourself are you for us or are you against us and the angel said I'm the captain of the Lord Joshua knew definitely that that was the pillow of fire he did the very same thing that Moses did he took off his shoes he bowed his hair down and he washed so whenever the word takes a form whether it takes a form of a man or the form of a woman that is God's expression are we together that's the reason why we don't need to break God into three to believe him he don't have to be a trinity he came down as as the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost he broke himself into many 120 after 3,000 belief he broke himself up God can break himself up and he can gather himself again that's what make him Almighty we don't have to set him here a father set him here a son this same Catholic Church gives to us it has just blown and ruined our spirit that may can never get H H close to God we always want to go through somebody when God is expressing himself he's expressing himself trying to bring himself so close to us no we want to go through somebody we always feed ourself on water to get into his presence I rather go through the pastor I go through the church or I go through this belief or go through that belief it's the expression of God when God Express himself praise the Lord because he had a thought when he left internity to begin time he had a thought he had a plan and it was the Plan of Redemption what was the Plan of Redemption to express his attributes they will come as lost Sinners and he will find a way to bring them back to him that's why Jesus says all the father has given me will come praise the lord we don't have to beg you to be a child of God we don't have to pay you to be a child of God if the see of God in you you will come if God have to drag you and bring you by a sick bed he will bring you whichever way you come we will say receive you you are one of ours we will love you but it better you come nice just just come the way you are now praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the picture I'm sure that my bed will have work now I got you I can preach amen prise the Lord so the lust the word that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness the angel of the Covenant the lust that went out of God and then that lust that logos that went out of God one day to all the prophets he was coming in portion but one day that word took on flesh praise the Lord amen that word took on flesh are we together that word took on flesh let's go let's let's continue to read now we are in St John 1 that's where we are in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and now as he gave his life for us then his Spirit come back upon us Jesus said at that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me see is God all alone is God all alone it's God all alone it have to be God for you to believe this word word it have to be God for you to conform to this word let me tell you you are not the believer God is the believer in you that's the reason why we must be dead in Christ dead in our life hid in Christ is God all alone it's being God that's been watching you from the dead you were separated from your mother's womb it was God that saved you from the terrible whatever thing you are that that could have cost your life it has been God all alone just trying to express himself to you see me see me I'm the one but we don't see it we see this person we see that person we see this money we see that thing and and I mean because uh uh uh our our our human brain our sight in the back of our brain I I don't know what it call it there the doctors will explain it to you but uh uh uh it's it's built to be able to capture an image either in a form of a shape or by colors praise the Lord that's the reason why when you when you are explaining the supernatural to people if they cannot push a shape or a color if they can if they can put it together in a design work it can make sense to their brain they can believe it right but the supernatural don't make sense to the brain the supernatural makes sense to the soul praise the Lord if then God all theone God manifesting himself walking himself through different ages so that three Father Son and the Holy Ghost seem God working in three attributes that's all that's all you're never going to get to heaven and see a throne for the father and see the son sitting there and the Holy Ghost sitting there that's one of the teaching from from from from the church that that has put this separation because because we we can never be able to find our sunship to God our sunship to God has always been tied to something because we are member of the church so we are Son of God the day we leave the church we are no longer Son of God why it's it's it's it's it's Trinity doctrine that have created that Gap praise the Lord but it have just been God expressing himself or alone while we were yet sinners he expressed himself on the cross of Calvary praise the Lord amen is God expressing himself and we today are one the church itself an attribute of God thinking before the foundation of the word to have a church so those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning that was his thought and his thought is his attribute so when John said in the beginning was the word praise the Lord the word was with God which mean Elohim was dwelling with his thoughts amen Elohim was dwelling with his attributes in him it's not a father son holy ghost story in the beginning was the word the word is a thought Express the word was with God Elohim was dwelling with his thoughts are you seeing the picture and he's going to express he's going to express it so the very same thing here we show you in that information measurement and and leaving from order to disorder when God dwell as as a self-existent God when he was alone there was no chaos praise the Lord amen there was no chaos he was by himself he was the Fountain of all Perfection praise the Lord The Fountain Of Truth glory be to God but now he choose to to express himself what was in his mind to bring it to to manifestation are we together praise the Lord I don't know about you but I'm enjoying this I'm enjoying it not because I'm preaching it I'm enjoying it because it's be it's it's it's beginning to to bring out the some shap more clearer to me praise the Lord is beginning to bring out the sunship more clearer to me Hallelujah in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God are we together let's read a little bit here we'll take something on the church ages be to get through that and and let you go home home once again thank you I appreciate each and every one of you for coming praise the Lord amen let's take this the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as uh as it was back in the days of our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live praise the Lord Jesus never distressed the importance of Works signs and wonders as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works will follow amen he says the word that I speak unto you they are life and they are Spirit he said if you if you doubt what I say SE the scripture go go back to the word his emphasis was the word go back to the word SE the scripture because he knew that if you get the word that that that will reveal to you your original identification you won't run after SS and wonder you won't run after all of this because it's the word that produces it but s say that we have we have a generation we have an age where a church will run its whole program on Miracles and signs and prosperity and then no word right no word let's read down a little bit now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible Drift from the word in the pagamos age which was as yet 2,000 years of uh the pathal vision he knew that DFT who caused him to go into the Dark Age the pamis church age was the Dark Age uh we will we will show you a picture here just now he knew that the way man originally got away from God was first to was first by leaving the word praise the Lord amen yeah when other things start occupying our mind and we start putting emphasis on other things more than the word you will see it no one have to tell you you will see it your prayer life will be gone the interest in the word the respect to the word of God will be gone the way that man leave God has always been leaving the word right and a way to come back to God is always coming back to the word praise the Lord there's no way I can I can I can overemphasize that than then it has been said but let's go ahead a little bit here he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leing the word Genesis 3 tells us there they left the word if you leave that word you have left God praise the Lord you can be in the church you have left God right if you leave the word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the to to to to the church at P Gamers and indeed to all the churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst praise the Lord if you want deity in your midst what is deity the fullness of God if you want to experience the fullness of God not just a partial God by making church playing music and then we come and just give you some lecture make you laugh but if you want to experience the fullness of God Amen the fullness of God in healing the fullness of God in transformation the fullness of God in overcoming praise the Lord the fullness of God in Deliverance if you want deed in your mess then welcome and receive the word because in the beginning was the word if you want deed in your M welcome and receive the word praise the Lord open your heart and open your mind to the word it can change you why because it's the word that form you amen it's the word that form you I don't I don't know how how men think that they can enjoy this word that is made when they reject the word that has made the word okay the word of God created the universe and then we are going to just put away the word of God and then we will enjoy the universe praise the Lord if you want de in your mid then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone don't let don't ever let anyone not even me praise the Lord don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and the word this which I'm going to give you the word is the revelation of myself that's Jesus speaking to the church now is the revelation of myself I am the word remember that in the beginning was the word word are we together in the beginning was the word the intelligence of God praise the Lord he said let every seed bring forth of its kind he designed it in such a way that every seed is going to bring for of his kind men try to hybrid and mix it together and and and and and you know and and produce lemon and Apple at the same time are we together but such an intelligence that is impossible for you to put a mango seed to the ground and get an Apple the intelligence behind it said every seed must bring forth of his kind you can't beat that intelligence you can beat it the intelligence said let the water separated from the land and when that intelligence drew the water back it gave the water the boundary say stands right here that's your limit you you can come and visit and go back praise the Lord you can come and visit ride away and visit but you must go back I give you your limit the intelligence of God praise the Lord that's the reason why David said the heavens declared the glory of God when I look at the heavens the design the design that is in the heavens tell me there is an intelligence that put it together it did not hang there by itself praise the Lord amen now you think about it now think about it y say we are in an age I know I'm getting out of time but uh let me let me just get to this year because it's part of my thoughts notes Here y say we in a time where science is is is is hitting us it's like it's like they are they they they are overrunning us they're running over us with this new technology of of AI this new h h h h uh uh artificial intelligence is just it's it's overtaking praise the Lord amen whe whether whether you believe it or not it's overtaking people it's the time that we are living in it's the it's the direction where the word is going AI is telling you that uh the they have a they have a place where they are going to bring millions of babies in the word they're going to bring millions of babies in the word for the long time uh uh the the the science and health industry has been you know as as much as they have been donating blood they have been donating H H hog gem cells sperm cells and all of that a is telling you that we have create artificial wom and we're going to bring millions of babies in the world praise the Lord amen have you ever got on your phone I I know you have done it but let me ask the question maybe I'm the only dumb person have you ever got on your phone and you are talking to this customer service person praise the Lord and uh my name is BL one I don't hear it please repeat my name is blooded one I don't hear it please repeat my name is BL one you say what one no my name is you are getting angry you think there you talking to a human and you getting mad these people this people can you hear can you hear me if you would just realize that you talking to uh a remote you just come to your you organize yourself and don't get mad for nothing because you just carry your blood pressure off for nothing sound funny to you sound funny to you praise the Lord but think about it we in such a Time word science is is pouring this thing out us I mean they don't they don't they don't need man they will tell you says no man fot is touching the ground before let there be problem in the world like the way there is problem in Israel now America are finished sending troops of soldier now they don't need anybody to go they don't need anybody to go they having robots men that are standing on God they can stay right there give a command send this thing straight to that place they're going to send the mea there they don't need men on the ground anymore are we together what you believ it or that whether you are interested in it or that is the world that you are living in praise the Lord it is the intelligence that sends the door when you get there the door open you don't have to touch the door anymore to open it it's a sensor that sensor and intelligence has been placed in that sensor to be able to sense your presence that's the word that we are living in and we see all of these things Siri where is the closest restaurant the closest gas station Siri rout your phone yeah my own is rewriting right here sorry Siri I'm not talking to you I was supposed to have say something El and it's rerouting and and pretty soon it tells you right there oh it's in 2.3 M oh it's right around the corner right and we enjoy it we get so fascinated with that praise the Lord but you see the thing there is that the thing about it is that those gadgets they don't have a brain of their own they have used the intelligence of a fallen Son of God they are they have used the intelligence of a fallen child of God a man whose mind has been so gravitated to invention praise the Lord it don't have a brain of its own it only do what the intelligence has failed it to do praise the Lord amen amen the intelligence the intelligence do not feel the the Meer amen and say when you go down there on the target if if if it is just children don't bomb right watch watch and see if there is children or innocent people no the intelligence only told the mea what what intelligence will placed in it be accurate on the target right right if they would have if they would have been smart to say go there and watch take a sensor and watch if there are women and children turn around don't blast that that means that will do that but they did not give it they give it only limited knowledge him at the Target and do your work so when it gets there whether they innocent people are not going to explode why because that's what it was fair to do are we together I hope that gave you a picture amen I hope that give you a picture it's almost like uh uh yeah let me let me not go down that R let me let me just stay right here praise the Lord let me just stay right here and that's the word that we are living in but yet when Jesus said ask the father anything in my name ask the father anything in my name and believe that you have received it it LO so hard for us but it's very easy to take up your phone and say Google it's easy right it's easy one little Chinese boy or whoever I mean they are not the only smartest people have just you know faced that Gadget and it looks like I can just go on my phone and and order whatever I want but the creator of Heaven in Earth say ask ask me praise the Lord do you think it's possible to talk to God the same way you talk to your phones it's possible it's possible the reason that is that we have come to to to to to to to Believe In Our gget Praise the Lord man we so believe in it that when we go with our a is like we don't have life where's my phone oh my God I can't I can't believe that I left my phone it's almost like everybody in the world has died from you they just send you a news that the bomb has blasted your whole generation just because you don't have a cell phone we go so sick we have become so gravitated to it it's every day part of our life that's the first thing we pick up to look at the look at the time nothing wrong with the that I do that every morning my phone have bunch of different uh alarms that go off of different things I want to do so when it rings I take it up to see which one maybe I slept through the other one there's nothing wrong but I'm just trying to say the way we are so gravitated that's the reason why we believe that if you ask Google Google will give it to you right praise the Lord but we can be also so gravitated to the word that's where he's drawing us to he's drawing us to that place that I don't have to wait for the church service I can be right in my home right in the kitchen uh uh uh wherever I am I can be right there and say father I need your grace I need a help from you I need strength from you I can be right there and say Lord I have mess a big time have mercy upon me right praise the Lord the Bible says he ever so night if we can confess with our mouth that Jesus is Christ and believe in our heart that's why Paul says in the Book of Romans so what are we talking about here let's let's let's find a place in close so so I will not bore you out but let me read this again if you want deed in your mess then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and th word this which I G this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that now this statement comes I spoke on this before I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst the word we have we spoke a little bit of that on Wednesday night the word we call the message are we impressed are we sufficiently impressed of this word that we have in our midst praise the Lord are you impressed of the word that you have believed when you say I believe in God I believe in Jesus Christ are you impressed can you look at your life and say thank God thank God that I made that choice or are you still looking at your life and you are wondering what what what are you doing what are you living a double life you are claiming one thing but you are not fully involved in it you are not giving yourself to it are we sufficiently impressed can you say if if there's another life to live if I die and there is no Heaven I should come back on Earth I want to live this life of a Christian again can you say that to yourself praise the Lord amen or you wish that you come back and come back as a Hollywood star I we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I will leave that and then uh I'll share this with you and then we close last week Sunday we we share the the image of Nebuchadnezzar if uh if our our young tech people can put that up again for us the image of Nebuchadnezzar we share that with you beautiful beautiful this was representing the Gentile Kingdom there are there are some things that I'm gathering together uh uh uh on this share with you if you if you are paying attention uh uh we we've been playing uh the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation that's why we are playing for Sunday school so if you want to find a time and and play it you know by yourself and steud through it but that is the tip that we playing for Sunday school and uh uh uh we have cancer that this morning because of the weather now so uh uh we we we we spoke about this last week and and and and what we pointed out here is that uh the image grew harder as it left gold saver brass iron it grew harder okay it went from a softer uh uh element to one that is harder than it and Brass is more harder and then iron is more harder from brass and thing we pick up on the image last week uh was that uh there was a stone that was caught out of the mountain that came and smashed the image image here yeah on his feet and the image fell in Daniel vision and then when the image fell there was a huge mountain That Grew right from here up now so the image came from up down and The Rock HD it on the feet now when when God gave Daniel this Vision if you see here the head of gold represent Babylon and uh the breast is is the m and Persian and Greek these are all Gentile kiddom so God gave Daniel a vision concerning the Gentiles now you have to realize that God been dealing with the Jews since he called Abraham he was the first Hebrew and God de with them all alone but y said he's giving Daniel that is the reason why the dream troubled Daniel he he couldn't even remember the dream h no sorry the dream troubled Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar was the one that had a dream it's it's written right here how couldn't I see that Nebuchadnezzar was the one that had the dream and it it troubled him and Daniel was the one that interpreted said the dream get it right brother one you should get it right Don't Preach something different to the people now so uh uh but the the the dream year was representing the Gentile Kingdom where we are right here we are right in this place this is where we are okay we are in this place of uh of of of Papa room that turned over to Pagan room and and all of that we find time to explain that to you but what I wanted want us to see is that this was speaking about the Gentile Kingdom now you have to remember that Jesus told us that uh uh uh he talks about the time of the Gentiles he talks about the dispensation of the Gentiles are we together amen that's what I want I want you to remember there so this was speaking about the political Powers ACC calling to according to uh uh uh biblical prophecy when you really want to talk about superpower these are the Nations that you mention according to the scripture according to the to the scripture America is not a superpower she just a puet in the hands of Rome praise Lord according to prophecy these are the superpowers of the word that have gone on and on and we write down here okay but when the The Rock Crut this image at the feet the Bible says there was another Mountain that grew up it grew up so this was smashed down and the mountain started coming up and started coming up and started coming up and it became a huge mountain praise the Lord so we will use another image here and that image is uh uh an image that is tied to the the the the church ages and uh and and uh and the virtues over in in the book of Peter the seven the the stature of a perfect man so I I I took that I ask I asked us to look at it okay now so uh a beautiful picture here of of the stature of a perfect man now the reason why I brought this is because the mountain That Grew From Where the image was crushed it speaks of the spiritual Kingdom of the Gentiles the natural kingdom was smashed by a rock caught out of the mountain and in the scripture a rock is what Christ amen so he hid the the the the the the the image at the feet the natural Kingdom the natural Powers over the Gentile to break it down because he has promised to get a people out of the Gentile for his name sake so after that image fell God started building a spiritual Kingdom through the seven Church ages in the Book of Revelation are we together so it started from the Ephesus Church age and you know up to the seventh Church age so it grew as a mountain it went from one age to another are we together are you seeing the picture amen I almost said is uh anybody have a question I almost said that but I know if I said that we would not leave from here today so if you have a question just write it down amen write it down and then we will be able to address I almost said it but if I I have said it then we would not uh we would not leave from here so yes yes the seven Church age ages here that's that's the Gentile spiritual Kingdom now there's a reason why I could explain all of this to you we'll get back to it let's let's not run very fast I just wanted to show you the mountain That Grew so you see the image came from up down but God started building this mountain from Faith up to brotherly kindness and and uh love so uh uh that's the picture but this is the reason why I brought this picture let's let's let's let's take the picture from there and then uh if my young people back there would give me the quote on Christ is revealed in his own word we will read that and then we close are we together amen are we together let's let's read that Christ has revealed in his own word and then we will close listen to this see down Through the Ages we started off from the foundation from the first church Edge that was the picture that I show you the first church age the Ephesus Church age that was when Paul went out and he and he told the the the the the the Jewish councel he say seeing then you have refused the law we turn unto the Gentiles that was when he and barabra started their first uh missionary meeting out of out of that the Church of epo was born so the spiritual kingom started building right from there from the first church age when the seed went to the ground the complete seed which seed was that Christ the complete seed it was Christ the lust in body Christ he went to the ground he he he resurrected after three days and that seed unto us is The Incorruptible seed which is the word of God are we together amen when the sea went to the ground their complet SE then then it uh uh it come out through the feet now it was the feet that was hit so definitely it has to start from the feet are we together amen amen it it started from the feet Luther comes out through Wesley then to Pentecost the tongue in the L now brother called that because it was in the Pentecostal age where the gifts were were returning back to the church and it started speaking to tongues I mean started speaking in Tong speaking to tongues speaking in tongues now so you you you see that H H uh right there that uh uh uh uh he's he's kind of for building the spiritual image he's giving us a picture he's creating an image for us to look onto that when the natural Kingdom when the political powers of the Gentile was crushed by the revelation of Jesus Christ then God started building a spiritual Kingdom revealing himself to the Gentiles the Gentile received the same holy ghost that the Jews received on the days of Pentecost I can show you in the scripture you know what Peter said Peter said I wish that we receive it the way the Gentile receive it because the Gentile receive it by just the preaching of the word why Peter preached this word the Holy Ghost fed upon them praise the Lord God was building a spiritual Kingdom so brother Bram yet is giving us a picture because he's bringing us to a place and let's get to there quickly and I let you go then in the Pentecost the tong in the L SE now now it's in the eyes prophetic now so what is he doing he bringing us down from the legs and he bring us here to our mouth the Pentecostal speaking in tongues the next intelligence after the mouth is the eye which of course he called the prophetic age the eye is the seal the image is building but where I want to bring you this morning is to this place malacha 4 and now there is nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into death yet cuz that is the last thing there is the next thing after the eyes is the intelligence praise the Lord the next thing after the the you you know the thing about the thing about it is is that yes's a prophet of God saying this thing years back back in 1962 1963 he's saying he's saying these things and Y said that we are now living in an age where science is telling you that it's an intellectual age it's an intelligence age science is telling you that we are living in an age where intelligence is going to detect you praise the Lord a prophet of God was saying it he was telling us that God is bringing his church to the place where this bride will be honor the intelligence of Jesus Christ Hallelujah sons of God are led by the spirit we not be making our own choices we'll be bringing everything back to the word will be honor the intelligence of Christ he told us that maybe we didn't catch it then but science is now telling you that you living in a world where artificial intelligence will detect to you whether you like it or not you will be honor the influence of one intelligence or another if you are not falling under the intelligence of Christ where you are glued to the word and you're ready to obey the word you will obey somebody's intelligence praise the Lord you don't want to do it don't use GPS that's somebody intelligence that is detecting to you yeah praise the Lord oh you are following men you have to follow somebody that's right you have to follow somebody why rather follow the one like Paul says follow me like I follow Christ praise the Lord you will have to follow some kind of intelligence and intelligence will be detected to you it will tell you the time it will tell you the weather praise the Lord amen if you have the one that can tell you your blood pressure how your heart is beating please don't walk fast walk slow and you start walking slow no my monitor say my heart is beating too fast I must walk slow praise the Lord you will be controlled by an intelligence in this age that we are living in whether you like it or not whether you like it or not work put your money in the bank call the bank they put some kind of artificial intelligence on talk to them praise the Lord they ask you all the question ask you for your name your birthday where everything everything then they come back again asking you the same question praise the Lord can you wait that we find uh uh a live representative to talk to you and then while you are waiting on the phone can you please tell me your name again is this this person I'm talking to and then you yeah you you you becoming nice because you want your own money you put in the bank so you got to be nice today artifici your voice on the phone yes yes yes praise the Lord can we say yes yes Lord to the word can we say yes when God speak to your heart can we say yes yes a prophet of God telling us when God was building his spiritual Kingdom he brought us to an age where he introduced a prophet a SE of God came on the scene open the Myster of God he says but above that it has to be the intelligence itself which is Christ the logos we are back again to St John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God that's the intelligence of God he's telling us we are going right back again but there will be there there's a people on Earth that will be influenced by the intelligence of God praise the Lord there will be influenced by the intelligence of God they can say he know my name he know knows my every touch praise the Lord why should I worry when he knows all about me there will be influence they honor that influence of God's intelligence praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you musicians you can come that's what I wanted to bring you this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord please if you are clapping for me thank you
