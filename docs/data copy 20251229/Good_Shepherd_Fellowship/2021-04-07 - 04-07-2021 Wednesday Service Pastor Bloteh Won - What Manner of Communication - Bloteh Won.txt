gratefulness and we want to stand in our place tonight with gratefulness and thank the lord for for blessing us also we want to thank brother khalid and his wife for coming and making the weekend special celebrating the weekend with us praise the loss in luke chapter 24 we will read from verse 13 the familiar scripture as all the bible's pages in the bible is becoming familiar to us but we will remind ourselves here over this passage in luke chapter 24 we read from verse 13. and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emails which was from jerusalem about three for long and they talked together of all these things which have happened and it came to pass that why they commune together and reason jesus himself drew night and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication at this that you have one to another as you walk and i said let us pray heavenly father lord jesus we want to approach you by your word for lord father god you hear our voice only through your blood and father god is your word echoing back to you so father we come tonight lord with gratefulness in our hearts once again lord to say thank you father lord because only eternity will remind us of the blessings of the weekend dear lord we just want to trust ourselves in your hands father and and pray that god your grace lord will will bless us now lord god as we just look at this portion of verses that we have just read come father lord and speak to us encourage us tonight lord brought us closer to you we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord i praise the lord but call it go and sit by beside your wife praise the lord amen well the uh we really enjoy their company enjoy their visit with us and and i guess uh both of them will we appreciate your prayers that you keep them in your prayers lord we bless them as they travel hoping to visit again praise the lord amen but you see uh a few years back after we came out of our memorial day meeting meetings we decided that we will we will start these uh easter meetings and he came uh like i told you he came to me as a personal conviction even though brother brother prater you know when we talked uh you know we we joke around and and he try to make it like my personal doctrine but i said it's not a doctrine it's just my personal conviction i feel that it's a good thing for me as a pastor to spend easter with the church because i was traveling for most easter meetings but you see the thing about it their church is that it's not just to have a special meeting it's not just to have a convention or whatever term we want to give it but it is the importance that we put to it you know i heard brother branham saying that uh easter is the only which of course we know is the only christian holiday that there is praise the lord easter is the only christian holiday that there is the only truth christian holiday is easter and we know it is all because of the resurrection i will tell you something i'll share something with you uh uh uh you know even as we come to the to the uh the month of april uh you realize that god told the children of israel in uh in establishing the easter where he will he will you know tell them give them the ordinance of the passover he told them that this will be the beginning of months amen which was the month of abba he says this will be the beginning of months god was establishing a new calendar he was establishing a new day if it is the beginning of months then it is the beginning of the year praise the lord amen so he told them and said this will be the beginning of months and we know that uh uh you know in the jewish calendar is the man of abba and and and actually it is what uh uh you know that is that is that is taken as as april this is springtime is the beginning of life amen that's what spring is but right now we are we are under uh uh a different calendar we are on the uh how we would call it uh you know our gentle a gregorian calendar now in changing that what uh uh history would tell us is that when the when the king or the emperor gregory would change the calendar over to what we have january going on there was something that happened that many of us don't know and i'll share with you tonight and that was back in 1582 when when uh when france swished from the julian calanda to the to you know to the gregorian calendar what happened is that because the jews has started beginning the year with what we would call april or abba that was the beginning of months with them so uh when this calendar was changed and and they decided to start the beginning of the year from january right in there that's word this little uh what terms to be a joke or how you call it whatever way you want to call it april food that was when it was introduced now you have to realize that just as as uh naomi brought ruth into uh lefty hand and and then she met a boss that that is the same way the jewish church brought the blessing of abraham to the gentile people praise the lord so the early christians head on to the judean calendar they were doing everything according to the judean calendar because that is the history of the church so when this calendar change took place the early christians were still hauling to april 1st as the beginning of their year praise the lord amen so when that time comes just like we have the chinese new year and and different you know groups have their new year when that time of the year comes even though every one of them keep this january to december calendar but for certain reasons they will celebrate that time of the year as the beginning of their new year what are japanese china china whatever group it is but to the early christians they were still respecting april first but that's where the slogan april fool came so the early christians were called fooled for honoring the beginning of months as the beginning of their year praise the lord amen so april fool it is not just a general joke it was a joke to mark the christians praise the lord it was a joke because even though they has changed the calendar and this king said well it's no longer the first of of of april we're going to start from the first of january that will be the beginning of the year but these christians decided that they would still honor the 1st of april because that was the beginning of months in honor of the passover that was speaking of the resurrection praise the lord amen so the the the the the the easter celebration goes back now why am i saying this is because just like we were saying is dripping with blood there are people that have gone through criticisms you hear brother branham says uh uh uh they call the church holy roller and and all of that i mean that that word holy roller was actually an insult amen it was an insult on the church praise the lord are we together so you realize that these early christians they had to go through different things so we can be able to have a faith today but when it comes to the last day of church we bring all of these jokes what was a a criticism and an insult to the man that was standing for truth is now something that is lied to us are we together praise the lord in other groups you see the the the the the mohammedans the muslim they they they love and celebrate the ramadan praise the lord and when it comes to that time they don't care how many a dollar you paying them when it comes to that time they have to celebrate it and different other groups you know you get uh the buddhists that have their time to celebrate but when it comes to the resurrection it comes to easter the the hope of your faith praise the lord you know what the church gives us easter eggs palm sunday we town time leaves together when it's supposed to be a sacred moment for us it's supposed to be a time where we pull ourselves back a person will say if i would take my vacation from work i take it on easter and i will set that time aside if i have to just sit home even there if there is no convention let me just spend that time to appreciate the lord jesus for what he did for me all the religion that has no life in it go to places like liberia where the where where the the the the transportation is run by muslims time for the ramadan everybody stay home because they are not driving they are not going to be taxes meant for you because they have to celebrate their ramadan but you water down the hope of your faith so when you say april fool you are saying it to yourself praise the lord but i want to thank you for coming this weekend thank you for making the the service special praise the lord i know people how to how to juggle around their jobs and different things but we appreciate you amen but until it becomes a revelation to you we just have to remind you god has to quicken it in your heart he has to make it real praise the lord paul says if there be no resurrection we better stop playing games if this thing about christianity is just all for us to come and and have brother college sing good music and we just sit there and tap our feet and and you know and entertain ourself we will be the most miserable people we will be the most miserable people praise the lord but that's the hope we have amen just like the sun will rise tomorrow morning we believe that there is a resurrection that's the hope that is in our heart praise the lord brother branham says uh uh taking sides of jesus he says every every son of god is every child every prophet that went down to the to the grave they went down with that anticipation he says that's the reason why they will rise up with the hope that was in their heart he said when paul preached about the rapture paul did not preach the rapture message for your age he never said dead i will be alive he said we that are alive he was preaching the rapture for his day he said we that are alive so they die with that hope in their heart praise the lord i know we are just just as uh you know small group of people just a little little assembly and but you see this it's not it's not the multitude it's not the crowd what god wants to achieve is to discipline god is looking for discipline when you hear adopted sounds it means disciplined sounds people that are adopted are people that are disciplined praise the lord so what we want to talk about what we want to encourage you tonight is what manner of communication you know that's what jesus said to those men what manner of communication what are you talking about after these meetings i taught you after we get back to service tonight and you will be on fire you know we we just we we get excited and after the meeting is gone it's just gone it's just gone the excitement just goes away and the people just keep dragging you know people just keep dragging and just like being wake up from a deep sleep praise the lord a man has always been like that i believe that's the same thing that jesus was dealing with with these two men on the road of demise with all that they have heard with all that they saw in and he taught them and and told them about living in the comfort of with calm and the promises he gave to them yet when he left they were of sar heart jesus said what manner of communication since uh uh uh sunday about two o'clock two o'clock we we left and uh what are you what you been talking about praise the lord what have we been talking about were we talking about the things that were ministered to us you have to remember we are sheeps you know and sheeps they they eat their food and then they keep it in a jar and they bring it back up again and they chew it praise the lord and that's what we must do our spiritual sheeps we don't come to service just to enjoy a good preaching or es it would just be entertaining because that's what entertainment that that's the way it affect us you sit there you enjoy the moment as soon as you walk out of the door it's gone but this is not entertainment this is an experience you are having an experience with the raising christ and an experience affects you when a person has on the spirit it affect them praise the lord that's that's what brother branham ex explained by being affected in in the spirit man and being affected in the soul praise the lord he says the word the soul can feel on only one thing jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of god your soul can only feed on the word of god praise the lord amen so if i try to preach tonight and look for stories and try to just bring a lot of stories and make you feel sorrowful okay let me talk about the passion of christ you see this gone easter jesus really suffered you know that that the the pooled his beard and he bleeding and and i can tell you all of those story and i can drive you into a into a ram for you to feel so sorry for but if it is not the word your soul will not feed on it your spirit you will just feel sorry for in that moment that i'm talking to you praise the lord amen and as soon as you get outside you know it will play on your mind it's still in your spirit realm you feel sorry for you feel quiet you say but if the soul did not receive the word the thing that makes you carry on the revival is the word that you have fed in your soul praise the lord that's the thing that makes you to think oh my goodness i really enjoy that weekend it's the world you keep remembering the word the word is playing back in your heart most of the time we just sit there and we listening to the story when the preacher is talking we connected with this one okay yeah yeah brother brandon said this he come to this okay yeah brother branham said that and we use all of that to entertain ourself praise the lord amen brother branham shared christ is the mystery of god revealed he says that is the way for you to know jesus by the flesh praise the lord remember he says you remember that paul didn't know jesus by the flesh he says when a man has all the intellectual understanding of the scripture he just know jesus by the flesh if he can connect the cults and connect the scripture and just lay back he just know jesus by the flesh praise the lord what manner of communication praise the lord what manner of communication i believe that this little group of people that come here wednesday night and sunday morning that uh identified with this with this uh assembly here you know uh working from the corner of the street i believe that if god will help us and realize that uh we're not just doing a religion and actually get involved in what god is doing in this building praise the lord amen i believe that there is there is nothing that is impossible for us everything that we we have put our heart to do in this church we have tried to do it right maybe they have not come up to stand up but we have tried to do it how much more if we get involved the lord how much more if we get involved i mean we have great services we have services where you can you can you can feel the presence you can even you can even cut it with a blade right praise the lord but with all that it looks like people just stand on the shore and look at a scene instead of jumping in the water by the moving of the spirit praise the lord people just sit and just look at scene water is good preaching whether it is good singing nice music we just stay on the stage right and look at the scene yeah but just like i've always reminded us is is it's all saying from my from my friend brother lonnie he used to say you have to remember that you are the audience no god is your audience and you are the actors that are unseen yes it's not the preacher the actor and you the audience he said heaven is your audience and god is looking down and those angels are watching and seeing what's your attitude when the word is being preached praise the lord what's your attitude when the word is being preached well so let's just go into what we want to talk about tonight what manner of communication we are reminded of this story that was the first day of the resurrection praise the lord we we spoke about that uh in many different ways we were talking about the different body the the terrestrial celestial and heaven and body we we spoke about that you know because it's all seen in that we know that jesus he had a a terrestrial body you know and and that was that was what the the crucified him and and then when he resurrected right there in in luke chapter 24 uh the bible talks about him meeting mary you know and and then he told you know when he called mary mark elaine and she she realized that that was her lord he says touch ned because he was in a different form of body you see i'm not raising i'm not raising unto the father yet go and tell my brethrens i will meet you amen so just in that period of time brother branham says the sacrifice needed to be presented praise the lord so he died in in a terrestrial body when when he when he he was raising and he met mary martin lane it was in a celestial body praise the lord but that bothering do not eat or drink that body cannot be touched by martyr praise the lord but we realized that that was the same that was the same day he have just raised him he just met mary magdalene and he says go and tell my brethren i'm raising and in no time he met these two men on the road of emails so when he left miramar the lane he ascended on to the father and then he came back and then he took on another body [Music] which is now a heavenly body because in this body he will eat but yet he can go through a war are we together amen so he met cleopas and his friend on the road and he asked them this amazing question that we are talking about tonight he said unto them what manner of communication the bible says year as the joining it came to pass that while they commune uh together in reason jesus himself drew nigh praise the lord amen and uh and went with them but their eyes were holding so we realized that they did not identify him praise the lord amen they did not identify him just like mary magdalene when he when when he called her he had to call her by name the thing that helped her to identify him was a familiar voice she did not identify him by his appearance praise the lord are we together because i mean just like brother ben was talking uh speaking on the weekend uh you know when when when we drop this body like paul says there is there is another tabernacle that awaits us praise the lord there there are things that this tabernacle we lost praise the lord because he resurrected just like i said by a familiar voice mary magdalene recognized and even this man it was something that he did and the bible says their eyes open but their eyes were holding it was it was not it was not in a sense that god just blind them to not know him no there was something about the body that he was in that they could not identify him because he walked with them and said what manner of communication you guys are having and i said well are you a stranger here that you don't know all the things and and actually this distance they were they were uh traveling about three four long almost about three hours walk almost about three hours walk praise the lord and yet they could not identify him sure praise the lord do you see how the lord comes into the services and we don't identify him praise the lord the way we identified him is now by the emotion we feel the way we identify him is by a familiar voice his word praise the lord is by the preaching of the word he says yeah the law was really in our minds while the church world looks for something that will shiver their body sure says wow you know i enjoyed that music there was there was something that you know that went down my spine are we together i'm kind of i'm kind of frustrating all my talk here but it's it's okay i just get a few minutes here and i'll let you go just like i said it was just to come in uh you know and just appreciate every one of you for for all that you put into the meetings on the weekend but you see he he went down and there were there were some few things that brother brandon pointed out yeah that's what i wanted to for us to look at he says what matter of uh uh communication you're having you know as you walk one another and year aside and and one said clip i said i doubt only a stranger in jerusalem and have not known the things which have come to pass there in these days he said what think amen it says said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in these and words before god and all the prophets now brother branham said yeah and then jesus came he said on the road of myers on their first testimony when the whole world was in bloom of flowers and bobs and bees and homing on that beautiful april morning little did the disciples know that he he was raised from the dead and was among the resurrection and asked his friend cleopas and his friend was on the roll very much discouraged but they were pounding on the scriptures praise the lord now see right yet in the bible it says concerning jesus which was a prophet mighty in these and were before god that proved that they were on the scripture because if they were allowing their discouragement to drive them they would have said that that guy that was a capital son you know jesus you know i mean i mean that faker but because they were on the word even though they were discouraged but they were talking about the word they identified him by scripture that he was a prophet mighty in these and we're before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers deliver him to be condemned to death and crucify him praise the lord amen so if they were just if they were just i mean just talking about their disappointment or you see i i lost my job i left my job because of that man and uh you know uh uh by this time i would have i would have been a millionaire you know i would have been rich if i would have just you know stayed with what i was doing if those were the things that they were talking about i mean they were just going to shun him away yeah you just forget about leave us alone go your way but brother branham says they were talking about the words they were remembering the meetings that they had you remember when he said this my goodness i was looking right into his face i mean my eyes could not even blink i saw him talk those breaths lift it up and bless it they were remembering the meetings they were talking about the things that was preached unto them praise the lord they were going back to their notes husband and wife was sharing their notes wow i didn't i didn't well i liked the way you wrote that thing down i never saw it like that i like it i enjoy it that's the way to sustain the presence of god when a people is blessed by god's presence the way to sustain his presence is to be talking about the word yeah the easter meeting was wonderful my goodness i enjoy the music oh my goodness we dance and we can talk about everything and cannot be able to find one place in the world that's too up to us praise the lord and he went on talking and we trusted that it had been he that that shu had redeemed israel they were discouraged but they stay having their faith in this man praise the lord and he went on talking setting went to the supreme court verse 24 verse 25 then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all night christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he has he expounded onto them in all the scriptures all the scriptures all the scriptures he was not just he was not just uh talking about i mean you know the revival on my mount sauna all talking about you know what he did when he raised jairus daughter no he took them back to the world he took them back to the scripture back to the scripture it could have been easy for him to have just start reminding them you know you remember when i caught zacchaeus down from the tree and you know and just remembering that reminding them of all the things that have happened but no he took them back to the scripture beginning from moses when moses said the law your god will raise up a prophet joshua you remember the captain of the lord host the one that met joshua was the same one that met moses he took them from moses all through the prophets all the scripture he was not telling them of his life story he was putting them in the scripture praise the lord he was putting them in the scripture brother branham we use this very scripture to preach the message christ is the mystery of god reveal he will bring the scene of the road of of of of immigrants to preach the message crisis the minister of god revealed to let us to understand that everything that he has preached throughout all his ministry that only had one goal with a three four purpose praise the lord was everything that was in the scriptures praise the lord it was everything that was in the scripture people think when brother branham says the bible has become a new book it means that we should leave the bible [Music] and only copy and paste quotes of three five pages no the bible has become a new book because when you are in the scriptures amen if you are in your bible if you are a lover of your bible the message of brother branham will fly out to you the things that brother branham has said will fly out that's what jesus was doing to this man that's right as he as he reminded them from moses throughout the prophets so the thing that christ did will fly out to them praise the lord what a manner of communication what are you talking about what are you talking about that's the thing were our young people supposed to be talking about i read this scripture in the bible mine my goodness could it be something of what brother ben was preaching on i read this scripture because every time when you read a scripture in the bible that you don't understand the reason why you don't understand it is because god is giving you an opportunity he's giving you an opportunity to for you to see him because when you read a scripture and you don't understand what this means if you just don't just jump over it and don't just cast it away from your mind but just say lord i wonder what this means i wonder what this means you see god coming right through the next service to tell you what it means or you will see god just allowing something to happen to you and we connect you every time praise the lord someone said to me that brother branham did not preach from that scripture i can't preach from it i said thierry from your bible then the interior from your bible if you are really in the scripture and you really listening to the message you will hear the scripture coming out all the time because brother branham talks about scripture and he don't say this is revelation 10 verse 7. he just talks about it as he goes along he just talks about it i was listening to the to brother branham he was talking about fellowship among the brethren he said because the blankets the blankets stretch a little wider and then he used a statement from isaiah the prophet but he did not cut it aside the prophet right but if you read outside the prophet you see where as i was talking about the blanket stretch a little farther that jesus came after his resurrection he never thought reminded him you remember when i felt five thousand no he took them back to the scripture moses said this isaiah said this praise the lord and that was that was the thing that captured him that when he when he actually says he was going he said can you can you stay with us they were captured by the scripture so he just needed to do something little for the eyes to come open right he just needed to do something little take the bread bless it and break it yeah and the eyes open oh my goodness this is our lord i've been walking with for three hours they're jumping over the chair i gotta go tell people but he used the scripture to capture them to capture them what matter of communication praise the lord brother branham says they were very much discouraged but they were pounding on the scripture did you notice while they were talking on the scripture he appears they were not talking on their disappointment this other person called and said believer they did this even peter he that was always dead he denied the lord jesus that's not why they were talking they were talking on the scriptures do you know that i read in the bible where the scripture says the view of the lord has eaten him i did not even know what that was until the day he took the whip because that's what the bible says when he got into the temple and started to whip them out the bible says the disciple the law brought to their mind what is written in the scripture that the view of the house has eaten me say that was the day that i honest to that praise the lord you read things in the scriptures you don't understand it just just keep loving the lord the lord is going to bring it to your mind open your understanding you just be listening to a tape and brother brandon would just say something and that scripture that you have read will just come open to your mind that's how the bible becomes a new book yes sir that's how the bible becomes a new book when the word becomes alive to you but we're not in love with the word that's the reason why even if we have brother branham yeah preaching for us all you go and talk about is that you know and he prayed for this girl and he prayed for that other person and he prayed for this other person you won't say nothing about the word because you are not in love with the word that's the thing that must interest us the word praise the lord oh my brother brahm says this now listen the presence of the lord jesus he says now listen closely brother and sisters there are many of you that jesus has talked to and you didn't realize it praise the lord amen how many of you that jesus has talked to and you didn't realize it he's here with us he's alive he come to you every night there and saying it's you i'm talking to especially when the preacher say that you i'm talking to i'm not preaching to the drums it's you that i'm talking to praise the lord but you see what we do is that we take what he's talking about and associate it with somebody else the lord and associate with somebody else and make that person to you we dodge the word like a bullet you can be made whole just accept it confess it and see what happened that's him talking to you he talked to them all day and he said why are you so sad and worried beautiful easter morning jesus is alive in the word from the resurrection first man was raised from the dead first fruit of them that slept so then walking along and they didn't know it and they went along and said well are you just a stranger here said jesus no said nor jesus of nazareth and then he began with the scripture and explained just exactly what jesus was supposed to do when he come now so if their interest was not in the world they would have stopped him they would have just stopped him but as he was talking about the scripture everything that he told them was it was being revived in them praise the lord amen glory be to god i'm telling you you can never understand brother brandon message if you are not in the scripture amen even our lord jesus when he came he said ses the scripture yes sir sesh the scripture in another sense if you will understand my ministry you must set the scripture right you must be in the scripture and then he begin with the scripture and explain just exactly what jesus was supposed to do when he come and when he went in a little house a little place where the sabbath day joining they started to go into an inn so he made out like he was going going on by he does that a lot of times he might have made our life he was going to pass you by tonight sonny this little girl here sitting here in the wheelchair you know and brother branham talks all of that just to see how much interest we have in the world sure we don't have to wait for devotion time before you pick up the bible to read praise the lord someone got healed i told you the story about that and you know listening to the lady testimony she got healed of memory problem god heal her mind her mental problem by choosing to memorize scripture memorizing scripture you are keeping the lord on your mind that's what you are doing because the moment you try to do that you don't you you don't remember it after you have read a few times but you will realize that as you think about it you see you're thought trying to grab it right praise the lord i read a scripture this morning from the book of psalms and and it talks about the law of loving-kindness and how his loving-kindness is good to the children of men and all the children of men come under the shadow of his wings i was sitting there and i was meditating on that i said i said oh god you see all of these people go on the street and start to tell them about jesus christ they will get mad with you but they are going hoping that they will get locked they are hoping that they will get locked they're hoping i mean if if there's a god somewhere that he will make it away from me they they are trusting honor his wings they are trusting for for them to be hoping that this thing will work out hoping i would get i would get a job or hoping that i would get a business now i'm going to see this friend of mine he will be able to give me 20 bucks their hope that they have in them they are trusting honor his wings i was just sitting there and thinking about that i said oh god they don't know you and if you go tell them they don't want to know you but yet they are trusting under your wings trusting that god will open door for them i hope i'm really i'm really trusting i would get you know i would be able to get that position oh i really trust that i'll be able to get you know uh what you you just trust in honor his wings praise the lord so he acted like he he will go by and they constrain himself come in and abide with us you do the same now come in and abide with us so he come in as soon as he sat down the waiter come in and he brought the bread and jesus did something just a little different and the eyes were open and they recognize him and he vanished out of their sight praise the lord amen he vanished out of the assad he went to the other group of believers that were gathering together that was when he came through through the world and told them shalom peace be still and he thought that he was a spirit he says bring me bread praise the lord bring me bread bring me some fish he could eat in that body praise the lord amen but yet he could disappear and appear they're only corruptable things the only thing the bible says corruption cannot inherit incorruption the only corruptible thing in heaven is the nazca because brother branham says jesus he says god kept that body as a memorial sure he said god kept the nail scar body as a memorial just like ezra kept the body of joseph as a memorial sure and every time the look of the body knows that one day we will be out of here praise the lord what are we talking about young people what are we talking about what manner of communication are we having sometimes that's what you said you know the lord realized the law spoke to me you will realize that every time that god will speak to you in a service will be something about the word that either you were thinking about or you were reading or you were listening talk something of the word where god was already dealing with you then he comes back and used the preacher to bring that thing up praise the lord what manner of communication that we should be having after an easter service like the one that we had what manner of communication i mean if the people are really in the word if the people are really taking those messages go back on on youtube instead of looking at all the funny things we look and go then and play those messages you realize that the holy spirit sees the interest of the people he take this the the services that is coming right from the eastern meeting and just take you up but if we don't have interest in the world why should god give us the word why should god bring bring something to to to make you uh uh uh uh excited or or anxious or or i mean uh increase your spiritual appetite when you don't have interest in the word praise the lord it is not the amen that you say amen preach it is not the thing that pulls on the preacher the thing that pulls on the preacher is your desire for the word the desire that you have in your heart that's what pulls on the preacher those things you've been reading those things you've been praying to god for answers that's the thing that pulls on the preacher it's not it's not out of the assault preacher preach it because some of those yelling there just i mean praise the lord the preacher can't even stream you jump out of sleep and you yell i don't even know nothing he said it's because you were sleeping right yes amen you just woke up the things that pulled on the preacher is the thing that you do out of service when you are praying you are reading the word you are putting things before god it is those things that pulled on the preacher what manner of communication what are the things that we should be talking about musicians you can come tonight uh we we have those services on the little website that we have and on youtube they are there because of you they are there for you to be able to go back listen to the word play the service together don't say oh i see see what uh uh this brother is doing oh see that other person in the world you're just looking at one another when people go on youtube to look at the service that's all they look at oh yeah yeah she was in church yeah i can see her sitting down there the reason is to listen to the word is to be able to play back that word so
