And once again, we want to thank you for making this night special for us. Praise the Lord. Because if you were not here, I will be here alone. Amen. I will be here giving thanks alone. So, thank you for coming to uh to spend the night with me. Praise the Lord. And uh we just we just thank the Lord for uh the the opportunity of uh coming together tonight. and and I know some of you came from work and and uh whether you were able to grab uh sleep or not, you still made it your business to be here. And I know many want to be with us tonight. Uh but uh uh they are not able to to come because of work and and uh and other things. But uh we are here tonight and and I know they are streaming in and following the service tonight. Maybe some will come and join us, but whatever it is, we will be here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh and just like I said, this is just a thanksgiving service. We just want to come and give thanks with a grateful heart for the Lord, you know, uh keeping this uh little assembly going after after the uh uh 30 years. Actually, today this 18th of July was uh uh many years back that was when uh uh the brothers started this assembly. So we just wanted to use that time and and tell the Lord thank you that there were people that were before us and u uh and many of them are not here tonight with us but uh maybe we might say a little more of that on Sunday but uh we just we just want to be grateful you know we want to be grateful and uh it's some of the things that uh sometime we take for granted some of the things that sometime we take for granted. Uh I mean to move in a setting and and find a church there and you can be able to go you meet people and and then sometimes you don't you really you are not able to put together you know what what all it takes for for that local assembly to be there. Praise the Lord. And many times we come you know with our our preferences. we come with uh you know uh the way we know things are done like I normally said and then then sometimes it takes a while for us to even understand what this is all about you know what the people that are gathering here what is it all about. But uh uh but for tonight we we would just want to uh uh give thanks and uh um we have some prayer needs that we going to to take uh special prayer needs that are in. We will we will pray for there before we we uh uh change the service for the preaching of the word. We're not able to have brother uh uh Farmer in, but the Lord that knows our needs provided for our need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord that know our needs provided for our needs. I think he he uh he so loved me and he wanted for me to rest. So uh uh he brought two of our friends, brother Valentine and u and brother German from uh from the Arabic coast uh on their way to Trinidad, but they decided to to come in and and and see us and see us uh uh and those uh those are pretty good good good friend of mine. Those guys took care of me when I was in the course and and uh uh I I owe them a whole lot that I can't be able to pay them for. But they were very good friends, very good friends to us and they decided to come in and uh uh stop last year. Brother J was around uh you know they were there and over. We met in North Carolina when I went for brother Joe Green's meeting and he really wanted to come. He he wanted for he and myself to come but some of things did not work up right. So uh so this time around he said when he's around he's going to come whatever it takes he will just come and and just uh just to see us and just fellowship with us. So we're glad to have him tonight. Praise the Lord. So brother V will speak for us tonight. He's a familiar face. So he will speak for us tonight and we will give uh uh brother J the service on Sunday and he will bring the word of God. So, uh, we're glad to have both of them with us and, uh, they over in the office. They will be coming over soon after we take our prayer need tonight. So, I'm I'm very grateful. I'm very grateful that the Lord uh will have me to rest this weekend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord will have me to rest this weekend. So, I'm so thankful for that. And uh uh uh with that being said uh uh like I said this is not like u you know like like a tiring meeting where we come in tiring for the Holy Ghost. Uh brother Samuel preach on Wednesday night. You have the quickening power in you. You know you don't tar for what you have. So this is not a kind of a Pentecostal tar meeting and uh you know when this is not uh this is just thanksgiving. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh we will have different needs to pray about. We will pray for our church. We will pray for the different families that come here. But uh uh just to sum it all, we just want to give thanks. And it's our way of coming to give thanks. And uh I just want to read a psalm tonight before we go uh into into praying is our way of giving thanks and uh you know and just just expressing our gratitude to the Lord. So there is no there is no formality tonight. We don't have to drug you up and you know and and and and drag you and keep pounding on your back. We will do the best that we can to make uh uh the best out of the service. Brother, we preach and then we will go into our prayer time. We will take some prayer lead. We will worship. We will praise the Lord. And uh and then when the service comes to an end, that will be the end of the service. Praise the Lord. So uh uh the service could end at 12:00. It could end at 2:00 a.m. It could end at 3:00. It could end at 4:00. Praise the Lord. So tonight uh uh you have the accelerator. I just have the steering wheel. Amen. So how far you carried us, that's where we would go. If I see you slowing down, we would just park by the side of the road. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I remember I remember one service uh I had to carry uh joy at home and uh I preached that that Sunday and we were going we were talking and uh uh we were talking and and uh you know while we were we were driving you know she was asking me question we were just lecturing you know we're having a good time and then I think she realized I was dropping in my speed. You know, the car was going more slower than it was supposed to go. So, she said, "Uh, uncle, are you tired?" I realized that, okay, she has caught me. Amen. So, uh that's what we want to do tonight is just uh just it's just a different way. Amen. We know that uh traditionally you know uh the 31st the end of the year that's when most and all uh most all night services are held and u uh you know that's that just u a kind of a religious tradition where we come together thank the Lord for the year and and all his goodness upon us and we wait you so we say we wait for the new year you know and then uh have to pray and we realize we are in the new year. We shout, we praise, we sing, but this is this is completely different tonight. Praise the Lord. This is our own thing. Amen. It is our own thing. So, we're going to do it our own way. Praise the Lord. We're going to do it our own way. So, uh let's just read Psalm um uh 134 tonight. 134. And uh let's just read that and then we will take up some few prayer needs that we have. Praise the Lord. Let's just read that. It has three verses. If we just want to stand on our feet and uh and read it together, we will read those three verses together. Psalm chapter 134. Let's read from verse one. Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord. Lift up your hands in his sanctuary and bless the Lord. The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Let's just take our prayer needs tonight. Let's just take our prayer needs. I pray I mean I spoke with brother Wesley and I actually spoke with him. I was just trying to call and check on him and uh and sister Carol and then uh uh the phone switch off and then I think he tried to call me back and left me in the voicemail that he was in the doctor office and uh because of his eyes since they did the catarized uh uh soldered on his eyes he's uh uh he's been uh uh bright lights has been battering in his eyes whenever the light is bright. So he went in to see the doctor. So he just left a a voicemail and says uh uh you can pray for me. So we'll take that tonight and just remember brother Wesley and sister Karen and uh uh you know uh and those uh some of uh you know uh uh one of the families that uh that has uh you know sacrificed in their own way. Can you imagine they are the uh in their 80s and uh and whenever they come to church they drive two hours from Brainer to be here in church. And many times they are earlier. They come early than even me and many of us. They drive 2 hours every Sunday whenever they are in church. And uh and we just thank the Lord for them. Uh we pray for sister Carol too that the Lord will uh uh just uh help uh help them. We want to take unspoken request tonight for for Sam and and Abby. Um for a few of us that know Sam and Abby, we want to just take an unspoken prayer request for them tonight that the Lord will help their family and they and the children will just uh commit them in the hands of the Lord tonight. [Music] It's brand new here from brother Diane. Shalom saints. I'm asking prayer for my niece uh Mary Gin who is carrying pregnancy with fabros in a way that God will see her through safely in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We pray for them. Remember we we had a privilege to do their wedding. So uh we ask that the Lord will bless them with children. So we will definitely remember them tonight. Remember them tonight. Let's take another prayer need tonight. And uh um this is uh a prayer need for [Music] I would just read it. An urgent prayer request for sister Anita, brother Franklin and his family. Their house and shop were just struck by lightning and the house is on fire. The fire department uh is just now getting there. Sister Anita said it's bad. The family is all destruct praying the fireman can get uh it under control sweetly. Praying for the Lord mercy. Praise the Lord. And uh we're beginning to see more more of these uh u home invasion by fire. Uh Sister Mary was telling me on on Sunday that uh Saturday she she herself they woke up to uh uh their stove being on fire and the Lord just her to get there right on time and uh and cut it off. So we want to remember this family uh that the Lord will just uh uh help them whatever is the situation.

For everyone that asks receive, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be open. Uh, of what man is there of you whom if his son asks bread, he uh will he give him a stone? Or if he asks a fish, will he give him a sip? If you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him.

You know just just like just like the brother said you know we we we get afraid in our mind you know uh uh and sometimes we think that uh is is is worldliness you know uh uh or is canality uh uh you know to to be able to ask God for for for great things. I mean where you you where you should start from is your motive and objective. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where you should start from. If that motive and adjective is on the word of God, you ask God for it. Amen. Don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be afraid because you have to also realize that no is an answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God says no, we will say praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will praise the Lord anyhow. &gt;&gt; But we must we must be able to express ourself to God. We must be able to speak like you know I was I was thinking tonight uh if I was going to to to to speak I was going to talk on uh uh ask for help cry for help. That that was my message I was going to preach. Cry for help. Brother Brandham says you know God designed it that the only way that a baby can get attention is to cry &gt;&gt; by nature. That's the way that God designed it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way he designed it. &gt;&gt; And if we are his children, &gt;&gt; if we are his children, &gt;&gt; we are all babies. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are all babies. What's your age tonight? &gt;&gt; Compared to the rock of ages, compared to the Asian of Day, the creator of the universe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Think about this. when when when uh when when when Sarah sent Hagar and and Ishmael away with all the bragging and all the you know the braveness that Hagar was trying to play. They went out of water. It was not it was not Hagar crying that brought the angel. It was the little baby &gt;&gt; Ishmael. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When that little baby starts to cry &gt;&gt; because that's the way that God designed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime crying is the language that God understand. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, because one thing that is in crying, one thing that is in crying, there is no verb and adverb. &gt;&gt; You cannot be crying and get a straight sentence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you see anybody crying with a straight sentence, they are not crying. &gt;&gt; They're just faking it. &gt;&gt; A person that is really crying, they are saying, "Oh God, oh God, &gt;&gt; they are just saying one thing over and over. &gt;&gt; They are just crying. They are just they are just pouring out their heart again. It's hard for you to even be able to express words." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to express words. And that's and that's what God love. Let's let's sing that song tonight before we get down into praying tonight. Let's sing uh uh he's a he's a on time God. Yes, he is. Pray for my my voice tonight. I hope you did that.

If you should find in the praise in your mind, reach out for grace. def [Music] and they will fall in Jesus name. Let me say this tonight some midnight hour. this midnight. &gt;&gt; You know the Apostle Paul says the weapons of our warfare are not counter &gt;&gt; but it's the pulling down of strongholds. &gt;&gt; You know what are strongholds? Strongholds are things that are stuck on your mind &gt;&gt; that even when you are praying you can't pass them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All those distraction on your mind. They are strongholds. They are they is either fear or is it's is it's a it's an accusation from the devil. He's trying to remind you of your past. You just feel so condemned. You can't you can't even say Lord thank you because he it's it's it's a stronghold. It's on your mind. [Music] You can't even you can't even think on Jesus. you are just thinking on uh all of those things whatever it they are. So the first thing is that we got to defy those chains we got to bring down every stronghold. Everything that is exalting itself in your mind everything that is exalting itself in your mind above the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You got to bring it down tonight. Yes. Thank you. &gt;&gt; If it keep bothering your mind, just just continue to say, "Lord, I thank you. Lord, I praise you." You are worth water to be praised. Because if you don't bring those stronghold down, there is no way you can sail into the heavens. There is no way you can enter his presence tonight to enter into the in the in the sphere of praying tonight because the devil knows. He knows how our mind runs. He knows our fears. He knows our doubts. He knows uh uh uh he knows where to touch you tonight. He knows what to bring to your mind tonight and just and just uh h destroy your spirit. [Music] But you see once Paul and Silas started to started to praise [Music] their praise defa [Music] &gt;&gt; and that's what we want to do tonight. We we we want to praise God so much. &gt;&gt; Not just vain words. You got to be we we we got to be earnest about it. &gt;&gt; Think about how much the Lord has been good to you. How much he has been good to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] Even if you can just find one thing tonight &gt;&gt; in the many things that he have done. &gt;&gt; If we can just find one thing tonight and let that thing magnify itself in our mind, &gt;&gt; let it become so real [Music] &gt;&gt; that we can say if the Lord was not on our side, When strong water rise against us, if the Lord was not on our side, let me tell you tonight, don't allow the devil to condemn you. The grace you have to be here tonight. Show that there is something in your heart. the grace you have to be up tonight, whether you are streaming in, whether you are kneeling down inhide or where wherever you are tonight, the grace to be tuning in tonight. The grace to to to be there and in and and and uh want you to be in the place of praying tonight. The devil will try to do everything to discourage you. But that's what I want. I want to let out a secret to you tonight. We got to bring down those strongholds. &gt;&gt; If he keeps bringing things to your mind, pay attention to it. [Music] Let's sing that verse again. Some may not, some may out. If you should find you, the praise in your mouth. Reach out and praise. Defy those chains and they will fall in Jesus name. Let's sing that one more time. some thy heart. If you should find [Music] in the praise, in your mind, reach out and praise. defy those chains and they will fall in Jesus name. So I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. Lord, I give you honor [Music] and give you praise. You are the light, the true way. I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] While the music softly playing, [Music] let's bless the name of the Lord tonight. Let's bless the name of the Lord. [Music] His water to be praised. Let's speak to him tonight.

What can we do for this assembly that the that the that that that every time we come to church [Music] and the Lord has been faithful. [Music] So it's not anybody tonight, nobody to be blamed.

We are making excuses, looking at our weaknesses and and the devil is boxing us into a corner and those things are just they are becoming our identity. He's robbing us of our identity.

Praise the Lord. And uh I know uh uh some of the sisters face uh things for us to drink and share just when we come to the end of the service. And uh uh but before we close or before we we uh try to find our way home and get some rest for the service tomorrow, which is Sunday. We already Saturday night. So just like I said, I mean it's no uh all night drag on as long as we let uh uh in the spirit of prayer. We're just going to, you know, sing and worship and and then we we bring the the service tonight to an end and then we can be able to go home, get some rest for those that have some other things to do tomorrow. And so I have to bring my preacher friends. I know they all tired still in their jet lay from the overseas straight but uh they wanted to be here. So it's all part of the work of the Lord bless you. You may have your seat for a little bit and If you realize recently we've been we've been talking a whole lot about uh about the church looking at the church in prophecy and uh also talking about building some time actually uh supposed to by God's grace I will be awaiting surviving dedicating the church there so I was actually praying for what I will speak on and the Lord gave me that that uh that message on my heart and I just thought sh before we go even though we have some sequences to talk about but uh uh Just like I said, you know, the uh the church of God, that's God's own community. We might come from different families. We come from uh different countries, different backgrounds. You see, but like Paul said, by one spirit, we are baptized into one body. Praise the Lord. By one spirit. And that's and that's the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of uh the Holy Ghost. We are baptized into that body which is mystical body. The church is not a certain building. It's not a certain name. It's a mystical body. Is is you know comprises of people from all over the world. That's why we have brothers coming from different places. They can come and preach to us and you know they can just blame into into exactly what we've been talking about here or what uh you know is happening in our midst is because it's by spirit that uh you know God order his church and uh uh we are praying and and hoping that uh you know God will bring us to that place you know a church uh is just like u a child that is growing you know uh from the beginning that's just a little child you know they just do whatever it is and as they grow and they start to change and start into the teenage life. Sometimes it become troublesome you know uh uh they have to face different things and that's how the church is you know it has a a revolving door people will come people will leave you know uh uh uh some people will be there and you know and and on and on and on there but you know uh for every church every group of people God has a vision. God has a vision. God has something that he wants to achieve with with that group of people. That's the reason why he brought us together and that's the reason why he keeping us together. There is something that he want to achieve. I don't know you know I don't know the big picture. I just follow it day by day and you know try to do do uh you know the the best that we can. But I believe that God has a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose. He has kept us in this area like I said every most every one of us live uh about 20 or 30 35 and plus meaning away from here but yet uh you know he's able to give us the grace to be able to come Wednesday night and come Sunday you know and uh we we thank the Lord for that and we look forward and I I I see the Lord blessing our Wednesday service more and more you know and uh especially this period of time we having most of our visitor this coming Wednesday. I never designed it like that. I think the Lord just just uh you know, I thought about it and just say, well, okay, maybe uh you know, God himself is doing whatever that pleases him to do. And because I believe that uh uh you know, I believe that we going to have a New Testament church. Amen. Have a new testament church. We just believe just want to continue to encourage you, you know, let's our shoulder to the wheels, you know. Uh let's uh let's take what we do here serious because it is not man's business. It's God's business. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is God's business and uh uh so we want we want to you know take everything we come about to do here to be very very serious. We have a message that that you know that we are all about. You know the prophet of God is nothing new that we are learning. We're not making to happen. It's already been given to us. We just need to follow the instruction, you know, to have it the way that God wanted just like when he gave uh uh the instruction to Noah to build an ark, you know, uh he tell him, he told him how to do it and that is the only way it could have survived the flood. If Noah tried to do it any way other it would have sank. &gt;&gt; And that is the way that God built his church. It's not built by man's idea. Let's do it like this. The other person say let's do it like this. No, you know he gave he gave us his word. We have to look in his word pray and be able to follow what he want us to do. And that's the way God also give us our family. You know there is a word for us to be able to guide our family. If we follow that word, we will come out successful. If we do it our own, we will drown. There were many people that tried to build a boat in Noah's day. Only Noah boat survive. Praise the Lord. Only Noah boat survive. You know, uh uh uh for many for many years, I think I read it here to you the other time. For many years, I've always thought, how did Noah, you know, call those animals into the ark? But uh I I don't have my notes here, but I read it to you all the time. You know, brother Brandham says uh that was the first thunder. He said that was the first thunder and that's what he connects that to the voice of God. So there was a thunder that rose and the animals heard the voice of God. Noah did not preach to them. He said that was the first thunder you know and they heard the voice of God and they peed themsel and they went into that act. If you think about it now, those those animals have all they have already experienced, you know, violence. They have experienced, you know, uh uh uh killing one another, fighting and all of that. But yet when uh when they got the voice of God, the tunnel rose and they heard the voice of God in the tunnel and they ordered themselves, they pair themselves male and female and they walked straight to Adam, I mean Noah. And God was able to keep those animals of different of different uh nature in an enclosed ark. Praise the Lord. Amen. You just think about that. And they don't they don't they don't have a soul. They they you know they they control by instincts. How much more about people about us made in the image of God and and you know redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and he has given us his spirit. And all I think we need again is is just the break of another tunnel. That's all we need. the break of another tunnel. If we can hear the voice of God through the messages that been preached to us, &gt;&gt; we will order our homes. We will order our lives. &gt;&gt; That's all we need. He that have an ear to hear what the spirit says. you know, as I thought about this prayer meeting and uh really took a time to pray about it and wait on the Lord and all of that and just ask the Lord to give us, you know, a wonderful time and we come together. I don't know how it was going to turn out to be. I don't know who are going to be here. I just thought that, you know, we were going to have this time uh just to uh like I said, do as a memorial for the church. Uh I was just thinking about it. I mean that is being 2010. So I mean it was a long going on before uh you know we came over to the states but just to see how the Lord in his own way has uh you know has helped us you know just just a lot of things there I'm still waiting for the right time to say you know just the right time to say it but uh uh I want us to as we turn this corner If we have another uh uh anniversary is going to be 31 years and uh uh uh but as we turn this corn I'm really praying that the Lord will be able to really really help us you know uh lately what what has come upon our heart you know we see all of these all of these young young people especially the little ones the teenagers you know praying Gracies little babies all in this church. Now they are all teenagers and uh and all these other little ones that are coming you know is uh it's been a journey and like Brandon was say taking sides with Jesus you know he emphasized a whole lot of us paying attention to the to the paying attention to the young people you know because he says if there's a tomorrow you know every every grown among us. We have had our own experience. You can go anywhere and live you know and live your Christian life the best way you know it. But these young people, these little ones, they still have uh they still have to meet God. They still have to meet God. And uh for now, the best that they have is just the atmosphere, you know. I mean pretty much don't have a son for that is not you know that's that's not destiny still trying to think about how we address that you know still thinking about it how address but then on the other side also the responsibility fall on us as parents you know to come up with something. We as parents, we have to do a whole lot. This is this is a crazy generation. A very crazy generation. One of the most evil generation that we ever have. And it's not going to get better. It's not going to get better. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not going to get better. taught us about the dimensions. He talked about uh you know the fourth dimension and you know and and all of those things uh that science have broke into and uh uh and the influence that is having on people and say we seeing those things happening right before us. It's happening right before our eyes. The Bible says iniquity will abound, the love of many will hold and we seeing it happening before us. We seeing it happening before us. I mean uh we are holding a lot to past experience and not too much to what God is doing now. We are holding the law to what we used to be and how we used to serve the Lord and how we came to the Lord. But that same God that was there with you is the same today. It is our responsibility you know it's our responsibility and uh uh uh you know I thank the Lord for you know the the trust and confidence that you people have you know today you don't have trust in me you just let me know you know I sit down I'm there again support the new pastor that will come but for now you know thank Thank you all for your trust and you know uh uh support and everything but I think we we can do better than what we are doing you know we can do better than what we are doing we can do better like I said I'll talk to you about later but u that just a little little bit I want to say say encourage you tonight I believe there we can do better. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make this place the house of God to make this place where the spirit of God will have his liberty and it will all be for our benefit. If we can see if if the Holy Ghost can have uh uh enough liberty and we are not hindering him with our attitude and henrying him with uh you know uh uh with different things, our fears, our doubts, you know uh uh you know uh uh it will benefit our our our little ones. It will benefit the children. is going to benefit them because whether the message is attack or not when a person have an experience with God it makes the message real to them. You can hear about the prophet and hear about all the experience. If there is I mean everything that he have done. If you don't have no experience with God, it just going to be a fairy tale. It just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; You are going to come up with your own reason why you left the message. Just a matter of time. it is in our hands. We did a we did a series here uh where we we we went back and started looking uh uh you know our our our uh you know quiet time coming to service early quiet time praying and all of that you know and we we show how you know right there that you look church All of you brother never said anything about opening prayer and the reason why I said that is not because we are doing opening prayer is wrong is because the opening prayer of the service is the 30 minutes. You open the service when you are in quiet time. When people come and just sit and meditate and pray, the service begin. You have started the service because you are committing the service in the hands of the Lord. You are praying for the the preacher. You're praying for those that are on their way and all of that. And because we have gone away from there. So people we just we race to church to get there before some service start because we think that's when the service starts. The service start from the prelude the prelude of the service. And one thing he said that is very important is that that's when those that have gifts wait on their gifts. If God can give us a praying church, it will take us a long way. Praise the Lord. Whatever we are doing, think about the little ones. Think about the little ones. how our our our our choices, our decision, whatever you know we doing could affect their lives. Think about it. Think about your children because the statistics are out there. The statistics are out there. So God bless you this morning. God bless you richly. And I mean Is it raining out there? Is it okay? Okay. So, I wanted to let you know when it's raining. And uh uh so uh um I think we will just bring the meeting to an end so I can allow you to go home and then have have you come back on Sunday. I will have I have my brains together. I have my brains together. Praise the Lord. Amen. But thank you. Thank you for being here this morning. And sacrificing your sleep is some of the things that we do, you know, for the kingdom sake. And I'm sure that uh one of these days you realize Your prayers and services in this place contributed to your eternal glory. This is a rough very keeping us here for a reason. God is keeping us here for a reason. there's not much that we are doing in the neighborhood and I wish there was a whole lot that we were doing and uh but u we just we just you know kind of giving to the Lord for now so he will be able to help us you know so let's just stand on our feet for you. Amen. Maybe we'll help you. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, we thank you.
