the other believers they all send their greetings praise the lord amen so uh it's good to be in the house of the lord let's just stand on our feet this morning and as we will just want to trust the

uh uh beginning tomorrow the 25th uh there will be they'll be resealing and painting the parking lot and we want to thank the trustees for that and so if we can just stay and wait until wednesday night for those that do come through the church there will be that would be good praise the lord amen blessed be the name of the lord let's read uh first corinthians chapter four first corinthians chapter four and uh we just want to thank the lord uh follow the service on wednesday night and and just uh appreciate how the lord uh bless you and and brought forth the word amen and also last wednesday service also we had the privilege to follow it amen a good friend of of mine very close friend of mine over in in in ghana the tamai city but alfred davidson also wanted us to bring greetings to you first corinthians chapter four we had a privilege to spend one night in ghana because we had about six hour layover so we were able to get out of the airport and visit with our friends there praise the lord that we haven't seen for 12 years praise the lord amen and i mean it was just it was just laughter and noise and fellowship praise the lord so they were trying to do everything to change my ticket for me to stop and preach so i was supposed to be preaching in ghana this morning praise the lord but uh the ticket was so restricted that they couldn't change it amen so uh but we had a good time amen let's just read first corinthians chapter four reading verse one and two let a man sow account of us as the ministers of christ and stewards of the mystery the mysteries of god moreover it is required in steward that a man be found faithful praise the lord let's drop down to verse 14. i write now these things to shame you that's paul speaking to the corinthian church as a messenger who speak to the church age right now these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers it take only one man to beget you praise the lord you may have many teachers but it take one man to beget you though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye met many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel therefore i beseech you be your followers of me amen let us pray heavenly father we want to pray and ask blessings lord this morning dear lord the emphasis of god is what the holy spirit is doing in our lives we're being told by the prophet that you kept a harmony between the father and the son you would do the same lord well god sometimes until the holy spirit brings us to that understanding precious law we might just wonder and wonder and wonder but i pray this morning that lord you will help us as we take this little portion of your word drive us in the way that god you want us to go this morning speak to us as only you can and father we will give you the praise the glory and honor in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you i will read verse 17 for this cause have i sent unto you timotheurs who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord we shall bring you in remembrance of mine of my ways which be in christ as i teach every word in every church praise the lord amen amen praise the lord i was wondering who is the brother singing in the front i never knew you were the one down there i saw you on fire this morning i mean you were just into every song and praise the lord amen good to see you amen amen praise the lord praise the lord so we want to continue where we stop before we left we were speaking on the message the harmony of the father and the son taking from the began with church age we want to just go over that taught again and notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father saint john 5 19 jesus says i do nothing but except that which the father have shown me this harmony this harmony is known to exist between the groom and the bride which is christ and the church now you have to follow me a little bit because i'm really i'm really going somewhere with this i'm not just preaching i believe that we have that responsibility to this local assembly and so to be able to uh place us rightly in the world as we would trust the holy spirit but um i'm using this for us to be able to go somewhere and understand what we are doing as a local church praise the lord amen what this local church is doing we want to understand what god wants to achieve in this body i don't believe that god have just kept us here out of these years you know i mean a church where we can just come and go do as we want to and you know no i believe that a church is a family it's a body a man a group of people that go all call together from from different backgrounds and uh different family and and and create a unit among them praise the lord for a particular purpose and and that's why we want to we want to address a little bit so we pray that the lord will help us now see brother brahm talking about a harmony between the father and the son which of course he says more exists between the bride and christ so we're looking at a father and son relationship that must also exist between the bride and christ a husband and wife praise the lord amen so uh uh that's what we want to deal with so we we started we started addressing that we took a little bit of uh david and saul praise the lord we took a little bit of david and saul uh when when when saul died and david started crying and you know he he tore his clothes and started weeping and we were trying to show that how david on the inspiration he was able to see you know the gift that god raised up after the judges to be able to lead israel for a period of time praise the lord and and because david was able to identify that and he was able to rightly place himself on the death we realized that uh even though samuel anointed him to be king but he did not he did not run into the king's office because he knew that there was a man already there so uh he took all of those years took all of those years to grow into his office praise the lord we also started talking about elijah and elisha so you will see it all through the scripture it first started with god in adam the harmony between the father and the son when adam was in eating you know there was such a harmony that uh every every name that adam gave to every you know plain and animal god was so pleased amen praise the lord god never came around and rearranged what adam have already arranged there was just such a harmony between the father and the son and then we realized that that was that was what the enemy target because if he can break the harmony amen in between the father and the son he can be able to to make us to wonder if he can break the harmony in the local church praise the lord and uh i mean that we can we can come together we can grow in numbers but we will be going nowhere praise the lord we will be going nowhere we will not be able to achieve anything we would just come and and dance to the music you know get a preacher in a pulpit and work him out and and i mean put him to the place where he can break sweat and then and then we go home but i mean as a unit as a body we would not be going in a word and even in our family structure if the enemy can break the harmony in the family we would just be existing you know but we will not be going anywhere as a family so that's what we want to look at this morning and you see that god has worked that way amen praise the lord right after the flood god called abraham abraham brought lord and lord traveled with him in but god promised abraham a son amen true womb abraham will be the father of many nations so god once again will will establish a father and son relationship not through isaac but god will allow abraham to raise up a boy in his house called eliezer a trusted seven amen that abraham will commission so watch now watch the idea watch the inspiration is god raising up sons the brother branham taught in adoption that will be able to understand the heart of the father praise the lord amen now not not just sons there will that will uh uh believe that they are sons and and uh uh you know uh uh won all the privilege of psalms you know uh because what what we're saying that is that is rising up in our age is entitlement spirit of entitlement i'm a son so this belongs to me because i'm a son i have a right to this and you find people you know uh uh you know trying to claim inheritance trying to claim gift trying to claim blessing become a son of god i'm a child of god i have a right to this but you you are you also realize that even if you claim it and and and and in no way you try to achieve it because you have not been tutored you have not been taught it will be just like a practical song taking the wealth of the father and and lavish in it praise the lord you will take the name of god you will make a shame of it you will take the gift of god you will make a mess out of it you will take the grace of god and bring a disgrace out of it why because you are a son that don't give your heart to be taught so you see that relationship all through the scripture when god called moses there was a son joshua that grew to understand the heart of the father and moses talked about an inheritance he talked about the land and and and and even though there were there were giants and and and and men you know of renown in the land but joshua knew the heart of moses that he had doubt said the lord and he said we are more than able to take the land the harmony between the father and the son praise the lord god do not do guesswork and he don't want his children to do guesswork praise the lord if you are well taught you don't need to guess you know exactly what to do because you are well taught praise the lord so that's what we want to look at as we as we label on a distort and praise the lord amen so the the harmony between the father and the son amen the harmony of the father and the son where jesus never did uh anything until it was first shown to him by the father and this harmony noun to exist between the bride and christ he show her his word of life she received it she never doubted it therefore nothing can harm her not even death praise the lord amen not evie death now so when you look at it between the david and saw relationship you realize that even though saul got into a compromised position and and and where now he started to deal with with an evil spirit where he goes in and out of praise the lord amen you know brother bran talks dead you know what if a man will not uh stay under the leadership of the holy spirit god would give him another spirit to lead him because we that's the way we are made we are made with sheep nature we must be led praise the lord we must be led and and we we've seen a growing number of people that have that that that is just being captured under a religious spirit you know i mean they can code the message and then and one thing it would do it would just make you arrogant because your hair will be so blow up and you think you know everything in the world and i mean you can say the prophet say that the scripture say this and and and then you go in nowhere with that praise the lord amen so we we just we just want to pray that the lord will be able to help us he will be able to teach us amen so we can order our steps amen praise the lord so we can order our steps glory be to god so as we look at this thought together let me start with something here the spoken word is the original seed amen this is something that i'm not going to finish today and i don't know when i'm going to finish it so i'm not in a hurry at all praise the lord let's take a talk here and study a little bit in uh this in in this uh quote we have here oh yeah we are going to get into something deep now now watch this sea church the real church with the real sperm that's the beginning church that's the alpha church that's the pentecostal church now remember god never committed his preaching and his gospel to an angel that's right amen but yet uh uh uh the the the ministers uh angels flame of fire okay that's what paul says let's follow this together now because i want us to study how many knows that how many knows that galatians 1 8 says even though an angel from heaven paul says even though an angel from heaven say anything to you that is not according to my gospel let that angel be a curse amen it shows the authority that a messenger a god-called man have more than an angelic being in heaven are we together amen so he says that [Music] knows that galatians 1 8 says if an angel comes from heaven and preached and preached something else besides they have preached that paul had preached let it be a curse so the the the angel's wrong if he doesn't if if he's different from the word that's right amen that's the reason why whether it's a dream whether it's a vision it must come back to the word of god it must be lined up with the word of god and that is the highest authoritative in the local church nothing is above the word amen it must come back to the word of god are we together god comes down below angels and committed to men praise the lord he committed to men which were sons you believe that now watch he never committed it to angels notice he did not do it now philip had been up at pentecost jerusalem to worship amen i mean he says amen to death the eunuch he have been with all the dd's in ll now what he's dealing with here is us chapter eight philip in the ethiopian unit amen now he's going to teach us a principle that's what i want us to grab as we look at this harmony but why didn't he get something he come down steadying the prophet the prophecy of isaiah although an angel directed him to philip but the dream of life had to come through the body praise the lord that is a very strong statement life only comes through the body amen you cannot live a successful christian life on an island you can never be an island believer life only comes through the body it takes a body a union to give life to you it takes a father and a mother to come together for you to be born so even in our spiritual life for you to be able to express the life of christ you must be attached to a body are we together he's talking about the european union now why didn't he get something he just came from the revival he came from ethiopia traveled all the way down he went down that he went to the pentecostal feast praise the lord but he wasn't he was an island he was he was uh a stranger now god was now expressing himself through a body that was born at pentecost the holy ghost has come the promise of joy has come among the believers god has started a new thing a body was born praise the lord and all all the you know uh the the news went every word i mean these men are speaking in tongues and they are seeing everything that is happening everybody hearing in their own languages praise the lord he came to the feast of pentecost and then he was on his way back he enjoyed what the soul enjoyed hearing these people speaking in different language enjoyed you know just enjoy the blessings and on his way back he took isaiah prophet prophet said in his reading isaiah 53 praise the lord and he's reading and it's just like he's reading you know reading french amen cannot connect hazard 53 is wounded for our transgression who believe i will report who the arm of the lord is relayed to you know as i asking out of this question who will believe our report who is the arm of lord riveto and he shall come out as a tender plane and he's reading all of this it sounds good but he cannot put it together because what he's reading is about a body that he's not attached to he cannot put it together are we together why didn't he guess something he come back down steady the prophecy of isaiah adore an angel director philip but the germ of life had to come through the body oh philip oh brother now we are on the line where the gem of life comes from through the angel the angels show him where to go angel is a messenger praise the lord years as son philip remember now we're talking about harmony between the father and the son amen praise the lord god now have a body on the earth called the pentecostal church or called pentecost called the first church called the book of arts whatever name we want to give it but you see that a heart to take a son that is born in that body praise the lord because life comes through the body just follow me in a little bit you see what we're driving down to here and philip had a gene uh a message the word that's how child can be born by the sea incorruptible not by guessing scripture amen amen now by putting our own scripture on scripture to our own understanding when the bible says we must lean that to our own understanding but in all of our ways we must acknowledge him that's how a child is born by the seed incorruptible now so what god was doing at that time it was 120 that experienced the baptising of the holy ghost in the upper room these people were the possessor of the seed incorruptible praise the lord are we together and there is a man here that i mean travel travel hundreds of miles see the kind of a sacrifice he came to the revival enjoy all the excitement all the healing he saw and he's on his way back and if god don't help him if god don't meet him on the way he's going to travel back empty as he came he could go and talk about all the excitement oh i saw these men speaking in tongues and everybody heard me oh my goodness it was gracious but he's just traveling just like an empty barrel rolled down the hill making a lot of noise but don't have no substance praise the lord and god wants his children to have substance so so this is how the child is born philip lay his hands upon him philip baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ there comes forth the spirit of god so now the gem had to come from the body what body christ's body that philip was part of are we together what body christ's body correct philip was a member of the body so he was a carrier of the life are we together the harmony between the father and the son you know because we are not making church no we're not making church god is giving birth to sons and daughters and the way he did it in the first age he must always do it that thank you way it's not calling people can't join our church let let make church you know can't join our no no no no god is giving life to sons and daughters of god that's right and until we a possessor of his spirit paul said we are not of haze praise the lord i mean that's the reason why we we we don't have to drag any national spirit around because it's not going to work it's not going to help us amen it's either by the word or we are out so you see it in every age on on the types and shadow there were men that were attached to the messenger of the age let the elijah there he came challenge those prophets on the mountain and and just at the time he was leaving god says go and and and meet elisha on the field and you know put put his mentor on elijah which of course brother branham explained that elijah had to grow 10 years to be able to fail fill that place he had to grow he had to learn it was not an overnight experience when he says where is the god of elijah it was not an overnight experience church he had to follow elijah across jordan he had to contend with the sons of the prophets it was not an overnight birth it was not a guessing game he was not guessing praise the lord it's so easy sometimes we get we get caught in in in excitement of a big group and in the excitement of many people but we have to watch that life we got to look at that lifeline and make sure that there is i mean there is just there's just one blood that is running through that lifeline and it must be the bleeding word praise the lord that's the only thing that connects us here is that's the bleeding word amen so you see it all through the scripture and yes and yes paul now you know he's talking to to uh to the corinthian church you know he's speaking to them that uh you may have ten thousand of instructors you have you have super preachers and super ministries and and you know and and man you know that has all of these uh uh public speaking ability praise the lord so you might have many many teachers but there's only one father praise the lord amen he says there is only you have only one father it takes uh just one man to give to give birth you know praise the lord hallelujah so we so we see it and we understand that god throughout all the ages has worked this way and year paul uh he head on to timothy as his own as his own son you know just like elijah was saying my father my father the husband of israel paul also trained timid in in so much until he said he said tim i have fought a good fight he said it to his son just like david calls solomon and say i have done all of this do the same and show yourself a man that that principle is all through the scripture praise the lord you know people have made a shipwreck of themselves and of the faith because we don't we don't try to understand and learn what god is doing even even even in our own lives the grace of god comes we get excited and pretty soon we think that we are the one that is running the show we don't understand what god is doing we are dealing with an infinite god praise the lord amen and that's what i want us to you know uh drive down a little bit and understand what what god is doing in this in this little little body on the corner of the street what is he trying to achieve here praise the lord what is he trying to achieve i want to hold i want to take you know you have these you have these uh one called you know uh scenario and one statement scenario you know that that stands out and and many times you know we build things around it but one of them i want to take this morning and i want us to study together praise the lord how can i overcome amen let's just study this uh this this together and then we will we will grab something here now the harmony of the father and the son is is is uh uh is going to exist between christ and the bride christ and the bride is husband and wife relationship amen father and son is his parent and child relationship praise the lord now so you see that's the two form of relationship that god deeds with us praise the lord amen he deals with us honor those form or relationship we we we just did not step into the word amen he brought us true parents so even even on our new birth like jesus taught the the the the the story of the good samaritan when he when he when he take us out of our sin he trusts us in the key of an innkeeper praise the lord amen so when when god take us out of the word he trusts us in the cure of the holy ghost is the innkeeper and the holy ghost will work through a 5-4 ministry praise the lord amen are we together i want you to grab where we going now amen now on the uh uh the care of the of the innkeeper he would deal with us as a child that was born and give us milk for us to eat and for our our muscles our spiritual strength to grow for us to grow in the lord and and we we we we go through the different stages as he deals with us and he brings us to the place of a mentor son and daughter of god praise the lord now honor the state of being sounds were he's dealing with us just like paul said to the galatians even though you are hearers of everything but god deals with you as a son amen so until we come to that place of spiritual maturity to understand what god is doing we don't we don't just be born and enter right into marriage relationship no you got to get on the parental relationship are we together because there's two things that we have to watch glory be to god now this uh this particular quote that we're going to read like i said is is one of these one standing code you know where brother branham says your pastor is your husband it's a one standing cult amen it has been a blessing to many and it have caused many damage they have ruined the life of meaning whenever there is a one standing statement it's always dangerous when it does not have support if you are not able to take it back to the scripture praise the lord i was visiting a little group in in in one town uh just spending uh the evening with them i preached a message i called into the scripture that was the message i preached for them that was last wednesday night jesus says session scripture amen he says search the scripture for in them there is there is no preacher in the bible that point back to the scripture like our lord jesus praise the lord he says search the scripture for in them they have spoken of me praise the lord so if we if we have you know uh uh that that foundation then i mean it's easy to be able to deal with some of these things amen it's very easy to be able to deal with these things because uh uh you know you you are able to to look at it you know and i was sharing with the believers i took that i took that uh uh jesus statements in john chapter 5 39 and then i went over where paul says in corinthians 15 he said jesus died i call into the scripture he rose again according to the scripture no he was buried and rose again according to the scripture so i told the church we got to go back to the scripture we got to go from genesis to see his death barrier and resurrection because if you see it in the scripture nothing can take it away from you it's not just what a man says yes praise the lord amen so we took uh uh genesis chapter 22 uh a little bit we share with you before we we're looking at the three days joining as jesus three this journey in hell abraham took three days joining with his son to get to the mountain so right in there was the death burial and resurrection we took rahab she told the spies go three days and hire yourself praise the lord and jesus had himself in the earth three days praise the lord so uh i want us to study this a little bit here this is 12 30 and i'm still floating yet amen i'm still floating i can feed it praise the lord but let's let's read together yet a little bit and let's let's study let's see the establishment of this thought let's see where it was coming from now well lot wife did the same thing now we're talking about overcomers in every age verb is talking about overcomer in every age and how how to overcome just like i said it's not what to overcome but how to overcome amen because if you know how to overcome you can overcome anything lord wife did the same thing you know she set out to go with lot follow her husband her children her loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the word praise the lord amen so it's possible you can make a stat and still be in and still be the word in you amen you are just coming along but you you're struggling with those those wallet desires and and and wallet habits amen and uh uh uh like i mean taking taking all i mean your your inspiration from the word instead of from the word of god amen see she never she never overcome and even though she was well on the road it finally overthrew her and that's what we are seeing with all of these people that are coming up with reason why they can't save the lord anymore reason why i stopped to be a christian reason why i'm not in the message praise the lord search the reason you can't even see a scriptural base they were overthrowed she had to take that one big long last look the angel said go and don't low back praise the lord go and don't look back but that was just something too hard for her to do because it was not what was behind her it was what was in her heart it was not what was behind her that made her to look back it was the desire that was in her heart that made her to look back so if that desire is not dead with praise the lord you can just hang on for dear life as long as you want to hang on but it's your desire that will take you back praise the lord amen those men came across the red sea they saw the egyptians drawn and and and they saw the sea coming back together there is no way to there is no road to go but yet the desire for the garlic of egypt was in their heart [Music] there is no road to go back but yet they want to go back it's not because they know how to carry themselves back it's all because they are honoring an influence of a desire in their heart even though they don't know any role to go back they're still going to drown themselves it's your desire that will drown you praise the lord if you don't destroy it it will destroy you praise the lord big long last look there were she got cut don't even look back don't have no desire keep going put your mind on cavalry and keep moving towards christ praise the lord she started out as an overcomer we can do this praise the lord amen i mean she she's in the prayer meeting she's in the choir she's i mean she started out we can do this started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome oh she left the denomination she did she walked out of sodom with lot but she wanted to go back and have her haircut you know what i mean you know he's just throwing that in you know see she had to go back she just couldn't stand the tests she had to look back again to see what the rest of them are doing instead of looking at what god is doing her interest was to see what the others are doing amen praise the lord she got to respond to every post on facebook that just meant dropping that in there [Laughter] that's me just dropping that in there don't mind me i'm trying to keep myself awake praise the lord let's set it together yeah there's the place of interest i want to bring you amen she had to look back see what the rest of them are doing oh you know i had some good friends down there after all and after all this my this my just a little a little move now if you look at this you have to remember it's jesus own teaching jesus was the one in luke 17 that says remembers lot's wife that's jesus own teaching amen so which means there is something about that story that is very important and he's identifying it over to the very age where the son of man will be revealed in the revealing of the son of man remember lost wife and there's a lot there to remember praise the lord oh let's just take a little journey and and and and think about what was happening we know what happened that love went down there he went he went to sodom you know uh uh uh a separator from abraham praise the lord but you see he he carried he carried most of the things that he learned from abraham amen in his heart he still had a desire to to worship that god that abraham was always talking about that is telling him you know what about elaine uh uh uh that he was going to be the father of many nations lord god his wife and and the bible says they had two daughters glory be to god amen hallelujah there is there is a there is a there's a biblical principle here that you have to watch every time the scripture tells us to watch something you have to look at it very closely because it's fulfilling something major praise the lord are we together now lord went down to sutton with his wife and his two daughters because they were under the the teaching of abraham they were honored the protection of abraham they got down there to saw them with all the pollution and all the evil things that were happening in sodom god kept the life of these two young girls praise the lord even though we will learn that there were other children that came along because the prophet of god said she she looked back because she was thinking about her grandchildren well a picture of of the last this church is the alberta and says when lord wife got down there she became part of all the society she joined the women community committee she joined this other one she joined this other one and all of that and then you realize that there were a lot of children that came along that turned out not to be lost children because the scripture make emphasis on the two daughters than the rest of the children so this was a church that got herself into the word just like revelation 18 17 church that god pregnant with with many seeds of adultery trying to be part of everything praise the lord and she brought children of every committee and every society she joined she bring for a child of that society the blessings of abraham was upon these two those were the two that could hear the the angel voice abraham tell those men sodomites and say i have two daughters that are virgins praise the lord are you seeing the principle that's the last this age remember lord's wife glory be to god amen now so she came out as son as an overcomer but she never did overcome on oh she left the denomination she walked out of sodom with lot but she wanted to go back praise the lord she had to go back she just couldn't stand the test she had to go back and see what the rest of them was doing praise the lord i don't know whether it could be right i have only got this man word for it now she's uh she's the one talking now she's uh i don't know if this will be right he's the one that says the angel said we should get out amen i only have this man word for it she's referring to lord watch carefully now as we study this together she's referring to love i don't know whether it could be right i want to have this man this uh only god this man were for a dog he's my husband now there the statement comes in your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking lord was not the messenger of that age abraham was the messenger praise the lord i want for you to study carefully now praise the lord amen lord was not the messenger it was abraham that was interceding elohim was in the camp of abraham praise the lord because this one-line statement has created a lot of havoc it has wrong wrong people and and and and and actually when you look at you look at the expression as you go there and you will realize that this was just a passing statement it was not even a doctrine it was not a doctrine praise the lord i cannot take this man word for it i only got this i mean uh uh i don't know whether it could be right i've only got this man word for it though he is my husband but yet your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking you see now whether whether it could be right or not i don't know maybe his revelation wasn't right then if you are perfectly satisfied you are not perfectly know that it's the word of god then you can go see you've got to be really so out now so my question over the years how is that phrase related to everything that is here right here they are phrased that have empowered men over the ages problem says i'm your husband i'm the spiritual hustler what was he referring to here what was he teaching praise the lord i hope when you go home tonight you'll have a good night's sleep god has used the both relationship he have used the parental relationship and he have also used the marriage relationship to deal with his church amen he have used the parental relationship to nurture us as children amen and you have also used the marriage relationship to establish us to position a place us in our age and our dispensation not even in the body because it's a dispensational thing when you come to the bride praise the lord are we together as i was thinking about this a couple of weeks ago just before travel i was studying and i was thinking about basing and i went back and started listening to the prophet of god i mean my mind was blown my mind was completely blown let's travel together here a little bit and see now he's talking about lord's wife struggling over the instruction of her husband praise the lord which of course he's the head of the whom amen he's the one the angel spoke to and said get out of here i can do nothing until you get out praise the lord and and she told he told his family and says i mean uh uh susan we got to get out of here whether that was her name on that but we will use it amen an angel said we shouldn't look back let's just keep going amen and they were going and they had the two daughters going praise the lord the blessing of abraham kept those girls and they were going hallelujah amen a year on the away girl when she came out she joined the group and on their way during a year she's struggling in her he's describing her struggling in her mind struggling in in her desires well if it is true what god didn't why the injured two did not appear to me it's only a lot i don't know i i don't know why i mean if they destroy down it we did not destroy where we are going she's struggling with all of these things in her mind praise the lord it comes under the context of leadership he's bringing a context of leadership he's now dealing with the context of a direct relationship amen because it's a a a a lot harder message from the angel he told his wife amen and they are going she had she had a choice to stay if she wanted to so he's dealing with the context of leadership praise the lord and we know that sons of god are led by the spirit of god god have not set a man over the church to be the leader the holy ghost is the leader the man must be under the leadership of the holy ghost to lead the people in the world so he's dealing with the context of leadership he's not dealing with the context of me getting myself involved in your life and your decision praise the lord because that is the card that people with men's leadership that impose themselves on the people that's the card they draw out i'm the spiritual husband you have to do as i say he's dealing with the context of leadership amen praise the lord and if i get honor the context of leadership if i get under the context of leadership i will tell you that when it comes over to the family life god set a man in your home your husbands if we deal with the context of leadership if i'm on the leadership of the holy spirit that is backed by the scripture i must not step over your husband and rule over you praise the lord you must not trash your husband down and say i will go to the pastor that's wrong leadership honor the context of leadership that's what he was dealing with praise the lord amen you find in all of these uh uh uh spiritual church's year the pastor dead he cycled with all of the women the other one leaving the church the spiritual people they're right behind him praise the lord it's honored the context of leadership it's a divine order the bible says if a woman will learn anything let her ask her husband at home that's the divine order you see that's the reason why harmony is important because if the harmony of the spirit is not there we will break these laws and trying to look for godly results you cannot get godly result when you break god's laws he's dealing with the context of leadership and it even gets better it even gets better oh praise the lord you love the lord amen that's the reason why i hope you understand what we are doing here praise the lord amen we are not uh we're not in coming around the man no we want to get under the right leadership of the holy spirit are we together praise the lord amen you know this is the word that rules praise the lord and that's the reason why you know the bible says let a woman keep silence when the words start lining up like this the church is easy to go silent because it's the word that rules just leave the world down oh you can get there god bless you here that's it when you're working there out in emotion start to lay the word down the church will keep selling that's what the apostle paul says let the church keep silent when the word is in his place that is the highest authority in the local church that is the word of god nothing is above the word [Music] and if we will get result we must do it the way god says in his word amen god god is obligated to his word now to our selfish desires and selfish motives and self-breed things in our mind you know one thing that gave richard hard time in her travel was the adult of her father you have to remember rachel stole the idol of her father and she hated jacob never even knew about it because jacob swore before his father if you finally the person you found with let them die he prophesied death over his wife and she died in childbirth she struggled with the idol of her father and that's what people struggle with they travel with that idol it's in their spirit it's in their mind and they try to bring everything through it have to come true that way of understanding praise the lord [Music] but the word has come to make us free for he that the world made free this free indeed if we can just embrace truth and say lord deliver me from all my idols i'm ready to break them down i'm ready to get rid of them amen praise the lord scripture says where your treasure is there where your heart will be her treasure her heart was where her treasure was and her treasure was her idol that she hate her treasure was her idol that she had we have hidden hidden idols hidden denominational idols hating message idols she had a prophecy of death hanging over her because jacob said it yeah look people the scripture is deep we are not we are not gathering around feebles of men the one that we have to deal with is almighty god and we better bring our hearts right oh yes you'll be surprised of your end let's travel a little bit i think i got you to where i need to get you now i can let you go home i meet you on wednesday night let's continue yet a little bit so she's dealing she's dealing with this thing now now whether whether it could be right or not i don't know that's that lost wife dealing with her own struggle maybe his revelation wasn't right then if if if you are not perfectly satisfied you are not perfectly you know that it it it's the word of god then you can go you know she's struggling with all of that see you've got to be really so out you got to know not just say well i see other doing it so let me do it too that just follow follow amen no you got to be sure you got to you got to know that you got to be sure ask a question why are we doing this in this church praise the lord don't compare us with with all the rest of your internet churches find out why are we doing it why we do it this way and we are obligated to convince you by the scripture by the message of the hour come without our our fancy idea and we think we know what we're doing he says you do feel you can just leave now brown switching over here now this is at the closing closing of the of that message he preached now he's encouraged the people into overcoming but there's something he said here very important that it just blew my mind it blew my mind he's encouraging the church here he said do you feel that you you can just leave everything you're burdened you can just walk over above it now if you do raise up your hands by god's grace i'll lay my tries down i won't fight anymore praise the lord he's talking about committing to the world because it's the word i overcome now you overcoming you are no match to the devil praise the lord amen no it's the word that overcomes so he said you are surrounding to the word by the grace of god i won't fight anymore i'm just going to take a hold of his hands and start walking take a hold of god's hands and start walking i have fought yeah i have fought he said brother i've tried to quit smoking i've tried i tried to help let my head grow out you know all of those different things we all can identify things in our life that we're fighting and struggling with don't pretend like you don't have one [Music] i have tried so hard brother branham i just can do it don't try anymore just take a hold of his hands and say father you put my hands in the sleeves see i'm just going to give you my hands i'm going to walk on lord looking to you it will happen he will dress you like a real christian amen you will be a real christian until i can see you for the next series he says tonight god love you and be with you you are my children in the gospel now that's the thing that blow my mind if brother branham was establishing the doctrine after saying that your pastor is your husband he will have stayed with the thought that i am your husband but he goes back to the scriptural principle then you are my children it's the same message honor the same inspiration why should he change his thought what was he trying to establish that he should say your pastor is your spiritual husband close the service and say you are my children i told you we owned this for a while we are on this for a while and we will trust and pray that the holy spirit will help us praise the lord amen he says just put your hands in his hands he says he would dress you like a real christian amen stop start trying and start fighting on your own just surrounded to he that have overcome he have overcome death health and the grace praise the lord he will dress you like a real christian you'll be a real christian until i see you tonight god love you and be with you you are my children in the gospel you are the purchase praise the lord so we realized that the spirit that have drive that one phrase that one-line doctrine that have grown homes and ruined the life of people that have possessed the inheritance of people and possessed their lives because they think they had an instruction from a prophet that they are a spiritual husband that was an evil spirit that was now what god's prophet was teaching he stayed in the context of god's word there is nowhere in the scripture where paul says you are my wife he says you are my children in the lord and i have exposed you to christ as a chaste virgin [Applause] praise the lord now so we see here that uh that's the two form of relationship that god has did with his his church he put us on a ministry to parent us amen the ministry is to be apparent unto you praise the lord i don't think i'm qualified in a ministry to call people like brother wesley my son in the lord people that have been serving the lord before i was born but i also think it's a privilege when i see god trust people like that to me i don't take advantage of it i know the ability is not in the man is the holy spirit the parent but that's god's principle it must not be overlooked [Music] you cannot turn around says what is what is his age said which year he was born that small little thing behind our pulpit i've been serving god before before he even uh he was just in diapers when i got saved praise the lord whether i was in a womb or i was in dapper it pleased the lord for this body to place me over this local assembly and then i must submit myself to the holy ghost to be able to parent you in the world that's the way god ordained it [Applause] that's the way he ordained it praise the lord i don't need to bring a chisel on it and make myself tall are we together you understand why i'm going this morning praise the lord you know what i mean and people come by they don't they don't understand uh you know uh uh no don't even have an idea uh you know uh what is going on they just sit back they are observers they are daily users amen they observe they take notes i know what is going on in that church i know what is going on i've observed exactly what is going on in that church you are just as dealing as ever you are listening to a spirit of lie praise the lord amen let me tell you something let me tell you something every for god to create that connection for him to create that connection the attachment we have to our earthly parents is because we were birthed by them amen so for god to create that connection he will put you under a ministry that will break you in an experience not for your your your new breath but that ministry will break you in an experience because that's where the trust comes that's the way god do it that's the way he connects you praise the lord amen oh mine well there are things that we'll talk about they are things that we'll talk about praise the lord because we want the lord to have his way we want the preeminence of christ to abide in this place praise the lord amen we want the preeminence of christ to abide in this place we want every man that comes behind this pupae to have the liberty to preach the gospel of jesus christ we don't want a man established in the hearts of the people praise the lord not a pastor not a prophet we don't want no
