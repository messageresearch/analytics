========================================

die with pneumonia all respiration that's it that morning at nine o'clock in his office and this is ten something at night when you come back to life again because a little woman was persistent if God could Open the Eyes of a blind man he also could give her a Baby Alive she's still the same God the night you've got to be persistent to achieve something or should have listened and said well a baby's dead and just give it up and go on see they sit up that same faith that lives in a woman like to shoot a woman it still lives in people today once in a while they can strike that something not a plural not a make-believe but something that's real something that's that's genuine don't you think we can do that tonight now we are going to pray for the sick laying hands up old man in the name of the Lord Jesus to pray for them now um we probably can have the line through and about all perhaps 20 30 minutes now we can't stop for a discernment you really understand that because it'd be so much but we're going to pray and lay hands on the sick are you ready tonight do you feel in your heart something's anchored the present how many has been near the meeting through the week let's see your hands oh yes practice yeah hold on all right how many never been in one of the meetings before raise your hand well not let's have well I guess some can't get in well let me just say to them for some of me have a prayer card Divine Healing is something that God has already done the it's something we believe and I believe with all my heart that the Bible of Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever he's the same and I believe that the life that was in Christ should be in us if we're Christian and he said in Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also said to Saint John 5 19 I do nothing till the father shows me is that right amen now here for instance share every one of these far as I know is strangers to me all right I want everybody to be real revered for a moment and if Jesus Christ doesn't appear abundance in his same power that I'm a false prophet don't listen to me no more how many here doesn't have a prayer card you won't be in no prayer line raise up your hands anywhere you're at you look this way and pray with all your heart and belief this is a heart wasn't income prepared for this now but I know we ain't got much longer to stay here now I'm going to take every spirit in your under my control in the name of Jesus Christ I sit still and if you don't believe uh or keep your head down but if you're a Believer the Bible said that he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity and how did he act when the woman touched him he turned around and know who she was and what was wrong with her he perceived the thoughts of their heart but you believe he's the same today and forever if you have a need you pray now and what is who are you talking about brother Brown [Music] if I'm his servant and our claim in his life is in here then the same Works will show themselves now you know a man can't do those things it's impossible [Music] but Christ Remains the Same I want you to believe that anywhere in ability I want you to have faith in God and just believe it and you say Lord Jesus the man doesn't know me and I've been hearing about this but maybe it's so me I don't know but I know he doesn't know me and I know if he could tell me I says your healing is already done if Jesus is standing right here now with this pseudom and he gave me he could not heal you how many knows that your Bible see North he's already done amen right see he could prove that he was Jesus saved yesterday and forever not the nail scars his life anybody could have nail scars and wear a long hair maybe in a beard we don't even know he'll dress like that we couldn't say that was right but any man could do that but his life is what it is his life in you now you pray and you say Lord Jesus let me touch you and find out whether he remains the saint yesterday and forever [Music] you feel do it will you believe you know that's what he did that proves he'd be Messiah this little lady sitting here keeps looking up at me and putting her hands over her face and so forth you never you don't have a prayer card I suppose you I mean the little lady you don't have a prayer card no all right do you believe me to be God's servant if the Lord Jesus Christ stands we're perfectly strangers we're we're A different race one from the other but if I can just speak to you you're sitting in front of you as a good friend of mine Mr Dao from down in Ohio but he had a complete heart failure not long ago and 91 years old doctors give him up and everything I started to him he's a lovely brother he and his lovely wife sitting there they're good friends of mine and I started to him now just coming out of a filling station trying to get to him about a couple 300 miles from me and I was driving as hard as I could to get to him because he she called me said Bill's dying complete heart failure and a heart attack and 91 years old and has started our filling station I seen Bill standing

you had to now in the presence of God that's exactly what our Lord did that's exactly what he promised in the last days that's exactly what happened before Sodom burned that's exactly the last time that would come to the church we're here now at the end time you believe it what's your prayer card number all right I'll tell you what would be best let's take the People by the sections he says there's many prayer cards now you see God is sure now is there any ministers this is all right baby is there any ministers here Brethren now in laying hands all these people I don't want that people go say brother Branham did this see uh I'm just your brother your pastor had just as much right to pray for the sick as I do he might not have this gift no he hasn't I mean there's only one of them in the world of time that's what the Bible says that's not and that's now notice but your pastor is ordained of God if he's a Believer to pray for the sake and I'm asking some of you Minister Brethren to come here and stand with me while we pray let some God Spirit-filled ministers that bleeds in prayer for the sake but along with brother Vic brother bozay where's Dr Lee Veil and some of them at what's come here so that the Bible said these signs let's stop right here further and how about right here come right here yes these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover you believe that do you believe we're in divine presence of Christ amen I just want you to see because I spoke the way I did it was for a purpose I think are the purpose worked right things you're fixing to happen if you'll just believe it I'll tell you what I want you to do Brethren I want you to about divide up half on one side and half on her and make a little alley like you hear so the people can come I'm coming right down with you I'm going to ask someone who is a song leader that would come here that could lead songs I want to go down there and pray for the people somebody who can stand here and direct the people that's going to be prayed for thank you for our forgiving US money Knives have you giving us that room to come like that all right let the ministers lineup is like this right face each other see like this like the brother and I like Billy and I hear a stand like this one with the other images now how many has prayer cards on this side let's see your hand that's quite a number I suppose it'd be best if we could let them come out on this side and come right down along the side this awaits now before you go let's set uh the first part of the line has charge let them fly not up over here and we'll start praying for the sticks and laying hands on that I wonder how many here tonight is it's all right in well and you're interested in these people getting well raise up your hand sure you are now remember will you pray with me you pray with me now you pray with your pastors now to you sick people let's go to line up and be prayed for here remember when you come to this line and these ministers and myself touch you remember it's just to act just the same as you was baptized you've come having hands laid up on you by believing ministers that God promised that the prayer faith shall save the sick and these signs shall follow them that believe these men come here to testify that they believe in this ministry and they'll come here as Associates to with us together we're all of One Of Cards we're in one place at one time it's time now for the healing but if you don't believe it don't come of course it won't do you any good see you've got to believe it now do you believe now that's just by our heads just for a few moments and we're going to sing slowly now everybody with your head bound Lord Lord I believe only believe now everyone together let's be praying now let's imagine seeing Jesus coming down off of the mountain what Jesus that same Jesus that's here in the Holy Ghost form same one that knows what's in your heart whether you really believe or not the same one that knows all about you tells you not after night it's him you know it couldn't be me and now Ash is the is present now the little silky open Moment remember after she got in the presence of Jesus still she had trouble you're going to have trouble when you come to this line I want you each want to believe that you're going to be healed if you're not don't come in don't don't just don't take the other's Place stay there until you have enough faith that you're going to be healed and then God will grant it to you now those on my right side here line up over on the side while the rest of us saying only leave you with a prayer card some of the boys will be standing here to receive your prayer card as you come into life over on this side the right hand side go out on the right hand side if you possibly can cause it'll confuse them start this way you can't go backwards you have to come around this way see it has come one way go around if your brothers step back and let them come through this way it's a bit may seem a bit confusing because if there's such a a group of people to be taken care of but uh watch my son Billy Paul what's the ushers there they'll tell you just how to do it won't be a bit confused then you see on this side as you come to the prayer line then you go right back to your seat and then we'll take this other side and they'll come from that way and come through see now we'll stand here just Vice versus the line from one side to the other and pray for them all right now believe if you Brethren move down just a little bit so these brothers Cher can get in right you're sowing all feeling hands on the sea that's just fine now our list Brethren each one of you each one of you realize what you're doing you know the position that God's precious uh this challenges your faith yes remember and that you go to sleep every person that you touch has to get well they just have to do it God said so I'm going to touch him with you and I'll be either going back to be well would you believe that amen let us have a word of care about yourself while the rest of the boy is lining up we're going to pray for the condition of our own faith Heavenly Father there's many sick people here and some of them Lord still believe that they should have hands of the elders later on that's all right father we know that you taught that you said these signs shall follow them at least if they lay their hands on a stick they shall end up [Music] already done enough and here's your own standing here Harding into the Holy Spirit [Music] and we pray the best the Lord God we're going to believe that what are we live [Music] he [Music] [Music] pray alive oh God they're coming as if they were coming to water baskets they're coming back to the table of the lord they're coming beneath the cross of town as they pass New Year they didn't realize that's the Unseen Christ is standing in amongst his presence saving you down every morning and I commit it all to you now father in the name of Jesus Christ thank you Jesus now I want everyone else have your head spout listen close down to your instructions if you don't you're just taking a walk I remember if God will let me know the conditions and so forth and you believe that now just take my words you've got to believe that this settlement if it doesn't it might make you worse and settle everything if you've got sin in your life step out of the line and confess it don't come in the line until you're praying truth and if you're going to use your life or something besides the glory of God don't come in the line see if you're ready to make a dedication to Christ fully surrendered and fully persuaded that this is Jesus Christ this great Holy Spirit here and you're going to receive your healing when you pass through this line no matter what do you feel different or what you're going to be persistent the whole right under God's promises until a victory comes like that over did we talk do you feel that way if you do raise up your hand say I accept that foreign now I want you that's not in the line to pray I guess Brother Joseph is going to stand here to lead to singing and I'm going to get down here so I can pray to you and lay hands upon these people as they come through now look friends the services will be tomorrow night we don't know what'll
