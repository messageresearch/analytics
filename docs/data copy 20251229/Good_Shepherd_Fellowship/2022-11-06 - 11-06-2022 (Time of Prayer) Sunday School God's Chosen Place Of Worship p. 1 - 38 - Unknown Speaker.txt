foreign [Music] foreign [Music] of Grace by faith we move into the Beyond or God and the angels and the cherubins and all the Heavenly Host is assembled together or he said there cannot be even a sparrow fall to the ground without a Heavenly Father knowing it how much more does he know here when hundreds of people have their heads bowed and calling up on the far special requests father looked down upon the needy world tonight for we are needy people I pray God that because that we have assembled here and expressing to thee our faith and a living God who does answer prayer we have come out from among the world of the uncircumcised of the heart and ears come out to live a separate life and to live in confessing our faith in thee tonight we've raised our hands and saying we're needing dear God answer every one of their requests and then father we pray that you have visited us tonight in the word we come here for correction for understanding that we might know just how to live in this present day what to look forward to what to do for we know the coming of the Lord is drawing now according to all the signs that the prophets foretold we're nearing the time lord when complete deliverance will be given to your children God let us everyone be their father May there not be one missing that's our purpose of being here Lord we love you and we're trying to prepare for that hour speak to us we ask again tonight and heal the sick all the sick and Afflicted that's in the building we pray that you'll heal them Lord and especially them with spiritual needs we pray that you'll save our lost soul feel every believer with the Holy Spirit and renew the strength and power in your believing children Grant these things father we asked much because you told us to ask them uh ask abundance ask for great things many of them that our Joys might be made full and we ask then in Jesus Christ's name amen Lord and be seated yeah I certainly deem this the grand privilege tonight to be back here to platform again here in this High School to face These Fine people that's gathered out to hear the gospel I ask God's mercy to help me to tell you the truth as far as I know the truth he still can close the mouth of a man he seems he could the mouth of a lion and if I had ever tried to see anything that was wrong and contrary to his will my sincere prayer is that he closed my mouth that I won't say it or truly I want to be in heaven myself and I'll never be there and besides all that I'd be a false leader somebody who had done something falsely if I do it it's because I don't know no different the Lord bless you now tomorrow morning if it be the will of God I aim to speak on that subject marriage and divorce and we trust that you'll come and bring your pencils and papers we won't take too long but I just like that that was my purpose of being back here first in Indiana that I promised you that and I will try tomorrow morning if I don't get it tomorrow morning it will tomorrow night but I will try tomorrow morning if the Lord willing to speak on the subject the two schools of thoughts and may God help us to know what is truth just to know what's true so we can walk in truth and in life we you know used to have an old colored friend he said to me he said brother Billy said I don't want any trouble at the river he said I want to have my ticket in my hand and when the whistle blows I don't want any trouble there I've asked the Lord a long time ago if there's anything wrong let me set it up right now that because it'll be dark and stormy on that morning when the ship pulls out for the other side that I don't want any interference I want to take care of all of it now that's what we're here for try to take care of all the interferences so that we can walk aboard on that hour now I won't speak to you very long tonight because we got two Services tomorrow and then I take right off somewhere else to another more services but now in the book of Deuteronomy I wish to read from the 16th chapter the first three verses of Deuteronomy 16 and 1-3 observe the month of Abid and keep the past over the Lord die God in the fourth month of avid the Lord thy God brought the fourth out of out of Egypt by night Thou shalt therefore say sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flocks and of the herd in the place which the Lord has chosen to place his name there now my subject tonight is God's chosen place of worship if you notice the month ABA D be there is means April the month of April is when they were brought out and now the strange thing is that we denied as worshipers of God in this day that we live in and we find so many different ideas of people and as long as there's different ideas about things there's got different questions there's got to be one true answer that ever question that's asked if I would ask the question what is this well let's say a desk what is it for see now there somebody might say it isn't your test it's a board well it is a board but yet it's a desk you see there's got to be a true answer to it and if I asked a question about anything there's got to be a true answer there can be something close to it but there's got to be a true direct answer to every question so therefore every question that comes up in our lives there's got to be a true correct answer and now today we hear it said so many of our people in the world today as being a missionary have taken several trips across the sea and around the world I've been in contact with many different religions such as Buddha and Muhammad and and Sikhs and genes and what more uh of the religions of the world and then here in our own United States and other foreign countries meet with all of our different churches such as our denominational churches beginning with the early Roman Catholic and then to the Greek and so forth and the different rights and then down into the all the denominational ages of 900 and something different Protestant denominations now each one of them of course you could see their idea and I cannot blame them each one claims that they are the truth they have the truth and uh the people it belongs to those churches should believe that because they have staked their their destination their Eternal destination upon the teaching of that church and there's so much different one from the other so it makes 900 and something different questions therefore being 900 and something different questions there's got to be one correct answer and I would like for us tonight being that we're trying to go to heaven and to meet our lord Jesus who we all love I would like to search in the scriptures to find that now if it is a Bible question then it should have a Bible answer it should not be able to come from a group of man from any certain uh a fellowship are from some educator or from some denomination it should come straight from the scripture where God's meeting place is of worship and surely being God there is a meeting place somewhere that he meets now we find out here that in Deuteronomy here at the beginning Moses reciting back the scripture the things that he had told them how he brought him out the great strong arm out of Egypt and at first established them they were called the people of God until they come out of the Egypt and then they were called The Church of God because the church is a congregating or the way the church means called out ones those who have been called out and they come out of Egypt in order to be the church now God told them when the before they established the temple whatever they did I will choose the place of My Worship and I'll put my name in it and that's the only place that God would ever meet anybody was by his own choosing he chose his place and where he chose his place he put his name the second verse here tells us that he would put his name in the place that he had chosen for people to worship Him in now the thing of it is we want to find where that place is with 900 and something different ideas being we're bypassing all Heathen religion and just speaking of Christian religion which uh uh have a feeling for the heathens or I certainly wouldn't be going over there talking to him but they're wrong Christianity is the only religion that's true it's Christianity I'm saying that not exactly because I am a Christian because I believe that to be the truth it's the only religion that's right I've been to the Grave where the white horse has changed every four hours where Muhammad a great uh priest and leader right after Christ was supposedly to be a prophet and I don't doubt for what he was right it's a Maccabee Brothers but when they he died he claimed that he had raised again and would conquer the whole world now about every four hours they changed guards and they keep a white horse at his grave they have for two thousand years expecting him to rise again and conquer the world but you see and you go to Buddha Buddha live um many hundred years about 2300 years ago the god of of Japan and um so he was a philosopher something like Confucius and so forth but all these four uh Founders and so forth all of them died with their philosophy and buried and in the grave but Christianity which is established by Jesus Christ there is an empty tomb he was the only man that ever stood on Earth and lived and said I have power to lay my life down and raise it up again and he did it and he lives today and we know he lives because he is with us and proves himself by physical signs and wonders that he promised that he would do to show it in so much as a pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness it's with us today even having his picture taken performing the signs and wonders that he promised it would do in this day seeing all the words that he promised being made Manifest this day therefore the rest of heathen world is out it's Christianity now being if there's 900 and something questions about where God meets he meets with the Methodist or he meets in the Baptist and he meets and this and that the other now there's a question there so everyone has to seek out his own salvation with fear and trembling but tonight I want to try to find and prove in the scripture where the correct place is where God meets and worships with the people and if that's it that's the only place you'll ever meet now we took this text out of Deuteronomy it's a Greek word which uh has a compound meanings or it means two laws the Greek word Deuteronomy means two different laws and that's just what God has two different laws and one of them is the law of death and the other is a law of life God has two laws to follow him and serve him and worship him his life to reject it is death there's two laws in God now one of those laws was made recognized to the world at Mount Sinai God gave the law to Moses and Israel not if the law could help them but the law only pointed out to them that they were Sinners until that time they didn't know what sin was so they had a law there cannot be a law without a penalty a law is not a law without penalty so therefore the transgression of the law is sin and the wages of sin is death so therefore until God made them a law there was no uh transgression reckon to him if there's no law here says you can't run over 20 miles an hour then you can run over 20 miles an hour but when there's a law says you can't do it then there's a law and the penalty behind it now death or the law of death was the Commandments given on Mount Sinai I was told man that he was a sinner and a transgress God's law he died but there's no salvation in the law the it was only a policeman that could put you in jail it had nothing to bring you out with but then he gave another law that was at Mount Calvary where sin was reckoned in Jesus Christ and there the penalty was paid and not with without law but by Grace you are saved by the grace of God through predestination for God's foreknowledge of your being now we see these two laws Deuteronomy speaking of two laws there was two laws one was the law of death and the other in the law of Life there was also two covenants give to the people we're going to speak of them in the morning one of them was given to Adam on condition if you do this and don't do that but that law was broken Adam Eve broke that in the Garden of Eden then God made the second Covenant and give that to Abraham and that law was unconditional it isn't what you've done or what you will do he said I've already done it that's Grace That's the Law of life God did that for Abraham and his seed after him that's all of Abraham's seed as the Bible said all Israel will be saved but that don't mean Jews as Paul said that Israel which is inward are Israel outward outward as we spoke of other night it was Isaac's children by sex but the law of God was through Christ which was Abraham's Royal seed that by Grace all Israel is saved that's all that's in Christ is saying oh god's second Covenant but all these things foreshadowed Christ now notice the second verse the second verse here in Deuteronomy 16 Worship in the place that I have chosen now you must worship God he said in a place that I have chosen not what someone else chose but what I have chosen now if God chose the place it behooves us then to find out what he said about it amen and where is it yeah I want to find it because truly I want to worship Him we all are here tonight to worship him we're sitting here tonight as Methodist Baptist Catholic Jehovah Witness Christian Science and all but we're all seeking something we want to know truth the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free somebody you can't know what you're doing you don't know how to do it until you know how to do it you don't know what to do until you know how to do it rather you must know what you're doing and how to do it this Son shows us that God has a meeting place for his worshipers and one certain place and that place only God meets his worshipers now also the place he has chosen for his worshipers he claimed he would put his name now let's search out and find through the scripture where this place is surely if God said he had put his name in this place where he had chosen to meet the people and worship with them or them worship Him rather that is somewhere in the Bible for it was for all ages and the great unchanging God cannot change man changes but you can put your life upon anything that God ever said at any time because it is truth it is truth because that's the only thing I can have confidence in is the Bible because man's word will fail but God is supreme to this year I should know more than an old last year you should too each day we're finite so we gain knowledge but God is infinite is infinite and being infinite he cannot gain knowledge he is perfect to begin with every decision has to be exactly right and the way God acted one time he must forever act that way or he acted wrong when he act the first time if a man ever come to God for salvation upon the bases that he accepted him on it's got to be accepted on that same basis every time that's right if a man ever come to God for Divine Healing and God accepted him up on a certain base the next man comes he's got to accept them the same way or he did wrong when he accepted the first man God made a basis that he would meet a man on he made a basis at what he would do how he would do it and that is to the sacrificial blood of a lamb in the Garden of Eden God has never no time ever changed it right he decided I would save man we've tried today to educate man into it we tried to school him tried to educate him try to denominate try to do all these other kinds of things bring them in shake them in baptize them in every other way there is bring him in by letters but Still Remains the Same God beats the man under the shed blood of the Lamb amen amen blood was God's way in the beginning a blood's a God's way tonight it's good to do Penance and all these things but Salvation only comes through blood blood is the only way that God chose to save man and he cannot change it job had the same thing he knowed he was a righteous because he had offered the sacrifice that God had required of him now let us search now to see what this place is and a place he put his name we're going to have to find out where he put his name then if we find out what God's name is and where he put it then we got the place of worship as soon as we find that all these things of course is the shadows of things to come all the law was foreshadowing of the things to come just like the Moon is a shadow of the sun it serves in the absence of the sun just like the church is to serve in the absence of the s o n of God in the absence of the son the Lesser light the church the Believers serve God give life in the absence of the Sun but when the Sun rises you don't see the moon no more because it's gone down it doesn't need its light anymore because it only gets the side secondarily off the sun now like husband and wife the sun and moon is church in Christ now we find that these things being a shadow of Christ every sacrifice feast and everything in the Old Testament foreshadow Christ just as the shadow strikes across the floor now here's where we're going to have to find the correct place of worship is to go back here in the Old Testament where it was given and see what these things were now when a shadow comes across the floor you can tell whether it's man woman or beast or whatever it might be because it casts a shadow upon the floor and as that shadow gets shorter the shadow being a negative and there cannot be a negative without a positive therefore when the positive becomes closer to the negative the negative is swallowed up in the positive the Shadow and the and the positive comes together and that's what makes it then uh the positive and if all the old things the Bible said in the Old Testament were Shadows of the things to come then therefore Christ was a shadow of things to come so we can see by the Old Testament types where he chose to put his name and uh to for now now as the shadow is uh crosses the forest that is a negative being a type so we the worshipers also can see the Shadows of the Old Testament Fading Into the positive of the new now all the feasts the holidays all the Tabernacle all the wood everything in the Tabernacle everything type Christ all the offerings all the laws everything was a type of Christ we've been through it time after time here at the Tabernacle then we see by these that every Creed church and denomination is left far behind yes it's not even in the race at all every Creed every church every denomination is completely left out there's no place farm at all [Music] [Music]
