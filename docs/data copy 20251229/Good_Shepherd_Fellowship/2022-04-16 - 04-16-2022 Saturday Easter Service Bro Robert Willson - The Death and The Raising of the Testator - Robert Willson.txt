praise the lord hallelujah amen it's good to be in the house of the lord and uh to come out this uh of the evening and just fellowship and rejoice around the world amen praise the lord you know when we when we have these uh meetings you know uh it's it's it's always for the purpose it's not uh uh we know that it's it's uh easter weekend and it's all about celebrating the resurrection you know but it is not to be after that uh their tradition you know the tradition of just going through the normal routine of talking about the the steps to the cross and talking about cavalry the price that he paid i think it's something that we deal with every day in our lives praise the lord and we had a uh a thought on our heart to be able to that god will we use this uh uh these meetings to be able to inspire us in a different way just like i spoke last night you know god uh moving us in the direction of a church that is that is burden to pray you know spending time to pray the church under the inspiration of the almighty then and [Music] but when i taught to to have brother wilson come to be with us what actually was on my mind was was missions i'll share with you a little bit what was on my mind uh the technicians are putting some few things together that brother wilson will share with us before he gets into the message tonight so they will not put the scripture that i want to read up to you but uh just listening is from the word of god i promise you i won't read anything that is not from the word of god amen so you just got to believe me even if it's not up believe that it's from the word of god praise the lord i will read from verse 13 romans chapter 10 from verse 20. the bible says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they year without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent that's just one of my favorite missionary scripture that i love as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good news [Music] but they have not all obeyed the gospel for for as i have said lord who have believed our report so then faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen praise the lord so one of the the burden that i had on my heart for for this weekend services you know that god will just stir something in our heart you know to be a witness praise the lord we all as believers [Music] we are just like uh you know uh uh we played a different role of of of barabas we played a different role of palette having the blood you know barabbas being the one that was guilted and should have died that was that was us by sin by our first birth we were guilty and we should have died and and there is one that took our place and and and we played the role of of of peter being the denier so you see all the all the characteristics go allow different characteristics in that moment of someone betraying him or someone you know being the one that should have died and someone that had the blood on his hands which is pilot and knowing that this man was now walter of death but yet he tried to please the people and and and we come through those different roles in our life praise the lord and i will say that as we have received the lord jesus as our lord and savior uh we don't only have his blood on our hands we have his life on our hands the reason why he saved us and have given us this grace to be here is for us to be a bearer of his life the reason of the holy ghost is for us to carry his life to the world praise the lord so i was thinking about this weekend and thinking about what to do and then as i was praying for the services and we should look a little bit towards missions you know missionary we think about missions and missionary our mind goes to overseas but we can be missionary right in our backyard we can be missionaries in a grocery center we can be missionaries i mean right on the street corner to our friends to our loved ones praise the lord so uh uh tonight brother brad wilson will come you you wanted to do a little bit of bringing us into that mindset of some of the work that he's involving is this is this should be over about uh 20 plus years and uh that he's been out there on the field as a missionary and uh and and and the beautiful thing about it that he's uh a self-supported missionary you know so which means he used his own income and and and the house money the groceries money he have to cut it down you know the the uh you know uh money that he's supposed to buy things for his children he got to reduce it because his mind is is going out there he prints sometimes print his own material to take it out to missions and buy material from voice of god and and different things you know yeah when i had the privilege to be down there to visit him and went down and into his uh mission setting in the basement of his house uh yeah i was i was i was impressed to see the what a burden would do to a man when you have a burden it will change your appetite when you have a burden it will change your appetite a burden change the way you dress because you are not focused in class and brand name you just want to cover your nakedness and get out into the street praise the lord amen a burden will change a lot of things in your life when god put a burden on your heart and the beautiful thing about it there is that a god show through the scripture uh sami or just just a little boy maybe three years old god started giving him a burden from from a dream and and god started calling him you know so uh there is no heart that is too young for god to burden and there is no heart that is too old for god to burden [Music] we just have to make ourselves available praise the lord amen and you know the beautiful thing is only the things that are done for god that's why we'll be remembered on the other [Music] side only the things that are done for god and the things that we do for his people amen now we need the ones in church with us not only the ones you know uh uh uh i mean his people the bible says he's been good to the sons of man you know when david says that in the psalm he means even the ones that are not safe even the ones that are not serving god god is still being good to them praise the lord if god can pull the rain upon the just and unjust he pulled the rain upon the just and unjust why should i hold a bottle of water from from a just or from our unjust praise the lord so we will call brother wilson and then he will come in and be able to are you ready back there okay praise the lord we also have uh his uh his missionary partner and son joseph with us amen he had all his all his boys and girls being part of what he's doing his wife as a as a missionary partner also praise the lord after after the fourth washing last night he was telling me about a foot watching service there in uh i think uh bocanna faso somewhere there in the village where they just use just one bucket for everybody both men and women amen and it gets deathed just like our scene is daddy [Music] i have a little story about uh about data water and and being safe i will tell you another time that tonight praise the lord well i just stand on our feet and we sing a song here and then brother brother wilson would come fill my way with love i think that's why the musicians every day oh [Music] fear every day with [Music] [Music] oh amen god bless you tonight i'll have you sit down for a few minutes i i just got nervous being back there i'm glad i'm here finally what we want to do you know when you come to the house of god many times my burden is we are so close to going home i want to challenge you this might not happen again right you know so when i get the opportunity i want to not take it that is the last day it's the last time so it's a burden on me that if god ever wanted to tell you something if you are going to die tomorrow and god wanted to tell you something what will he tell you so bear with me but our life points to where we are going where your treasure is so if we really believe the message we really are christians nobody has to convince us what we have to do if that has to come in then something hasn't clicked so i pray that tonight the holy ghost will bring something to your attention you've never paid attention to before and then when we leave here we'll never be the same some doubts will go some spooky things will leave sickness will leave evil spirits will disappear our lives will be a little bit stable and a little bit straight because the distractions are too much too many too many and so i want to kind of talk to you about a little bit 15 minutes so it's going to be quickly quick and short on about some mission work but i find that everybody has a different idea of what a mission work is sometimes you want to go to africa sometimes you want to bring people here and it's part of mission work and there's nothing wrong with it but we should really focus on what will bring people to christ because the last one is out there i don't know it could be in this room still but the last one is out there so we got to reach out the out one whether here africa or everywhere so i find that my focus is reaching out to the last one in my prayer every day is lord some way somehow let my effort influence the last one to come in because if he doesn't come in we are not going and somewhere brahms said he might be a black man so sometimes when i'm walking in africa i'm wondering is this this one or it could be here right so we all go with the quotes it's a little bit of our guideline so tonight i think it's we've been talking about when i could come and all that god allowed that to be tonight and i'm glad to have the audience here so what i want to tell you is about a tool that we use for missions and i'm going to spend i said 15 minutes some of you might have seen it some of you might not but what i want to do is to give you a little bit of update of of what i wanted to tell you um okay so they got something on the on this is not it they will get it up there um easter time is a good thing because it reminds us of what really god has in mind i've learned that the beginning it's not as important as the end i i've raised kids and i look at some of them and i know this one is a true one is going to heaven give me a couple of months and i'm not sure and then it comes to myself there are times i wake up and i said today it's all good the next day i'm not sure whether i belong but it's by faith that we can also rest on god so easter is a reminder if you don't get anything tonight your fair has been paid everything that you need for this journey has been paid for you know you go to lunch and somebody has paid for the food what do you do you eat you can't walk yes so you always have to soak in and say lord if you pay for it let me see that can you have the update i just wanted to talk about this they are still trying to load it the update so what happened was that about 20 years ago you know i came in a message way back in africa yeah so about 20 years ago just looking at my kids they want to get on the internet and all that and i said well i'm not buying internet in the house unless you're going to use it for something for the message so that's where the whole thing started and for a while we thought about making a tool because those days the tapes were just on cassette tapes and you got to carry so 20 years ago we started got my basement got internet and then we decided to develop a tool something that will help in the propagation of the gospel and this tool was not made for message believers it's just made for every christian it's on their website and also in an app and my thought was it has to be free because the gospel is free you don't buy something and use it to bring it so if you go to the next page i'm going to go fast here my thought even today is that we've been put in trust with this message and if it's just a matter of listening to another tape and another tip or another tip we are not doing much with it and then if we believe it that is the truth then we have to put everything in it so i put my everything in it i have not regretted it i have put everything everything you have to believe me everything in it so every time i thought this lord let me do something to further this gospel every day and i see it every day that it's god's blessing that courage me i'm nobody and you might not find me on youtube or facebook or anything because i work under the radar because some places i go are very dangerous i don't even like many of the things with my photos anywhere so you have to get close to know the little things that we are doing and god blesses it can we go we're going to go fast now now so our focus has been to provide the free access and we also one thing i'll show you quickly is how we cross-reference the message with the bible because many times you are talking to an unbeliever you want to quote the message they don't even know christ how are you going to call the message so it's nice to take the same scripture and explain it the way abraham explained it so when you take the message it links you to a scripture and vice versa and then we spend a lot of money and time spending sending bibles and message books and then we do message missionary trips as the lord provides for the 20 years it's just god's grace that we've made it to many many countries and i usually go to where there are no message churches because i don't go for an offering i don't go for somebody to park my back but i go to lay ground work if somebody will build on it it's the same thing if not god will honor it so this is the website if you haven't been there probably one of these days you can go there we can go to the website just to show one little thing my son back there he was so i did this with my kids so his 20th anniversary uh the first i want to show is the message so if you go to so if you go to the website this is and then let's say put rapture in the rapture in there so all the message books are there you can click on booklet so voice of god has stopped printing i i can tell you i've bought probably about the last batch of all the print it's in my basement and i give it out so i just thought if i need books and it's not being printed where am i going to get it so it's on the website if you go there you can it's in pdf you can print it i don't own copyright i just said you know we are just distributing this the nice thing is that you could see that we've also linked the bible verses to it so when you take it you say where did bubram get this from you can be linked with that so that's so important because many times oh i want some message books you got a tablet you got the what they call it in voice of god the table is very good but there are times i don't want to start telling you stories but over there people sometimes don't have toilet paper and they go to a toilet room and there's a sheet of paper so people read the books in different places and it's nice to have the book so that's what i want to show you but you can go there and explore to yourself let's go to the next one that i um just explore it at the website okay where are we now uh we can skip this one and go to the okay so this website 20th anniversary if you go there we have laid all the things we started doing from that time if you go all the way down my 15 minutes is almost up if you point to 21 it shows you the list of the things so the message is with index can you imagine take a paragraph and look for it in the bible if you ask me that's the job i do every day every day i allocate one two hours i say lord where did problem get this it's the same holy ghost the same holy ghost that gave him is able to also give it and i've indexed some people have helped all the way i'm left with five or six years almost every paragraph it's not everything that i find all the time but sometimes it takes a while so i wanted you to know if you go there you could see all the things that have been done um now let's go back to the charts i think there was something else quickly my 15 minutes is up let's go back to the powerpoint i'm conscious of the time so where were we now uh okay so keep go to the next one so this is my basement i have a lot of books a lot of tapes and we pack and mail them so we mail with the bibles so if you ever get tired or don't know what to do just come over we park some books we pray over them and last last year a family from arkansas drove all the way from arkansas we spent two days to park books the day and then the next day they stayed keep going so these are the boxes ready to go sometime i pack the boxes and it takes me a while because it used to be about 30 dollars to mail it anywhere especially overseas but now it takes over 250 between 250 and 300. for me the hardest part is it gets there they don't claim it and it gets returned then i got to pay it again but god knows what he's doing so you could probably identify people this is book parking i'm sure you know do you know anybody in the photo you don't know anyone bred your smith somebody says bro john smith yeah he's part of it so these are the places that we spent we sent books even in u.s and mainly to new churches that are starting yeah keep going quickly so this is my basement if you come there we have computers we built ourselves with my uh kids studied computer science and hardware and i was always thinking where am i going to apply so we build all these computers ourselves we can go further and build the basement ourselves we learned how to do the wall the drywall and all that i'm almost done so these are the computers i won't have time to go over that so let's go back yeah go for it so now if you have the app store you can go to the app store lwb mobile uh where are we not no just okay so keep keep it there i want to say something okay okay now the mouse technology no we are not there yet but okay just just this one i want to say something on it before thank you okay so we have about seven languages that this app is in so if you are in holland or germany you download it it will all be in german and you can find in your app store or even on your windows computer so this is different from the website because now everybody has it on their phone and it will be also in the browser so if you have that app you have to explore it can we show the app just for a minute and then we are almost done so this is the app if you see the left top left there's the bible yeah that brings the menu so you see the bible yeah click on the bible now down here you could see select wnb and strong select you can copy it and put in your sermon if you go to wmb so if you watch it all the paragraphs that are linked uh it shows the quotes down there so every not every bible verse is linked most of them then you go to strong's also it gives you the concordance with it right there so you can put it under any of the words and it shows you the concordance right there so right in your hand you don't have an excuse this is the tree of life you know but there are a lot of things on your phone that you could do but if you are sitting at the train station or tired or something here is the message for you and if you go back to the the menu again the top there is always the menu there are so many things that you could do from it so many things there's videos there's different things i'll leave it so that you can explore let's quickly go because my time is up two more minutes go back to the presentation it will have been harder for you to grow up in a wilson household because they learn quickly that they have to be part of everything i do so let's keep going so you can download almost everything on the website keep going keep going uh yeah just keep going this is all the app we've done the quick demo keep going and let's start keep going i'll just show you keep going keep going keep going keep going okay so here you look at it and say so all this website and the app is it even useful if you look at the first line almost half a billion people have been to this website it's very very very popular there are many times i get emails for churches voice of god and all that and i said this is not voice of god it's painful but this is different and the computers run in my basement some in the crowd you wouldn't know my light bill or how much tea ones i bring in my basement so we can play and then also we have listeners so many people come and listen to the messages and we track them but all that we are doing here is that if there is a world there is a purpose in your heart god somehow provides for it yes and we've done this for 20 years i'm not here to appeal for money i've returned so many money back to the pastors where their congregation but i wanted you to know that you could do something for this message just pulling message from the table and listening to it is not enough if it does something in your life you see that like the woman at the well she run for god that woman shouldn't preach when it hits you you forget who you are and the bible says that's right the bible says he preached in samaria come see a man it's a testimony of my life and here bebraham says she laid for the foundation for philip to go there a couple of years later and have a revival so the little testimony we give to our neighbor who knows what god will build on it so this is our 20 years of operation and you could see almost every country almost in the world somehow we've touched it so if you haven't downloaded it it's a resource for you to use to witness there's so many things that you can find that oh where is this message where can i find it it's in there we have a search program we have everything there so when he wanted me to come i could tell you stories about going to gambia going to some of the places they are ticklish they enjoy oh this brother but you got to get to a point where you are not telling a story but it's a life that you are living and when you live that life it speaks louder than what you can say so we're going to sing alas at the cross and switch change the order of the service if we can start the course and then we will stand up and sing the last verse together the last verse i think they're going to put it on the screen at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the bed of my heart rolled away it was there by faith i received my sight and i am happy all day [Music] let's stand up and sing the last verse we are going to sing the last words the last verse [Applause] [Music] myself [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh lord jesus we are coming in your presence the oranges come around us the holy ghost i received [Music] can we do the last verse again and really mean it that lord all i can do is to give myself away how many are willing to do that he gave his life for you without the music the loudness [Music] but drops of grief and now repay that [Applause] [Music] i give myself [Music] musicians you can join ah that cross [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am happy all the day lord jesus we are presenting ourselves tonight [Music] in appreciation for your death that we are celebrating because we only see you at the cross no you are not at a cross you've come back down as a spirit holy spirit in our hearts tonight may the holy spirit usher us back to the tree of life and may we receive from you take over my thoughts my words my everything oh god i yield myself today that's all i can do and everyone here that's all we can do may we live here better than we came in may we leave our burdens here may you open our eyes a little bit more may the holy ghost come and minister to us individually we thank you that you've done it already just help us to have faith to receive from you in your name we pray amen amen amen amen amen god bless you i'm going to watch the time so bear with me let's go straight to the word and if you have your bibles we i got some slides that we're going to use also because i want you to leave here with something and i'm somebody that tries to be very sensitive to the spirit of god so it's hard to for me to even walk with myself i changed my mind many times yesterday i was sitting down and i thought i had what i'm going to talk about and then i came down and the pastor was saying something in the office and he confirmed some things and took some things out so we'll go to hebrews chapter nine it will it will come on the screen hebrews chapter nine and yesterday he's been you have a very solid pastor i respect him a lot and yesterday he was dealing with hebrews chapter 9 and 10. and i was cringing that he might take everything then i have to go to the drawing board but thank god the holy ghost reserves something for me you know you walk into somewhere and they don't know what you are thinking you don't know what they are thinking and they are preaching your notes and same quote so if it sounds repetitive forgive me um he didn't coach me i didn't coach him how many believe it's one holy ghost it's not two it's just who he will use and that's what we have to rely on so if you have your bibles in hebrews chapter 9. it's good i see that you all have bibles and it's good let me read just a couple of verses and we take a thought and for this course he that is christ is the mediator of the new testament and how is he a mediator by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance verse 16 for where a testament is there must also be also of necessity be the death of a testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood verse 19 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people verse 20 says this is saying this is the blood of the testament which god has enjoined unto you and that word and joint it's a very precious word because it's like somebody does something and he did it for you yes you didn't even ask for it and said you've been enjoying to it it's like i've added you to something without asking your permission i decided to do that so we want to take a little thought and i'll let you sit down the next page they are getting the the death of the testator please sit down and the raising of the testator um the death as paul said where a testament is they must of necessity be the death of a testator i'm sure everybody in this room probably have lost a relative before how many have yes yes yes and the relative might not be rich if you are you have a rich relative sometimes it's enjoyable to know that they left something for you don't you agree nah you get nervous checking whether your name is in the in the world and if your name is not in the world somebody is going to be in trouble either the wife or somebody so paul being a lawyer is there anyone a lawyer here oh my goodness some of you young ones be a lawyer god chose a lawyer chose doctors because when we came in the message at first education everybody 18 we are going to heaven and this is what more than 60 years and we are still here continue planting your potatoes if you god has given you a gift to study study hard because god can use the same education to do something even at the university wherever you are god can do it yes i'm a i'm a i'm a witness of it raised all my kids and a lot of brothers were against it but never did i think i will live this long god is here because the last one hasn't come in so please use it so i might be talking about a little bit of law so one of you if you ever become a lawyer at least you can come back and straighten me out so we spend a little time to understand the law of the land see because these all these laws are derived from the bible and so if you read paul's writings he goes into the law and proved by law god's word and so tonight we are going to do a little bit of it a little bit of preaching a little bit of studying but as paul said in hebrews 9 where a testament is there must also be the necessity of the death of the testator so if i make a world today and i'm not dead you don't have anything you better pray that i die quickly so you can inherit the car or the house don't think it doesn't happen let's be honest right when is he going to die so i can get the house or the car you might not say it outright but in your heart i'm suffering dad he's got this nice hefty insurance it's going to come to you but you better be sure your name is in the world because that one is me that decides nobody has to see it so if we go to the next page i want to spend time to try to explain the technology and then uh probably another 30 15 minutes to bring it down so the first word i use there is tester the original owner a person who creates a world the world is actually not for you but for him that when he dies all that he has who should have what praise the lord hallelujah so you can do look at the law of the land some rich person and most times you have to be a relative sometimes they give it to their dog or some charity so tester is the original owner and as i go i'll be bringing our minds to what it is the original owner of this earth that is god amen that's right and god could not die so he had to bring all the promises all the world everything that he wants to do in the person of jesus christ and everything that he promised you is in jesus christ so that's why many people still miss easter now if i die and i'm on the cross it doesn't mean much and christ is on the cross anyway but his death released his will so i have an inheritance he was preaching to me about inheritance and i thought god let him keep quiet so i can talk about it so do you know you have an inheritance yes you believe it okay are you sure and you've been praying for the tester to die have you not he's dead that's why we have easter are you sure he's dead if i ask you to show me your inheritance would you show me either he didn't die or your name was not in the book let's go to the next one so testament or the world it's a disposition or arrangement the primary purpose of a world is to clearly state the intent for the largest position which one makes of his early possessions and for the court to make your will legally binding so if the testiture dies there is a statement that is filed with the court and that statement has names in it and it cannot be opened until the person has died when a person dies everybody cries for joy or for fear or whatever and after he's been buried then let's go down and look at what he decided you had no decision because the one that is making the world decide who gets what right because he might know that if i get a dog his dog i might eat a dog so he might not give it to me or a cat he might give you a dog because he knows you're going to take care of the dog and give feed the dog he might give you the car he might give you anything that he decides it's not your decision and so you can't get up and say i like this one he's dead and gone anyway he made it and thank god we have it etc that before the foundation of the world was laid he gave us gifts without repentance before you repented came to say oh jesus i give my self away that's all i can do he thought about you he knew what you would need in this life and he put your name there now if your name is not there that's another story we'll touch it a little bit then the next technology is an executor i type it to the prophet of the age and the five-fold ministers executor is the one that will knock on the door one afternoon you are all dejected when are we going to open the world probably is gone couple of years or something knocks on the door and says i have news for you. what your name is in the world right because what is all the preaching doing what is all the message doing to bring you that before the foundation of the world was late god thought about you and put your name in the world you had nothing to do with it yes and so i find that it's hard to tell people that there is a prophet and there is a message maybe the prophet is that that message is not knocking at the door of their heart but if god speaks to you there's nothing for this age other than this message because you look at it and said he's speaking to me i am part of what he's talking about and you might say oh where's my name robert but you see if you take abraham when hebrews 11 was written he staggered not at the word of god now you go back all through the bible we know abraham had ishmael and all that and he told a lie and went back and forth but they tested testator knew abraham before he even made a mistake he knew david before david made a mistake that's right yes and that's what he's looking at that's right amen that's why the prophet could say he took a photo of you on your best estate you come to my house the nicest photos of my cat is on the wall they might have grown taller or got some pink pimples or whatever but that's on my wall that's how i want to remember them and he took a photo of you i'm talking about the tester and put it on his hall of fame wall of fame so when you get up and oh god today is a hard day he looks at the photo what is he talking about glory to god some evil spirit has gotten on him so sometimes we got to shake all those out yes the tester thought about you and put your name on it so you have a five-fold minister in your church let's have prayer let's do this until something speaks to you that actually is you that he's talking to and so we all become executed in the sense that we are bringing you the good message what is the good good message the message is that your name was in the world before the foundation of the world was laid it's not everybody's name that is in there let's be honest so the time of are you going to read your bible are you going to go to church it's over if you get it that your name is in there you realize that it does something to you the woman of the world nobody has to tell her but somehow when that man told her that she's had five husband you might take it as a condemnation oh five husbands so i'm going to go but she took it that if this man knew before the foundation of the world was late that she will have five husbands don't think god doesn't didn't know that right and he sent somebody to now tell her and what was i respond we expect a prophet to do the same thing i am he oh oh i'm in the presence of the testes [Music] god has to come down to reveal it to you and when you see it you said now probably if i was there i said women should not preach don't preach and the prophet used that story thousands of times she went to the city forgot about the water and preached yes so what i'm trying to bring to you is that somehow something has to get to you when it gets to you all the struggle all the things is over because you have passed you have passed from death onto life glory to god let's go through this because i haven't started the sermon and how many minutes have we got beneficiary sons and daughters of god an individual entity designated as recipient of the money or property under the world or trust i've never seen anybody that well it happens when the world was read he said oh i don't like the dog or i don't like the car sometimes people will say they don't want it but most times people will take it right people will take it inheritance it can refer to the assets that an individual be quick to their loved ones after they pass away this inheritance a testator might want to contact an attorney if he wants to leave someone out of his world that would otherwise inherit his property by law such as a spouse or a child that's a tough one because i put your name in my will you do something so bad i take your name out of my will that works but you know one thing god does not change his mind are you sure not even his mind about anything about you because he knew you before the foundation of the world was laid he even knew your mistakes right now if you want to call the prophet he said he even ordained your mistakes i have no idea what a god oh i had an accident it was such a bad accident you know i just god allowed it god ordained it it's part of your story challenges the hardest part with inheritance is that there is always somebody who is not satisfied either their name was left out or they didn't get what they expected to get right why didn't you make me a minister why can't i be like this one you know i know i was telling about my cousin who is a catholic priest and some others that i know they are always praying for the same revelation and the same gift that the prophet had in other words we get to a point where we want to be a copycat but the tested knows who you are not just news because he made you he made you what you are so you better accept who you are if he made you a woman stay a woman don't be confused about an x or y or what right so here you are a tester gives you an inheritance and because he knows you're a man he gave you manly things and then he said no i'm no more so and it's all that's why we are confused this is easter the death of the tested and we are walking here still trying to figure out whether it's on the cross or my cross is heavier than yours and i can have a a nice uh uh what do you call it youtube video of me carrying a cross you've missed it right that's right completely it's nice to watch them then people would actually in philippines they sacrifice people yeah put nails on them and and put names my the world is gone they can't wait for god to get out of here the promises of god are in him so every promise that god made all the seven compound names of god is fulfilled in jesus christ that's right the prophet said jesus christ was the tree of life in the garden of eden so if you want to really go to the tree of life this is it there's nothing else now so if god put all the promises on him and god wanted the promises to be fulfilled therefore he took him to calgary calvary and he died i'm not going to go to the second part of the horizon yet then it means all the promises that god ever all the thought god ever had it's now released in his fullness that's what paul says if the testator doesn't die there's nothing in effect when he dies the the law the court says this is your car i might not don't know how much it costs i don't know how to drive but this is yours this is yours the proof of his death is what you have inherited if you can't prove that you have inherited anything then either christ didn't die or you can convince me that your name is not there i'm convinced your name is there so if you don't believe it just say brother robert thank you for being sure that my name is in the world because my desire always to go where god's people are that's a thing i pray every time so i don't know how many i don't know who but i know somebody we go to meet over there so when you have that witness when you stand there you know there are people that can you imagine god shedding the blood of a human even animals that are short that are killed mercilessly god doesn't like it but to take a human life just for you it means god means serious business yes praise the lord days of just quoting or doing this and things are over let this easter mean to us that we have an inheritance you do so he was a man when he cried there at calvary where are we the next page right when he cried my god my god why has that forsaken me he died as a man but on easter morning he rose breaking the seals of death corruption rising to ascend to the father above showing that he was more than a man he was god in flesh some of these things you read and read and read and he said what is he talking about if jesus was only man you don't have an inheritance so a man will die and probably will wait for the resurrection but this man died and said in three days i'll rise up right so god did not put his promises in a man he put his promises in himself represented himself as a man so he can go back and release them to you that's itself mind-boggling he was a man because he walked on earth but when he died he rose again no man can just say i'm dying and i'll rise up he did it and he did it for one purpose only one purpose so that you can inherit an inheritance oh i have to take time a little bit your inheritance probably the best way to explain it when israel got to the promised land god said i'm going to give you inheritance. he didn't even let joshua have a revelation of who will go where he said cast lot see god uses simple things to do his work so they cast lot benjamin this is your land judah this is your land this one this is your land because they came from egypt they didn't know god said i'm going to give you a land when they got there cast a lot and gave everybody inheritance now after they got the inheritance benjamin was a small tribe judah they were fighters and all the troil tribes everybody had their land think about it that judah could have just decided benjamin we're getting rid of you we'll take over your land no but you could see if you study the bible god protects the inheritance that he has assigned to you you can't even protect it god protects you yes so even though moses let's make a law moses do it when you marry your inheritance is from your your your husband so i believe joshua or one of them their father died they didn't have a male so they came to moses what about us because our father died and we didn't have any man so what about our inheritance he said yeah i give them some of the inheritance but the moment they are they marry the inheritance go back to them to the original tribe yes in other words god all these years have been protecting that piece of land in israel it might be all mixed up but god ceased to protect in it yes and i want to tell you this morning if you heard something even from your father or something oh i just want to sell it and go away and all that you might do all that but you see god protects it so anything god has given you he protects it he protects his gifts can you imagine the prophet going to try to take a drink and he couldn't do it god had to protect it that's right glory to god hey if he doesn't protect you how are you going to make it that's why it says in a in a simple way the steps of the righteous are ordered so god is in the protection business if he gives you an inheritance he knows robert will go and squander it so he'll protect it not like the prodigal son that father when are you going to die you are getting too old give me what you think belongs to me he took it he went and squandered it one day he woke up so he didn't have inheritance he came back why he said now make me one of the sevens the father was very joyful but if you read the the bible very well the father gave him a ring not his ring so all these things it takes the prophet to bring it out he's come home he's quander the inheritance but god don't think that god didn't know the prodigal son would go away yeah right god that allowed him to go he's able to bring the inheritance right back to him so you haven't lost anything god is not an indian giver that he gives it to you tomorrow robert you told a big lie today i take it back no it was part of it so let's go quickly so now to abraham and he sees where the promise is made he said not to cease as of many but of one and so the seed of abraham is not the physical but by faith i'm bringing a lot of things then i'll bring it close together so god and abraham's relationship extend to us not because we must be jews because people still think if i convert to be a jew then that is going to help me actually abraham was god's friend abraham not so much as he was so righteous but he believed god our faith is what brings that relationship to christ our faith is what establishes us as a kinsmen of christ so if you believe christ died for you how many believe that that faith is what establishes you that you have an inheritance glory to god the moment you lose that oh he died for somebody but not me that's fine but if you have an inheritance if something occurs to you you say he died not for everybody but for me it's a personal thing yes it's a personal thing and so hebrews 11 13 says these all died in faith having received their promises but i haven't seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and piglets on earth and they saw having obtained a good rapport through faith received not the promise so all those people who died from moses rahab all of them and we have people are coming to take over jericho and she believed i can't believe it and everything that she's done in her life it didn't matter to god he just believed that these people we better do something and by faith the scarlet thread is all that she had and can you imagine the army coming to fight jericho there is no sign i'm not going to make a phone call if you see her you say send me a text that you are there and show me a way he said no just hang that scarlet thread i don't know how thick but if it was me probably the thread would be so red that everybody will see something is happening because i don't want them to miss it she hung that scarlet thread all the way down yeah and the army coming going to overtake jericho and she and her family in the living room hanging on what if somebody pulled it out what if they didn't see it but she believed it and god confirmed her faith by signing them to deliver her in her house she was not a preacher she was a harlot it didn't matter to god your faith is what is going to get you there and when you get shaken just remember rehab and say my goodness i need some scarlet right to tie you know around my my waist or something to know that the blood of jesus has been shed for me i'm going to have to hurry jesus walked and this is the time jesus walked with his 12 disciples they saw everything about him as a man and they saw everything about him as god so there are times they were not sure whether he was god or he was man one day he was asleep on the pillow and everybody was the boat was ready to capsize don't you care that we perish he got up and said peace mister hey this man he's more than god he's more than god they get to some place on the mountain all of a sudden moses that was there was talking to him the disciples says oh this is wonderful we are not going down let's break greater banana cross three churches one for moses one for you one when we stay here because they saw god in him yes but seeing god in your pastor in a prophet or somebody isn't the answer but it is you seeing that you are part of that god seeing yourself that you are part of this message it's what makes a difference it's not just a quote it's just all the tips you are listening to glory to god so these disciples at the end that jesus had died like probably saturday morning or listen like today after he's died they've seen all the powerful messages and then peter said i'm just going to go back to my fishing because something has happened maybe i don't understand so if you read luke chapter 24 peter says i'm going fishing some of them joined them others said well we are sad but let's just get out of here so they were going to him house and when they were going they started looking so tired and so gloomy we all have gloomy days sure but the bible says jesus drew near and so when you see that you are part of god your lowest moment actually is when god comes near you the problem is we are looking on our gloominess that we don't even see that god is right there right so he came and walked with them if you read the bible abraham explains about three days jenny he preached them watch them talking to them explaining things to them he didn't go somewhere but i want you to know he took from the source of the tree of life this is this word of god many times people will come and use the stories like this and that and that you've got to go back to the source explain it all to them he even tied them all fools they go down he made like he was going they still didn't get it and he said they said oh why stay and eat with us they persuaded him he stayed at with them the way he was eating i don't know how he was eating but something struck them this is him something has to track you he doesn't have to be in church but somehow god has to come near and strike your heart if he doesn't do it you'll miss it every day but something struck them and these people just turned around and said no it's him i don't know how god did it and he disappeared the bible says now they were going somewhere the three days jenny they did it in one day i don't know how much energy they had probably they were running are you tired oh i'm going one day they ran back to jerusalem the disciples had got it they didn't have any story he is risen he's risen are you sure he's risen and then jesus himself came and stood amongst them whatever god did he better do it and tonight for us because it changes your atmosphere changes your mind it changes the way you walk because all things are now possible to you it doesn't take three days journey praying doesn't get hard anymore reading your bible doesn't say i better hurry i have to get to work anymore something in you makes you put that above everything it quickens the life in you amen he had to because when you really look at that you realize that all of us can walk with god take the message quote listen to abraham but until god takes something and open our eyes to it yeah it's all exercise right it's like going to the gym exercising and eating and eating why am i not losing weight something hasn't happened the problem we have often is that we don't even realize as the bible says bone of his bone flesh of his flesh you are so much a part of god that god cannot do without you no you think you are the one that can do without god no god can do without you if god even shows you that robert god can do without you it changes everything because you were part of god from the beginning he put your name in his will it means you're a relative born of his moon flesh of his flesh we always think is we that need god god also needs us that's why the prophet always says no man ever saw god he's god always that is sick in you that's why he sent you a pastor that's why he sent the executor at your door to tell you that your name is in the world and can you imagine god putting your name in the wall and you walk away he will make sure that you know your name is in there and you can inherit what he has put there for you so don't blame brother one if he's stressing you out just pray that lord let me get what he's trying to tell me so we are fresh off his flesh bone of his bone when god was wounded when god wounded christ at calvary he was wounded for me and you we are fresh off his flesh bone of his own body of his body name of his name bride of of him see we are in him we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones so god has potentially already raised us the quaking power that raised up jesus from the dead it's already enough in god's mind we already raised up in god's mind the rapture has already taken place in god's mind a lot of things has happened we are just waiting for the manifestation so it's nice to feel that christ died and released the inheritance it's just that when somebody gives you the inheritance and he leaves you alone with it you could still make mistakes here and there but god is obligated to make sure that you when you hurry the inheritance you use it the way he has ordained it the gifts are not for you to make you somebody but his gifts are there god plays it in you so he can use it to bless his children you can try to make money out of it you can do whatever you want out of it but that's not it i'm trying to bring this to a close now i want to bring your mind to it so one day i said well the only way i know my name is in it is bring everybody let's sit at a courtroom or somewhere and then we're going to open the world the first thing you want to know is that likely everybody that is assembled his name is in the world did you hear that the fact that you've been invited by the executor that come to the court today we are going to read the word almost 100 your name is in the world yes sure and i can say tonight being here means god has something for you yes sir and you didn't come here by yourself he drew you here in fact he knew where you were going to sit do you believe it yes otherwise he's not god oh he knew even what you're going to wear right you believe that yes sir when you were looking in your wardrobe i like this one no i don't want this one no this one is too tight no this one is that you know who was doing that it's god the holy ghost he's that close to you and then you come here and say ah don't i look handsome or beautiful god planted all before the foundation of the world he put it all in his will and you go back how you got that clothes probably you bought it on a trip somewhere and you've kept it when am i going to throw it away and on and on and on and today you wore it he did it all before the foundation of the world was left so when the tested has died the world has to be opened that's why in this age it took all the ages for this end time and when the world is written is sealed that's why god took the sieves and opened it because none of the ages that people actually can see their name in it so this is the age that that's why the bible says they without us are not made perfect they did everything just by faith now we are doing it because we are beyond faith in other words we've seen more than faith [Music] and no man could open the world no man in heaven or in it so he opened the seats and there was somebody standing on earth and gave him the seals i know when you read the seals you see a white horse greyhound black horse going and assault that's a noise right absolutely go take your time and read the fourth seal he talks about it he said elijah after the fire came from heaven elijah he's a powerful man he can call fire from heaven killed 400 prophets very powerful very strong yes and then the next morning jesus said where is elijah i'm going to kill him you know what elijah did he ran away hiding in a cave right yes that was elijah the prophet said elijah was praying and even saying i'm the only one he said when god opened the seals to him and he saw his name there elijah was a different person now when jezebel sent 50 army men go and arrest elijah i was thinking elijah would run away but elijah said if i be a prophet of god let fire come from heaven did it happen yes second time elijah got to a place where he was not at even when fire came from heaven but when god showed him that his name was there he was different and that's why this age we need to come to see that that's the only one only way we can withstand the end time struggle and the devil and the things that come our way because tomorrow there is this problem today there is this one you get up and you can't even do it but when you see your name it just transforms you now you can your prayer is even different if i be a son of god a daughter of god let this happen now it changes your prayer moses the runaway prophet every little thing moses will go and cry for god the prophet said when one day god showed moses his name in the book right moses prayer has been changed he wasn't afraid anymore so even in front of god when god said i'm going to destroy everybody moses said huh do it but take my name out of the book first how many have seen the scripture if i was god i'm so angry i'll take your name of it even god can't take your name out of his book i'm talking about alarm's book of life he can't even take your name from it he put moses name moses you know speak he hit the rock yeah he just have to pack moses back home because moses with all the blessings you still made in other words bible says moses had one app on god can you imagine walking here and knowing that your name is in the world your name is an alarm's book of life you don't know what it will do to you because it gives you some confidence yes that you've made it because he who that put your name there is able to protect you and bring you to the end game so moses now knows what is going on so there are many examples in the bible oh you know paul the bible says he was caught in the third heavens we don't know what happened to paul he saw all that but after he had seen god now a prophet agabus acts 16 came on the scene and said paul don't go to jerusalem you're going to die how many of you like me if a prophecy came tonight and say robert don't go back to chicago right the plane is going to crash everybody crying i probably will say no i'm not going i'll wait right but paul what is this are you telling me agabus you are a great prophet that i can't go to jerusalem because god has shown you i'm not doubting what god told you but god is telling you that it's part of my inheritance to go and suffer in jerusalem and they say paul you are too stubborn when you see your name a prophecy doesn't stop you nothing it's a supernatural work that you are working with god now paul went to jerusalem and many people say oh paul's ministry he disobeyed agabus great prophet but we know in this age if paul didn't go we couldn't even read hebrews when he was there god has a way with his pen and paul was writing all these yes that's right writing all this so i can go through so many even peter all of them in other words as you walk with god god has to bring you to some point and when that happens nobody can take it from you so this message is not death to read with abraham to read a quote is there to bring us to that point where we can see our name and if tonight you can see your name you you'll see what i mean nobody can the devil can't put you anywhere he bought trash ball john the revelator put him in oil tried everything they said finally we are banishing you you're a witch so he can write the book of revelation sure we have power over the devil not today but before the foundation of the world was laid and this end time because of the death that has been revealed to us and the sins have been opened it's released all the power of god on his bride no more you know i was telling somebody that you know those were the days if i was walking if elijah elijah god is going to take you away what do you want me to do for you what would you ask like oh you tell elijah but he said give me a double portion that was good the double portion is not for this age this age we are going yeah and here there is a child that will take you you could have afraid that lord i want to be part of that child i'm going with elijah you can have a double portion and do all the miracles mostly saw the miracles but the rare gift in this age is to see the day approaching and do something about it so i was thinking lord if i was standing there maybe now that i see things elijah says what would you want god to do for you i said so i'll go with you what because i just said whatever you ask i can do it yes so though the child had only one seat god will make a provision for another seat this ant is gone what do you want here you want more money i can pray for god to give you a million dollars what are you going to do it's time to get out of here change it let's pray more for god to give us strength to walk in this journey that says oh god and i need to be a bigger house and i need a better car and i need they are all important but they all go tomorrow you need a better car the next year you're going to need a better house every sickness god heals you you're going to be sick again i've given you enough examples do you want more oh there's so many now you read the bible and say my so every age and what is there god used brother brahm to do all the miracles they didn't even save the earth did they help anybody but it's for us to know that now that god has released it everything that god did in abraham being the first fruit is here in the bride you go to places people are waiting to see the pillar of fire and sometimes you go and people will show you a picture the pillar of fire is around let me tell you the people of crowd was there with moses right day and night never disappeared yet israel they were doing whatever they want to do right but here the prophet said the pillar of fire that you see him standing here it's now in you it's not the hollow on your head it's the spirit of god that has been released that has come to dwell in you it is the same fire we are in another age you can call it whatever you want but we are at a point where the bride sees the bridegroom sees themselves i'm bringing this to a close i need to talk about this so we can build up for tomorrow so after god has released the seas have been opened you've seen your name when abraham said it ushers in a stronger walk a closer walk with god that's why the bible could say a bride without spot or wrinkle can you imagine no sport or wrinkle how is god going to do that there has to be extra energy extra protection extra power of god the power of god has never been released on earth until this time the holy ghost has not been released in abundance until this time right and so when we are there we feeble trying to see who believes what and who does what it's just a devil coming among us to make us miss what it is there the most important thing is say lord i don't know whether my name is in there show me show me show me and when that happens he's going to have a holiday not so much as a holiday but you could see that the extra force that is driving you is no more from the pulpit it's a personal life in a personal way [Applause] and i stand here to tell you that i just look at god and i say god who am i to deserve that and in all this i like to go clap my hand uh play youtube and go away my goodness god bring me to that sauce so that every day that seed will sprout make my family make my workers make everywhere i go for them to see christ in me the death of jesus christ is to release christ in you is to make christ visible in you please take him off the cross yes he's still on the cross or in christmas time we put him in a manger he still never grew up and you say oh i mean the message and i'll quote robert abraham and somebody today was telling me sunrise was the most important event on earth wonderful but i see reason in your heart because we celebrate the sunrise morning okay he rose up what does it mean the world has missed it and even in the message we've missed it what i'm bringing you tonight is that he gave us the airness of our inheritance ephesians 1 13 can we read that in closing i've gone over my time what is it 9 30 my goodness we are about to close but that you leave something here and you it will crank and and you walk away and say yes yes god has done something for me ephesians 1 i'm sure you read it so paul's got something that all the disciples somehow you say so didn't peter know this didn't this one know this they all knew it but god gave him a revelation a deeper one so i'll start from verse chapter 1 verse 13. it says in whom he also trusted after he after that he had that word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise and verse 14 says which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase procession unto the praise of his glory so not only that he gave us the promise but he sent the holy ghost to enforce the promise because god protects his promise can you imagine mary an angel appearing to hear that mary you're going to have a baby now who can protect mary the devil will be sure that baby either miscarriaged or if he was born killed but god had to protect the baby even through a dream he let mary and joseph leave there to egypt and come back again and it was all in the scriptures under the devil's nose and he didn't see it praise the lord i will tell the devil go read the scriptures because it was right there that out of egypt called his son and the devil could have looked at it and said let's not kill those in bethlehem or judea let's kill everybody even in egypt right the devil is not wise he's lost because he does many things that it's like god letting the devil raise moses letting pharaoh raise moses that will come and overthrow him just bring some story i was he went someplace and i went with some brothers and we stayed with a person who was a character priest and fed us and everything and then we go to church and condemn the catholic church you know in other words god has protected it so much that the devil even can't see that you hide because he points to you your failures he points to you all the things that are wrong and then you also are doubting and the devil said it can be that's why he came to jesus and said if thou be the son of god come down from the cross he could have done it sure but if he did it this easter will be meaningless thank god he stayed there because he knew who he was and he knew that going to the cross was part of the game so he gave us the promise and gave us the inheritance the holy ghost to enforce the inheritance i want to tell you if you don't know you have the holy ghost maybe you don't have it if you don't have the holy ghost you have no enforcer in your life to bring the inheritance set it in your heart and say lord give me the holy ghost this weekend give me the holy ghost before i leave here and if you think you have the holy ghost iran said a statement here that i'm persuaded that many of us have received the holy ghost see the holy ghost comes in different levels and it takes us to a place where we don't want to tell lies you feel bad when you do something wrong but god wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to feel every bit of you just to make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in god till his word is just living right through you amen if tonight we can open our hearts and say lord oh bring the enforcer of the inheritance that from today know that i'll have victory but i'll have you know like the octane power yes to take me out of here that's right i don't know whether it's a four-engine plane or what octane you know but elijah saw this the child coming there is a path enoch knew that that day he was not coming back he couldn't tell anyone no wonder the prophet said one day in nine o'clock in the morning we will know right but what is happening is that there's a path that we have to walk to that land and that's why we must walk on it every day because that's our inheritance it doesn't take persuasion to walk on that path it's god's hand that is leading us on that path the holy ghost is our light and tonight how many are really hungering for the holy ghost if you even have the holy ghost say lord fill me a little bit more in the book of hearts the disciples got together with one accord and the bible says he came and filled them and you haven't received it there's no little child or big man john the baptist received the holy ghost in the in the belly of the mother but could he feel us afraid this morning tonight that our walk even will change that something will change in our lives because we are living the world is gone you don't have anything in a bank or food or gas or something to look for there's a better world there's a better thing coming and if this is the last sermon i'll tell you you need the holy ghost to get out of here we need more of the holy ghost i do too how many will stand up with me and say lord share the holy ghost afresh in my heart yes let's raise our hands to him and pray lord jesus everybody pray the days of somebody praying for you is over lord i heard that the death of christ brought my inheritance tell him i heard that you sent the holy ghost to enforce the inheritance in my life lord i don't know whether i have the holy ghost lord i come in thy presence i've heard it there's a cure have told me that my name is in the book hallelujah lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world was made lord i open my soul to you pray tell him come and fill me fill me
