========================================

that's Becky's first time to play in church here so a very appropriate song when Jesus came so we are grateful to be here again tonight and so thankful for the your fine attendance this morning and now tonight is I got a little subject I want to talk on in a few moments but just before that I've got some announcements to make and things and I just a teeny bit hoarse think it's just the over speaking preached a long time but when I take these our two tapes and want to come back here it's because it I'm taping that for round the world and so thank you for being so patient with us this morning now there's a few things I would like to make mention of right here that is that I would like to ask the church the first thing something that I have have done and I'm I want to ask if I can change that tonight we're not I don't make New Year's vows and I'm we've got to go home tomorrow so we won't be here for New Year's too but we'll be remembering you not believe there'll be a meeting here New Year's night yes that's right a watch service as you always have on New Year's night we like stay but we just can't get back in time and it to get the kiddies in school and my wife's got to wash up their clothes you on so on I want to thank each one of you for your fine things that you did for us through Christmas and you women who went up there and put food in the house and things for us that when we got there there were stuff was already cooked and ready to eat I certainly thank you for that may God ever bless you and the church further a little ticket that I could go over here and and get some clothes if I wanted them for our suit they gave me a suit each year and some kind friends of mine just got me a suit so I think if so alright I need some other things like shirts and undershirts and things I'd like to take the money up and now if it's alright with the church we need that better no worse than I do the suit right at the time now this young fella that just sang for us brother George Smith from down in Tucson we've been going up to their church up there the New Testament Baptist Church his father is a missionary I think he has about seven churches down in Mexico and there's certainly some fine people there and his father and mother and all them are five people in George is very fine young man I was just sorry that he didn't give us a word of testimony but well before he sat down of the saving grace of Christ in his life and now the the messages I promise you're not long ago that the messages before I went out in the meetings I come here and tape them first and then go out that was because of getting the tapes to the people then I come here tape a message and then go out and preach it that give the people a chance to the tape makers to make the tape and take it with us as we win now I'm fixing to leave on a great strain of evangelistic tour so I won't be able to do that from now on see and the one who takes the tapes they'll just have to get them as we go along and I think after all aren't they having a meeting on tapes this week or something about something about the tapes this week anyhow thank brother sophomore this year and he represents brother my bar I don't know whether he's sure not I think for the fridge or somebody said he was here and he I think they're having a meeting this week maybe tomorrow night or some time about the tapes we just talked about the other night in the room there I think the time is up for something they take and make arrangements about it so from now on I'll probably just speak messages that I haven't touched here at the tabernacle out in the meeting and now I have want to be grateful to God for that testimony a brother Blair happens to be the brother sister Blair sitting right here tonight sitting right here before it's the one that had the little boy I remember when the Lord told me when he was brother Blair altura weeping his little boy got pushed in the face like this of a turned-over car and he was very bad but while I was a pre I saw the little fella alright and brother bear of course asked me said brother branham is this thus saith the Lord I said brother bear Blair it's thus saith the Lord and brother Blair is sure tonight and we're certainly thankful to have brother Blair with us and he's been suffering with a little trouble of nervousness and they can give him a great rap you're not long ago to try to get him to disbelieve me and while sait was doing that the Lord came right around reveal it to him and told him about it just to cut it off before that time come for this and brother Blair is a fine man and I want you to remember him he's kind halt between opinions on what to do he doesn't know just how to turn and I trust brother Blair that God your great servant of Christ and he's got plenty for you to do the lights are getting dim where you here this morning well that's very fine now now I suppose the next time I get to see maybe up in the spring a little bit and but that time maybe we'll know whether we're going to hold thee the meetings are not here at a Jeffersonville during your time that I should been in Norway and in the Scandinavian countries now just before we take it takes calls we got a prayer line coming up and many are standing their rooms and around the walls and so forth and I know you it's very hard on him and I stood him any time itself and I passed by a while ago bringing the wife down I notice the people around the doors and I thought who says the gospel still is the most attractive thing there is in the world sure is if it attracts those who are interested in it those who are not interested of course they don't they it won't be but Jesus if I said if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me how true that is and when I get here there's just so much to say and I have to kind of jot down what I'm going to say here for a while or ah there's so much to say you just forget what you're going to say now I understand that brother Omron's father was baptized this morning in the name of Jesus Christ and if sister Omron and them are here I'm sure that's a great thing to them because that's been their constant prayer for many years and brother hunger and wherever you are God richly bless you my brother and if that isn't correct God make me answer for it at the day of the judgment I know it's correct I take the blame for that that's exactly right because it is the truth you say does it make any difference it did to Paul they asked how they've been baptized they said they'd already been baptized but John the man that baptized Jesus Paul said they had to come and be rebaptised again in the name of Jesus Christ and not one person in the Bible was ever baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost no people is ever baptized like after the organizing of the Catholic Church at the lai lai lai a seat of counsel at lea Rome that's where the first person was ever baptized using the titles a fellow said to me the other day I said well if the Lord Jesus that's his name he said well I said if a fellow come to you he said I don't think it makes any difference I just caught him in his own doctoring I said if a man come to you and said I am baptized in the name of the Rose of Sharon Lily LaValley in the morning star would you say amen to that he said no sir I said how would you would you rebaptised him said yes sir I said how would you baptize him he said I'll baptize in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and I said that's the way i baptize you in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost I said now Rose of Sharon Lily Valley Morningstar is no name he said that's right it's a tide like this so his Father Son and Holy Ghost not baptize him in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ exactly so I say and he saw it if not it was brother Joseph Matson Bo's a of Chicago the hardest fellow I've ever had a breakthrough I suppose I've got around three or four thousand natives to baptize now I want to get over in Africa with Harry baptized over again now so we're grateful for the gospel light and so now Jesus said when he was sure on earth what I hear that I speak and I'm going to say just for a next about 10 minutes or 15 just before taking the text in a very short text and then we'll have the prayer line I have come to a place in my ministry to where I've got to to say something and on Jesus said that what he heard that was what he spoke and he said I called you my friends and a friend tells his friends all things Paul said in acts 20:27 I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God then may I join in tonight and say the same thing with that great saint of old to the best of my knowledge I have not I have not shunned but declared to you the whole counsel of God someone explain him on the tapes of the day just because it made somebody angry they shot at him through the window and a woman wounded so perhaps some day I'll seal my testimony but when that time comes I'm ready to go until nighttime comes there's nothing gonna hurt me until that time now we believe in the same gospel just the way the Bible is written it's zeroed and and if the gun is exactly zeroed in in tune if it strikes the target the first time it will strike it the second time and every time if a tree or limb vine puts out a branch and that branch bears a certain fruit the next time the the vine puts out a branch it will bear the same kind of fruit and if Jesus is the vine and we are the branches and the first branch church that that bind put out they wrote a book of Acts behind it and that first branch baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they had the Living God among them that did the same things among them that he did when he was on earth therefore the people take a notice to them though ignorant and unlearn that they had been with Jesus because his life was through them as I've said if I had the spirit of a Beethoven in me I would write songs a bait if I if Beethoven lived with me I'd be Beethoven me a Shakespeare lived a me I'd be Shakespeare write poems and plays and so forth if Shakespeare lived in me if Christ lives in me the works of Christ you'll do it's got to be and what is Christ the word he said if ye abide me my wording you then s what you will it'll be done because the words are just needs the life and the light makes it live so now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long or at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will never be an impersonation of that cause it can't be it cannot be now it's in existent and I have I'm warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happen so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly thing that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen from nothing sinful I don't mean that but I mean something odd to what the regular trend because for a reach to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that far as certain as the first clause identified so has the second been identified and if you'll think real closely you are spiritual as the Bible say here's the a man has wisdom the third is properly a dinner we know where it is so the third pool is here it is so sacred that I'm mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself but - I've tried to explain the others not I made a mistake this will be the thing that - my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapture and faith for the going away enter them obviously quite for just a little long now remember and who's listening to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified there's coming a time upon in this nation now where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which is pagan Rome when it become papal Rome thing that's this nation will do that revelations 13 plainly explains it the lamb come up out of the earth the other beasts come up out of water thickness and multitudes of people this lamb come up where there was no people a lamb represents a religion the Lamb of God and remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb and then after a while it be received power and spoke like a dragon and extra sauce all the dragon power the dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination a image unto the Beast making a power that will force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be into this Council of Churches or you won't be able to have fellowship or - well it's it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach less you have a Oh shift card or some identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all that all together that's exactly cuz they won't be able to do it it's tightening it and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixin to tell you a few minutes what's the third pull then and it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it it will be for the bride in the church now we're closer than it seems to me I don't go a win but it's real real close maybe building a platform for somebody else to step on I may be taken before that time I don't know and that time maybe this coming week that the Holy Spirit will come with and bring Christ Jesus he may come this next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but I do believe that we are so close then I would never die with old age yet at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here unless I'm shot killed or something other someway killed this old age wouldn't kill me until he's come and I believe that and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to Scripture according to what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 brother what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world or a john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming and john said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I think so it's a paralleled it and every way and I know it will the message will go on now there's been some great things take place along the road this morning I was having interviews in the room here and a young fellow by the name of Autry he's probably still in here tonight he's some Senate owned Texas he come asked if Columbus going to Dallas coming from California we could drop in one night at their Tabernacle just for one night they're looking it up the next day or two to see if we can do then and he was telling me about I never been to San Antonio since that first meeting now the first meeting when I come to Santa tone I was there I think with brother coot and the the International Bible School and I forget the auditorium we had the service in and it's either my first night our second night I think the first night when I was walking to the platform someone's raised up in the building way back in the back and spoke with tongues like a machine gun firing and you know more and set out just a moment or two to one raised on the platform and give the interpretation and I stopped with what he said and I said to the man do you know this man said no sir and he said I said how'd you come here he said the people I work part was that was here tonight and they brought me he's a the cowboy and I said what do you do he said do you know him he said no sir I never seen him and I said what are you and he was a merchant in the city and what they said in the I was always before I learned better I was a little skeptical speaking in tongues I thought a lot of it was flesh and it might be but when this was said that interpretation was exactly what the angel of Lord said down the river eleven years before that and john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent to forerun the second there it wasn't that angel that light has been thoroughly identifiable by the church by the word by science and everything has identified that light for its first time to appear in public standing right over where I was and about two o'clock in the afternoon at the foot of the bridge right down here at the foot of Spring Street in the water now that's been many many years ago and it exactly what it said has come to pass to the doc this brother here was telling me this morning he married a girl out of the church your sister noise daughter now I don't know I guess the young men are you here a brother Audrey I don't know he was from San atone I don't know whether he sure or not he was sure this morning and he was telling me I believe it was his grandfather doing that meeting had been an epileptic all of his life and was brought there that's the first beginning of the ministry when it said that if the discernment was put their hands upon mine and what would be said would be what it was and I told you and many are witnesses tonight that it would come to pass that I would know the very secret of their heart remember that before it ever happened about five or six years later that taken place and up in Canada for its first time and that happened then he said if you'll keep being sincere it'll just keep going and now the third thing has taken place he just constantly moving on and he said his father was brought in the line and told of this epilepsy and so forth and a prayer prayed for him and that's been 16 years ago I think it is about 16 or 17 years ago and he says he never has had a seizure ever since and he's prettier 85 years old he never had a seizure since what is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever is Margie Morgan in the building sister Margie Morgan a lady that was eaten up with cancer a nurse how many remembers sister Morgan if she's here she can't get in she was nursing you see on the cancer list in Louisville the woman's been dead for about 16 17 years on the cancer list and lo when Jim Tom Robinson the attorney Christian Attorney heard about it he went to the Baptist hospital to check and see if his right cause his father's on the board trustee at the Baptist Hospital and they looked up the case and the woman who supposed to been dead years ago and she's nursing her were still in the hospital when she stood right here when they had to hold her up not even in her own mind but it was thus saith the law and she's a living she went to nursing in Louisville and a fellow down here chimps candy place is mr. Shapiro tonight I'd like for him utility if he's here sunny shim great healthy man many times and I used to I hate to say this but it's the truth pop used to give me a dime if I worked all week and I

the picture show for a nickel and we used to see the old steel pictures with little kids in wonder but 810 years old we had that William s heart many you guys don't remember him the old actor still pictures I couldn't read I just have to watch what was going on and even I have to spell it all out I couldn't make it but I watch what he was doing I don't have an extra nickel how many remembers getting the penny ice cream cone all right I could get three ice cream cones and two Penny's worth of Redhawks I couldn't hold the ice cream cone so I'd eat them and get two pennies worth a red-hot to be almost a half a pound to them thing and chimps made him and I go in there and set back and watch with UMass Hart and this young fella a little older than I'm stricken down with the disease that five noted specialists of Louisville passed him I weigh in about 45 pounds and was dying miss Morgan was nursing him and he was in such a condition yet so many things as long as God his throat was gone his little arms as just about that big around and he was laying there dying and miss Morgan was hard to come on the job so she said to him I was once the cancer patient and begin to tell him he

long had I forgotten that and wife and I was going down to buy some candy when we got your Christmas and how I don't know that we ever thought of ships I was usually go over here some of these drugstores and pick it up but we stopped in front of ships when I went in his sister looking she said what brother ran she said your member juni I said yes and they're a great big strong healthy looking fella now I walk toward the counter looked at it looked out I kiss I said I'll take a pound of those red hots and he said yes sir so his sister was waiting on my wife and so he got him out I

thus saith the Lord about five years ago he said brother Brennan I am so completely healed there's not even one effect I'm teeny bit hard hearing him on here I guess he's in his 50s he said I'm teeny bit hard hearing him one ear because they give me so much antibiotic when I was in their amazing grace of Jesus Christ I haven't got much time now to say something else but I want to make this statement how many remembers about the squirrels all right that was a puzzling scripture in my life I never could understand that and there was another that puzzled me that's when Moses could tell God a better way than God note how to do anything when Moses said they have people to say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses to itself in the breach then later I found out that Moses that was Christ in Moses standing for the people see so then on this scripture and I never would preach on it if you say to this mountain be moved and you know the story so I'll bypass that now little did I know what that was leading to and I think that brother Woods and brother Fred and them are here in the building which was present when that happened or right edge would happen their brother Rodney and brother Charlie from down in Kentucky such Awards this brother name was present when it happened down in Kentucky which was the second time it happened just simply speaking into existence things it wasn't the speaking all time and backing up the scriptures encouraging the third time it happened was Hattie right is Hattie here tonight that's etus how many knows Hattie right brother woods and I were sitting there when it happened and when the Holy Spirit said give her what she wants and I was talking about that how do them squirrels come into existence and I said it's only thing it is he's Jehovah Jireh just when Abraham needed a ram God provided that Ram and he provided the squirrels he can speak a squirrel just into existence because he's creator just same as he could speak the RAM Abraham never asked for it he was just simply going on to do it but he showed that Jehovah Jireh I was there when I said that a humble a woman for the first time this ever happened the third pull upon a human being was a little humble woman that making about $200 a year for a living well she got out of her little farm her husband did two children that had turned kind of wild and come and donated $20 of that to the building of this tabernacle and media give me some money that morning for groceries $20 and oz go to give it back to her that day well it was down there so she wouldn't have to pay it but she wouldn't take him and when she's sitting back in the corner and when in line I said only thing I know is he still Jehovah Jireh and a little head he said the right word she said that's nothing but the truth and when she said that brother banks woods here's one that was present that room felt like it was coming apart and the Holy Spirit said the same boy spoke about the squirrel said give her what she asked for now said sister Hattie as a witness before God this is it now there's any doubt in your mind you asked what you want to in if it ain't laid in your lap then I'm a false prophet she said brother Branham everybody was crying said watch how I asked I said you're poor and you live on the hill over there with no money you might ask for that you've got a little crippled sister setting your Edith that we prayed for for years you might ask for her healing I said your father and mother is old and broke down you might ask for them whatever you ask for sister Hattie see now if it happens or not right now and I said he's just told me the same voice said give her what she asked for and she looked around to watch y'all say brother Bama I said say what's your desire is thank you your greatest desire and said and her boys was even sniggering laughing and she said the greatest is all I have is a Salvation my two sons give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ in there they went and they've been faithful in this church with communion hem little fellas set on a warship feet with the man and things like that we all are witness to that she had a real choice her mother has to die so does she all him but what she asked will be eternal and the salvation of her children that was a third time it happened the fourth time it happened I just explained it here the last time I here was up on the mountain or that storm raging how many heard it all we're the storm raging and God being my judge standing here going down the mountain when David would he's here somewhere I guess that made me a sandwich and it was quite a one I think he's trying get even with me for the one I made for his daddy a few years ago he had baloney in and me mmm everything mixed together I put it my shirt it rain and just got a big water dole and I was coming down the mountain it's so storm I couldn't see my hand before me all right and I know just one thing you're turned around cause that winds its whirling now there's witnesses here to that one of them is one of our faithful deacons which is brother wheeler are you were is the end you're right here brother wheeler brother man a Methodist preacher from New Albany is he a brother man in tonight don't know whether he is or not brother banks woods are you your brother banks he's in the recording room all right and David woods and brother Evans was there I believe is that right brother Evans brother Evans stand against the wall was there and how they broadcast four days two days before that a mighty blizzard were sweeping the land brother Tom Simpson is sure tonight when coming down out of Canada they asked him to bypass Sarah cause he couldn't get through a blizzard was coming but the Tom are you here or like here he's sitting right here and there the clouds come up and I said brother everybody rushed out there was nobody back there out of a hundred and something man back there there's nobody back there but our little group and the cowboy the rider and we was going to stay I'd call sister Evans and head her to call the wife and tell to tell Tony if I didn't get out get somebody else to hold a breakfast for the businessman and up on the mountain that that thing I said I wanted first little rain starts or anything take for the camp I said both in 10 or 15 minutes you can't see your hands before you well that blizzards and it'll dump 20 foot of snow just a little bit over the mountain that's how people you read in a paper now they're back there and perish and everything but we knew how to get out and they know where we was at and so we felt led to stay and so upon the mountain when that Blizzard started I started going down and I was just about a half a mile from where it started and the voice of God said turn and go back and I went back as he told me after waiting for a while eating that sandwich of Davy gimme and went back up there and sat down and while I was sitting there in that wind twisting and blowing the treetops leading away over to sleet and snow applying like that a boy said I am the God of creation I looked up I thought where was that that was a wind maybe he said I created the heavens and earth I still the mighty winds up on the Seas and when I'm talking I jumped up and took off my head and he said just speak to the storm little cease whatever you say that's what will happen I said storm you cease it son you shine normally for four days that we're out of here and I know more and said it until the sleet snow and everything stopped in a moment or two the hot sun is shining on my back I've seen the winds blowing I kiss come back from the north coming down I mean from the east coming from the east it was coming from the West the winds changed and come back hitched when the clouds like a mystic thing lifting up into the air and the Sun was shining in a few minutes then the Lord Jesus spoke to me a little later on about my wife down there as you know about where I went up there I've never been home a home anniversary yet we've been married 22 years the first anniversary first our wedding I took her on a hunting trip cause I couldn't forward take the hunt written and and go on a honeymoon - so I kind of put it together and so then I'm and I've been hunting ever since not offense way out treat her now that was the fourth time it happened now here's something I I want to say I must tell exactly the truth about 16 years ago I was in California where's brother John Sharon and I was having a meeting and a median I and brother shirt and sister shirts I was staying in a hotel and a man named Paul Maliki who stood right here in this Tabernacle many times so wealthy Armenian and his wife er give birth to a child up at Fresno California where they live and was calm down brought his wife down to call me at the hotel and said can I bring my wife up brother Graham I said yes you may next day I was going to Catalina so it brought his wife up and the little lady was so sick and she I said put your hand on mine sister Maliki and I said we will see if the Lord will tell us and his City she laid her hands upon me I said oh it's milk Lane
