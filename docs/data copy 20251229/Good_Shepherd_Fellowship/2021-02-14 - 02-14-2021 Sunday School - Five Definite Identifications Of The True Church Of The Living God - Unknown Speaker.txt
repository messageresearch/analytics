========================================

so he carried me away in the spirit and to the wilderness and i saw a woman sitting up on a scarlet colored beast let me get these symbols as you go along now scarlett is red red in one way is a good color red in another way is an ill-famed color red light danger color a scarlet colored she was decked in scarlet color red prostitute and was setting up on a beast a beast in the bible means power if you notice many ministers i see them not in their head right because they're teachers of the bible a beast means a power we see these beasts in the of the bible of revelations 13 and of daniel coming up out of the water these powers coming up from among the people but did you notice in revelation 13 when the united states come up is the only beast in the bible that come up that did not come out of waters the bible said it come up out of the earth where there was no peoples that was this new kingdom and it looked like a lamb but afterwards spoke like the dragon that's right that's this country it's got to happen someday they'll make a mistake and elect the wrong guy that's right they're raised up for joseph or pharaoh it doesn't know joseph they've tried it before and they'll do it again if they fail this time it'll finally come the bible says so that's right now i'm not a politician both sides of them are crooked i'm placing my vote on jesus christ he's the only one i'm interested in but i'll tell you you better wipe your glasses off now and expect any freedom for your children i don't know how close it is pray all right heaven watch so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman church setting up on a scarlet colored beast scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns seven heads on down here said the seven heads which was on the beast is seven hills on which the the city set up now what cities built on seven hills rome exactly a city sitting on seven hills a church a woman a prostitute that'll control the world with her powers well it's just as plain as reading the newspaper certainly now and the woman was a raided purple and scarlet colors the woman the church rich and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls tell me what one american income tax tell me whether tax for anything right away of anything you want to do yet god's got children in there certainly just the same pot can't call kittle black a lot of times the protestants say well the catholics they murdered this that the other who murdered joseph smith i don't agree with him but he had just as much right for his teaching as i've got for mine here in america and the methodist church murder joseph smith when you come into the salt lake city it's got a great big sign up you methodists watch some arm and crickets right the methodist church shot joseph smith down protestants so don't holler about the catholic watch just a few minutes the bible say so too precious stones pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of the abomination of the filthiness of her fornications her doctrines what she was giving out kings of the earth drinking anybody could believe that could leave brother jaggers vitamin pills that you can sprinkle a water on a woman that's been married to a man for 30 years and had a bunch of children and turn her back to a virgin and send her to a bridal bed that night with her husband anybody can believe that holy water will do that can believe anything that's right amen but the kings of the earth commit such things as that it's so they can live and have a peaceful feeling down in your heart you know you're rotten takes the blood of jesus christ to cleanse you but now notice she was the first organized church the bible speaks of it here and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babbling the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth a watch we all will agree and romans own books the catholics own books agree that that is the roman church amen their own books could agree with it how about what's called facts of our faith only belongs to a priest a catholic was converted to my whichever boy was a priest and she gave me the book then you talked to her back in church you come for it and let her have it i kept it for evidence boy i don't know what i was talking about when i say anything i must know it amen god's going to hold me responsible for it and remember she was called mystery babbling we know that's a catholic church but notice she's a mother of harlots what's a harlot the same thing as she is the now where did these organizations come from there's your mother that's what you are to begin with then you say that's the antichrist that's true then if that's antichrist then what about our organizations just as harlot and the same thing committing adultery committing fornications accepting false things because of the mind and intellectuals of man as the bible said teaching for doctrine the commandments of man that's what's called church today which is against god's kingdom like in the old testament god wanted to be king over israel before it became a church and he was king and although they had a prophet samuel a good man and when he had told them that if they wanted a king but they want to be like the rest of people they want to be like the philistines that's what samaritan's protestant people they just won't let good enough alone that's right they just when the holy ghost fell on the back under 40 years ago and the power began to pour out they began to dance and shout and speak with tongues they wouldn't leave it alone they had to organize right then along came one and he called him a general counsel along came another with a little light on the name jesus christ and they called them the new issues and turned them out then they got them an organization called the pfjc the pentecostal symbol of jesus christ a little friction come in between him whether he's coming on a white horse or high was coming and they organized another called the afw pentecost assemblies of the world oh my my then all come the church of god then they broke off by prophecy organized again every time you do it you go out of the way of god that's right praise the lord antichrist spirit god's church is free god's church is bound by no boundaries because from sea to sea is god's amen every human being under the earth belongs to him amen whether he in catholic prophecy or whatever he is god seeks those with an honest heart and we're saved by faith believing him that's the church now you see the church is not an organization and every time you see organization just remember antichrist has wrote over it here it is in the bible that's as plain as i know how to read it i i've got plenty of precious friends sitting here that belongs to organizations i don't say your antichrist i'm not calling you that but behind the whole thing yeah amen and it looks like the devil has twisted it in such a way till you have to have something like that or they won't even let you preach [Music] that's the same thing the nations as god you can't be a man without a nation you have to have a nation somewhere you have to either be american german or something see it's all twisted around so really a real born-again christian is almost a wonder in the side of the world he's a renegade but in the sight of god he's precious wish we had time to go to hebrews 11 and see all them faith warriors how abraham stepped out and called himself a pilgrim and a stranger said this world was his home but he was wandering about seeking a city whose builder and maker was god and if we be dirty christ we take on abraham's seat and her heir to him [Applause] [Music] when israel come up out of egypt there was moab the great organized country there was also esau the great organized country and there was israel on on denomination coming along both of them fundamentally in the word remember balaam offered the same sacrifice that israel offered seven orders god's requirement seven cleanest sacrifices seven rams speaking of the coming of a just one fundamentally they were both right speaking fundamentally but what balaam failed to see he failed to see that supernatural amongst israel that interdenominational group no place to go they were wandering but they were on the road somewhere that's the way the church of the living god is today it's unorganized as far as the world is concerned but it's bound together about not organization tithes but by the power and the spirit of jesus christ by the bonds of love make some methodists and baptists pat one other on the back and say my precious brother when they're see they can't walk together unless they're greed people say are you a christian i'm a baptist i don't answer the question at all am i a christian i'm pentecost that only answers the question if you are a christian you are a born-again creature you are in a mystic kingdom of god your eyes are not on things in this world but on things above and that's when you're in the church amen that is the church it is not an organization it can never be an organization take me on record the church of the living god can never be any certain group it cannot be an organization amen it has to be a mystical body the holy spirit a little farther if we get time we'll get right into it now now you see what church means church means a called out bunch a called out people that's governed only by the king of this messiah kingdom oh isn't that wonderful i love that when i read that in the uh uh today in what i said there the kingdom the messianic empire the writer put it messianic empire the writer also said there is not such a thing as a church of the living god ever being organized an organization is something that was adapted into to take the place out that's just exactly why all these false doctrines is brought in to take the place of the real that's the reason a woman had in her hand a cup of the filthiness of her abomination now you see i'm not saying the pentecostals is just as guilty as the catholic or the pilgrim holiness or the nazarenes or the baptist or amen methodist in all those denominational churches god has children amen amen they belong into this mystic kingdom the only thing they're waiting for is to see that something take place that'll draw our hearts into it i'm so glad to know tonight that they're coming from the east and west north and south america amen pulling themselves out worshiping waiting for the coming of the lord the bible said they'd do that in the last days that's exactly right and said they'd run from the east to the west north and south seeking for the true word of god famine not for bread and water but for the hearing of the word of god they want you come join this come join this there's nothing you join in the kingdom of god there's not one thing you can join it's an experience of being born into the church not jarned into it now i'll make you a little more on that in a minute i've got some more scriptures roll down there but now let's go to the second thought so we can try to get through all of it who set it up that is this mystical body who started this jesus christ and it is the he is the head of this mystical body he's a king over working his own will in his dominion not a bishop's control or a church board's control but a king which is messiah himself working in his own domain when did it begin at pentecost not the pentecostal organization the pentecostal experience that's when it began with you he spoke of its coming he said what would take place he told it was coming now if we will we can turn to luke 24 chapter 49 first and we can see here start reading some scriptures so these people that's taking this can put it down luke 24 49 we'll see what he said and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tear ye in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high now he promised of a coming church a coming kingdom now turn right over to acts one and eight now i remember he spoke also in matthew 16 18 of upon this rock he would build his church and the gates of hell should not prevail against it we're going to get to that just in a few minutes as we go on down into the other subject acts 1 and 8 but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samara and to the utmost parts of the world a coming kingdom of witnesses witnesses of his resurrection witnesses of his power witnesses of his of being alive you're my witnesses now acts one and eight then we also find that in ephesians the first chapter 22nd verse you just put that down just there's plenty of it to put down but just to nail it down to make it sure that you're you see it all right the 22nd verse of ephesians the first chapter and has put all things under his feet that's christ and gave him to be the head over the things to the church which is his body and the fullness of him that filleth all in all who set this church up jesus christ no bishop no group a man no pope no man made powers at all but jesus christ spoke of it being his kingdom that was coming in power some censure 16th chapter matthew very i'll say you some stand sure shall not see death until they see the kingdom of god coming in power just a few days after that he was crucified and the holy ghost fell some stand here shall not see death until they see the kingdom of god will thou restore the kingdom at this time the jews ask him he said it's not for you to know the time or the season what the father is putting his own mind but you shall receive power acts 1 you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power after you are made a bishop if you're made a preacher if you're made a pope after you made a priest you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come on you that's the witness that god was looking for a witness after the holy ghost this comes not a witness that i'm a bishop not a witness that i'm a pastor but a witness of what of the resurrected king that's the true church of the living god all right and also in colossians 1 17 and we might read this as while we're at colossians 1 17 and 18th verse and he who is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who he is who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence who is the head of this church jesus christ what kingdom is it the messianic kingdom the church not an organization a church a mystic body to which christ is the head oh i love that walking in the spirit obeying the king foolish to the world precious in the sight of god walking in the spirit misunderstood life that made fun of all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution if they persecute the prophets which were before you call the master the king master of the building be else above how much more will they call them of his disciples but you're walking in the spirit turning your back on the things of the world not bound by any fetters he who the son is made free is free indeed amen that's the church of the living god that's who set it up now we see in witnesses in acts 1 and 8 he said you shall be my witnesses after the holy ghost has come on you what is the church the mystic body of christ who set it up the lord jesus himself he wasn't set up at rome neither wasn't set up in england but john wesley neither was the set for calvin or in america the baptist but john smith neither of us was set up in california by the pentecostals it was set up by jesus christ the king of the messianic kingdom that's what was set up by he is the king he wants to be king he wants to rule us he wants to be lord people let him in say i'll let him be savior but they won't let him be lord lord means ownership rulership come into my heart lord save me from hell but don't tell me what to do that's the attitude of the people that's the reason no one in the bible said all the tables have become full of vomit you know what vomit is as a dog turns to its vomit if these organizations didn't work in the first time and god had to vomit them out go back to him they'll make you vomit again amen he said i would that you were hot or cold because you're lukewarm i'll spew you from my mouth you make god sick at his stomach and he vomits us out tell me an organization that ever fell it ever rose again show me by history where one ever did a man will rise up with a ministry god will bless that man the first thing you know he'll turn it right around and get amongst man and make an organization out of it and that kills it right there look through the histories and find one that ever come up not a one because it's all an antichrist spirit amongst the people like moses and wanted something they could do themselves lord we had so many members this year what difference does that make how many members you have we're not looking for members of a church we're looking for members of christ's body borne into the kingdom of god not by the will of man but by the will of god not for the spirit of man or the intelligence of man paul said i never come to you with the wisdom of man i come to you with the spirit of god in the power of his resurrection that's your faith will not rest in the wisdom or chat the words of man but in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ that's what he come in god help us that we do the same thing now we don't want to spend too much time
