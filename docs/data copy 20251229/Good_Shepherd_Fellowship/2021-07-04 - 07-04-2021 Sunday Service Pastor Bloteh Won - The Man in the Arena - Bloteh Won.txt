you can please go ahead and sit sorry i don't know who has this i just want to thank god for safe travel back his wound his wonderful grace brought me back god bless you all i don't know no name is on this brother ben i don't know who is that oh oh sis okay the name uh mom that's sister helena welcome back god bless you all right okay let's sit and listen to brother joshua lee's testimony you are welcome brother [Music] okay all right god bless you saints uh you know when i when they struck my heart to actually give this testimony a thought kind of hit me like you know why do you always come to church and give testimonies why don't you just sit in your chair and you know be quiet and just let the service go on and you know all that you know and as soon as it hit me i'm just like you know the devil was busy you know and right after that thought another one just hit me like you know i know people don't come to church to hear me speak you know and but i know one thing you know people do come to church to hear about the glory of god and how good god is to his people you know so i was like even if nobody wants to hear me i would go outside and speak to the trees you know because i know after that conversation god had just sent a win and the tree to start dancing in that wind you know so um i i'm pretty sure most of you guys know about my friend who used to come with me often he was actually here when we got back when i got baptized and we were very close like you know anywhere i go he'd go with me anywhere he'd go i'm way i'm right with him you know and we kind of fell off a little bit as time went on i guess i just stopped doing certain things and he just kept on doing it so we just kind of kind of fell off there it's kind of sad but i understand why and i was at work the other day nikon i went to my locker open my locker and i seen like two missed calls from him i called him back i'm like how you doing you know how you doing brother you know he just kind of made fun of the way i talk and like man you sound like a square why you talk like that you know i'm like whatever how you doing and he's like um you could tell in his voice or like just the way he sounded that he was just kind of disturbed a little bit and he was like i'm good as the conversation went on he got to opening up maury he's like man i'm just tired of the way i'm living you know he's just like i'm just tired of the way my life is going and everything about it and he got to telling me how he's sleeping that you know he burnt the bridge with his mom he burnt the bridge with his pipes he burnt the bridge with his sisters and all that so he's sleeping at a park in uh in minneapolis and he told me the parking you know back in my days of rebellion i got very accustomed with that part too you know so you know it's true and i'm just like man um i i fell for him you know and he just he just asked me he's like what would you do if he was in my situation and i'm like now you asked me that what i do back then or what i'll do right now he's like i'm not trying to hear what you would have done back then i mean right now and i thought about it i'm like i got nowhere to go i got you know my family don't want me i'm at a park i got no job and it just hit me like i would pray like honestly that's exactly what i said i said i just pray to god and he was like man i'm not trying to hear that like come on like this is that like he kind of got mad he's like man i'm not trying to hear that what god gonna do for me how he gonna give me a place to sleep or a place to lay my head and this and that and just all sorts of stuff i'm like whoa you know he's like i'm not trying to hear that you gotta be one i'm like that is exactly what i would do you know and then you should really humble yourself and be sincere and pray to god and see what he would do for you it's like man i'm not trying to hear that kept on going on and on and he's just like i mean i pray but i don't know about being all sincere because i don't really you know feel like he's gonna do nothing for me and i just told him like if you're not sincere don't even do it i don't know if you know just like don't even do it because he's not gonna hear you if you're going to pray to god believe you're praying to god who's going to answer your prayers you know don't just pray to him and think it might happen it might not happen you know and when i said that the conversation just kind of went flat you know i guess he got kind of mad but like i was trying to be honest with him you know and a little bit later it kind of ended and just a week ago he texted me and he was like man what's up with you what you be putting in your cereal what do you eat what what's going on with you and i'm like what are you talking about and i kind of sent him a question mark he's like i'ma call you and he called me and he was like so tell me one night while i was at a park i was at the same park and i was getting ready to sleep and he goes during the night time and he was like i was looking up at this guy and i was just feeling so bad you know just with my life and myself that i began to cry you know he don't like telling me when he cried but he was like i began to cry and i just started praying i just started praying to god i was just so disturbed i just started praying to him and when i got done praying an hour went by and my uncle called me i haven't talked to this man in a long time but i don't know where he just decided to call me he's like i just wanted to check up on you and see how you're doing and all of this and all of that and he asked me where where am i and i kind of ran over to uh that subject because i didn't want to let him know i was at a part and they hung up and probably an hour went by again and his uncle called him back like you're at a park why aren't you telling me this what are you doing at the park you know what i'm coming to pick you up tomorrow we're going to figure something out so the next day came and his uncle came to pick him up and took him to his auntie's house in inver grove heights and by god's grace didn't even take hours and he's at he's living with his auntie now in inver grove heights you know and it was just so many he's like man i just feel so good i don't even want to ask him for nothing no more like i just i don't want to make him feel like i'm like ungrateful i like i'm just so happy like he just moved so fast i just i can't believe it you know and i'm just like i was so happy for him i was like i was just really so happy for him to the point where he's telling me this uh no just telling me all this and then i meet with him the other day he tells me it again you know because i just wanted i wanted to hear it again i was just so happy i wanted to hear how god moved for him again and he was i got so happy i wanted to hug him but he was in the car now so i couldn't really hug him but i kind of put my hand around him i'm like i'll do that so i kind of move my hand he's like bro i know you not just try to pat rub my back and i was just like i'm like i don't know what i was doing i was just really happy for you man and i just say this to be like just to give god the glory it's so wonderful to see what he does in the lives of people that we love and he know how much you really care for him that he he works with this with these people and just try to build their faith and their confidence in him and i also say to just you know ask you know all of us as a group you know are we praying like we're supposed to you know our it's our prayer lives where we need it to be because that is like the one and only place we can really come and talk to god and conversate with our maker you know so it was just a wonderful wonderful

thank everybody i greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ and um during the memorial weekend we had a wonderful time in waperton north dakota and i wanted to personally come back here and thank every one of you for the support and for the warmth that you gave us i counted over 50 people attended the meetings and a majority of them were from here so i really really appreciated that the people that prayed for us the people that came up to help i cannot mention all the names i am also very grateful for brother blotte and his support and the meetings were successful we had almost eight different nations represented in that small town there were people from the united states people from kenya from zimbabwe from liberia from canada from the united kingdom from puerto rico uh even the democratic republic of congo so this message this word as it's written shall be preached to all tongues and nations and then the end will come so may god bless you so much i feel so much at home here and i love all of you very much and let us keep praying for each other we had almost 60 people the last service there which was a big multiplication of what we normally have last weekend we were four so so and my co-worker and fellow soldier brother steve carlon has been such a great addition to us and he was during the meetings he was the cook the chef the pianist uh he was the usher the sound machine man it was everything whatever he wanted so may god bless him and his family for his great support so thank you so much i just want to uh i love the song we last sang here that we are just so joining for a few minutes we will not be here for long we believe those who are keeping an eye on the scripture that is coming is very close let me share just one scripture uh from isaiah chapter 30 verse 26 uh the fulfillment of a scripture here is isaiah chapter 30 verse 26. moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be seven folds as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and he let the stroke of the wound we all know especially in the northwest and other places the so-called global warming or climate change people are dying from the heat and even the cnn this morning the headlines was about the heat wave across the united states and here the scripture is saying when the the sun shall be seven-fold as the light of seven days in the day when the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and we know that israel is back in the homeland as a direct fulfillment of scripture and prophecy whether it's from the book of isaiah is ezekiel from jeremiah chapter 31 uh isaiah chapter 14 i'll bring my people back to their homeland it's a direct fulfillment of scripture and in that day when he makes and binds the wound of his people israel the sun shall be seven times harder and we see this happening right now so keep an eye on the word of god as we wait for his coming his promise rest assured he'll keep his promise when he said i go to prepare place in john chapter 14 verse 3 and i will return the return of christ is coming and also it's written in acceptance 1 11. the same jesus that you saw going up shall return again let us be ready to meet him as he comes god bless you brothers and sisters amen praise the lord amen i used that brother team to redeem myself i left my notes of the visitors in the office so i had to bring him up so i can redeem myself amen and we greeted our sister there sister mosukante sorry for mispronouncing your name and the brother year brother kwame hey brother kwame praise the lord good to have you visiting with us uh and we have our brother franklin uh he's uh he's uh uh partner in missions with me [Laughter] brother franklin is actually from alaska he works there with brother flynn take and brother andrew boscott in uh in the in the island area there he's uh one of the the minister brothers there but if you remember some time ago uh uh we were praying for him uh when his wife went to be with the lord and uh uh so just after that i called uh brother brett and at a high in my heart one day because we were good friends i mean we really bounded together one year when we went for the meeting in uh in in tucson but a dog baker meeting so we had to sleep together amen sleep in the same room so you know what it is it is that's fellowship to his highest heart you know fellowship is too fellow in the same shape but if they have to sleep together the lord so we had uh two double beds and we had to share the room so i mean we really spent time together and you know we just bound it so uh so after hearing the error i knew how how how difficult it would have been for him because i know how he and his wife were very very close and uh the last time we were there we visited her in the hospital pray with her before we left after the meeting that year but he pleased the law to take her home and then when i talked to brother flynn he told me how much you know brother franklin was was it was difficult for him and uh and he says well brother well i don't know if you would get him on the phone because even myself it's hard for me to get him on the phone and uh so i said well what we would do we would just pray you know and we were praying and until one day brother jordan uh sent a message from facebook to to me that a brother was making contact i think there were two two different person one from uganda and he also was making contact so as soon as i saw his message i said well if he if he's making contact then he's ready to talk so i took my phone and i called him immediately he answered the phone call and we spent some time on the phone and and then later on we talked again he told me he possibly will be visiting minnesota if things work out you know uh most of the brothers there they they are involved into uh artworks that works with their hands and you know they do some craft works and uh so some of his friends choose to pay his ticket for them to come down to minneapolis and he just thought that he would come and fellowship with us so in the plan that we had you remember last sunday i told you i was thinking that he and brother uh where is the brother name there oh my goodness he and brother olano who have done the test tested you know testimony today but because brother orlando tripp was caught shot so he had to go back so we had him testifying last sunday so we would call brother but franklin up he won he will share a little bit of uh how the lord miraculously brought him out of the struggle of his wife passion so come on sodium [Applause] god bless you god bless you i just want to share the um power of almighty god and through that i want to share a scripture with you and that is pertaining to this um testimony that i have with the passing of my wife and that scripture is in um it's in first john 3 and i wanted to read verse 2 and it says beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and i want you to know that that scripture right there and this pertains to the healing of my wife passing away and it's i'm not gonna keep this long i'm here for the word you know i want to feed on the word and that's why i'm here and so that scripture is has got a mask like covet 19. it's sealed you know but but right now the way everything is going god is about to lift that scripture so that we can see him as he is because we are the word yeah you know we are the word made flesh and that scripture right there is that that transformation that is taking place right now that's in our hearts but is about to be made flesh yes and so um to make a long story short my wife passed away i went away from church you know i didn't want to talk to nobody absolutely nobody you know and death is something that's not easy you know everybody goes through it regardless you know healing is totally in many forms many uh different ways um and so to to this day um i went through like several months of uh grieving you know grieving and everybody goes through that some take 10 years some take a lifetime but by god's grace mine was eight months eight months total and what had happened was a friend of mine i was talking to nobody and they said you know you're building a wow around you i said how did you know that and they told me two other things that i knew that i was doing right within my heart and i said you can tell me anything you want you just told me what's in my heart i mean i don't care i mean uh and so what happened was um i went into a a meta friend they are biblically based uh program up in alaska and so they were we were talking and so we got to the discussion of my uh wife and um so they uh they we sat down and they said what would you say to yourself about the loss of your wife and i was the hardest i couldn't i couldn't grasp the words to come out and i just stayed there and i just started weeping you know and just started crying and everything and and again they asked what and there's nobody that can grieve for you like yourself that can feel sorry for you you know who you are everybody goes through different stages and so again they asked what did you say to yourself if you were sitting right next to you and i just and the words that came to me was i suffered a tremendous loss and i was set free right from my spoken i was ill i was healed instantly right there and i was just both healing and praising god came right at the same time and i'm telling you that scripture that says um we shall know him as he is that spirit there absolutely knows no death right yes and when we become that word we will absolutely know no death but that spirit has come unto me in that healing there and that it is as if there's absolutely no death happened you know that that's that's the kingdom that we're coming into and we're about to receive that that's right you know and so um what happened was right after that i just said lord i'm just gonna go out into the world you know and because jesus christ is in my heart and i'm just i'm not preaching or doing anything i'm just going out to the world and however people treat me is how they treat the lord jesus christ whether it's a cup of water however it is you know and i'm and you can do that to your friends too you don't have to preach to them your life is right there light you know you might be the only chance that they'll ever see god you might be the only chance they'll ever see god and so i and i hope brother one doesn't mind me saying this so what i want i'm almost done the first thing i did was i went to the uh and i don't recommend this don't do this you know i went to a ball game tournament for young people and because i used to play basketball before i came into the message and so i was coaching not not coaching but telling the team what to do and the uh the young ladies coach i i went to go talk to the team and i said you guys are a really good team you know and they said well nobody ever tells us that you know everybody says we're bad and the funny thing about it was when i was done they said um can you pray for us like oh my goodness you guys want me to pray for you guys i said i'm not here to pray for you guys but if you want a prayer you know i'll give you guys prayer and so i didn't know what to pray and i was like lord i commit their lives into your hands you know and right after that uh not too long after that one of the young people that i prayed for prayed for is in church now you know so the lord knows what he's doing and one of the things that happened during that tournament was i went out and i i told nobody what i was doing now this is the first time that i'm really telling my story you know and so we were sitting down and i was thinking lord i'm here you told me to come over here i'm here for a purpose and i was sitting at the morning table there was nobody i'm just waiting on the lord said well you brought me here so it's something got to happen so those coaches came of that that girl's uh ball team and the other people came and i was like starting to talk talk about our culture and tying the message in and and i said i want you to know how what brother andrew believes that pastor up in uh chivac and i was talking to them of what they believe and the lady one of the believers is a coach and the other one is her her best friend and as soon as i was done talking about what we exactly believe on the word that her best friend turned around to her friend and said i am so sorry for what i thought of you all these years her best friend he said she said i had a wrong conception of your belief and so i said thank you lord that's if that's all god wants me to do you know that's fine and so when i and so i got invited to minnesota and the first thing i said was you need to if you're going to bring me down i need sunday to be with brother juan because i want to go to church and so here i am and you just keep me in prayer god bless you guys oh praise the lord what an awesome god we serve amen god works in mysterious way his wonders to perform amen we want to just thank the lord for that and and we are so grateful so grateful to uh you know uh the brother franklin and many of the brothers we we we got so connected when the first time we got back there and uh i mean there are some things i can tell you but it is there is no time for it now we must get right to the world but there is just such a good friendship that we have with these brothers and uh and and we just want to thank the lord you know and like i've said many times you get to know people sometimes we know people in different ways you know we know people you can know a person in a very shadow way you know but as a preacher and as a minister and having the privilege to work with people over the years i learned to know people from a death and and when the lord helped me to know you that way that is just enough for me you know i don't care what you are going through i know you and i know that when you are a son of god or you are a daughter of god your art will you know struggle might not show it but your spirit show it praise the lord and jesus told the disciples he said go here and be fishers of man it was not really just fishing man but fishing the good that is in every man because it only takes god to bring that out praise the lord let's turn to our feet and uh let's let's just sing a song here and as we just watch it and then we go right into the word i want to wish each and every one of you happy fault praise the lord amen happy father amen amen with my hands lifted up my mouth fit with praise my

strong and offer good courage praise the lord amen be strong of and offer good courage for unto these people shall thou divide for and inherit things the lamb we shall sword unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou merell observed to do according to all the lord which moses my seven commanded thee turn that from it to the right or to the left that thou nearer prospered where does whoever thou go with this book of the lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen that thou married observed to do a calling to all that is written therein then shut down for them thou shalt make their ways prosperous and then thou shall have good success what a way to be successful have not commanded thee be strong and offer good courage this is the tear time that god is repeating this statement be strong and of a good courage and there is a reason why havana commodity be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be that dismay for the lord thy god is with thee where's whoever that goeth the lord bless you you can have your seat i believe the reason why god re-echoed that remember he's telling moses i will be with you i mean joshua i will be with you just like i was with moses but yet he's encouraging joshua to be strong and very courageous and uh you you see the thing about courage comes with conviction you cannot be courageous if you don't have a conviction praise the lord amen god promised him to be with joshua just like he will be with moses even though there's a promise but it's not exactly the same because when we look in the scripture it's not exactly the same for joshua god is not going to pull minor down from heaven just like he did for moses praise the lord joshua is going to have challenges now this was a leader moses was a leader that the people trusted the people struggle with his leadership because they knew his past how he ran from egypt killed a man and run away they struggled with that but when god came down and vindicated his seven praise the lord by opening the red seed and the people walking on dry ground and and turning the bitter water of mara into a drinking water for them bringing manor down from heaven it build the confidence of the people praise the lord and here's the people having confidence in this man the man that they know speak face to face with god and for you to have a boy like joshua that grew up on the his ministry now to step in his shoes that kind of did wrong with this thing it's okay to step in his shoes you see now the the the challenge that he's he's having because the expectation of the people is for him to to behave just like moses they expect him to preach just like moses they expect him to go and talk face-to-face with god just like moses now you see that's the reason why almighty god is coming down and encouraging joshua that you have to be strong and courageous praise the lord you have to stay with everything moses said but be strong and courageous i'm telling you to stay with this gospel that the apostle has preached you have to be strong encourage us in a doubtful age like this in a grooming age like this you have to be strong you you can't just say the bible say the bible say it no you have to be strong praise the lord you have to be strong as much as if nobody believe it i believe it if i would have to believe it and go to hell i believe it i believe it because god said it [Music] praise the lord not because what the church interpreted to be but because god said it for you to be strong and courageous unique conviction praise the lord so god was kind of for giving uh joshua a little bit of a boss that he needed to be strong and courageous amen i don't know what you know better to preach for you on an independence day but i would just want to read a little bit here and and so we can be able to identify ourselves with this day independence day but ben said yet in identifying masterpiece he said whatever this nation is i am that's right so i landed on plymouth rock at a road with paul reveal i crossed the valley forge and in the icy river with george washington i was one of them american soldiers praise the lord that they didn't have any shoes to march against the british i had coffee that morning praise the lord then so in one way in reading this is uh again it's our way to naturally you know to to pledge our allegiance you know uh but there are some things that i'll share with you this morning by the help of the lord let me just go through this and he's identifying you know taking identity with uh with the natural land that god has given us this land this country that wants to as one of the greatest country in the world uh uh and and we know a lot of the parlor that uh runs uh between uh this country and in israel and all of that so he talks about this and uh uh [Music] when i wrap my feet i've seen washington come out of the wilderness wet plum to his ways from praying all night i was there when it happened as to with stonewall jackson when the opposition was great enough in the and as he goes on and on he takes a position with this with with uh he's assigned a declaration of independence with thomas jefferson i rang the liberty bell july 4th 1776 i identified with her in hashem of the revolution when brothers fought against brothers father against son i have to be identified with hashem praise the lord amen and when you understand this when you understand this it helps you to embrace some of the things that the critics who said about this message praise the lord because you can never stand with her glory unless you embrace hashem praise the lord because in an at work before they entered the hall of fame it must go through the heart of critics praise the lord there are many people that want to just be identified with the glory of america and never want to be identified with with a shame when it comes to regime then we talk about racist we talk about sexy we talk about the rest of everything but that's that's all what makes a nation that's what all that makes an individual i was there with thomas jefferson running the liberty bell identified with her in hashim of the revolution when brother fought against brother and fathers against son i have to be identified in hashem the same as i have to be identified in her glory that's exactly right i was awake island when all the soldiers lost their life i've seen them i've seen them when they took with alain i helped hosted the flag i've gone sent certainly all she was and all she ever they do all she is now i proudly say i'm a part of her because i'm glad to be an american to be a christian you must be the same amount praise the lord amen you must be the same if i'm a christian then i preach the gospel 120 years with noah and in his judgment i was with moses at the burning bush and the crossing of the red sea joshua at the word of jericho and when the captain of the lord host met him i was with the judges i was with the kings i was in the books of the prophets i'm identified with him in his death praise the lord i died with him when he died at calvary and that's why paul says in romans chapter 6 shall we continue in sin that grace might abound knowing that there are many of us that were baptized were baptized in his death praise the lord amen i mean you can take the church name you can claim to be a a christian and identify with a denomination but if you were not baptized if you never took on the name of jesus christ in baptism you are not identified with his death praise the lord to have a promise of a resurrection you must have an identification of a death and burial praise the lord i'm identified in his death i die with him when he died at calvary i rose again on easter morning with him in the power of his resurrection i'm a witness of it tonight i die with him at calvary raised with him on easter hallelujah to be a part of him i had to be identified with him i identify with him in his death identify with him in his suffering amen praise the lord and peter taught us james as well taught us that's why we go through trials is to be identified with him in his suffering praise the lord amen we go through trials and different trials of our life sometimes you think that it is it is you that god is taking an issue with no it's not you you are just partaking you are partaking of his suffering praise the lord it's not your suffering it's his suffering and you are just partaking of faith and sometimes we complain as if it is our suffering i'm suffering too much it's not your suffering it's his suffering praise the lord identify with him in suffering i was with him there in death raised with him in the resurrection and i was with 120 that claim up into the opera room i witnessed the mighty russian wing coming from heaven praise the lord in the book of romans paul taught the same you see everything that god does god paul in the book of hebrews said god works were finished from the foundation of the word which of course we know that foundation of the world was in god's mind because he thought of everything before he made it praise the lord so he said that so when god thought of everything in his mind the way he could do it to display it was by representation praise the lord amen he he set up setting individuals let me see that way and then he did representation now you will see in romans that's the reason why paul said by one man's sin we were all condemned representation and by the death of one man we are being redeemed praise the lord so everything that's the reason why uh god put the heavenly bodies the son to be able to govern the bottom in life and when he did the moon and the stars they were able to to to to control life that we don't see [Music] the moon and a star they control the ties of the sea praise the lord amen so the control life that we don't see why the sun controls the visible life the plants the flower the fruits and everything we can see it glory be to god are we together so you see that's that's the way that god designed his creation he designed it that way praise the lord amen also when you when you even bring it into time you will realize that uh the the the uh uh you know you talk about you talk about miracle you talk about healing you talk about the things that happen the wonders that happen the work of jesus christ you know when those things happen we give glory to god because we know that is the work of jesus christ but you see the power of the church the power of the gathering of the saints control the unseen word they control the unseen word the devil and his demons know that we are not yet this morning to play church they know that we are not striving to a religion there is one reason why we are here is because of this bleeding word saturn knows that he knows when a man is playing church and he knows when a man has a conviction so you see that's the reason why jesus says i will build my church and the gifts of hell the unseen powers of hell will never prevail against it praise the lord oh my so we are identified this morning amen but for the just for the a little message i want to use a statement i want to use a statement of uh theodore roosevelt april 23 1910 he was over in france just after he came out of power 1909 he was traveling the world and it was over in france and he gave a speech that is called the citizen in the republic praise the lord this will give us a full side of something i want for us to look at a little bit since we are talking since his independence let's talk about the man that fought for independence [Laughter] praise the lord left fought for the men talking about a man that fought for independence amen and then we were talking about the captain of all captain amen he fought for our independence praise the lord but mr roosevelt said this he says it is not the critics who count not the man who point out how the strong man stumble oh we're the doer of these who have done them better praise the lord you know it's the guy that is in the stand that knows how to play the game better than the guy that is on the page are you supposed to pass the bar the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena so i'm going to speak about the man in the arena the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the fight the credit belongs to the man who is actually going through the trial the credit belongs to the woman that is going through whatever you are going through praise the lord the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena who face is mild by dust and sweat and blood praise the lord who strife heavenly who earth who comes shot again and again hallelujah because there is no effort with our error or shortcoming but but who does actually strive to do the day who knows every time i read this it's it's just it just it do something special to me praise the lord the man in the arena praise the lord he was called the citizen of of a republic when he made a speech but then they turn it the brain into the man in the arena that's that's what is known all through the years the man who spent himself in warfare cause who are the best knows in the end the triumph is hard achievement and who are the worst if if he failed at least feel what daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid soul who never know victory no defeat you got to be in a fight for you to know victory or defeat you don't know it by reading books you don't know victory and defeat by listening to tapes you got to be in the fight for you to know victory or defeat amen praise the lord so i speak on the man in the arena but before that i will read this clause of thomas jefferson in the declaration of independence we hold this truth to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with setting on uh alienable rights that among these alive liberty in the pursuit of happiness and i came across this other statement that he made many years after thomas jefferson again he says indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever commerce between man and slave you know you think about this it helps you to see the frame of mind that those men live in we are in a society they have straighted no longer no matter how the people cry for liberty than cry for right they are now honored the right inspiration they can run down the street and stream for every right and and and throw money man down and says all of these people were slave master they are not in the right frame of mind because they are not under the right anointing none of these men were ever in the arena he said i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just in his justice do not sleep praise the lord [Music] so this morning we want to talk on the man that in the arena i have a uh a devotional that i bought some time ago it's called wall and picnic you know yeah brother branham says we are not on a picnic we're on a battlefield and sometimes i think in my mind that he you know he got that inspiration from some of these materials you'll realize that even this one bro we we say brother branham said you know he says if god do not judge this country he will raise up sutton and gomorrah do you realize that statement was actually a billigram that said it if you set your message you will see brother branham quoting billy graham but it turned to be like you know message preachers we just think that brother branham said everything praise the lord we think that he said everything hallelujah he was a man with his poor education he loved to read hallelujah are we together glory be to god now reading this uh uh uh um identifying with the usa that there's this uh there's a there's there's a phrase here that came up uh in this in this portion of the quote what brother branham says i was there when it happened as to with stonewall jackson stonewall jackson you know uh got the name stonewall because of the brave heart that he had praise the lord but when you read the story you realize that the brigade general that was leading his team taught that he was a cow for the matter of fact stonewall jackson uh they call him they have a name here because general thomas jackson that was his name was the artillery teacher at virginia military institute known as the rage he was a boring instructor he was given the name the nickname tom food he was giving the name the nickname tongue food by his students behind his back but one time in uh 1861 general jackson was in the command there in virginia it was 10 miles away from the nation capital the smoke and the noise of the artillery was going on it was difficult to tell one from the other some of the rebels until uh you know the the the stall the the the uniform of the union officers so people were disguising and serving is hakutel there was another officer the brigade general benell b from south carolina and general b saw what was about to happen and told general jackson the enemy are driving us general jackson replied then sir we will give them the bonnet praise the lord we are talking about independence people just bear with me so uh general b exotic his troop to reform shouting there is jackson standing like a stone wall let us determine to die here or we will conquer rally behind virginia glory be to god and many times as the history goes general jackson just had a way of learning to say a prayer before he get into the battle so no matter how tough the battle was he could be right in the midst of a very serious firing and he would just stand there and pray that is bravery [Music] when you hear don't sign you run but for the man to just stand there and pray praise the lord and this general bee died in that battle and stonewall jackson was the one that saved the virginia army praise the lord so he name changed from tom full to stonewall jackson glory be to god amen i just think that whatever christian faith he had was very all to the people around him [Music] that when he stand to pray people just think he's being idle praise the lord as a general he must be running he must be giving instruction but i mean he just get himself in that condition praise the lord there's another account about a chaplain that was always you know he was very strong on predestination i love this one you know and one time they got into a fight and this uh young copper sodium saw the chaplain hiding behind the tree and he said he said stop praying why are you hiding i believe you are predestinated why are you hiding behind the tree the chaplain kept quiet he had to put his talk together he said boy i believe this tree was predestinated to be here [Music] amen i don't know what you were expecting today so glory be to god but we want to talk about the man in the arena glory be to god praise the lord because it's the man that is in the arena that the credit belongs to it's the man that is wearing the shoes that knows the pain at the one that is going through that i mean you can have all the smart idea praise the lord and all the wonderful advices but it's the one that is going through the one that is in the midst of them i found another statement here of john f kennedy it was a statement in his inauguration speech that was also highly appreciated when he said the importance of civil action and public service he says ask not what your country can do for you ask yourself what you can do for your country and he challenged every every american to contribute in some way to the public good amen let me let me drive this with a little bit you realize that the forni fathers never brought a democracy to this country what actually they fought for was a republic and there is a difference between the republic and the democracy praise the lord a republic is a state in which supreme power is held by the people and they are elected representative democracy is assist him that's what i want for you to see a system is a system praise the lord amen this man can be in that party and this other person in as long as net as long as we are not democrat is not right amen as long as we are not republican and republican are doing it it's not right it's a system [Music] is the system that govern the people you will see the very same thing when you come to understand how denominationalism work it's a system that is the difference let me show you a scripture isaiah chapter 33 verse 22. the lord is our judge the lord is our lord giver the lord is our king and he will save us do you realize that the three branches of government is represented in thee praise the lord the lord is our george that is the judiary government branch of government the lord is our lawmaker the legislative branch of government the lord is our king that is the highest office the executive branch of government it goes to show that the men there designed these things with god fearing heart and the earnesty that they hold in their hearts to be able to serve the people was honor inspiration they might have not have known this scripture i don't know if they knew it or not but just to show the prophet isaiah said this hundreds of years before those men came here but just to be able to see that they were able to break the governance of the people and it fits right into scripture it shows where their heart was their heart was to save the people not to push their agenda but to self the people praise the lord is the man that's in the arena the credit goes to praise the lord people want to get on the internet and i mean they want to see whatever they want to see about the message they want to say whatever they need and whatever their grandparent told them whatever they read whatever they search out i mean it's their business this is what i've always said now studying this morning i came across something and i read it was really a blessing to me because my mind has always channeled in that way and and is this you can never be able to destroy what you have believed now this is what people don't know about belief belief is more than a mental thing belief is something that lies in your subconscious yes and more and more of the real thing of life and the real thing that concerns you lie in your subconscious [Music] praise the lord that's the reason why the first time you told a lie the first time you drink the first time you did things anything you never forget about it why because it goes and resident in your subconscious even if you you ask the lord for forgiveness the law forgive you but it does not leave you why because that is an important truth of your life [Music] nobody can come and tell you anything different because you were there you knew what happened so you see it is it is much easier for you to say it like the way it happened so what happened is that you are bringing this natural body to merge with that truth that is lying in your subconscious because if you don't see it the way it happened every time you say you were jack because your subconscious is witnessing that what you are saying is not true every time you say you you shiver or you look over your shoulder it shows that there is there is there is a problem in the image it can be the most horrible thing you might say it people will sit down they might be angry with you they will frying up with you and and this but the peace that you feel with inside can never be expressed your subconscious holds your reality praise the lord so for you to for you to destroy what you believe the best way to do it is to find something better is to find something better praise the lord oh that's the reason why we can we can we can talk about our past life we can condemn sin you we we can say why because we have found something better the life of christ is better than our first birth praise the lord amen it's not it's not difficult for us to go down into our family past and talk about some family strengths and family habits in my family that like to see they like to lie it's not hard to do that because you have found something that is better when you find people trying to protect family integrity the fountain of the new birth needs to flow down that stream [Laughter] if they start struggling to to protect family and if you cannot find something that is better you always be fighting what you have known to be the truth [Music] you'll always be fight you'll be looking in there for error you'll just be looking for one error or another error because you are not actually living that thing because it has been part of you praise the lord let me give you a good story or a good scene a scene in teenage life boy grow up and know that this is his dying you know his father as a young boy you know the kickball they run around and and uh the dad said papi he said yes daddy he wronged when he started getting out to a teenage life he's he's trying to look for personal identity [Music] and looking for that personal identity sometimes he rebelled against the principle he was taught peer pressure clicks in but the truth about the mata there is that there is no way he can wipe out his parents the truth about the matada is that the gene of that man a woman still flows through down his being even though he's struggling with the way i don't want to be like damn i mean yeah life is just boring man those are the little people that you're boring so he gets into that struggle and he's looking around that and sees yeah i mean yeah they don't have this and they don't have this he's looking for but he's not going anywhere because it took 23 chromosomes here 23 chromosomes here the doctor is in the house if i'm wrong you meet me in the office praise the lord he's not going anywhere that that child is not going anywhere you see and that is the reason why the parent reaction to that child is not to fight with them [Music] you just have to believe that they are not going anywhere unless you stole that child from the hospital but if you are the one that gave birth to that child you have to believe that they are not going anywhere oh praise the lord i'm talking about a man that is in the arena the one that is going through it glory be to god amen my my my mind you will either have to find something better and if that which you have find is truth it will cut you away from all your error because the word corrects the error amen it will just slay you away from all your errors and it starts to bring you transform you into that truth praise the lord amen and that's the reason why you find people over the years uh i mean the the they believe the law they are trying to walk into into uh into light and the fullness of life but but they are just some things they've been taught that is just invalid in their subconscious it's so hard for them to get away from it praise the lord you you i mean they read the word you show them the word and say oh i see it brother you know i see it but that thing is just there yes sir so for that individual to become a personal battle that they have to fight as they go along the glory there is that the way you can know that god is on your side is when he has identified that thing god picking up something in your life or exposing something in your life is not to embarrass you it's god's way to identify himself with your struggle praise the lord is his way to identify himself which means he has got in the fight with you because redemption is a partnership amen he has brought us to a partnership he paid the price he want us to push the enemy out of the lane and he never left us to us alone praise the lord amen he ever said that he's telling joshua everywhere the soul of your feet shall stand i have given it to you but yet they will have to fight for every inch of ground and god never left him alone he said i would send hornets to fight for you i'll send my angel before you and even god became a man the captain of the lord host he put himself in the battle praise the lord amen that's why he told joshua to be courageous he put himself in the battle he never just understand there and say oh i have given you the land go and take it go and take care of it no no no no no and that is the same thing with this land that he have given us this promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as the lord our god shall call he never left us alone he's in the fight with us [Music] and the way you can see him is when he has identified something in your life that you need to work on that's how god show up he marks himself behind that praise the lord so don't don't get mad with the preacher don't get mad with the holy spirit just lift your hand say thank you jesus i know you said you will never leave me you will never forsake me amen that man did not have no idea but i know you are the one sticking with me you want to rip this thing out of my life praise the lord oh i mean serving god that way it is just so sweet amen because you have the holy ghost walking with you every day he's the messenger of this hour amen he is the messenger of this hour praise the lord oh my we were just studying uh uh down the seventh week and playing through the tapes here there was something that is that was particular to daniel 7 to wheat and water was the reason why dog that gabriel came and brought the instruction to down here was all about returning the people toward their homeland amen the 70 weeks i mean just described events that were happy but the important thing of the visitation of the angel was to return the people to their homeland sometimes we get caught up in the dates we get caught up in the things that were happening the antichrist and the the marks of oman and order but the important the reason why he said gabra and now you think about it now why the king of peshawar fought against that visit because it was about returning the people toward their homeland and one thing the devil don't want you to get back to is to your homeland he want to have you as a stranger rumbling about never identify your inheritance never identify never come to rest because the promise of the homeland was to bring the people to rest i mean he can get you work up like a church member on the road seven days a week to church as long as you are not having rest you are not at a place of rest in your walk with god praise the lord he can just walk you out from one church to another church from one belief to another billy from one thing to you just walk up and then you i mean all over the place one thing he don't want to bring the people to when gabriel was bringing that message to daniel it was all the major principle fame of that message was the return to the homeland praise the lord their return to the homeland scholars can argue they can say whatever they want to say but israel is in their homeland praise the lord israel is in their homeland and see how god will do it how god will do it we know the mysterious end of the wall wall amen we know the mysterious end how he ended general i'll be and his name was mistaken to the arabs as allah so when he heard that the allah was coming to surrender it was a mysterious end praise the lord now you think about it in a local history just in that same period of time when israel was declared as an independent lane a hitler and messily and all these people started rising amen carrying jews to the gas chamber persecuting jews why was that happening because now the homeland was liberated god wanted them to go back home [Music] so now he's creating a pressure and that is the same promise to the church the same way political pressure led israel back to her homeland spiritual pressure is going to put this bra on her two feet spiritual pressure praise the lord amen when you realize that uh all doctrines has failed amen you realize that church is just a gathering place for us to encourage ourselves is not really the absolute the absolute is jesus christ the absolute is the word of god this word of god coming from out of the pages of the bible becoming personal to you praise the lord we have tried to build big churches but we just realized that we have have a lot of crows makes with the eagles praise the lord and many men are scripting unaware like the apostle will say to spy out our liberty so the mission is not a it's not a it's not a big church the mission is the word of god becoming personal to you the word on two feet [Music] political pressure drew israel back to their homeland spiritual pressure when you when you start seeing dryness everywhere amen it used to be where people used to hover on a church atmosphere you come to the church they play the music we dance we praise the lord oh the anointing was there it's just like wasting water on the dog's back as soon as you shake yourself it's gone you get back in the week where was the revival praise the lord and gradually we're realizing that spirit is be beginning to lift up off the earth now he that is holy will remain holy still and he that is filthy will remain filtered still praise the lord when those hours comes then it's time where you need this word to become a person the word has taken every form it's now in your cellphone it's in your our part it's in every form but the progression is to be made flesh and that's why god did in the creation he started creating things but the real achievement was to make a man in his image because god wanted to become flesh that is the progression of the word that is the aim of the gospel because this is not a story that is not a theory we are serving a living christ and one day we will ring with him we will walk with him he will be in a body form it's not a story it's not just an imagination it's not a concept to just draw people together praise the lord young people that's the reason why over and over i encourage you to stay in the word read your bible you will never understand this message if you're not reading your bible praise the lord this message has never come to take the place of the bible i will prove to you by history every cut has been successful to get the bible from the people and introduce their concept every cut has been successful so if you put this bible aside and you think you can live on the on the message on the tip in the box you have just breathed yourself into a cart the man in the arena there's a story of a little woman here oh praise the lord she was not a military woman she was a nurse praise the lord and the little story goes about this woman where where does real authority comes from in the civil war there was a chain of command for both armies and authorities flow down from above beginning from the com the commanding in chief to the general the the culinary the captains and so on but sometimes the brides didn't have as much authority as they thought they have there was a chief nurse named mary ann she was called maryland and she was known to thousands of wounded soldiers as uh mother miriam who was not respected of rank or prestige when it came to providing proper care for the ordinary soldier she frequently flood military rules and regulations she was known to offer sharp words for officers who failed to care for their men general sherman received a complaint from his staff about her about her about her in subordination [Music] and disregard for military protocol general sherman struggled and he said i can't reply you she has more power than i she ranked me that's the way he said it she rank me glory be to god she was not recruited by the army she never went on training base praise the lord we are talking about independence people a furious warrior the scholarship georgia to acknowledge that he was powerless in her presence earned her authority when she entered the military incoming at cairo near the beginning of the war it might be said that she attacked it a way a general ma attack his fault she went through the cam and immediately she began to correct and improve the condition praise the lord she got into the camp seeing all these men lying with wounds all over them what is the need of going for protocol and that let the general sign the people she got there and she started giving command she started giving com she took charge of the situation she was the woman in the arena amen praise the lord oh you find people well nobody told me nobody told me praise the lord no sense of responsibility we want to be told everything it's all because we are using our ears and not using our heart to listen because if you're using your heart to listen you will listen when the holy ghost speak she talked the situation in charge i know what it is during the military war when there is no medication that was my first mission field back 1993 i was not going i just went to the hospital and just you just you just see the conditioned men lying there wounded crying of paints broken legs broken arm she took the situation under control whether you were a general whether you were the president she gave you command when it comes to caregiving when the person needed to be taken care of she tell you you pick him up she was the woman in the arena [Music] praise the lord many men who have just bled to to death to the kuhalar on this on on the stretcher waiting from command to come from the commander and they should sign this paper before they take him for treatment he will have just laid it and die but when she stepped into the camp she took the situation under control praise the lord until whether it was a general or not they all knew that she had a higher power praise the lord she had a higher power so am i waiting for special ministry to be able to help a falling brother to be able to encourage a sinner on the street you don't need permission from me i don't have it to give it to you what are you what are we doing with people dying around us young people on drugs young women roaming into prostitution what are you doing are you waiting for the vision or the strange spirit to come running down your spine this was a little woman all she has was she was a nurse and with what she heard and what she knows she will not stay there and allowed men and young men to lose their lives oh god gave us some miriams today praise the lord it's the man that is in the arena we all can say his best if i was the one this is what i would do and that's not what i would do we can say it best and use the right proper grammar and then look for the verb and advert and make everything sound nice but the credit goes to the man or the woman that is in the heat a young woman trying to stand for god with all she knows living for god how many times we come around and encourage instead of criticizing praise the lord you don't know what our person is dealing with in their spirit in their mind the floss of touch that is coming to them with everything they see that other teenagers are doing and the only thing that they can hotel is because there is something supernaturally holding them something supernaturally holding them that would not allow them to take a cigarette between their finger or will not allow them to defy themselves what is holding them they don't even know because they have the desire to do it they just want to do it but something supernaturally is holding them it's not you being tough you go for the modifier you not off it's not you being tough if you are tough carry your toughness on your knees that's where toughness is seen it's on the knees when you wake up with your pain stored because you were crying on your knees crying to god that's toughness amen the man in the arena praise the lord amen one day was our lord jesus we can talk about different bible character david one time got caught in the arena not even not known to himself he was not looking for the name he was just only caring for his brothers he took food for them to eat and he got caught into the arena goliath standing on the field and all the ahmed of israel hiding himself away he was the man in the arena he says who is this uncircumcised it takes a lot of courage it takes conviction he has experienced god delivering bear a lion in his presence he had an experience with god he was not looking for a brother brandon saying 1965 and let me go to the table he was in he was in action who is this uncircumcised philistine to tarnish the name of almighty god you know what he did he put god in the challenge he said god is your name it's your name that is at stake and that's the reason why we fail all the time because we are looking for the name we want people to know our name if you put god's name to the state god will defend his name and that's what david doe that's what he did defy the name of the almighty god he was the man in the arena oh saul said you are a little boy they criticize him his brother said this boy is too nutty get him away from here but he was the man that had the birthday he was the man that had the burden and if he was going to cost his life he was ready to give his life i'd rather die than to see the name of god be blasphemed amen glory be to god one time he was our lord jesus he was the man god himself in flesh was the man in the arena praise the lord when he healed the sake and raised the dead to all praise him but when he started to identify himself with scripture they said he hired devil on him praise the lord but he was the man in the arena he had to stand alone even when all his disciples denied and rejected him because he was prophesied he would be rejected he had to stand alone he was a man in the arena when three cross were on cavalry golgotha he was the man in the arena even in his death he was still giving life tomorrow you'll be with me in paradise even in death he was still giving life yes glory be to god praise the lord and when he resurrected on the day of pentecost he poured his spirit back on the church you know what he was what he was looking for he was looking for tight teams he said this time i'm not going alone i need tight teams he tap your hand and say go in and fight if you can't make it come back and give me the tap i will get into the battle that's why he poured his spirit to be able to get a tight team and he redeemed every one of us for us to get in the fight praise the lord and some just enjoy staying on the touchline when it's supposed to be in the ring they get on the touch line and their voice is loud he didn't hit him not knocking he's looking at you and looking at me to be the one in the arena in this age praise the lord he's expecting you and me to be the one in the arena in this age fighting out devils yes doing all we can to be a life of example not looking at people on the street and criticizing them amen if you can just meet one and just say god bless you if you don't have nothing to say just say god bless you musicians you can come i realize if i get in my notes will not leave from here today praise the lord hallelujah he's looking at me and you to be the one in the arena we get so scared we don't want to fail and because we don't want to fail we start ascribing to people's ideas what this person think and what this other person think and pretty soon we don't we don't have no conviction of ourself we want to please this person we want to please that person it's all because we're struggling in [Music] ourselves praise the lord but you see like the apostle paul says he said we are more than conquerors [Music] being more than conquerors means that [Music] a victory has been attributed a victory has been imputed unto us jesus imputed his victory unto us you don't need nothing more than that you don't need nothing more than jesus victory [Music] you don't need no oppression or victory for any person or glory because all he's going to do is just going to stick prayer right at the back of your neck he has already imputed victory to us so whether in defeat or in victory we are victorious praise the lord but you see that's that is that little thing that makes people to stick and sin and stick in wrong because we are we are afraid to be looked at as a failure to say oh i tried to witness to this person it never came to the lord maybe i need to go study my bible more no all you need to do is just fall in love with jesus love him all the time whenever you tried and you feel loving more [Music] that's the problem with the church that's the problem with the last this church failure has killed the church because it looks like we are not winning souls

they can keep the people is to turn them loose to the arms of the devil it's not the critics that count now the man i point out how the strong man stumble we can talk about this brother fall we can
