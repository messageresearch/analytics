him born to worship him is that what you feel like you're here for I didn't just happen upon this you didn't just happen upon this God thought of you before the world began there aren't enough devils and all of hell and Johnson City and there's a bunch in Johnson City to keep us out of the program of God and somebody said God bless you let's turn together tonight the book of First Corinthians chapter 12 if you would the Gucci tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus thank God for all that he means to us all of his blessings and all the things that he's done for all of us imagine whenever the Jewish Christians begin to read what we are fixing to read together it must have just been a struggle for many of them to try to comprehend what Paul was conveying listen carefully for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say because I am not the odd I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling but now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him now you imagine you've been raised a Jew all your life so you've known sacrifice levitical law leverage law law law then you get saved and you hear this for your first time and this preacher is putting these new testament converts as the body of God and saying that they were the body of Christ and that they were like members you imagine them looking think you mean I'm like a finger or I'm like an ear or a nose on God you see the Old Testament could never produce such a relationship or such an understanding now you think you have a hard time and understanding this and that and the other you imagine coming out of Judaism wherever bit of it was Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not you shall not mix linen and Woodland on your garments don't sow two different kinds of seed in the same Row in your garden don't do this don't do that and then this man turns around and tell you you are baptized into the body of Jesus himself no matter what age you live in it still takes one access to God divine revelation amen Amy's glad for it tonight you'd like to be remembered as we go to the Lord in prayer him and he has a need a request brother Pete Lawson texted me before I came out a little bit ago I wanted us to pray for him tonight he's not been feeling very well developed a fever later in the day also I talked to brother Jerry Phillips today he certainly needs prayer in his body and also Brother Sam Clark uh brother Bobby Hayden had texts me about Brother Sam today and also brother Jerry so we certainly want to remember these these requests Heavenly Father we counted a great honor that we are part of the body of Christ we read it we've heard about it but I wonder sometimes it's the fullness of it really struck home to us what that means to be a part of your body I pray Lord that you would make it real to us tonight we know there's one way that we access into the very heart and mind of God and that is by you pulling us to yourself and revealing yourself to us as your Prophet is so well explained it to us and said Christ's way of making himself known to his church is by revelation so we could memorize the word we could even memorize the message we can listen to tapes so well that we can tell you what brother Branham is fixing to say and be as lost as we could be unless what we're hearing is divine revelation to us so I pray father that you would help us tonight once again we've gathered here they've put forth the effort many of them have worked today no doubt they're tired they had was pressed for time some of them had to cut short or suffer and this and that to be able to be here tonight so we've not just come to see one another we've not come for a protractive meeting but we've come to hear from heaven Lord God we're asking you that you would take the service and anoint us with your presence help me to move away out of us out of the side of the people even Lord God out of my own reasoning on my own thinking Lord God help me to be able to speak the words of God speak to us in our father be mindful of these sick ones that we've requested their names Lord and the hands that were uplifted signifying a need would you move form father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated heard some really good reports of the camp up in Ohio certainly appreciate what the Lord did up there amen certainly glad to be identified with a group of people around the world not just in America but around the world that have a living God that is among them read with me if you would in the Book of Romans chapter 12 verse 5. notice again now of of all the New Testament writers Paul was given by God a great understanding a greater understanding than any of the rest of the Apostles as far as the new births the blood the mystery of worship even of being baptized into the mystical body Peter wraps good things about it James writes good things Matthew Mark Luke and John not so much because it was not given to them but God endowed Paul with an understanding like none of the rest of the men in the apostolic age had and we thank God for that do we not because God wanted to give to him an understanding that would not just be beneficial for that age but it would be beneficial for many many hundreds of years and here we are two thousand years later still feasting on what gay God gave to our brother now listen to how he deals with this in Romans 12. so we being many are one body in Christ one body in Christ and every one members one of another so what Paul does is places us individually we're baptized by the Holy Ghost but we are baptized collectively now this is what the prophet says in our day that we are baptized individually but yet we are collectively the body of Christ so each one has their own experience each one has their own walk with God but yet we are not an island in that we don't need one another so Paul says it this way in the first century writing so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members of one another I think if that ever really struck our hearts right that we would treat one another different than what we do and I think it would make us to where we would want to be around one another more you know brother random talks about his church Arthur Branham Tabernacle whenever he was there there more and he said that preachers would come to him and ask him Billy how do you do that because then people would just love one another so much and whenever they would part like on Sunday night they had church on Sunday morning and Sunday night and Wednesday night and whenever they would leave church on Sunday night they would stand out front and stand around the back door and they would cry they would cry because they was going to be apart from one another from Sunday night to Wednesday night they couldn't hardly stand the thoughts of being away from one another just on Monday and Tuesday and they was going to be back together again on Wednesday night and perchers would ask him Billy how do you do that how do you get that love among them and there was so something about them and they was not just Longing To Be In God's Presence but they were longing to be in one another's presence well brother Ram tells us of course that it was the true gospel that he preached well I find it amazing that no doubt most of our message churches feel like that we're much deeper in the message than what that church was in those days but I wonder how many of our churches feel the same way about one another that they did then makes you wonder are we deeper or are we just deeper in our minds or are we really deeper in our experience and deeper in our soul but now remember Paul one of the early church to be able to understand that they were many and they were as diverse as we are today but yet one body in Christ and every one members one of another not just one was Christ but members one of another First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body me so also is Christ Now watch how he is identifying Christ with the human Visage identifying Christ with a human image identifying Christ notice he does not say Jesus because Jesus is of course on the throne of God Jesus is the personification of deity that sets on the throne of God God never had a permanent flesh body until Jesus come on the Earth but notice what what term Paul uses he does not say that we are members of Jesus but we are members of Christ what is Christ it is the anointed one Messiahs the anointed one so you and I are not baptized into the material flesh body of Jesus you understand that but we are baptized into the mystical body which is called Christ so that is the anointed one it was not it was not listen carefully Christos Christ that died for you the anointing cannot die it was the human Visage or human image of God which was Jesus now Jesus was of course given the titles of Lord and Christ this same Jesus hath God made both Lord and Christ but read your Bible real close and you'll notice he was not called that until after he rose from the dead now Jesus you never find him before his resurrection from the dead saying all power is given to me in heaven a nurse show it to me in your Bible he never said that I'm until after he raised from the dead he could not say it well Hallelujah he could not say all power is given unto me he could not say that until after he had raised from the dead well somebody say Amen then once he raised from the dead then he could stand and say all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth that could not be said in the Jesus form but it could be said in the Christos form it cannot be said of you even though you may be a seed before your new birth it cannot be said of you in reality I and my father are one until after you become the anointed one in this day do you understand the bride is the messiah of the hour I said I don't know what can you say that because she is the anointed one we are here in his stand the prophet of God said every God called preacher is called to stand in the very stead and the place of Jesus Christ is that quite a challenge or not but let me not limit it to a preacher because the preachers are not the only ones that are anointed by the Holy Ghost but every person you're denied men women boys girls whatever you are if you have the Holy Ghost in your soul you are called as as an anointed one to represent the Lord Jesus Christ himself and the church said notice Paul says for us the body is one and as many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is not Jesus but so also is Christians now you understand it's totally impossible for us to be baptized into the flesh body of Jesus it's impossible always I was washed in the blood and he dripped one drop of blood from me no that's symbolism there was only so much blood in the body of the Lord Jesus there was not enough blood in the chemistry of his body to have one drop for every human being that would ever be saved but the blood was taken as a symbol the token oh I know even some message people don't believe this but it don't matter to me what message people believe or don't believe the prophet of God taught us the token in this hour is is not the blood the token is the Holy Ghost because the token is the life now this is why many people think they're under the blood but they're not because they deny the very life that came out of the blood I know there's message preachers that preach that the blood is token there to Heaven went deep enough themselves but the spirit of God is the token and when I see that I will pass over you so it is the spirit of God that baptizes us into the mystical Body of Christ and that's why when you're in Christ Jesus and you pray and you may think well I'm nothing I'm nobody ever devil in hell is scared to death of you because what the devil sees and what the devil hears it's not your voice it's not your Humanity it's not your weakness it's not my weakness it's the mystical Body of Christ that's standing there oh Hallelujah notice in verse 27 now Paul said now ye are listen to this church now ye are the body of Christ now again not Jesus ye are the body of Christ and members in particular but notice in verse 28 it is God that sets us in our position in Christ and in the local assembly but now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him so he doesn't even ask you what do you want to be here's a multiple choice just pick out check to box whichever one you want to be you want to be a singer you want to be an organ player you want to be a deacon you want to be a trustee God is the one who sets that in the body so the mystery of our life really is us getting out of our self and thinking well I want to be this in the church and I want to do that and I want to do something else that that's really as no relevance to God but God wants us to go to him who brought us on the earth and say why did you bring me here what do you want me here for Lord I do believe it was you that sent me here to the Word of Life Church then what am I therefore am I there to be a preacher am I there to be a deacon and I know to be a special singer maybe my voice is not a special singing voice but I'll be a good back of voice in the choir maybe I'll write the songs that the choir sing I don't know what I'm supposed to do Lord but would you please let me know and it would say me and you a whole lot of trouble and brother Donnie too and everybody else I'm going to church with now won't you notice the word here that Paul used when he said but now God hath set it's the exact same word that Jesus used in Saint John 15 16. notice this now you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you now the word ordained in the Greek is the exact same word that Paul used for set so set and ordain are the exact same words so you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so then it is God that sets us in the body it is God that places us positionally just as God put our fingers where they belong as God put our toes so they belong on our ears or they belong and so on and so on and they are so designed by the Creator himself that they fit exactly so is it in the spiritual body notice in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 but all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will now notice this is not as you and I will so according to whose will the father again so the father May pick one man and he may give him this gift and that gift and another and the Lord may give one man my goodness a half a dozen gifts and him then come to his brother say natural Brethren the Flesh and he may come to him and he may give him one and it may be two out of a big old family and two of them be called to really serve God and then God may go to another family and give one man one gift and he may skip everybody else in that family and give somebody else another one so God is the one who places the gifts you believe that now whether it's a gift to sing whether it's a musical ability or whether it's a gift to preach or whatever it is God is the only one that can do it now can people within themselves desire to do something that they're not called to do absolutely now when you get into that it's where you move into great deception watch this in verse 28 and God has sat in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then gifts plural of healings helps governments diversities of tongues which means different kinds of tongues and every one of them is going to be placed in the body as God Wills now of course this is where Pentecost whenever they begin to cabbage down was the word that brother Brandon used whenever they begin to cabbage down that tongues was the evidence so then everybody according to them that got the Holy Ghost got tongues we're believing I was in Pentecost for several years and I prayed through many many people that got tongues but it didn't take me long to realize they didn't have the Holy Ghost but yet when they made that the initial evidence then Satan could impersonate I've seen it around the altarus many times and them all mamas and daddies some of you come from a Pentecostal background and that come up and pray for them and beat him on the back and shake them and say Jesus you got it brother you got it you got it and what did they get and then they got not a power to help them to overcome not a power that would help them overcome drinking and smoking and lying and so on and many of them turned away from God never to come back because of the ill teaching that they were taught well you got it and they said well I suppose they got the holy ghost at least they told me I did and I went right back out into the world again that's what Satan wants to do and if we're not careful then we will come and we made a new evidence now our new evidence and the message is well we believe God sent a prophet well if that's the evidence every devil in hell is saved because they met with him one on one many of them and you I guarantee you one thing you'll never find any of them Devils been on believe the sign the website you'll never find any of them Devil's been on YouTube You'll Never Find Them writing any books god Set Me Free from the message Hallelujah glory to God I'm so free them Devils met this prophet of God they were scared tea totally out of their minds well somebody's saying that so they wouldn't do such a thing is that the truth yet they believed that he was truly a servant of God just like they did the Lord Jesus We Know Thee thou Jesus our son of God and he commanded them that they should not make known who he was isn't it amazing that demons can identify righteous men when church people will sit there and call them false wow so God does this in his own sovereignty and he places them according to the Divine abilities given to them by God so as God placed it in the natural body so God places it in the mystical body and each person really ought to be content was what God gave them now we face the facts some will never be what others are some will never be the great singers that others are yet they sing and they're a blessing and others will never be as talented on the piano or the organ and yet they should not even compare themselves well I wish everybody would clap as loud for me as they do for brother so and so but they just kind of do this when I sing well at least you're getting that much out of them are you doing it for them are you doing it for the Lord who are you doing it for well come on I I believe that some folks are doing it for people we don't want to do it for one another we want to do it for God now what you notice in question answers 1961. someone said to me not long ago the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach and so I really think it's so Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and I want you to listen what the devil will try to do the devil will try to deceive a man well women too of course if you believe in women preachers but he will try to deceive a man to make him think he's called to preach when in reality he ain't called at all now you're talking about a tricky thing notice if you can get somebody to act like that and then deceive them so can you imagine then a person can actually be deceived a man a man just so deceived and he feels like he's called to preach and then he will go preach and he will study and he gets under this burden and he will his wife will get under this family will get under the church that he attends will get under it the pastor that he sets under will get under it because the pastor will have to make room for him to see if he's really called a preach or not God don't tell me I don't know I don't know the young men come to me but only I think I'm called to preach the only thing I don't do is just try to make her inform and see if they are if he ain't so if you're dealing with them for six months nine months a year a year and a half two years and you give up and forfeit this service and that service and that service and once you wind up looking at and realizing with some of them they were not even called in the first place they were deceived not were they trying to deceive anybody else no they were not trying to be Wicked they were not trying to be condemning or nothing like that they actually thought those young men sitting right here that I've talked to in our church and they come to me many of them years ago and felt like they were called to preach and I would just go through the best that I knew look brother God's called you it'll be this and this and explain it if I was you I'd blate and I'd pray and they'd come back to me a month later six weeks later brother Donny you know what I did exactly what you told me to do I don't believe it's the Lord I don't believe it is I tell them look if it's God calling you you ain't going to get away from it he'll haunt you he'll torment you you won't get away from it so if you can get away from it leave it alone because you wasn't called in the first place well come on somebody say Amen if it's a real Call of God God ain't going to tell me to tell your mama to tell your daddy to tell your third cousin and then he'll tell your wife and then they'll tell you if God's calls you God will call you come on somebody God's gonna call you look God verified by others yes he will and God will let on other people's hearts absolutely and God can tell them look brother you've got a gift sir but if God's calling you God's going to deal with you first thank you Jesus now notice the prophet said see Satan can do somebody act like that that deceives them that's what he wants to do then the whole world points their finger right there somebody thinks they have the gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation some has the gift of Divine Healing somebody else thinks look at him sometimes they're mistaken mistaken in those things and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have so it's very tricky so a person could be called to preach and the devil tell them that and a person not called to preach and the devil telling them there is Lord have mercy by the done how in the world does a person judge it paragraph 52. so always do this Brethren when you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out if it's scripture for you to do it well the Lord called me to do this and other well is there scripture for what you say God calls you to do now not just in one place but also the Bible well don't sit there and look at me about God I'm fixing to read it to you if it's in the scriptures not just wrote in one place but I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it oh my goodness you mean a person then that's really called of God they will see themself and Jeremiah's call they will see themselves when they read about Peter being called you see they will so identify with themselves you know but I've had young men to come and talk to me before and their brother Donnie I'm thinking maybe I might be called to preach well brother tell me how it happened well I'll tell you what brother Donnie I I was sitting there reading my Bible before church and you wouldn't you know it you got up there and you read that from the same text and you started preaching from that same text and I say brother that happens to my wife so does that mean she's called to how many does that happen to you oh dear lord some of our women are raising their hands oh no Jesus well that don't mean you're called to preach that means we're in the same same unction of the Holy Ghost don't that mean something special to you when that happens to you of course it does it blesses your heart that's not a call of God I bet young men and come and talk to me I'm not sure why I'm going this way now but I'm gonna do it uh young men and come to my brother Donnie I'm just saying the Lord's call me well brother you know what have you been doing I've done got 37 sermons prepared brother Donnie that is not an individual seeking the mind of God that is an individual that is convinced before they ever even come and talk to their pastor which according to the message is contrary to what you're taught to do if you ever feel led to do something then he said put it with a word and consult your pastor amen amen not after you've made up your mind well I know folks don't believe that quote but what if it's right and you don't follow it Mama now watch I love the way brother Remnant explains it says that then usually he said yourself an evangelist or a pastor a teacher Prophet whatever God might have called you to DC but if you have the gift of Tom's interpretation of tongues any of the non-spiritual gifts in the church four spiritual offices any position saying then usually the way I watch it for myself now watch how he looked at it this is me I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing see God will work with his creature the way he's made him now if you see a man real flighty going on and he said the Lord call me for such and such to be a pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty person and the church said the pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor's solid sound but I find it so amazing some of the men that I know in the message that have become pastors and their Pastor has to encourage them to even attend church Faithfully because they get discouraged and get down and and get so all worn out and then that's that kind of man becomes a pastor wow I find that very strange myself if you're down just being an evangelist I hate to think what you're going to be when you become a pastor God called me to be a teacher now watch this is so simple God called me to be a teacher watch him how he interprets the word he gets it all mixed up and everything then you can tell sometimes I wonder friends how many preachers in this message are even God called you know what I judge it by these quotes how many of them have made the office messes that ever was come on somebody say amen and they interpret the word this way and they cause a big big split and the message and you know part of them go this way and part of them go that way a god-called teacher ain't going to do no such nonsense um but then the thing to do your position is usually known whether you can do it or not wow that is good good understanding it now when God called me to be an evangelist I wanted to be a pastor wow you mean God called brother render to be one's hand brother brown one to be something else I'm guilty too God called me the very preacher I said no I don't want be no preacher did he did him listen to me and then whenever he called me to preach he didn't even say now look I've got five foes here which one you want and everyone left his shoes off I said God this ain't even fair I mean you don't even give me a choice and then you've got all these different aspects of the ministry I could entertain you don't even write me choose that the order this ain't even fair at all you see when you're really called of God it's not something that you yourself want to do a man who wants to do it nine times out of ten ain't called in the first place a real servant of God runs from the call well praise the Lord when God called me to be an evangelist I wanted to be a pastor and I thought staying at home here would be just five wow now let me skip a little bit and go down a little further on the quote here my calling was an evangelist now this morning Lane right here on the cornerstone if we could burst in there tonight you'll see a fly leaf off of my Bible where he told me to be an evangelist and I wasn't a successful pastor now you won't hear this quote quoted I realize but when God called me to preach the message I can preach the whole thing you see headquarters never call me no group of message people never call me God call me so I'm gonna read quotes like this I wasn't a successful pastor anybody in here brave enough to read it with me never ah and yet some of the folks in the message now say brother Brandon was their pastor so how in the world can a man from the sixth Dimension Pastor those of us who are still in these dimensions so how long has it been since you've seen your pastor anyway how long has it been since you consulted with your pastor how long has it been now the prophet tells you according to the message whenever you feel led to do something put it with the word of God and consult your pastor so that puts you in a real bind does it not then whenever you get ready to make a decision a business decision family decision whatever tell me how that works that you're able to be transported into the sixth Dimension to consult with your pastor and then come back down to the Earth and get the answer now you see where that come from men that are interpreting God's word and making lies out of the truth well amen now notice he said never would be because I haven't got the patience oh so it takes patience to be a pastor takes patience notice he don't say tongues healing Miracles patience now is healing important yes it's Miracle is important yes but I want you to notice the main thing that he focuses on that a pastor must have patience and God not only calls him but he calls his wife right along with it you all know that already by being here part of this ministry right because I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a pastor so those who believe that brother Branham fulfilled all five and all the rest of us preachers ought to set down you are a liar and if you don't get that evil devil off of you you're going to be lost because that devil anointing you is speaking contrary to the scripture and contrary to the message [Applause] now push play in obey I don't know why it is but when I push play I come up with quotes like this well Hallelujah now he said so therefore if I tried to be a pastor I'd be just as far out as a pastor trying to be an evangelist you see what I mean you can see the way the Lord calls you what your position is in the body and the church said now let us run a parallel tonight by the help of the Lord we'll jump back into the book of Exodus if you'd like to turn up with me we can read it up on the screen in the book of Exodus chapter 31 and I like to run a parallel if the Lord will help me on god-giving just instructions and design an architectural ability to certain men to be able to build the Tabernacle of God now let me say this right up front for those who are here tonight and those that will stream this service and those that may archive it later for those of you who have this narrow narrow view that the Tabernacle in the wilderness was just this makeshift something that was maybe a 40 by 60 tenth and a had a few tent poles on the side and it was just thrown up on the side I hate to tell you but I think I'll go ahead and tell you right up front you are sadly mistaken you see many people feel like that in order for God to move in a church you've got to be in a storefront and your windows have got to be busted out and you can throw a tomcat through the door you know and there's 40 blowing there in the wintertime and we're all sitting there freezing to death and they identify that as humility you need to read your Bible come on somebody Now watch how that God is has told Moses and he's given the revelation of what kind of place God wants and God told him prior to this let them make me a sanctuary that I can come down and be among them now remember these were slaves so they had had some ability no doubt back in the land of Egypt but watch what God is fixing to do and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Exodus 31 1. see I have called by name I can't watch God this is God's first Tabernacle on the earth and it's going to foreshadow Solomon's simple it's going to foreshadow also the mystical body which we are part of tonight so God is going to build have them to build for him a tabernacle and God's going to use human beings to do it but he don't want them to stand in line for volunteers who wants to be the engraver who wants to be the Weaver who wants to be this but I want you to notice what God does God starts this whole thing out by calling men and he calls them by name you so I'm talking about a genuine call now you see that it would not be no strange thing when the Lord Jesus comes on the earth and whenever he's going to establish his mystical body that he would get on the earth and he would call men Peter Andrew James John Bartholomew sadius Judas right what'd he do call them by name don't you understand it's a new building program God so watch what God did God spoke this man's name so this man was called by God amen I have called by name the son of your eye the son of her of the tribe of Judah so what is this man getting a Divine call so this man is not seeking after it this man did not necessarily want it but God calls him now we don't know much about this man whether he even had a whole lot of abilities or not but a Divine gift always have attributes of the Divine call so what does this man give he gets a Divine call every God call man has a Divine call some were sent and some just went well some of mama called them some of them Daddy call them and some of them the wife called them well so the Lord called him also according to Exodus chapter 35 verse 30 the Lord called him so the Lord does the deciding and the Lord does the calling now men might try to presume upon that and think well that's what I'd like to be I'd like to be a preacher oh my goodness I'd like to be an evangelist I'd like to be this or that the other but that's not the way that it works and it was not only a Divine call but a distinct call it was not something that the man would ever be able to get away from this man would never be the same again God is going to impart to this man he's going to be able to devise curious things now watch this God call man he's going to be given Enlightenment on metallurgical abilities now apparently the man didn't have it before God is going to give this man and what the Hebrew words are that is used is the mind of a genius God is going to give this man the ability to be able to carve and work on metal and do this and that and the other now as I said the Bible doesn't say that the man who had to do it before so we're told then who was called and now we're being shown what he's called to do Amen to devise curious works so it sums up all the work that's going to be involved in the Tabernacle so God not only decides who's going to do it but what they're going to do and then you've got the capability of the call so God calls this man now it's up to God to give the man the ability of what he needs to carry it out no doubt these people had done some of these things in the land of Egypt but told my thought there and I'll read it to you in a moment when God calls God enables when God sins God anoints when God gives you something God will give you the backbone of a ramrod that's what you need you'll stand there if you've got to stand by yourself and people will look at you and think how in the world can you do it and you'll even ask yourself the same question but when God calls God gives ability when God calls God enables when God sends you he goes with you amen and if you like capability in the area that you're professing that you're called to do it's either one of two things either you're not called to do it or you've been delinquent delinquent and being able to hook up with the right channel of God or maybe refusing guidance from some Elders that's been around for a long time I know we despise all that we hate all that we're so much against organization we're against organism I said it to you several months ago but I'll say it again you look in the Bible and you show me where preachers went out from the original Church in Jerusalem on their own I challenged anybody preacher Deacon trustee anybody show me where any preacher lit out on his own show me but they sent them Force they sent them forth they never went out on their own well I feel they had to go over here and I feel led to go over there they were sick from the church well come on children read your Bible into the book of Acts they didn't do it on their own and rebel if the church didn't send you forward you were not recognized they never read your Bible they were not recognized as being said of God do you understand even Paul the prophet whenever he went out he went up to Jerusalem and they sent him out a prophet that's your new testament oh my goodness now you see when God then calls this individual God will give them adequate capability the ability to be able to do it notice this Exodus chapter 35 verse 31 whenever it quoted this about this man it says he hath filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom so being filled means the capability of doing whatever it is he faces God's calling to do that and it's up to God to give the man the ability now there they're not making a mystical body but they're going to build a tent or a tabernacle let's read again Exodus 31 3. now God said I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship so now this guy was not called to handle the word he's not a levite he's not a coincide he's not nothing that can be the Priestly order but this man is called in the ability of being able to take wood and shape it and take Stone and shape it now remember they're going to have an ephod and they're going to have all these precious stones the birthstone and this man's got to know how he has to understand metallurgical Tempo temperatures to where gold can come up to a certain spot silver come up to a certain spot brass come up to a certain spot this man's got to understand all that where'd he get it out from God so God filled this man now keeping your mind the parallel of the New Testament Church God knew the New Testament Church needed a Peter God knew they needed an Andrew but God also knew they needed a Paul so God did not confuse the gifts but God gave to Paul exactly what Paul needed he gave to Peter exactly what Peter needed and as long as they stayed in their field designed by God there was never an issue come on somebody if we can find our place in the body of Christ and work together as the people of God for one common goal I'll tell you one thing the devil would become powerless before us that's why he wants to divide us that's why he wants to separate us he's done it in every move that's ever been on the earth and you'd have to be blind if you think he hasn't done it in our message but as much as he's tried to do it he will never divide the bride from the word and the prophet said it'll be a paradox if he ever runs her together if he ever gets it together but he promised it and he will he knows how to send the little trouble our way he knows how to send a little persecution not the persecution of the tribulation period but just enough trouble to get us all together oh my now notice what this man is Anointed he's going to be anointed to do to devise to devise cunning works to work and goals and silver and embrace now wait a minute you mean to tell me God wants gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and ivory all these high dollar items God wants them in his house do you understand that Tabernacle and the value today was over 30 million dollars and God was the one that gave them the pattern we got a nice place here but it's about like a Shack on the side of the road compared to what that place was worth but yeah people get it in their mind humility humility humility don't understand the first letter of it God himself anointed this man well why didn't God just say take to another crook just make up I don't care I don't care just throw up whatever you want no doubt there's some of them people that would done it and the reason I say that because there's some today that do God the same way you go to Lowe's and buy you the very best faucet you can find and you go online and fight if ain't nothing good enough you'll go to New York get it if you've got to do it you'll put you in the franchise bathtub and you'll put you in the best this and that and other and when it comes to the house of God you want to throw God a shady up on the side of the road and say we want to be humble you no doubt hypocrite [Music] you mean you think more of yourself than you would of God I figured God deserves a whole lot better than I deserve and I'm going to go ahead and say that God deserves a whole lot better than you deserve wow to devise devise so this guy this is where part of the genius part comes from and the spirit of God anointed this man so he would look and say a piece of Walnut say oh my goodness wow I can see it now can't you wow other people and I said shame on you humble yourself that's too shiny well you need to Fancy altafire Imperial it's done been a bunch of Tears shed on this altar I'm hoping there's a bunch more well Hallelujah well glory to God we shouldn't have these fine padded chairs in here you always should my brother Tim comes we need them you'll pay better attention if you don't go to sleep that is oh we now want you to have a comfortable place but it ain't just for your comfort that's a representation of what I think about my God oh I could have built him a little Shack on the side of the road and took the money that I spent for this place and put it in my bank account and why would I want to do such a foolish thing have done it'll be surprised of the millionaire message preachers that they are and I say it's a crying shame oh but I say we ought to give to God not only a nice place but everything we are our hearts our souls our minds our strength [Applause] I'm being this brother right here I can't wait to meet this guy this man Harry was so gifted to devise cunning works that never been anything like it so God just anointed him and he just get these thoughts Moses Ascend Thou shalt not do this thou shall not do that that old brother sin oh God that diamond would look awesome and that goal coming up around it and them chapters not chapter but chapter them chapters on the tops of them columns I'm going to put a lily on one side and a pomegranate on the other side and I want to name one of them Jason and I'm going to name the other one bohas and I'm gonna then that old guy just sitting around eating supper and his wife say where are you hello hello where are you you know Brothers sometimes like to do us have y'all got Converters on your mind painting on your mind whatever your vocation is where are you you imagine that old boy he slept about it he dreamed about it why he was anointed Lord God children if God could anoint a man to be able to do that for the house of God don't you think you and I can get so in love with the Lord Jesus that whatever we're called to do maybe you're called to visit the self oh I'm so proud to hear some of our young folks have been visited those that shut-ins and can't go I hope some of you get under such an anointing and get so burdened that you want to go back again and again and again and bring them a smile let them know they love them let them know that we care for them brother Jonathan play your guitar and sing and say something that's encourage you or if we can get so a part of the family of God and one in the house of God this is your time notice this to devise cunning Works to work in gold and silver and brass and cutting of stones they didn't do no good to cut them if you didn't know how to settle but he just sat around just looking at you know whatever it was glory to God is why I said what is it now I know it's something to do about church that seemed like to me that's all you think about sound like a good man to me and in Cotton Stones I understand and then carving Timber to work in working of workmanship and our behold I have given was him a whole of that the son of aishmach of the tribe of Dan isn't this and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted but I that they may make all that I have commanded thee so God had appeared God had appalled God had a James God had a Bartholomew look at our message in this day look at all the different preachers that's god's got and look at some of them they defy such curious works we call them sermons you know what I'm saying they then they think wow where did they get that at and either even other preachers will say wow I wish I'd have thought of that it's not a thought of it event sermon whatever my goodness where'd God get it cause gives every everyone the way he wants to and then this man preaches on this and this man preaches on that and they'll say all glory to God what a great understanding oh my thank you Lord why because God is the one who gives him but watch it all for you do you think it's so this preacher cannot preach that one and this one cannot do that one no if the real surrendered men of God is all for you every sermon coming from God is for you it's a love gift oh my God so from the nature of what we see of the offerings I put this down so you'll be able to read it with me this is what they brought out of the land of Egypt gold silver brass blue purple Scarlet fine linen ramskins dyed red what we call Badger scans oil spices incense Onyx stones and other stones remember they spoil the Egyptians let's say it this way it was back paid with interest [Applause] so what did they do they gave to God their wages oh wow so Moses lifts an offer and I said all right I want everybody everybody that's got gold everybody's going to see where we're going to meet all this for the house of God they started bringing some much stuff in that Moses had to get up and make an announcement and said no more offerings we've got way more than what we need wow you talking about a giving people that wanted to take of theirselves and never remember they were Paupers they were proper State this was the richest they had ever been in their lives and yet what does God do God says I want it and what did they do so if God wants it we'll give it to him so here they bring all these offers now this is only than that aspect of it but think of it from this side too they must have also brought Looms spinning wheels instruments for cutting precious stones anvils hammers furnaces melting pots with a vast variety of tools for the different artists employed in the work of the Tabernacle Smith's joiners Carvers and gilders wow God wanted them to be a part of what he was doing amen God know what it's just about the Don he does this and brother Donnie does that and brother Daryl and these ministers they do on the deacons God don't want it to be just that way God wants this to be your church God wants this to be your work as well as mine and we work together for one thing look friend it's not us trying to divide this group in that group and say well who's got the biggest following in the message my goodness we should be well beyond that but it's not our move no way this ain't my message so to speak oh y'all know you call it brother Donny's church I'm only here as a Shepherd I believe this church Belongs to the Lord Jesus [Applause] yeah let me read through this and they'll close you momentarily Exodus 35 30 and Moses said unto the children of Israel now what she's going to repeat what God told him see the Lord has called the name basilio the son of your eye the son of her of the tribe of Dan and has filled him with the spirit of God and wisdom and understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship and to devise curious Works in gold and in silver and in brass cutting of stones to set them carving of wood make any manner of cunning work you see Divine abilities are given to men to accomplish a Divine Purpose our abilities are not given to us for our own use this is why such a danger for preachers to get into business because if they're not careful they'll tap into that gift and they'll get into making money with that gift come on now they'll use that god-given gift you've seen it as well as I am and sometimes preachers get on the top of the biggest pyramids in the message except banana real pyramid of love and charity and faith and all of that it's a pyramid of money come on brother Donnie now once you notice what else that God is going to give to this man the ability to teach you see every gifted individual is not a teacher you ever get around people before and they could do this and this and this and this and you say show me how you do that and when they get down and explaining it to you you are more confused than you was before they started now they're very good at what they do but they don't have the ability to teach others how to do it because they stand there from where they're at and they're doing what's automatic in their brain been there for 15 to 20 years and you're standing there's you know illiterate as you can be concerning the subject but this man not only him but the other brother they were not only given these great ability to devise all these beautiful cunning works that God said I'm going to make you Brothers teachers you're going to teach others watch in verse 34. he has put in his heart that he may teach both he and a holy ebb so what are these brothers going to do they're going to be over the entire work say like a messenger to an age and then there'll be others that'll go out from under them and if they are Faithfully taught and will stay with what the teachers taught them then they'll be able to build the house of God now you see they're giving all this wisdom of No Doubt there were some younger guys you think I'm going to follow him I don't bless God I feel led to do this and that and the other I ain't no man going to tell me what to do well you broke God's program right there I no doubt they had it same as we do in every age that yet that these men were not only great Artisans and great Craftsmen but they're going to teach by divine inspiration they don't want to keep this to themselves now now I'm the only one that can do this don't don't look but you look this way brother I I'm the only one who can do this God ain't giving this to nobody but me don't you look over here now but God enlightened them with this great ability and I said take and show this with those others that are called to do so then it will be the body building the house of God he has put in his heart that he may teach mostly and a holyhead the son of eshimach of the tribe of death you see it was essential that these two Master Craftsmen should also be able to teach their subordinates oh wow but the teaching is only as good as the subordinate will listen I'll tell friend you'd be surprised if you knew how hard that it really is for a yacht of young preachers in this message to take any advice from an older minister I I never ceased to Marvel me myself coming out of Pentecost never having a mentor in Pentecost never haven't really anybody you could go talk to coming to the message you know kind of being the same way and I look back and I say oh Lord how much these have been on me how much easier been on you all if I'd have been able to talk to some men and been able to have the right type of influence I'm talking about denomination I'm talking about God call me in God is setting up no organization God never called them Apostles a set of no organization but it was the apostolic way and what did they do those God called men had to teach water baptism they had to teach the godhead they taught the truth is that right and that's the way it's supposed to be this is the way the house of God is built God called these two men as Master Builders remember Paul used the word and Paul was a master builder well come on Saints God had another master builder in this day and it ain't me and it ain't no other preacher and we ain't promised another master builder neither we've stop the master builder that we need in this age it was a prophet of Malachi for come on somebody I know some of the folks in the message ain't going to preach the message no more they're getting tired of quote no problem well that's fine if they want to do that that's up to them I'm going to keep on quoting I'm going to keep on preaching it I'm going to keep on pointing you in that direction because I believe God sent us a master builder look at it would not a god-called pastor that's straight on the word and taught the word for years and been faithful as posed to Beauty well not he be a man that God would be able to use to influence other brother that think they're called to be pastors how can an evangelist tell a pastor how to do this now God's Prophet said in evangelist said never tell a pastor what to even do ah so I said but we're so scared to death to take any instruction what a shame can you imagine the wisdom the battles the scars that brother Tim Pruitt has had through the years passed on the church for I guess going on 50 years something like that preaching for almost that long can you imagine all that he's been through is he perfect of course not but how much has he been through that he could hand down to others but we're scared to death of it oh my notice verse 23 and I'll close now one thing about this other brother was preach different ahola had his specialty was weaving and embroidery we've had a few preachers out that embroidered us didn't they so this other brother was more in the aspect of the metallurgical side is it amazing now God could give this one man all of this whole thing but he decided to separate it now he's going to make both of these brothers teachers now with him was a whole to have the son of a shemek and the tribe of damn an engraver and a cunning Workman and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and discard it and then finally well why not just take an old piece of canvas and fill her just get no grass sack just get an old grass sack pick up something off the side of the street just throw it up on the side but got a little crooked stick on this side and they got them cherubims laying over and they're saying about my kids one of them says anything that way but we're humble we're humble anything with any shine to it oh that's of the devil and the pavement in the city you're going to walk on is pure gold and the gates are going to walk through are created pearls come on Saints oh my goodness you got them pictures ready for me damn house he filled with wisdom of heart to work all manner of work of the engraver and the cunning Workman and the embroidering blue and in purple and Scarlet and fine linen and of the Weaver even of them that do any work and those that devise cunning work now the ordinary Weaver would have wove all the fabric in one color the gifted Weaver would take blue Scarlet White and to do that you had to calculate so you're going to put the image of a cherubim you're going to put an image inside this embroidery work you've got to sit there and figure out how to do it so are the three gods or are there one and they come up to one every time and then they got to looking well is there an eight-day messenger said no there's only one two three four five six seven ages so they could only be seven Messengers so they had to count all that in order to make the picture look just exactly right you got to know how to count aren't y'all glad you finally learned how to count how in the world can one plus one plus one equals one but only in Divine understanding can the manifestation of a father the manifestation of a sign and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost only wind up of being one God and somebody said the skillful Weaver then produced a pattern and this is three classes of men and I'm gonna close three classes of workers which were men they were this now what's in what they did but then there was another category Exodus 35 25. and they were women ah you mean the women even get to do something and all the women that were wise hearted did span on the rumor mill no I mean whoa whoa did spin with their hands and brought which they had spun both a blue and the purple and of scarlet and a fine linen and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun so the women did the spinning and the dime now remember according to the Bible they were to make a Brazen labor and his foot so God told Moses now it sat on the outside and that is whenever they come in they would take their foot and kick on the little lever down at the bottom then they would bend over and wash their hands and their feet before they go into worship now what was this signifying their walk with God they was only anointed One Time by the prophet of God they were priests from that time on so they didn't have to get reanointed again or saved again but they didn't need their hands and feet washed this is another reason why we need to come to church so we don't come to church to be told how good we are how sweet we are how nice we are and everything like that we'll come to church to get Washed by the Water of the word because we're out there in this dark filthy sinful world and we get up spirits on us if we're not careful and we'll get you know this idea and that idea so what do we need to do man of God to kick that thing on and get your hands down there and wash them all and wash your feet then what you're getting ready to worship praise God that's why some of you come in here and say you're like a bump on a pickle and you ain't washed from the water of all the filths of the world out there but God when you know what that labor was made out of the women's looking glasses now they didn't have mirrors like we do today sisters their mirrors were made out of burnished or polished brass didn't have glass like we did so that polished polished Polish Polish that piece of metal until they could hold it up and see their self and them women gave their mirrors to this man here and this man poured it in a furnace and smelted it I melted it and it became the very vessel that was used to wash their own priest so they supply to the ministry the very thing that the ministry needed in order to bring your sacrifice to the house of God Oh Glory to God now if that man had not have done that God would have killed him is that right God said let them wash their hands on their feet there at lest they die and Who provided the brass you did so you gave your breasts you gave your mirror you gave your ability to no longer see yourself but see yourself identified in the Tabernacle Oh Glory to God I'm not saying sister don't quit combing your hair and don't quit taking a shower and all that sort of thing it's in the nature of a woman she wants to look pretty that's all right but don't put that vanity in front of the house of God don't put that make it a vain thing your words you just almost worshiped yourself but you imagine they sacrificed the ability to see themself and every time the priest would go into the house of God with their sacrifice the priests would wash and something they contributed listen show them a couple of pictures our brothers artists Renditions of course of what the Tabernacle would have looked like ah does anybody know what that gold color is on the walls it's not Crayola it is not Sherwin-Williams paint it is chateemwood overlaid and pure gold the menorah seven Branch Candlestick solid gold the altar of incense for the priests is standing City wood overlaid in gold they are the Covenant wood humanity overlaid and gold signifying our lord Jesus at the current cost of Gold Silver and these things today over 30 million dollars you ever seen a storefront look like that so you see the people who think all big churches are of the devil really so what is heaven like a 12 a 12 14 by 14 so you and your two children and you know your favorite cousin and uncle and y'all going to get y'all gonna live in that 1500 Mile City I hate to interrupt your party but you're going to hear somebody one day down there screaming to the top of their voice it's going to be me and brother Dave and brother Jonathan brother Fred and brother Daniel and sister so and so and we're all down there and we we heard another voice louder the notion who it is brother Branham he's down there screaming with us you ain't getting rid of me friends you're stuck with me for eternity like it or not No Doubt this couldn't even be a drop in the bucket as we'd say of the beauty can you imagine when the Shekinah the Shekinah as we call it would come in and Sparkle over that altar and a flash on them golden walls our carpet looks pretty puny after all stinking old Walnut sound panels wow look at this look at this look at what God's doing around the world not just in this what is he making around the world and he has Fine artisans who study and stay alone with God they come out of there from the presence of the Lord I know you believe it the same spirit of God who gave these brothers that it's the same one that anoints me it's the same one that anoints brother Daryl and these other preachers the same one that anointed Brother David Siler when he's still here during the meeting and brother Tim Curtin brother on you believe that it's the same spirit of God except now it's not in gold and silver and purple and all that sort of thing but it's to build up the house of God to take you out of this world where does gold come from the dirt where does silver come from the dirt where does all these precious things come from the dirt and they have to go through a process in order to make it look like this it doesn't look like this initially neither do we but through the process God turns us into the Tabernacle of God praise the Lord asparagus together praise the Lord Jesus thank you Holy Father Lord God what an awesome God you are what a beautiful story you have laid before us this night the parallels and the types so beautiful father thank you so the same spirit of God that moved upon these men and gave them this great ability it's the same spirit of God that moved right there in our prophet's house from the very first service and the series of the seals God hiding himself in Simplicity than the breach first through the seventh The Sixth Seal question answers on the seals and the seventh seal Sunday night the same spirit of God began to open and pull back the seals of things that have been kept secret since the foundation of the world so you sent a master builder to this age many men have come and gone many men will stand before you at that day and answer for dividing and splitting and separating the message people having all kinds of doctrines that's divided the people around the world now Lord we're as divided as the denominations are message people won't even speak to one another they won't even visit one another have nothing to do with one another help us God we can't really say nothing about the denominations and words divided as they are but that don't change the program that don't change the building you're going to have a bride that's going to love in spite of everything it doesn't mean we go along with people but many people judge loving people by going along with them but they've got love backwards you love those that hated you you love those that crossed you and went against you you love them anyway so father help us to know that human love is the conditional love well I'll love you if you like me I'll love you you'll be good to me and it don't take us long in talking to people in this day and we can tell whether or not they like people or dislike them and if they'll talk long enough they'll understand why and for most of them it's because that person crossed them somehow or didn't treat them right and they will base their love on the treatment of that person which is not Divine love at all so you were hanging on the cross and you prayed for those Sinners who had crucified you father forgive them for they know not what they do they never even ask you for forgiveness but that's real love that's real Godly love that we can forgive those that don't even ask us to O Lord help us father I pray help me Jesus as the pastor Lord help these other ministers your father that we will study and stay in the presence of God and get what's needed for this building help these brothers as they go out and preach in other churches Lord that they will be quickened by your spirit and you will lead them Lord for what needs to be brought for the services well they go oh Father not for our Glory not for our benefit but for the kingdom of Jesus Christ may we not preach ourselves but may we preach Christ Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah don't you love him children with all your heart now look God did the opposite to you to what was done to those boards that you saw on the Tabernacle God there God had the goal which represented deity put on the outside and the humanity the wood was on the inside but God in building this Tabernacle since Messias has come God started with the gold on the inside and the humanity on the outside and I don't care how hard you try you will never perfect your Humanity it's going to bother you but thank God it does you're going to be aggravated with it you're not even going to like it at times those times I don't even like myself none and there's other times I just think I'm such a great person don't stand there and look at me like a hypocrite you do yourself the same way who did you feed before you come to church yourself or your wife who did you close it's in us to protect ourselves and God put the gold on the inside and that's the outside the humanity still be this whole chatime would oh my God how many wants to be more like the Lord Jesus how many wants to love like he loved and want to need one another more come on now you want to recognize I need my brothers and sisters at our church I need them I need them now that don't mean you'll always be the very best of Pals there's some folks I don't care how hard you try you'll never be compatible in the flesh but you can still love one another so much from your soul you just love that brother and sister though you may not spend a lot of personal time with them you know there's preachers that I love them but they're just not my buddies they're not my Chums they're just not pals you know what I'm saying because the atmosphere they creates different than the one that I create that's why we all got to be changed if not heaven will be just like our church in about two weeks time some of you all be in one click over there and some of you young people will be on another Street on the other side and then there'll be certain young people that won't be on that click so they'll be on the other side no we've all got to be changed from clicks would you lay your hand on one another tonight let's pray for one another that God will give us more love and more Unity than we've ever had in our lives Hallelujah Lord Jesus we have our hands one upon the other we could ask you tonight for gifts we could ask you tonight for healing and we've done that before and we may do that before we stop but Lord I'm asking for something tonight that I believe is so needed Among Us allow for each other a recognition that we need each other and Satan does his best to try to convince us we don't need each other and cause us to pull away and pull away from the church and pull away from each other I don't need nobody ain't nobody locks me up there and then we go to pulling ourself away that ain't nothing but the devil Lord I pray you would help us tonight father may we love one another more than we've ever loved in our lives Lord not only the people of our church but Lord God loving Humanity if they ever needed love they sure need it now that don't mean that we go along with our sin father we love the sinner but we hate their sin father I pray that you would help each of us in our assembly Lord God that we can recognize we need one another as we looked up here at this artist's rendition of the the Tabernacle there was one board by another by another by another the interior of this Tabernacle was not made out of one piece of wood there was not a tree big enough to do such but it was one plank by another plank by another plank buy another plank but put them together and then make the house of God oh Jesus Put Me by this brother put this one by that brother by this sister but that brother but this sister then Lord God put us together and we'll make the house of God for God to have a place that he can dwell for perfect worship perfect worship is God in flesh how can I ever know how to worship you unless you in me teaches me how you want to be worshiped and loved we'll do it our way every time according to our background according to what Obama says what her daddy said well honey you do it this way you do it that way or you don't get too loud or if you ain't screaming you ain't doing it but only you can really teach us how to worship so you living in US this is why some people don't worship no more than they do because they've never been taught personally by you that worship is not hinged upon the song leader worship is not hinged upon the preacher saying all right now let's everybody worship but if God is in our hearts and we're yielded to God we worship for the song leader worships or not we worship whether the preacher worships or not because The God Who Wants to be worshiped lives in the worship her soul all glory to God God's Own desire to be worship pulls praise out of my mouth God's Own desire to be worshiped and adored and magnified pulls it out of my mouth so now I may be so low I cannot even raise my voice but the Lord God from within my soul will take my human lips and speak praise and love and adoration Hallelujah for that's what we were made for Lord Lord God make us to be a house of God oh this is your house Lord all the building all the planning all that we've done Lord that we might could have this place Lord Jesus so we could come and worship have meetings and so on thank you for it Lord we've already seen you do so many things there's been so many miracles so many healings so many baptisms that we've already seen take place I believe we've yet to see the greatest Hallelujah we thank you for it Lord now we can have special meetings and men will have them in years we thank you for it Lord but oh God this ain't the only house of God we're talking about but we want this mystical body to be your house I want my body to be your house I want Harry I want all of my brothers

you can understand it They Don't Love the way a child of God loves I preached it for years and believed it and I told Carol the other day I was always afraid that somebody was going to question me on this thing that I preached because I'd never found a quote for it I could see it but I needed a quote I'd always preach that Satan didn't love his own people and he didn't love the world and the people of the world that serve him but I found a quote the other day where brother Branham said Satan cannot love and I was out wow one of the many many things that makes him so different than our lord Jesus so when you was living for the devil he didn't care one thing about you he didn't love you he didn't love you not one bit he can't love but look what the Bible says about God for God is love praise God so what ought we to be we ought to be loved too we are his children sing something for us hey let's just love him just a little bit now not you and your wife not you and the brother
