me sing it I know we sing it quite a bit but we don't we don't sing all the verses so we're going to sing all the verses today the song was actually written uh by a Swedish brother back in the 1800s wasn't exactly in the context it is now but it he wrote it back that long ago and it got translated from Swedish to German and then from German it end up into the Russian country and it is laid there dormant nobody knew about this song and then a a British British missionary was in Russia and he heard it and he was so inspired with it and he translated it into English and changed some of the verses a little bit and still nobody knew about it till after World War II and after World War II in the 40s it became very popular so much that this was one of brother bram's favorite songs and uh I can see why oh Lord my [Music] God when I in awesome Wonder consider all the world thy hands have made I see the Stars I hear The Rolling Thunder thy power throughout the Universe displayed when

my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art how great thou are how great [Music] th how great the [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord and may believes we serve a great Mighty God thank you Lord Jesus what an awesome privilege is for us to be gathered together on Wednesday night how many loves church on Wednesday night amen thank the Lord let's turn to Psalms if you would tonight Psalm 126 verse5 thank the Lord for his Mercy to us and his grace as much as we would like to understand and comprehend his greatness I would imagine for the most of us we still know so very little about him and our understanding would be so small a comprehension of it and not only to look at big and numbers and how big the universe all that sort of thing but greatness is expressed in humility not just in size and numbers I'm so grateful we know in that way Psalms 126 five they that sow in tears shall reap en Joy okay so here is a type of sewing that can be in sadness sorrow now we've been talking about sewing seed for the rain to come now we would think well depending on the mood we sew it in that would be the same mood we reap it in it's not the mood that it reproduces but it's the seat notice how David says this they that sow in tears not you're not sewing tears but you're sewing in tears they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy so it doesn't say they that sow tears will reap Joy it's impossible now if you'll think about a lot of our life and our walk before the Lord it describes it right here in this verse so many things that we have to go through as Christian so many things that we deal with sorrow sickness difficulty trouble even sometimes from friends that we have to part from because of sin or something there just breaks your heart but yet you are sewing in tears but sewing righteous seed and whenever you reap that righteous seed you will not reap it back in tears but you will actually reap it back in Joy if we could keep this in mind through the hard things we go through I think it make it easier for us they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed now again notice David in this verse he's not saying that the Weeping is the seed it's the demeanor of the swer so he's describing an emotion that the so is having you mothers and fathers know whenever you have to correct your children whenever you would have to say say something to someone that you really love and it might it might really be painful and it might really hurt so how do you sow them typ ay sometimes you have to sew him in tears but you keep in mind he reward you in the right way he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves bringing his sheaves with him which is a cycle of maturity so you seow it sometimes in heaviness a preacher SWS seed many times in tears he SWS correction in heaviness and sorrow but he believes that God will turn that around and that he one day will reap with rejoicing praise the Lord is't that awesome scriptures he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves so all that he SED was not in vain so he went out with seed and when he comes back he comes back with those sheaves bringing in the mature Harvest Galatians 6 the scripture that we've been reading for several service is Galatians 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting now let's read if you would from a little sermon that brother randam preached called the era of God's Deliverance from shreport 1956 and he's talking about Ahab and Jezebel a few paragraphs above that and he said Elijah had told him how he was going to die and what God was going to do because he was wicked and how that Jezebel was going to be fed to the dogs now we know enough about God to know God would have never allowed this to happen unless there was something really really bad about these people so the dogs are going to lick your blood and they will turn right around and eat Jezebel's flesh which is unusual for dogs wild dogs yes the tame dogs that live in a city so they leave her hand and parts of her feet is what they eat now how how could she reap such a harvest because of her attitude to God's people and remember the nail that finished it all was her treatment to nabos which was not a preacher not a prophet not a high priest just a man that had a garden and a house an inheritance in a certain part of the city and Ahab wanted it and he said no this this is my inheritance you keep that in mind when sickness attacks you when the devil tries to rob your home peace Joy this and that you let him know that's your inheritance in Christ Jesus amen nebal standing for that inheritance finally cost him his life now notice what what God did how that Jezebel was going to be fed to the dogs because she did the evil thing that she had done and remember my brethren and sisters you'll reap what you sow you well that's God's law that's God's law of nature now brother Donnie does it apply to elect and non-elect it does y it sure does now this law does not change election it does not change the power of salvation but it is the law of God that what you sow you will reap so don't get in your mind well I'm bride I'm ordained I'm predestinated I can do you know pretty much and God will deal with me in a different way and where was it you got that at you need to find that man that told you that lie and tell him to quit lying to people right I mean like to be remember tonight as as we pray have a couple of prayer claws one for brother George Hamlin who's been dealing with a pretty bad cough now for several months and um had another scan and he still got some pneumonia in his lung also Brother Louis wanted us to pray over one for brother Keith beanan he's in a real real desperate situation um needing a liver transplant so we want to pray for them as well tonight how many has an unspoken request something you want to present before the Lord with all your heart Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word dear Jesus we desire tonight that we might be better equipped when we walk out these doors than we were when we came in that we might understand a little bit more about who we are and where we are in time why you are so meticulous about the seed that we seow and if we could only look at it in the right way that you aren't just trying to warn us of the seed that we sow but you are conveying to us your own nature so this is why you are so particular over men that you will call to preach the word and you're even more particular about men that you will call to interpret the word because every preacher is not called to be an interpreter of the word for the age but that is assigned to a certain Church age messenger then those others go out from under them and then they preach what those Church AIDS Messengers have been given because you also follow this same law and you knew whatever type of seed you sowed that's what type of harvest you would reap so if you are responsible for seing all of the denominations then you sir are to blame for the Havoc that they have wrought on the Earth but we know you would never seow such a thing and help us to see father now it is our time after the message has been brought now we will be hit by an onslaught of demons to see if we will hybridize our message from God the way all the other ages have done father you see these prayer calls I have in my hand tonight dear God minister to to the needs of these my brothers speak to us from your word father in the name of Jesus amen God bless you Saint you may be seated we know that it's a Divine Law of God to follow those ones that God has called to interpret his word now keep this in mind you can only serve God on Earth as Those whom God has called to interpret that word to you which does not include your pastor which does not include your favorite evangelist every preacher is not called to interpret the word of God that's given to the office of a Vindicated Prophet amen and the Word of Life said that's not given to you Ley it's not given to me I do not have the right nor the authority nor the understanding to interpret God's word it's not my place it's not my place to do so it's not the place of many of the men around the message who are doing it now they take the word well I think it means this and I think it means that and I don't think this no longer applies I think this was for another time now you realize what they're doing they are interpreting the word to those who follows them but on what right do they establish that on well because they preach Maybe for 45 years that's not qualification enough maybe because they've been preaching since they was 18 years old that's not qualification enough either you've got to be a godall Vindicated Prophet to divinely interpret the word of God a theologian is not good enough a preacher is not good enough a teacher a missionary a pastor or no one else other than a Vindicated Prophet so it's one of God's laws that we will serve God on Earth as those who are sent to us interpret that word then we will answer to God on how close that we stick to that Vindicated message of the hour that we lived in now this is where that people have always messed up it's when God would give his word and then they would begin to reason many of them wait till after the messenger of course is gone uh they would many of them would never confront him to his face they knew better but it's answer that he's gone and then times change and people change and they feel like because time changes and people change that somehow we need to re-evaluate resin and reapply the message of the hour that we live now we don't think well it's not that it's not the same message of the hour but we just need to resink it and maybe we don't need to so strictly adhere to what has been delivered maybe we've become too legal to it and maybe it's not really that necessary and all you see there is when we start listening to the spirit of antichrist to get us to hybrid what God has given to us either with a message that has been in the days gone by and we will hybridize it with a past message or we will hybrid it with someone else's opinion in the present day that we live in either way it produces a hybrid product now remember God's word will never hybridize as far as God is concerned now what happens is that people will they will sew to the wind and then they will re a wh wind so they will sew to the wind that's a scripture in case you don't know it he Hosea 8:7 for they have swn the wind and shall reap the Whirlwind so they sewn the wind and reap a whirlwind now they might have sown to something that was very gentle and we know it's how a breeze can be boy don't we appreciate a nice cooling breeze here in East Tennessee when it's about 90 in the shade and about 85% humidity and a little breeze will come up and it goes to blow on that sweat rolling down your cheeks and it feels just like an air conditioner don't it and we think man how good that breeze feels and a lot of people that's the way they seow the hybridization of the word they don't sew it to a tornado but they sew it to a gentle easy Breeze that just simply blows across their face or we'll say across their church service and it's a breeze that is so gentle and so nice but it will never come back in the same speed or Ratio or velocity that it was sewn in so it's sewn in a gentile Breeze that is so nice and so comforting but you know what's amazing is it comes back in the form of a whirlwind so what does it do it always magnifies now that's good in both the right but it's bad when it comes to the wrong now some preachers you know they they really have an issue and a problem whenever they're sewing seed and whenever they're preaching if people aren't just running and jumping and screaming and and don't get me wrong I like amens I like to know that the people are being blessed but I also realized this principle right here that if if I will seow even if it's under the influence of a gentle breeze that it will come right back in this same build in in the form of a whirlwind maybe a week or two or maybe a month later cuz God's word don't lie now this is actually a Hebrew proverb of course it was more amongst uh peoples of this time than it was with the Hebrew but we could relate to it because of them so it was a a proverbial uh manner of speech so it was signifying the taking also of a lot of work and a lot of preparation and sewing it to something that was invisible so now all of our lifetime all of us have felt breezes and winds and yet we've never been able to grab a hold of it we've never been able to harness it we've never been able to put it in a bag or open your car door as the breeze is coming through and you let the breeze come into your car door and you slam the car door you say I got it I got it no you can't tame it you can't catch it but yet people in the negative sense they will spend so much labor and sew it toward something that is passing and fleeing call a wind and then what's worse than that is they'll come right back and reap a whirlwind which will always bring more devastation and destruction than they ever deemed possible so it pays us to sew the right seed don't it so if if tonight is one of them quiet type of sewing deals I I'm good with that as long as y'all just bat your eye every now and then or just wave your hand to the breeze I know we're on the same page all right because I know God's word will not return to him void so the wind is an empty creature in respect to things that are solid and things that we could touch made of at atoms and molecules and structure and all that sort of thing so it comes through and it's gone and how do you know whether you've ever been touched by the same wind or not so the wind that passed your face when you were a three or four year old child and then when you were 21 the the wind come past again was it the same one that touched you by the Skip and you're three or four well when you're 30 the wind hits you again when you're 40 hits you again when you're 50 hits you again is it the same one we know very little about it don't we yet sometimes people will sow so much to something that they know so little about and then when it comes back it never comes back and that Gentile small Breeze type of say but it can tear their home all to pieces it can tear their marriage all to pieces and they simply solded a little something maybe looking at a sister in the wrong way or a brother or just saying a little something that wasn't quite right y'all can say Amen right here if you want to and yet it just started with a small little something never never meant nothing bad maybe hand a sister a bottle of cake or something you're sitting at a restaurant or a salt shaker or Pepper or whatever more and by mistake you just simply touch your hand and from there it starts something right here and it may start the same thing and Herman so you sew to something that was unseen you sewed to something and it may be a month it may be two and then you think about it and then you may see her church and speak to her or you know whatever more however that it comes about and then before long it begins to pick up and it's picking up velocity and momentum and the breeze is building more and more and before you know it you have got a full-fledged tornado or a cat five hurricane on your hands and yet you were the one that swld for that thing to come through now you see but I take this also on the posit positive side that as long as I preach the word of God the message of the hour with the right attitude the right time the right season everything like that uh you may look at and think brother Donnie is it doing any good I'm sewing to the wind but I'm looking for that hurricane called The Rapture and it's coming by after a while and it may look small now it may not look like there's a whole lot going on it may look like oh my we're just coming to church and we're just kind of playing along and the Breeze is coming along and we're sewing seed and we're clapping our hands and oh everything seems good and we're doing all right but you see I've got my eyes on something more than the sewing time I'm waiting for this cat five which is gr a c e j s u s f AI t h I'm looking for this cat five that is going to carry the bride out of here in a moment in a twinkling of an eye because if I keep sewing this seed it will not fall to the ground it will come to pass is that right so a person will not merely reap what they sow but it will be greatly multiplied so if people sow Folly and in vanity natur just going to be so much worse and it will be in such a violent devastating way in the way that it will return so when it comes back you see it's an emblem of rest it didn't start out that way now if people would see what the wrong seed they're sewing if they could see the outcome down the road there a month or two or three or a year or two most of the people would never do it that way but Satan always hides that end result now it's amazing because he not only tries to hide the end result for The Sinner but he also wants to hide the end result for the child of God he wants us to focus on our sickness he wants us to focus on our trouble on our pain on our Agony he does not want us to see that us sowing the seeds of reading our Bible sewing the seeds of coming to church when you really didn't feel like coming tonight you didn't feel like Clapping Your Hands you didn't feel like praising the Lord but you se de seed anyhow and you worship God he'll try to to hide from you the reward of that seed of you worshiping God when you didn't feel like it he knows if you do that you're sewing seed and he'll try to keep that from you by you sewing that seed God's going to turn around and bless you a hundred times over because you offered to God a sacrifice of praise and you worshiped him when you didn't feel like doing it you would have felt better off physically if if you have stayed home it's much easier now to stream of course it's a lot easier for people to can sit home kick back in the recliner uh get him a a big bowl of sugarfree ice cream and get him some sugar-free chocolate cake and then drink a double espresso on top of that and sit there and a men and me from their recliner or they can sit there on their couch and just kind of hang out and they rub the dog on the top of the head and the cat on the top of the head and then they say Amen they throw me an amen through the radio or through the to the monitor of course us message people don't have TVs but we've got a Sanctified version of it and we got a monitor and they don't pull come on now and they don't really put nothing into the service and it's much easier to stay home but I'll tell you one thing they will not get the reward now I'm talking about people that can't come to church I'm ain't talking about people that are sick I'm talking about people that let the devil Rob them it's amazing how many people get a headache on Wednesday and on Sunday it's amazing how many people have an issue on Wednesday and on Sunday but by Thursday the headache has gone away oh my goodness their nose was a running I'm telling you what they thought they was going to have to get a car to chase their nose down it was just a running some muds and their fever was 102 by by Thursday morning when they got to go to work they jump out of that bad I mean they're just as chipper as a little red squirrel boy hallelujah thank you Jesus for moving for me but the thing of it is if you have sacrifice and come to the house of God on Wednesday night the Lord might have move that fever while you was there well praise the Lord but you see we are living in leosia so and we don't realize all of those things that we do like that we're sewing we're sewing now watch brother R says you remember the old days of the flaer now look at her daughter now what's her daughter going to be see I'll preach one of these nights on sewing to the wind and reaping the Whirlwind that's what the Nations has done sewed to the wind and is reaping the Whirlwind we've sowed to socialism and reaping communism so what did it do it got worse with as it goes and comes up now again he said I wish I had enough time here to preach on sewing to the wind and reaping the Whirlwind for you listen here that's what America's done look at these way back a long time ago the old flapper of long ago her daughter today is a chorus girl what's her daughter going to be now this is 1959 so it went from the flapper to A Chorus girl then of course between the chorus girl and now we've had a couple of more generations and look what they are yeah and if time goes on what will they become oh my what's her daughter going to be you see what you do bear something upon listen do you see single young people understand that what you do will affect your children do you married mothers and fathers realize things you do the way you behave the way you act the way you talk your attitude toward church can affect your children and even your grandchildren now you men that feel like you can sneak around and get on your phone and look at things that's indecent and ungodly and you say well all I got to do is ask God to forgive me but you realize that you may be doing something for your young Sons that's right do you understand what you may be doing to your young Sons you sisters in the same way of doing things that are not right you said well I I just repent and I ask God to forgive me yeah and God will forgive you but the angels of God don't go up there and rub up all of those seeds that you've swn they've been sown now praise the Lord notice this see what you do bears something upon your generations to follow you sin does to three are for generations and righteousness death live right it'll do something to your children to follow you now do you understand you're not just doing it for yourself oh I would to God we would have heard this years ago many of us when we were younger it might have helped I'm sure it would have helped us and some some of our kids might have turned out a lot different why because message people do not believe this that's why they do not believe this element that the prophet taught it's just another one that they're adding to the list that's all I still believe it myself now notice livide it'll do something to your children that follow you on on keep living right doing right separating yourself from the things of the world and live Godly in the present world for Christ Jesus so you understand that things can be handed down to your children or even your grandchildren that's right promiscuous living can be handed down to two and three generations epilepsy can be passed down or brought on because a grandparent does something disobedient to God's word now most of us would do everything within our power to keep our children from Evil and wrong Would we not what any of you parents tonight want your children to get epilepsy would you want any of your children to get to burcul losis or cancer or or anything like that you said oh you know i' take every vitamin possible if I could get a shot somehow and they would promise me that if I got this shot I would not pass that cancer cuz it runs in my family I'd get that shot I'd do it twice a year if that's what they recommended and you do that naturally but but what about the spiritual things you don't do now listen the prophet said all diseases come from direct or indirect cause from sin now not may be sin in your life but sin in your parents life inherited sin in your parents life inherited now as I said I realize there's an an element of message people that don't believe that but the last time I checked as far as I know we are a true message church right we believe the teaching of the message you believe that could be possible God said so I will visit the iniquity upon the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation scripture yeah amen and now if you're dealing with sin now maybe you never sinned but there might be a sin that your father did your grandfather did and he said he visit the iniquity of the parents upon the third and fourth generation you understand one reason why now that we're several Generations in the message we've got people in our church that are second and third and some fourth generation message followers now can you imagine what it's going to be if the Lord carries for some of our message children and grandchildren what they are going to be dealing with in the days that are to come because of their grandparents attitude and their parents' attitude toward the word the message the prophet the other aspects of the ministry and by the way you do you are cutting out the past for your children and your grandchildren would any of us willingly be so cruel to do such a thing that you would stubbornly and hardheaded say I'm going to do it I don't care oh my now watch this oh help us tonight Jesus speak to us now maybe you never sin but there might be a sin that your father did your grandfather did and he said it visit the iniquity of the parents upon the third and fourth generation now keep in mind that all this is is Satan understanding the law of God so he doesn't have to actually make people worse in every generation all he had to do in the Garden of Eden was cause one woman to walk away from the program of God and her husband to love her so much that he would willingly walk out of the paradise of God for her sake then by the time it comes down of course to Cain which was not fathered by Adam and then when it comes from there when the two Bloodlines are still separate up to Genesis chapter 6 and we see what happened after that that the sin became greater and greater so whenever it come across on the flood the serpent did not have to show up again in Noah's Garden or Noah's Vineyard or somewhere near around Mount Ararat where they come out of the Ark and the the serpent had to begal another woman but you see the Bloodlines had crossed in Genesis 6 sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took unto them women not even married to them just living with them and once the bloodline was crossed then in the ark was the mixture of the mixed blood and the mixed seed line prior to that there was two separate lines I hope this don't stagger you but Adam was not a devil after he fell in the Garden of Eden Adam never was a devil never could be a devil he was a fallen Son of God Adam did not have murder in his heart after he fell Abel never had murder in his heart though he was born by sex desire come on now how could Abel had murder in his heart and he was a direct descendant from Adam which was a direct descendant from God so Satan knew his accomplishment was never be brought to pass just by getting to Eve but he had to mix him two seed lines Lord children listen to me tonight that's exactly what he's done in every age try to mix in two seed lines down through time I'm talking about now just the physical part yes in Genesis but now the mixture is in the spiritual seed lines so what did he do cross the bloodline there in Genesis 6 then what do we find we don't find Adam ever getting drunk we don't find Abel ever getting drunk we don't find Seth getting drunk but who is the first one written in the Bible that got drunk Noah Noah what in the world happened what happened then we find Moses a murderer Jacob a deceiver where did it come from the mixing Of The Bloodline so if Jacob would start out being a deceiver and then Jacob is going to have all these boys and look at what they turned out to be now Satan all he had to do was step back and let the law of sewing and reaping kick in so Jacob so deceit and lies and treachery and then look at his son look at Reuben his firstborn went and laid with his concubine look look at Simeon and Levi look at the different things that these boys done how did D so Satan had to get on more work had to work harder No all he had to do would just stand by and watch the garden come up it's the same way with us it's the same way with us as a church it's the same way with us in the spiritual sense as it is in the natural sense Satan is not like Satan's working over time boy I'm going to have to hurry I'm going to have to hurry no sin is so multiplied all he's got to do is sit back and just watch people if God did not intervene man would annihilate himself I know a lot of people that don't understand Malachi 4 they don't understand why we have to have it but if you read it real good with a real understanding you will see that God said he would send Elijah in the last day lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse God sending Elijah to you and I not only help Oh Glory to God bring us back to reconciliation of the end time message but it saved the Earth from being cursed by God God's prophets are intercessors oh Hallelujah can I go on tell me go on brother Donnie thank you now your own mouth is against you now what so it might be a a sin that your father did or your grandfather notice again in Mighty conquer but if the little fell if there's something in the family now watch he talking about a sickness even in a child if there's something in the family that the families done that caused this maybe it was for the glory of God maybe it was something they done maybe it's a sin of someone else their grandparents he said he' visit the iniquity of the children to the third and fourth generation I don't know but whatever it is God can reveal it now watch there's a child there before him that has an Affliction and brother random is saying the Poss abilities of what it could be that it might be for the glory of God of course in St John 9:31 we know that or it could be that a grandparent did something wrong and it was not made right he said I don't know so what's he waiting on he's waiting on Clarity from the father to know how to handle this watch's this again in Hebrews your attitude towards Christ was will make a great impression on what your children will be do you understand tonight if it was not for the grace of God some of the lives that many of our parents have lived there ain't no telling what in the world we'd be that's right come on say Amen my mom and daddy never knew the truth of the message of the hour so what did they sow they SED Pentecost that's all they know to do many of you your parents weren't even Christians and they've done this and that and the other and you think God what what what in the world am I going through and you want to blame God many times for the trials and things you're going through that if we had a prophet here' be able to point out to us it ain't God trying you it's because your daddy did this and your mama did that and your grandma did that and your grandfather did that but you what Satan wants to do he always wants to point everything bad that you go through up this way so you'll blame god well come on somebody I've done come to realize a lot of what I go through ain't really got a whole lot to do with my father it's got more to do probably with my mama and my daddy and my grandpa and my uncles and my aunts Lord have mercy it's a wonder I am an absolute outright Heathen it's the grace of God that I'm saved tonight I'm going to say it for the rest of you little angels that think you're so sweet and so honeyfi if it wasn't for the grace of God there wouldn't be a one of us in this building that wouldn't be nothing but a rotten sorry Outcast a bunch of unbelievers come on church or a bunch of cold dead church members but the grace of God has intervened on our behalf not because we're worthy not because we are deserving but amazing Gra Grace how sweet to sound oh my Lord Jesus help us father oh Lord God listen you young people today I don't know whether you come to this church or whether you come you young boys and girls did you realize the things that you're doing if there is another generation your children will be judged for what you do but you see it's this idea of leer de seea I do what I want to do what I do don't affect nobody you just lied it does affect other people praise the lord well after this service tonight we ought to have some of the best people in Carter County and Washington and Sullivan and unoy and every other County in Tennessee my goodness just for the sake of wanting to make it easy on your kids I wish my parents had made a little bit easier on me y'all believe this right okay all right now notice oh my Lord did you realize the things that you're doing if there's another generation your children will be judged for what you do hav you no respect or decency you girls out here wearing these little old shorts and things around you know that's reflecting on your daughter so there was some of these little girls young women that he was talking to wasn't even married yet they didn't even have no kids but they were setting the pattern for the what the girls was going to do now friends who would have ever thought who would have ever thought that in the United States of America that we would come to a spot to where that our L leaders in our government would put tampons in a men's bathroom right yeah who would have ever thought that this transgender thing and I I'm sure that you've noticed it that for several years it was a gay lesbian deal that was the preeminent thing but if you noticed in the last few years what is actually dominated over the top of that is actually the transgender move there's actually some of the gay and lesbian people that really don't go along with this transgender thing because it's overshadowed their move it's actually overshadowed it and they really don't like it so I mean you got a man that walks into a woman's bathroom you've got a man that wants to put on a pair of boxing gloves that's born a biological males he his former legs look like a gorilla and his chest look like a gorilla and he had a big old husky voice like that and I he's squeaky like this and he wants to get out there and find a girl in the rain you love all down scoundrel you you can't beat a man in your game so you got to get in there whoop up on a [Applause] woman and our government from the White House Down will answer to almighty God for what they've brought our nation to not only America but the world come on don't get quiet on me Church Lord have mercy if we go on a few more years what will it be Whoever thought you would go into a Walmart or Lord of Mercy even worse than that going to a restaurant and the thing comes up to take your order with pink fingernails and you can tell by looking at it what it is don't start try to look at me like yall are ignorant that they're around Tri Cities everywhere but of course we can't say nothing about it ah I don't fit in that category I still can say something about it cuz I'm called to preach the gospel amen oh I know all the pronouns and we don't like the he and the she and this and that my Bible tells me male and female create did he them and call their name Adam there is only two genders in the Bible I don't care what the scientists say I don't care what the Democrats say or the Liberal Republicans say according to almighty God there's only two genders and that's male and female anything other then that is a perversion and will go to hell so can you imagine two gay men adopting a child or two lesbian women adopting a child and raising a child in that type of environment and what will that child be and the other one and the other one it's not too hard to tell God's original seat cuzz God's original can always reproduce itself after its own kind so let's put two lisbians together and let them fulfill Genesis one let every seed bring forth after its kind or let's put two men together and let them reproduce let's put two transgenders or 42 whichever way you want to do it and let's watch them reproduce God's word they cannot and they never will amen well glory to God and right in the middle of hell right in the middle of all this sin and debauchery that's going on God is saying I will produce a bride that will stand upon my word out of Leia out of Darkness that people don't even know if they're a man or a woman anymore and they're mutilating little five and six year old kids what in the world is wrong with this nation the damn nation of God awaits it come on Sheldon somebody say Amen Let hell know where you stand tonight let Heaven know where you [Applause] stand well if I get killed after this service it's been good knowing you all if this is my last sermon to preach I guess I can go out with a blaze of glory can I your children will be judged for what you do haven't you no respect or decency you girls out there wearing these little old shorts and things around you know that's reflecting on your daughter did you know your grandmom was a Flopper and your mmy this is Harvard terminology in case you didn't know it your mamy of course girl that's the reason you're a strip teas today certainly what will your children be God said it visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children and their children to three and four generation now let's not leave it out yonder what about our message churches preacher start start adding here and taking away there oh and the first generation they may not see much of a fact but watch the second generation some of them younger men sitting in these message churches to start hybridizing the message of the hour take away a little he and take away I told you the other day I sat down and started just making a list of different preachers that I know of and churches that I know of in the message that don't preach this the way the prophet taught it and they don't preach this the way the prophet taught it and that the way the prophet taught it I thought Lord have mercy what's it going to be what's it going to be for the young preachers sitting there in their church and they hear their their grandpa or their uncles or you know whoever it is teaching it and then them young guys are going to get up and they're always going to do less they're always going to add more or take more from it what's it going to be if the Lord carries another 10 or 15 years will Holiness be accepted in the message churches will we even want the new birth anymore or will we want to just a cold dry-eyed confession well I believe God sent a prophet every devil in hell believes you've got to be born again you've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and that nature of the world has got to [Applause] dieo did you realize my brother every time you do that which is right that will be visited on your children now see this is not just SE the negative side it's SE the positive side simply friends all God wants you to do it's just change the things you're doing learn how to use his law for yours and your children and your grandchildren's advantage it's going to work whether or not you think about it it's going to work either way but Brother David we have a choice we have a choice brother na we have a choice my brothers and sisters which way do we want to use this law of God my my I might have to cut it short tonight I'm not sure if y'all can take his full term to that or not and people today the teenagers out in high school with beer parties and drink and living and little girls living in adultery and little boys and things like that what kind of a generation's coming up after this what makes these little girls act like that their mommy was a flaer their grandmam was a chorus girl and he said he'd visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children and children's children to the third and fourth generation what can you expect anymore you would not believe some of the stories that I have heard from some of our sisters who are in public school what they see and what they have to deal with I'm talking about teachers and those that work in cooking and so on and so on unbelievable where does it come from their mothers the grandmothers brother Donny does it apply spiritual it does so Abraham went and fought a war one day on the direction of God and he comes back to his tent to refresh himself and here this man being Supernatural person shows up by the name of MDC and served Abraham communion and Abraham paid him tithes and God allocated him paying tie to Levi out of Abraham came Isaac out of Isaac came Jacob out of Jacob came Levi fourth generation and it was this if though L paid ties to MDC praise be to God so friends we don't want to do right just for the natural reward now we're not just doing right for ourselves we're doing right for our future posterity if there is none I want to do it if there ain't no tomorrow but when you think of it this way that what I do the way our church goes the way you all go can affect future Generations oh my what you do if there is a coming tomorrow if you have a great grandson your action today will determine what he'll be then wow a great grandson watch this in the rising of the sun he's talking about the seal the spirit of God and the abstract coming back on the title deed when the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like this epileptic child I prayed for a few minutes ago that come through from the grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon the child if God don't stop Humanity the Earth will be annihilated the Bible tells us a Child Left to itself will bring its mother shame right so if preachers quit spanking people and leave the children sheep to go back to the Book of Judges and every man does that which is right in his own eyes I cannot imagine what word of life would turn into in a few years I cannot imagine what evening like Tabernacle in Len Louisiana would turn into Lighthouse for Jesus all these other churches around the world if men of God would let up on preaching hard and just let the people do whatever they want to do and let them start sewing and sewing you understand all these people that have pulled away from the message you understand what they're doing it's not just what they're doing to themselves it's what they're doing to their children and their grandchildren so these folks have pull away from the message in life of brother RAM and call him a false prophet and call you and I all these terrible things that they call us can you imagine what the children are going to call us I can tell you for the people around the message that don't believe in Preachers you'd not believe some of the preacher jokes I have heard from the tape people and say they're following brother brandham brother brandham never seed any such Tommy rot but can you imagine what the children are going to be and what their grandchildren are going to be let's stand if you ain't able you and just said to her while I finish y'all okay can you can you get up kind of leaned against a chair there and get your balance there you go brother Rob just put both hands there bu Sister Sarah put your arm around him there and kind of help him a little oh my woo I brought about 48 pages to church tonight cuz I just thought was going to Breeze through this bad part first I didn't realize he was going to slow me down to Grandma gear on on this not even let us get to the good part so apparently either somebody here present or somebody streaming this needed to hear this really emphasized on tonight now Lord well in this is the direction we'll go next Wednesday night spoken words Original Seed God made every seed after its kind that's his then when he made his Man In His Image was a seed of his word and when Jesus has made flesh the Flesh of the word of God and when we receive the word of God then we become God's word in our flesh see the church should be in that condition so you see what the bride will be when God brings her to the finale at the end time out of her Union with Christ Jesus and the progeny out of that Union you what it'll produce the resurrection and the next phase will be the Millennium it will bring forth of its kind seed word don't you love him let's bow our heads together oh Jesus I'm sure there's more people in here tonight other than myself that wish we would have heard these types of things years ago we would have sowed a lot different Lord father we cannot go backwards and tear out any bad seed or any wrongdoing but what we can do father is so so many good seeds that they just overwhelm our garden Lord as a preacher I realize I have such a responsibility as every other preacher does but especially pastors evangelists come in and they have an influence surely I noticed it when I was in Pentecost that the mainstream of what it seemed like with the groups anyway that we were with the men of the hour seemed to be like the traveling evangelist and they were the ones that people would go here so much when I came to the message and been in it now for over 40 years and especially noticing in the last 5 years or so that seems to be the aspect of the ministry now that is so shaping the mindset of the message it's not evangelist like it was in Pentecost but it's more so the pastors and especially if they stream or Facebook or YouTube or whatever it is that they do and then they are the one on who begin to shape the mindset of the people and then as many Youth Services as we have and we get some of these traveling pastors that will travel around and they want to bring their agenda to the youth and they are reshaping the minds of the youth and they're changing the aspect of the message the focus God I pray you'd help each each preacher to realize we have to answer to you so if I were to die tonight and this church will go on because I believe it's your church and I'm totally replaceable I know that so then whoever would step in here Lord they would have a maybe a different burden a different Vision somewhat but surely the people would not put a man in here unless they felt like it was a man saying what God's Prophet said but the leaders are the ones that can shape the direction that we go if people could only realize how they need to pray for their leaders way more than they do but dear God not only for the preachers but the single men that are here tonight the things that are doing if you T and they get married in a few years and to their Union you gr a little boy through four years that little boy start picking up certain things may every young man here tonight realize what he's doing the way he's living the habits that he has can affect his children grandchildren and even great grandchildren oh Lord God that's why I believe that there will be a bride that will be just as true to this word as your Prophet was when he preached it years and years ago because the seeds that were sown were pure unadulterated bride word so it come from one generation to another we've had all kinds of men and all types of ideologies rais up and it's evident what we produced it's evident because they're more like the man who founded this new move and they're like him and like this man and that man and another man and they make Idols out of the preachers Lord we don't want to make no Idol out of no preacher we want you to be the only one that we worship so father help us to look at it tonight in a double way that as a church we're sewing seeds but as individuals these sisters and they may not totally understand well why can't I wear this and why can't I dress this way why can't I do that and what's wrong with me just cutting my hair a little bit I've still got long hair what difference would an inch make or or two inches what difference would would just a little bit of makeup Mi she don't realize that she may start out with a little bit but her daughter will wear more and then a granddaughter will wear even more so a young man will look at a website that's not becoming to a Son of God to look at and he may well you know it's okay I've got it under control and then he gets married and he has a son and his son goes to feed him this pull it's Indescribable to him he don't even know why he's feeding it toward things that are not right I wonder if his daddy ain't to blame for it help us Jesus help us Jesus but when we also come back to the positive side of this to know Satan has tried his best to annihilate your seed ever since it came in the beginning once it became spiritual through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he thought he destroyed it in the days of Catholicism when luer came with justification he thought he destroyed it because the Reformation basically turned into a war then you sent another and another but Lord God you also have sowed good seeds and they will come up Hallelujah and now you've got a bunch of people on the Earth again with the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that your first generation children had in Acts 2 Hallelujah the prophet tells us and mighty God unveiled before us in Philadelphia 1964 the same kind of people act in the same way with the same experience the same baptism same signs same wonders same emotion doing the same because he is the same Hallelujah Lord God may that be our inheritance oh Lord and then if I going to influence my children my grandchildren Lord not only in the natural sense but but the Sheep here the that you've given me Lord God let me influence them in the right way with Zeal and determination and desire to serve you Lord God yes won't you grant it father we worship you tonight Lord we worship you tonight father when the cold of fire touch the prophet making him as pure as pure could be and the voice of God said who go for us then he answered Lord here am I send me speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I'll be quick to answer thee speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord s me Millions now in sin and shame are dying listen to to their sad and bitter cry hasten brother hasten to their rescue quickly answer Master here am I come we just raise our hands as a sign of surrender as we sing it together speak my Lord oh speak my Lord yes Father speak and out I don't know how many more time I can preach Lord how much more I'll have in life but father if you could use me Lord help me Jesus oh Lord I I don't know what I'll leave behind if I go by the way of the Grave may I be able to influence young people may I be able to influence younger preachers Lord that they want to stay with the truth speak my Lord oh speak my [Music] Lord speak and we be quick to answer Thee thank you Lord oh yes Lord speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord send me Victory in Jesus [Music] I heard an old old Story how a savior came from [Music] Glory I heard about his groaning of his Precious Blood Aton me then I repented of my sins and won the victory
