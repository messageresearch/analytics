I trusted my own strength, but it was sinking insane. So I'll put my ruins into your hands and watch you restore them like only you can. So if the Lord fills the house, nobody can tear it down. If the Lord builds the house, nobody can tear it down. When it's built on his name, there's nothing going to shake his ground. If the Lord builds the house, nobody can tear it down. [Music] The bricks may be weather through storm and through fire, but where God holds together, it stands firm every time. Cuz my life is anchor on this all the truth that we got holds together. No, it can't be moved. If the Lord builds a house, nobody can tear it down. If the Lord builds a house, nobody can tear it down.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? My God is so much bigger than troubles I face. [Music] Why would I hunger for power or riches or fame?

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] How many believes that though you aren't? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It don't make any difference what the devil puts before us. By God's grace, we will overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be of good cheer. I have overcome the world." &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I'd already studied out for tonight uh what I thought we needed to hear. So, Carol and I went out for lunch today and I have the Jerusalem Post on my phone. So, while we're waiting for our food to come, we're sitting there just talking and we'll read news together and things like that. So, I opened up the Jerusalem Post and I saw where Israel is u fixing to bring 60,000 more of their troops in. And I was reading a little bit down in the article to Carol and my eyes fell on two words. And just like that, God give me what you're going to hear tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 55:1 to the chief musician on Naginos Mascu, a psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, oh God, and hide not thyself from my supplication. Attend unto me and hear me. I mourn and my complaint and make a noise. Wow. He must have been pretty low, wasn't he? Attend unto me and hear me. I mourn in my complaint and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me. So his enemy was accusing him of all kinds of things and saying had done this and done that and the other and in wrath they hate me. My heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me. Now wait a minute. Isn't this the psalmist David? The giant killer, the dancer, the shoutter, the great victorious King David. Oh, you mean David felt like this? This is the other side of David. You see, fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror, horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove, for then would I fly away and be at rest." And I'd like to be remembered tonight as we pray. Lord Jesus, I imagine if these people, any of them have been serving you very long. They've experienced maybe not all these verses at one time, but at least some of them. Lord God, we're so thankful that you're mindful of us in such circumstances and events. Lord God, I pray that you would help us tonight as we look into your word. We thank you for the opportunity that's been given to us, Lord, that we can be able to assemble ourselves together. It's one of the highlights of our lives to come together in the presence of God and with the saints of God together. And Lord, to hear your word as you bring it to us. I pray that you'd help me to get out of the way. Father, you see we have a lot of sickness going on. Different ones sick, Lord, and can't be here. And we pray that you'd be mindful of them. Lord, you see our brother Steve Newsome was called away and Lord God, we're praying for his family and for the church family. Father, that you would just help each of us. We certainly do not mourn and don't feel bad for him. Why Why should we where he's gone to? But it's just our loss, Lord. So we pray that you'd help us tonight. You see, Sister Patty, Father Cooper, and if you don't move for her, Lord, it'll only be just a matter of days and she'll be gone as well. We know it's part of life. We know it, Lord. And we realize until you come, this is the cycle that we're in. And Lord, Carol and I had the funeral at Greenville on Monday morning, come home straight away, changed our clothes, went to the hospital, and then brother Steve passed later in the evening. As I sat there, dear God, by his bed, and I said it within myself, death, I hate you. &gt;&gt; I hate you with everything that's in me. But yet at the same time, I had to come back and quote what the prophet said. Thank God for the open door called death. What would it be if we laid in a miserable condition like we've seen many of our friends and loved ones maybe for a week or a few days? What if they laid there for months or years on end? Lord God, we're longing and waiting when there will be no more deaths. We believe you send your word to prepare us, Father, to make us ready. Speak to us tonight, Lord God. We ask in the name of Jesus. I want to speak to you tonight on battle fatigue syndrome. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; you can be seated. Battle fatigue syndrome. Let me read to you now what it means. Battle fatigue syndrome, also known as combat fatigue or battle fatigue, refers to a range of psychological and physical symptoms that arise from the intense stress and trauma experienced during combat. This condition is often characterized by emotional symptoms, irritability, anxiety, mood swings, feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Physical symptoms, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, cognitive symptoms, difficulty concentrating, indecision, and a sense of disconnection from surroundings. Now, what struck me today whenever I was reading this article from the Jerusalem Post was that Israel is going into what they're saying will be their last phase of the war which started in October the 7th going on two years now. and they've rotated their reservist and they've rotated different soldiers and so that they could give them a break to go back to their family. And they're saying that many of their IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, their soldiers, that they're having a really hard time with with this uh symptoms and dealing with all of this because of over and over and day in and day out. not just in the battle but dealing with their image in the way the majority of the world looks at them. So Israel has very unfair requirements that's required of them by the UN and by the majority of the world. You see the world requires of Israel that they feed their enemies. the world requires of Israel different standards. It's always a different standard for Israel versus anybody else. They're not requiring that of Putin. They are not requiring that of the Houthis and Yemen. They did not require that of Iran. They didn't require it of America. They didn't require it of Afghanistan or of Iraq, of Korea or Vietnam. On and on and on I could go. But they do require it of Israel. So we have people in our nation then that are protesting wearing Palestinian flags, Hamas flags, flags of Mexico, flags of Venezuela, flags of Honduras, flags of Brazil, flags of Chile. My opinion is whatever flag they're wearing, they should send them there. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If they like that better, adios, amigos. &gt;&gt; Need help with the tickets? I'll donate the first thousand. &gt;&gt; Anybody here willing to give 5, 10, 15, 20? All right, we done bought a few tickets already here tonight. But you can imagine now if you are Israel and you're you're you're losing your people, you've you've some of them have lost legs from IUD. Some of them have lost eyes. Some of them have lost arms. Some of them have lost all kinds of different things. And then they're constantly being under this onslaught of the media worldwide around the world every day of their life. You can imagine how difficult that it would be. So they're dealing with this battle related syndrome that their soldiers are having a hard time finding a real drive to get back into the battle because they're dealing with battle fatigue syndrome. And as I read that, I don't know how to explain to you how inspiration works, but just for a moment, it's like I just saw it right before me that here these are some of the greatest soldiers and they have the greatest army by the help of America with a lot of it. I I'll I'll have to say that and be honest with the military that they have and they can have the greatest successes of any army just about this in the world. But here are some of the greatest trained, the greatest military, the greatest generals, and yet they're finding themselves dealing with this battle fatigue to where they're having a hard time to want to get back into the battle and thinking, "What's the use?" I don't know if any of you saw it or not, but uh Hamas released just a week or two ago one of the hostages and the poor guy was nothing but just skin stretched over bones and they gave him a little old can of beans or something like that. How many actually saw that on YouTube? Anybody already know about? All right. So, they showed a picture of this guy and he was absolutely pitiful. So they gave him this can of beans and a bottle of water and that was to last him two to three days just depending on what they said, you know, and they could change it at any time. And they also brought him a shovel. He's inside of one of these tunnels in Gaza. And they demanded of him that he he's lost about 40% of his body weight, of his muscle mass, everything. and they demanded of him that he start digging his grave because they're planning on killing him. &gt;&gt; But now the world looks at that and the world thinks it's okay. &gt;&gt; Do you understand, friends, what we're looking at? Pre-tribulation anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing of the sixth seal of the antichrist that will change the morning of the rapture will change everything. By noon, the world will be a different world than what anyone has ever seen. By the 6:00 news on the day of the rapture, Satan will have already moved. He will not have one day, Harry, not one day to lose. He's already moving in the background tonight. The mechanics of Satan's agenda are already here. The people protesting in Portland, Oregon, the people protesting in Los Angeles, the people protesting in San Fran, and in the different leftist people all over our nation are already moved under the anointing of the sixth seal. It's already here. &gt;&gt; It's already here to kill the Jews. And yet they say from the river to the sea. But whenever the reporters ask them what does that even mean? They don't have an idea. Well, let me tell you what it means. It means there want to annihilate every Jew. It is the charter of Hamas that they will not be one of them left as long as there's a Jew left alive. It's the charter of the infantada to kill and annihilate every one of them. And we have American citizens that are saying that's what needs to happen. Don't you understand? The same spirit that was here in the 40s that Hitler spearheaded is now being spearheaded on our universities and our campuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; And under freedom of speech. Now, if I say anything from this pull pit that the media don't like, they'll crucify me. They'll call my name and my picture will be on every major thing. We've done been through that. We know what it is. &gt;&gt; Because and they twist our words and do this and that and the other. And yet they will do everything they can to try to destroy you. And known Jew haters, they will let them live and won't even show pictures of truth and reality. Why? They can't help it. They're under that destructive anointing. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell hell tonight, you cannot destroy God's bride. Neither can you destroy God's 144,000. I don't care how much you hate him, how much you dislike him, you'll never be able to do it till God says you can. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; but you imagine that you're dealing with the psychological battle and you're dealing with fighting and knowing the whole world is against you. You look at your comrades. They've lost hands, arms, eyes. They've lost legs. They've lost all kinds of things. For what? For what? When the majority of the world hates you. And they are surrounded on every side by the Arabs on every side. And then their number one ally, the United States of America. And they know all it takes is one presidential election. and it's turned totally around again. I don't care how much Trump does for them. I don't care how much the Republicans and the Congress and the Republicans in the Senate, once it flips, it'll go right back the way it was going before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes no difference to me where you're a Democrat or a Republican or you don't even vote. Satan controls both sides of the aisle. And I'll tell you one thing, there's only one head that's ever going to bring peace on this earth. And it ain't Trump. And it ain't the Democrats. And it ain't the liberals. And it ain't Hamas. It's King Jesus. &gt;&gt; I said it's King Jesus. But now, let me not take all of my time just on that, but to bring it across to where we would see when we look around that as the people of God, we are experiencing battles like never before. We're under things like most of us have never been under in our lives. Some of us from our children, some from our grandchildren, some from ranks inside our own ranks, some from the outside of persecuting and bringing charges against the message and the messenger. And yet we know that it must come. And if we're not careful, we will get under this battle syndrome to where we lose our desire to fight. And we not only lose our desire to fight, but even more importantly than that, we lose our desire to praise. And I'm going to tell you tonight, there's one way that you're going to be able to maintain your desire to fight. and that is that you equally understand that you must always keep your desire to praise God. Not just praise him when you feel like it, but praise him when you don't. You don't just praise him when you understand what God does, but you praise him when you don't understand what God does. You praise him whenever you're able to comprehend his will. and you praise him. May I say even more so when you don't comprehend his will. Now that takes real victory. Now I want you to notice again in Psalm 69:1 that David said to the chief musician upon Shash Hanim. Now don't you notice different location alto together. A psalm of David, save me, oh God, for the waters are come into my soul. I sink in deep mire where there is no standing. I am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me. I am weary of my crying. My throat is dried. My eyes fail when I wait for my God. They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head. They that would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. Then I restored that which I took not away. So to even make peace and find peace and resolve this situation that David was not even guilty of, they accused him of taking this and taking that and taking that. David said, "I never even took it, but I actually restored to the person." They said, "I took this and this. I never even took it, but I restored it to him. I thought it might bring a little bit of peace, but alas, it did not." Now, can you imagine the psalmist how he was in such a straight and he's trying to search and reach a place of peace in his own heart and be able to arrive to that thing with God. Now, remember, he's the great king by now and he's enjoyed great blessings of God. But the enemies have multiplied around him in such a place that they're robbing David of the joy of the very thing that he longed for for decades of his life. So the enemy, if he can't stop you from going and becoming what God wants you to be, then when you arrive in the plane where God has ordains you to walk, then the enemy will come and try to overwhelm you with so much stuff that it robs your joy of being what God ordained you to be. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you tonight, I get sick of that nonsense of the devil. You know, we we know that we certainly are not the first ones to ever go through these types of things. And I'm reminded as I I went whenever Carol and I come back home and I went downstairs to start studying. And I, as I said, I don't know how to explain it to you, but just all of a sudden, it was like the floodgates started opening up to me and the inspiration coming. It was coming faster than I could write it down. So, I just started putting down notes and notes and another note and another note and scriptures and quotes and it's just it's just like an explosion when it comes that way. And I was just praying, God, please help me to not miss it. Please help me. I wasn't asking him to slow down. It's asking me to speed up. Help me, Lord, that I can keep up with you. But as I begin to look at it and more and more of these characters of the scripture began to came to me, but one that so stuck out to my heart was Elijah. And the prophet tells us about Elijah. I tell you, Elijah and his nerves on edge anyhow. Always felt sorry for him. His nerves was about ready to break anyhow. And that great pound from Jezebel finished the stroke. Then he run and went into the wilderness and laid underneath the juniper tree. Oh, that experience of the juniper tree. Now, there's many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree. Now, what was Elijah experiencing? He was experiencing the title of my message tonight, battle fatigue syndrome. So now he had fought against the prophets. He had killed the prophets. He had stood up and prophesied of the word. And now he's at the breaking point. And we know that the prophet took this and he broke it down and said that actually Elijah wound up having a nervous breakdown. So he comes and he identified three stages of where Elijah was. Now watch he said he run and went into the wilderness and laid under the juniper tree. All that experience under the juniper tree. There's many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree. I get myself under there many times to a place that you don't know what to do. You're frustrated. Frankly, I'm right under it right now. I want you to notice this year, 1959. I'm right under it right now. If you notice, Brother Brandham, he goes through it in different years of his life. He's 156. He's in 159, back in 61, end of 62, comes through it again, middle of 63. And you notice he comes to the juniper tree time and time again. So, it's not a one-time experience. Why would it be that way? because the battlefield fatigue so builds up on a real true soldier. Now, this does not apply to recliner Christians. It does not apply to Christians that are not even in the battlefield. People that don't even see the need of going to church. They just stay home and press play. So, they don't have a clue as to what we are talking about. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Notice he said, "You know, people under the jour juniper tree is like Elijah. They like to sleep. I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world." People so tired they they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions. If he would have said that in 1959, Lord have mercy. What would he say in 2025? &gt;&gt; My goodness. filling the insane institutions in 1959. Of course, of now, we got insane people treating the insane people. Oh my. Well, that's that's exactly the truth. Notice they're in such a condition till they don't know what they do believe and what they want. Now, you talking about a mess. Whenever a person gets to a spot that they don't know what they do believe, so they do believe it, but they don't know what they do believe. Wow. I mean, that is far out. They don't they do believe something, but they don't even know what they do believe. And then they're at the spot also to where they don't know what they want. So, they're looking for happiness. They're searching. They're looking. So, they tried drinking. They tried this drug. Then, a new drug comes out and they try it. And that don't bring them to that high. So, they mix that drug with another drug. And then they mix that one with this one. And why? Because there's something in them. They're longing. Let me tell you something, friend. The worst day in your life as a Holy Ghost fil Christian is greater than the best day a sinner ever has. Any day out of the week, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and even on leap here, 24 hours a day, the worst day you have in your life is better than a sinner will ever have his entire life. &gt;&gt; Now, notice he said they're just laying there. They don't know what to do. And it's a sad sight. There he laid under the juniper tree. He didn't know what to do. His nerves was broke. He was shaking. Listen to great Elijah. He was shaking. He was crying. No doubt he was in a terrible. We're talking about a prophet, a false prophet killer. We're talking about a man that could stand there and call fire out of heaven &gt;&gt; and then turn right around and watch God come of the mighty vindication of his presence and stop the rain, said, "It ain't going to rain till I call for it." &gt;&gt; And now this man, what would you have thought if you would have run up on the juniper tree and seen him sitting there shaking and quivering and he didn't even know what to do and maybe screaming all Lord have mercy? What in the world's wrong with him? He's got the conditions of battlefield syndrome. &gt;&gt; He don't know what to do. He don't know where he's at. He thinks he's the only one left. &gt;&gt; You see, when some of our message preachers and message churches go to preaching that is about them and two, three more churches are the only one that's the bride. They've got battlefield syndrome. &gt;&gt; They don't know who they are. They get in that spirit like Elijah. That is not a complimentary trait to have. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice there he laid under the juniper tree, didn't know what to do. His nerves was broke, shaking. He was crying, no doubt, and a terrible condition. Many of us hit those places, especially after a Mount Carmel experience. God has to do something for every man that comes under the juniper tree or he'll go to pieces. He has to do. Oh Lord, he has to do it. If his servants laying under the tree under don't you know what to do? He's carried out his commission. Elijah said, "Oh Lord, let me die." My goodness, I've had those feelings after I come out of a meeting and look like I've tried and preached and begged and persuaded and seen the angel of God sweep through a meeting and do signs and wonders and sat in a car on the outside and hear him cry and say it was nothing but psychology. You understand what brother Brandham was feeling whenever he would hear these reports or read it in a newspaper article or hear one of his best friends say it. And Satan will always make sure you hear them comments. &gt;&gt; Satan will try his best to keep testimonies away from you. But he'll just certainly certainly make sure you hear complaints, griping, groaning, and complaining and going on and on and on. Praise the Lord. Sure does. That's just the way that he does it. But you imagine now the prophet he said and you hear it and it was nothing but psychology. There was nothing to it. Nothing to that. It's all nonsense. Oh then I crawled under the juniper tree and I think Lord why did you let me do it for? What can it be done? But we all hit these experiences but the mercy of Jehovah to his servant. God knows your trials. Somebody ought to be saying amen. God knows your trials. Just know this. He knows all about it. But I'm glad to tell you tonight, friends, if you're there, God has got a juniper tree for you. And God has also still got angels. You remember under that juniper tree, don't you? And the prophet of God said that God said to his angel, I want you to that the angel with the softest hand, I want you to go down there and start caressing the brow. Oh, I feel like having church tonight. I want the angel with the softest hand to go down there and start caressing the brow of my servant. You imagine that prophet as he woke up and then God sent the best cook out of the angelic band down there and he started making a little bit of ho cakes and on the fire. My my oh Elijah they had to wake him up maybe shaking quivering tore all the pieces. What was it? I don't feel fatigued. He didn't feel like fighting no more. God said that's all right. You don't need to fight right now. You're my servant. You're my son. You've stood true. You've stood faithful. Your children have turned away. Your grandchildren's turned away. Your loved ones have turned away. But I'm here, child. I'm mindful of you, child. Somebody hear me tonight. I've sent down an angel with a salt hand. But you know what? If we're not careful, when we get so low, we will turn away God's mercy and his grace. God will anoint a servant to bring something to you that will encourage you and you just sat there like a bump on a pickle when you ought to be saying, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord." You sent an angel tonight with a soft hand to caress me, Lord. You sent an angel with a message, oh God, that would help me through this. Father, you see, I'm fatigued and I've got this syndrome. My emotions are all tore up, Lord. My imagination and everything about me is tore up. Jesus, I'm your bride. I know I'm your elected. I know. But Lord, I need help. It's not a shame, friends, when you wind up under the juniper tree. Just climb up there and lay down and let God send them angels down there to go to ministering to you. Hallelujah. Oh my. And today we see the institutions filled with the people of God. You see, Christians are not exempt from some of the exact same things everybody else out here deals with. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at me like y'all don't get nervous. Y'all don't get upset. Y'all don't get tore up. Y'all don't get down. You don't get weary. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh my. Notice he says, "And today we see the institutions filled with people of God, nervous breakdowns, tensions. Oh, it makes us all want to run to the juniper tree." I think we could express it like the old colored lady said down south when she'd been hit by an automobile and a car had struck her and they asked her if she wanted to sue for damages. She said, "Lo, no, child. I don't need damage. I need repair." Oh, glory to God. I don't need damage. I need repair. Maybe some of y'all need to say that. Lousy know, child. I don't need no more damage. I need repair. How many feels like tonight's a good night to get repair? Let me tell you something. I'm heading you up to the greatest doctor that's ever been. Hallelujah. Dr. Jesus is here tonight. And if he diagnoses your case with battlefield fatigue, he can not only treat you, but he can heal you. He can deliver you. He can rub your brow. He can feed you with divine anointed word and give you strength to climb out from under that juniper tree and say, "Where is that devil? Where is that devil?" Hallelujah. And one moment you felt like dying, the next moment you feel like, "Glory to God, here I am. I'm ready to go. I'm fed. I'm rubbed. And I'm ready." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lousy know, child, I don't need damage. I need repair. I think that's about the way the church is tonight. A repair. the place under the juniper tree so we can be alone. I preach to tired people, nervous people. Pray for nervous people. And it's a nervous, neurotic, upset world right now that we're living in. Everybody's on the edge. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Can you imagine? As I said, what do you say if he was here and see road rage? &gt;&gt; That wasn't even in the vocabulary 1959. It's not been in yours that that long. The last few years, people pulling out guns, shooting at one another, doing this and that and the other. Everybody's living right on the edge. Is that true, church? &gt;&gt; Do you understand tonight? You think, "Oh, Lord, you know, I I ain't really that blessed. I ain't that blessed." How many's in your right mind tonight? &gt;&gt; The rest of you insane. How many's in your right mind &gt;&gt; and you're wanting to count your blessings? We're living in a crazy world. &gt;&gt; People's been saved, &gt;&gt; but you got your right mind. &gt;&gt; How many loves Jesus with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. How many's got a desire to serve him? &gt;&gt; Okay, you want to leave your hands up? Fine. How many's got a desire to go to heaven &gt;&gt; in the first exit out, which is the rapture? How many loves Jesus and his word? How many loves the saints of God? How many wants to be ready on the rapture morning and you're wondering what you've got to praise him for? All them things ought to make you jump up and spin around in your chair and say, "I've got so much to thank him for. I am so blessed. &gt;&gt; Oh my, the insane institutions are filling up. The hospitals are filling up. Juvenile crime is on the rampage. And it wasn't nothing then compared to what it is now. &gt;&gt; We're living in a terrible time. Brother Tommy Hicks, I hear, is in a heart attack overworked. As I said the other night, God's people needs a juniper tree. Notice what he calls the juniper tree. &gt;&gt; Rest. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, don't ever one of you start pulling out your phone right now and making reservations down in Florida on Expedia for the next eight months. &gt;&gt; Some of you just looking for an excuse to go on a trip anywhere. I ain't talking about you going to Dollywood. I ain't just talking about you going to Disney. I ain't just talking about you going to Six Flags or going here or there, there. I'm talking about entering into a place in Christ Jesus. Oh, sure you might get a little bit of benefit by getting away from your job and your work and so on. I hear there's of a thing called vacation. I never had too many of my life, but I hear there is such a thing. But I'm laying mine out for long term after a while. Uhhuh. But you know what? You can go and be gone every week somewhere. But if you never enter that place spiritually, you still don't have what I'm talking about tonight. But it's something down inside your soul. It don't make no difference what Satan does, what mama does, what daddy does, what your neighbor does. You have got a rest that's beyond you. It's beyond your mama. It's beyond your daddy. It's joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Let's just wait on the Lord. Then we renew our strength as we wait on him. Don't try to do it all. I remember staying on the prayer line for seven days and nights, eating my meals at the pulpit, determined I would pray for everyone that come before I sat down. There were 10 times more on the last night than there was when I started. Then I almost died. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I couldn't sleep. Didn't know where I was at hardly. I was so tired and weary. Doesn't pay to do that. Jesus doesn't want us to do that. He wants us to take care of ourselves. &gt;&gt; Now you realize Jesus won't do this part. &gt;&gt; Jesus won't take care of myself. Jesus won't take care of yourself. &gt;&gt; So you know whose responsibility it is? &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Whose responsibility is it for me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Me. &gt;&gt; But you imagine now some of you brothers that are painters and this and that and you have to go go. No, I ain't I ain't coming. Nope. No. You imagine how hard it is for a preacher church of our size. Sickness never stops. deaths, hospital visits, funerals, never stops. &gt;&gt; Imagine how hard it is for me and my wife to find any kind of time to rest. And even if I do go somewhere and I carry that box in my pocket off the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; And Satan loves nothing better than if he can't stop sons of God and men of God from preaching and laboring cause them to overwork themsel. So what will he do with all kinds of anxieties and troubles? And you see any pastor that really loves his people when they go through stuff, he goes through it, &gt;&gt; which is the way it's supposed to be. So what does he do? Increases your trouble, &gt;&gt; which is increasing mine &gt;&gt; automatically. &gt;&gt; Well, what am I supposed to do? Are we supposed to come to you? Yes, I'd be so offended if you didn't. But what do I need to do? What do you need to do? Somehow we got to figure out a place and all the duress and all the trouble to still find a, you know, a little bit way to visit under the juniper tree because if we don't, he will crack us up. He will absolutely wear you out with your children or your grandchildren or your neighbors or this doctrine in the message or that doctrine in the message. All a lot of it is is to try to stress out the bride to where the bride is so worried weary and worry has no virtue in it. Absolutely none. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of you will say amen to that quote and walk right out them doors and worry the same amount you did before you come in. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I guess it comes down, do we believe that quote or not? &gt;&gt; Now sometimes when you go to visit a doctor, you know they have to give you shock therapy. Notice he says, "Some people think that God's prophets ought to continually be bombarding away all the time, but God wants them to come aside." You know, some of us eat and eat and never exercise. Others are overex exercised and don't get a chance to eat. We sat in these conventions and eat the word of God and the goodness of go of God and then go out sassy and fat. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother. &gt;&gt; So that's what a convention can do for you or a youth camp or a banquet or whatever it is, a revival meeting. It can actually make you sassy and fat. &gt;&gt; Isn't that an awesome quote? I wouldn't take that right there from nobody else except a vindicated prophet. I don't mind tell you that right now. I don't care how good the pastor was. I'd say I question that. I ain't questioning this. Then you go out sassy and fat and never say nothing about it. We should go out and use that energy and those testimonies to the glory of the Lord Jesus. You know, a lot of people think that a prophet ought to go out like a rocket. If he goes out like a rocket, he will soon fall like a rock. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Ain't that awesome? If he goes out like a rocket, he will soon fall like a rock. And remember Elijah, God in his mercy. Here come Elijah under the juniper tree. And he was able to visit the doctor's office and the doctor the doctor brought him a cure. Peculiar what God will use. For some it's a soft gentle hand. &gt;&gt; For others it's another hand turned around swatting them where they sat down. Wham wham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz they become numb, desensitized. They don't need another soft hand on their brow. just puts them into deeper sleep, but they need a gospel spanking &gt;&gt; to kind of get them out of that old layer of the sea of coldness, you know. Oh my, you know, as as the eagle does whenever he goes to developing on this stage of his life and he goes up in the mountain and he goes beating his his beak and beating it and beating it in order to get that crust off of him because he's getting into that stage of molting and he has to really put himself through a difficult time. But when he comes out, he renews his youth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we need a revan. Sometimes we need a beat beating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you imagine John the Baptist church as he gets into that time that he's done what God commissioned him to do. But the prophet said John his eyes, the prophet John was kindly filmed over. He was had the spirit of Elijah. And Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree. And John had a breakdown in the prison. So how would you have accepted that in your day? The prophet messenger of your day had a nervous breakdown and was now questioning his own message. So he sends two disciples and say, "Are you the one that we're supposed to look for?" John's not really sure. He's really tore up now. He's he's afraid that he's missed it somehow. Can you imagine? And Jesus didn't rebuke him. Just Jesus didn't say send him a message back and tell him I am so ashamed of him. I cannot believe that he would do this. He introduced me and now he's even questioning whether I'm the word or not. &gt;&gt; He knows how to deal with this, don't he? &gt;&gt; Oh my. He was a highpitched prophet them nerves on edge and his eagle eye filmed over. He said, "Go see if I have been wrong." questioning his own message from God. What happened to him? Battlefront syndrome. He just saw beside himself. Oh God, I've missed it. I've missed it. Now this is the end of my ministry. I've introduced the wrong man. You said, "Why would he do that, Brother Donn?" He said, "There's one among you. I'll tell you one thing. He's going to do this and that and the other." Glory to God. John had in his mind what he was going to do. Jesus come along just being pushed around by the world. They laughed at him. They made fun of him. He said this is I'll tell you one thing. His fan is in his hand. He's thoroughly purging the floor. And John must have thought, "Glory to God, he's coming. He'll turn them Romans upside down." &gt;&gt; And when he heard what Jesus was doing, he said, "Oh no, I've missed it. I've missed it. I've I've introduced the wrong man. My ministry is ruined. I made a horrible mistake. So he says, "Boys, go down and ask him, are you sure you want us to aren't you afraid they'll embarrass you?" I can't help it. I've got to have an answer. Praise God. I don't know about you, I'm glad when we get in these spots, Jesus is still merciful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I heard a song today. I was over here at the church doing some work this morning and I heard a song as I started back home and it was it was the title of it a million a million reasons and they start out whoever it was wrote it they started out you know I'm this and I'm falling shortcomings and I'm this and that and the other and they said I've given Jesus at least a million reasons why he shouldn't love me but he comes back every time and says I still love you the same I thought praise be to God. Maybe I haven't given him a million, but I've surely given him a lot of them. Aren't you glad our mistakes and our juniper trees don't change how much he loves us? Now, it will people find out you're going through something tough in your life. Well, my goodness, I thought you stronger than that. I sure never thought you'd ever get sick. You mean to tell me you're taking aspirin? Lord have mercy. I can't believe you take Tylenol for pain. I can't believe it. I thank God for everything science has done to bring pain relief. I don't need much of it myself so far. But I'll tell you one thing. I've seen enough of the children of God suffer. I'm grateful for what they can do to help us through the hard times of life. Not only the natural painkiller, but I'm talking about the spiritual one, the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You imagine the Lord Jesus getting weary. The prophet said it this way. How can a man stand there tired and weary, dust all over him from his journey and say, "Lazarus, come for." And we might think, man, he stood there like a a Julius Caesar or an Alexander the Great or a Tommy of Egypt. But if we would have looked at Jesus and probably been sweaty and tired and sweat, you know, and the dust clinging to his body and maybe have to stand up and kind as us come forth. Them devils down here say, "Are you kidding me? We've heard Pharaoh say stuff. We've heard this man stands up and that little puny weak guy standing up there weary tired and he's going to say something and all of a sudden and the prophet of God tells us if he had not called Lazarus name the general resurrection would have took place right then cuz he had power not only over Lazarus but all the rest of them. &gt;&gt; But how did he despict himself? Not as a great gladiator, not as a man who would stand around and his muscles bumping up and all that sort of thing, but a weak, puny, frail human being. You imagine, he said he lived and talked to need. How can a man that could call the dead to life hang younger at the cross? Cruy marked, made fun of, spit on, hanging there, great big spit hanging on his face, thorns on his head, and scream for mercy. You imagine a kid, much less God that spit on his face and that spit running down his face, a general, a god. Lord God and scream for mercy. My God. My God. Imagine his screams and cries that day would have broke the heart of near the hardestarted sinner that would have standing there. It must have been so pitiful. Hey Harry, because he was a dying lamb. It was not an actress. He was not a Hollywood actor. &gt;&gt; It was dying in shame and weakness hanging on his juniper tree. Now remember it was a cedar tree as far as the wood, but I'm talking about spiritual metaphor hanging on his tree. But instead of getting an angel with a soft hand, instead of getting fresh bread, the angels turned. Father God turned his back on him. Lord God, again, he says, "Now tired and weary, he goes back and takes this opportunity for a little rest while the ship is crossing the sea." I wonder how many times Jesus got so weary. Let me hurry and bring it on down. Watch the prophet as he shares a few things about himself. He's hung out whenever he got so tired out discerning and praying for the people and stuff. And he said, "I woke up and I'd stopped and I couldn't get to myself and I had my hands out the window and I was in a cow pasture." And this is after he leaves the meetings in Arkansas. He runs off the road into a cow pastor and he has his hands stretched out of his truck window. And I had my hands out the window saying, "Only believe, sister. That's the only thing you have to do. Just believe." And I said, "What's the matter with me?" I got out. I done run off the road out into a cow pastor sleep on the road. And I come home and oh my when I got home there was before we kept the people from the house and it was lined up 150 to 200 of them. Now you imagine he leaves that meeting and when he gets home he's got people lined up the street at his house 150 to 200. I don't blame him. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; I would have been there too. &gt;&gt; You come in and you're so weary you'll hardly know where you're at. I woke up here not long ago right out in the middle of the floor holding a pillow in my arms saying only believe brother that's the only thing you have to do is just believe. My wife woke me up I was out on the floor so tor up you know and tired and I just couldn't go any farther and I had this pill in my hand said now just believe brother that's all you had to do. Oh I don't know it gets pretty rough. See, but what it is, I'm trying to do something for him and I want to represent him to the people. Oh Lord, I wonder how many times for our sake he wound up under that juniper tree and nearly died. He gives other examples about himself being under the juniper tree. One of them, of course, was his wife and his baby. Notice the guys on the road to Emmus and he said they went along the road saying well I guess life is not worth living. We believe that he was the Messiah. Can you imagine now Peter, James, John went back to fishing and the guys to Emmas they was going back home wherever they come from and they thought we've been deceived. We've been tricked. This Jesus, we thought he was the Messiah, but now the man's dead. All of our hopes was tied in this one man. Oh, praise God. But he found him in the way. Oh, we believed it was the Messiah. How could that man that raised from the dead ever stand there and let the high priest make fun of him? How could that man who could see vision after vision ever let a Roman soldier put a rag around his face, hit him on the head, and say, "If thou be a prophet, tell us who hit you." How could he scream for mercy on the cross seeing that he could raise up the dead? Oh, it was a discouraging moment. And those discouraging times comes to every believer to test you, to try you, to see if you really do believe. Every son that cometh to God must first be tested child training. And there'll be some of you here tonight, no doubt, will go through that same testing. And I can see from some of the expressions on the faces of my patients tonight. Now, you see, I also am a doctor. That's my initials. Dr. Donny Reagan. Some of you are sick with this syndrome and most of you are distraught. You've been so deflated by people and issues and things around you. You've lost some of your joy. Some of you have lost your clap. Instead of clapping, your hands are on the back of the seat and you just stand there as long as you can stand. And then you sat down and then you're just trying to sing and you're trying to do everything you can to to be a good solid Christian. But I've got some therapy for you &gt;&gt; now. Walgreens does not have this prescription. Okay? CVS, your favorite pharmacy, whoever it is, Walmart. I was unable to fax it to them this evening because they would have never understood what I'm fixing to share with you. &gt;&gt; How many needs it? How many wants it? &gt;&gt; Is the bottle got your name on it tonight? &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 33:29. Happy art thou, oh Israel. Now remember many of the promises of the Old Testament that were given to Israel are also given to the Gentile overcomers in the New Testament. Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee, oh people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, who is the sword of thy excellency, and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places. &gt;&gt; There's dose number one. Now, I am hoping tonight with all of my heart that I can overdose you so much so that some of you may walk out of here tonight so drunk on the Holy Ghost and so intoxicated on the promises of God that you go looking for that devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may have drugged yourself in, but I'm hoping you're going to fly high on your way out. Now listen to me. We must take the stand on God's promises and God's word and let God's word minister to us. Does this sermon have your name on it tonight? Psalm 47 and1 to the chief musician of song for the sons of Kora. I want you to notice this. Remember who Kora was? You remember who Kora was in the Bible? Kora who withtood God's prophet. But here were some of his sons that were faithful to the message even though their daddy left the message and stood against God's prophet. But they were sons of Kora, but more importantly, they were sons of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may have some reproach to bear tonight. You may have some, you know, things that would make you kind of hang your head, but it's all going to depend upon which message you want to hear. If you're a son of Kora tonight or a daughter of Kora, it doesn't mean that has to be your identity because this song can have your name on it. &gt;&gt; Oh, clap your hands. All ye people, shout unto God with the voice of triumph. Clap your hands, oh ye people. Shout unto God with the voice of triumph. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Psalm 47:2. For the Lord most high is terrible. Ah, here we go. The Lord most high is terrible, but not to you, just to your enemies. The Lord most high is terrible. He is a great king over all the earth. He shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet. He shall choose our inheritance for us. Oh, glory to God. He shall choose my inheritance. He chose me not to be a foolish virgin, but to be bride. He chose me not to go in tribulation period. I believe he chose me to go in the rapture. It was not my choice, your choice, your choice. But according to the Bible, the Lord God chose my inheritance. He chose for me to be happy. He chose for me to be filled with the Holy Ghost. He chose for me to stand on his word. He chose for me to have joy in the midst of troubles and trials. And if that's what he chose for me, I would be less than a man to not receive it and fight for every inch of it. &gt;&gt; Woo. He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved Salah. For God is gone up with a shout. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You mean God shouts? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God has gone up with a shout. The Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing praises to God. Sing praises. Sing praises. Oh my. Unto our king. Sing praises. Boy. Oh, David was hung up on that on this verse, was he? Sing praises. Sing praises. Why not sing defeat and sadness and how low you are and how much trouble you got? That's exactly what Satan wants you to do when you're going through the downtime and low times and difficult times and you don't know what to do. He wants to steal your song. He wants to steal your joy. He wants to steal your praise. He wants to steal your desire to come to the house of God because he knows how important it is for you to come to church. &gt;&gt; Psalm 144:15. sad, beat down, downtrodden, low, pitiful, never have no joy, never have no peace is the people. &gt;&gt; Happy is that people that is in such a case. Yay. Happy is that people whose God is the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 61:2, "From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed." Here's you a little more therapy right here. When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I. Oh men of God, if you see me down, don't leave me there. Saints of God, if you see me down, don't leave me there. Pray for me. Send me a card. Write me. Knock on my door. Whatever you've got to do, don't leave me down in the valley. Don't leave me distraught. And neither am I. I'm going to leave you. Whatever I've got to do, I'm going to come and get you. I'm not going to leave you in the valley of despair. I'm not going to let Satan steal your joy. I'll give my last breath preaching it to you. For thou has been a shelter for me. Oh, somebody lead me to the rock that is higher than I. Oh, lead me. Somebody lead me. Hallelujah. Thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in thy tabernacle forever. I will trust in the covered of thy wings. Sah right. &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:9. Let us not be weary. &gt;&gt; And welloing. You mean to tell me a person can be doing well in the eyes of God and be weary? Listen to the meaning of this word. Faint. To be utterly spiritless. to be wearied out, exhausted, exhausted from the battle, just tired of fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever get tired, Brother Donnie? I do. I do, just like all the rest of you do. But I ain't quitting. No, &gt;&gt; I said I ain't quitting. &gt;&gt; 2 Thessalonians 3:13. But ye, brethren, be not weary and welloing. Now, here's let me give you just a little mega dose here, then we'll close here momentarily. Enticing spirits. I said, I don't condemn the drunkard for going out and getting drunk. He's all moody. He don't know. He gets up in the morning, he's got the blues hangover. Oh my. goes out and gets him two or three bottles of beer. Goes out and gets him some whiskey and all that kind of stuff. Little old cigarette sucker, sits back and smoke and blow it up through his nose like that like a freight train. I don't blame him. That's all the joy he knows. That's all he's he's a pig &gt;&gt; by nature. &gt;&gt; Shame on you who profess to be a Christian and rely on such things for joy. &gt;&gt; Now listen. When the Holy Ghost gospel is nothing but one great big powerhouse of joy. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost Gospel is a perfect intoxication for every man. Well, hallelujah. That's got the blues. You take a drink of the gospel of Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost, you're drunk until you leave this world. Amen. Joy, unspeakable, full of glory. It's a constant stimulation. It's a constant intoxication. Drunk day and night. I finally figured it out. Some of y'all ain't drunk enough. &gt;&gt; You're way too sober. You're still thinking, well, I think and I believe and this is what I think and I, you know, I I' I've been sitting on this and I processed it this way and you know, I've got to understand this and I you're not drunk. And if you get drunk, you say, "Glory to God, I believe him." Anyhow, &gt;&gt; but the Lord give and the Lord to come to what you say about that. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Got another drink. Give me a more intoxication of the Holy Ghost. Let me just get so drunk I don't even know what my name is. Oh, hallelujah. Now, come on, friends. Oh, brother Donnie, I I now I I believe in the word. I do, too. But I also believe the word according to the third seal, fourth seal question answers, and also the seven seal. When the prophet of God talks about stimulation by revelation, now the only thing I can figure out is some of the folks in the message got so stimulated by the revelation, they passed out &gt;&gt; and they're sitting there in church passed out. They sat there and snore in church. But you know what? When brother Brandham defined what that was, now people say, "Well, now I know what that means." I do too because I hear the prophet of God when he's preaching that and the people in the tabernacle are screaming and hollering and shouting. He said, "That's what's wrong with them right now." So, he identified what that stimulation of revelation will do. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Oh my, but I don't feel like it, brother. I don't feel like it." &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 33:11. You talking about a miracle? The Lord giving me all this in just a matter of minutes. You know, I'm a serious preacher. So, I'm a slow put her together sort of guy. I do a search of 300 quotes here and 295 here and 118 over there looking at three versions of the Bible and then looking through the message. I've got six six windows open at one time, three of the Bible, three of the message, going back and forth, four study windows and sending it all the time. And for the Lord to put something together like this for me, it's an absolute miracle. Praise the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good. For his mercy endureth forever, and of them that shall bring sacrifices &gt;&gt; of praise and to the house of the Lord. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the Lord. Hebrews 13:15, By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to Godually. continually. That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to God. But you see, praise does not always cost us something. Let me show you what I mean. You can actually praise your dog or your cat or your horse or if you got a guinea pig or whatever you have like that and and you're, you know, you want to show your your neighbors what your dog can do. So you throw a stick and you swat out turn. Go get it, Pho. And Pho goes and he grabs that stick and go. Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. And you give him a treat. Good boy. Good boy. I wonder friends. Do you understand? If we're not careful, that's the way we do God. &gt;&gt; When God will do what we ask the way we ask it, &gt;&gt; then we will give God a treat &gt;&gt; of praise. And if God don't do it the way we don't, then we get angry at God and we will not treat God. &gt;&gt; So we won't praise him. &gt;&gt; I ain't done it. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; I ain't done it. I raise my hands. I don't care what to say. I ain't done it. You mean you're treating God like your dog &gt;&gt; or your horse or your cat or your pet, whatever. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's not a sacrifice. I'm winding down now. I'm coming to a close. I just ain't got there yet, but I'm coming. I'm on my way. Now, y'all bear with me. So, we reward our dog or an animal or whatever more with praise. Now, think of you ever thought of it that way that you give your dog or your child or whatever it is praise. So, you reward them with praise. Good boy. Good boy. Oh, my good boy. Do you understand purposes? and and killer whales. Those of you that have been to any of those places, SeaWorld or whatever, and how do they train them animals to do that? What is it based on the understanding all the English and all that? Reward. &gt;&gt; What do they do with them kid or whales come over and they flip and they do this that and other rewarding them? No, not like you'd reward your kid with a Tootsie Roll or Lifesavers or something like that, but they got fish. Everything they do, it's a reward. Is that the way we treat our God? That whenever he does something and he don't break our heart and he don't, you know, just confuse us by the way he moves, we reward him. Oh Jesus, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You answered my prayer. Lord, you help me pay my bill. Lord, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then whenever he don't, &gt;&gt; let's everybody praise him. I ain't praise him. I asked him for this, that, and other, and he didn't do it. I ain't doing it. I ain't praising him. I'm mad. &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Battle fatigue syndrome. Anybody bold enough to say, "Preach it, Brother Donnie." &gt;&gt; Preach it, Brother. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Now, watch. Praise is often our response for an action that God does and it directly benefits us of course. So we find it easy to praise him for blessings and peace and answered prayers and whenever he's helped us and all that in the way that we think he could and we can sing and boy we worship and tears will flow down our eyes and that's the kind of worship although that is you know is it really what God wants God is not a bargaining tool &gt;&gt; when you're standing and giving God praise for something you answer to prayer that is no sacrifice at all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But there's times when the medical test will come back positive. And you come up for prayer and you were just convinced, no, it's going to be gone. The growth is not going to be there. It's not going to be there. And if it hadn't have been there, you would have turned the testimony report in. Brother Louie would have stood up and read it. Glory to God. Brother so and so went to the doctor and they said this was there, but now they done an X-ray. It wasn't there. What would you all have done? Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if they come back and say, "Well, they done the scan of the doctor said it was still there and it's bigger now than it was before." Anybody praise God that he's still God? &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, preacher. &gt;&gt; He's still God no matter what the test say. But what have I got to praise him for? That he's still God. And he's still a healer. And he's still God over your life. He controls your life. He's the one that brought you on the earth. He's the one that'll take you off. &gt;&gt; The mortgage company tells you you got so many days or they're going to foreclose on you. &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got another praising for mama. We can't see his goodness sometimes when the circumstances dictate to us he didn't give us what we ask to praise God in those times requires personal sacrifice and I hate to say it but many people even in the message have not learned it yet. The command in Hebrews 13:15 that we just read says that sacrifices are to be offered to him continually. So the praise to our God should not be based upon our opinion when the answer was good or not so good. &gt;&gt; God wants your praise. And it's actually more sacrificial when you stand there and say, "God, I don't understand, but I love you. &gt;&gt; I worship you. I praise you. My wife is not suffering anymore. My husband's not suffering anymore. God, thank you that they're not lost. Thank you. They're there in that sixth dimension and every day I'm getting closer to him. But what do we focus on? Our personal loss. &gt;&gt; We stop praising him. &gt;&gt; You see, real praise continues regardless of the circumstance. It flows continually from a worshshiping heart. Notice in Acts 16:23, "And when they had laid many stripes upon them, Paul and Silas, two preachers, when they had laid many stripes upon them, and cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely, who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks." And at midnight, Paul got mad and said, "I'll tell you one thing. I'm turning in my preachers's license, and I wish I had never left the Pharisees. Ever since I've been serving this Jesus, I ain't nothing but I had a hard way to go. &gt;&gt; At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God. &gt;&gt; Setting up blood running down their backs, strips of meat hanging down their back. And what did they do, Carol? They learned how to praise him in the midst of all that. Can you imagine setting up stripes down your back? Now, what would you said? That was the church age messenger of that first age. I wonder what the people at that age would have said if they'd had a newspaper and had come out the next morning. Prophet of God thrown in jail. Prophet of God beaten like a criminal. I wonder if they'd printed the afternoon version though. Prophet of God sang and shouted and shut the jail house down. &gt;&gt; Notice they did not let their conditions dictate their praise. You imagine how it hurt their backs &gt;&gt; and their arms to raise their hands. Oh Jesus, thank you. Thank you for your light. Thank you for your mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh children, take your medicine. take your last praise pill. &gt;&gt; And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God. And they wouldn't meeting at the Brandom Tabernacle on Wednesday night and having silent prayer. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; but the prisoners heard him. God has always demanded public worship of his people. &gt;&gt; One of the first signs of people backsliding when they think they no longer need to go to church. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I don't care who they are, what their name is, or where they live. One of the first signs of people backsliding, getting cold on God, they think they can keep their worship and their religion in their home. You yellowbellied cowards. You Well, come on, somebody. Oh my. As long as there's a bride on the earth, there's going to be a bride that's going to come out and assemble themselves together. Come on, somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loose. Paul and Silas done the praising and all the rest of them received the benefit. You know what? There might be somebody beside you that ain't got enough joy to do it. But it might start with you, my brother. It may start with you, my sister. And then when you go to praising God, their bands go to shaken off, too. And they say, "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." Why? Because you offered a sacrifice of praise. And it made God so happy up there in heaven that he started kind of patting his foot and it caused an earthquake down on the earth and shook that old jail down. And here goes Paul and Silas saying glory to God. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, look what this is. And I'm closing. The sacrifice of praise comes from a humble heart that has been sanctified by fire. The fire is so cleansed that heart of selfishness. It no longer processes praise through their own human understanding. Or well, I'm going to praise him like my dog. I'm going to praise him like my horse. I'm going to No, the fire of God has cleansed it out. And they say, "I'm going to praise him. I got another day to live. I got another day to worship God. I'm one day closer to heaven. I'm one day closer to home." Friends, you've got so much more to be happy for than what we're giving him recognition for. &gt;&gt; It rises from a spirit that has chosen to honor God in spite of the pain and the sorrow. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Let me read this last verse with you. Psalms 51:17, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, thou wilt not despise." So, we think God only wants our praise when we're well and everything is going good. No. David says the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. Oh, what it must make him feel like when his children are broken. I've been broken. You've been broken. &gt;&gt; You've been broken, brother Chip. You saints, you've been broken. &gt;&gt; I've been broken many times. in many ways. But I don't mind telling you, you know it well. I hope you don't get tired of hearing it. But when the Lord in his wisdom declared and manifested his will with taking Erica from the earth, I went through an aspect of things in my life that I never went through before. I sat right back in that office in that chair and the first service I had to come out after we buried my daughter's body. I sat back there in that chair and shook like a leaf. Sick to my stomach. Broke out in a cold sweat. And I told God, "God, I cannot walk out that door and face them people. I can't do it. I just can't I can't do it cuz I don't have all the answers." But you know what the good thing was? He didn't expect me to. But you know what I done? Finally, by the grace of God, I got myself together and I walked out that door and I preached like I've been preaching for all along. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know what I've been hearing from people around this world? Brother Donnie the stand, you and Sister Carol and Lance and the girls and Lisa and their daughters and their husband and the church. It has reverberated around the world. People have been so strengthened and so encouraged by your stand. I say thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I preached many funerals, cried at many, many funerals. I didn't ever one I preach. How many now, Sister Barbara, has it been? 158 since I've been here. But none of them ever affected me like my own. My daddy died, my mama died, one of my favorite aunts died, mary's sister died. But when Erica passed, did you know why I didn't? And I still don't. But I still believe him. &gt;&gt; And I still trust him. &gt;&gt; And I'm praising him, brother Jonathan, like never before. And it's been more of a sacrifice for me than it's ever been in my entire life. When I was dealing with that planter fasciitis and my feet, I couldn't hardly walk. I laid the stone on that column right there. And when I got home in the evenings after laying the stone, I'd have to call Carol on the phone and say, "Come help me out of the truck. I can't walk." I went through that about two years, something like that. I never stopped and never slowed down. Kept right on going. I'm still praising him for healing me of that. &gt;&gt; But you know what? I didn't start praising him after my feet got better, Sister Carol. I started praising before they ever got better. &gt;&gt; But I have to say, I've learned to praise him like never before. &gt;&gt; And I want to be your example if I can. I want to be an influence if I can. Do you want to be an example to someone too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, God may use men to be an example of different people around the world that you'd never influence. Well, what can I do? What can I do? What about that one person standing by you that's a close friend? Maybe your husband, your wife, somebody standing in the back of the church. Let your light shine, my brother, sister. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; I was over here this morning doing some work and I saw some guys over here in a white pickup. I thought, I wonder what them guys are doing. So I seen them out there. I couldn't really understand what they was doing. So I planted some some plants out here and I come around back to unload the garbage in the dumpster. And I saw one sanitary the back door and said, "Hey, buddy. What y'all doing?" He said, "Oh, we're here to check the uh sprinkler system." Said, "We have to check it every now and then." I said, "Oh, okay." So here I stand in blue jeans, mud all over me, sweatshirt, t-shirt hanging out, soaking wet with sweat, sweat running down my face, probably no doubt dirt all over me. He said, ' Who are you?' I said, 'I'm the preacher.' He just kind of looked at me up and down like that. You know, I thought, "Oh, boy." He said, "I'll tell you one thing. If this church wasn't so far from where I lived, I'd come to church here." I said, "Buddy, you're welcome. I got my truck and I thought, God, that man could be the last one that's holding up the bride." the person that you meet and they say, "Where do you go to church at? What what do you do?" You understand, friends, there may not be but one more. &gt;&gt; There may not be but 10 or 12. And the whole rapture being held, let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; I got an email from a brother lives many, many thousands and thousands and thousands of miles away from us here. He said, "Brother Donnie, we heard your testimony about Sister Erica." And he said, "We cried when she passed." He said, "But we're believing God. It won't be long we'll be together." He said, "But I want to let you know your stand for the gospel has so influenced us." He said, "My family member had a hand took off because of cancer. Had a leg took off because of cancer. Had a breast took off because of cancer. But we're believing God for a complete restoration. &gt;&gt; And your stand for the gospel has been an influence in our life." I said, "Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We never know. But when you don't feel like it, when your hands is tired and you don't feel like it on Wednesday night, can you put them up and say, "Oh Jesus, I love you so much. I give you this sacrifice, Lord, but at least your back hasn't been beat today, has it?" &gt;&gt; Like Paul and Silas was. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads if you would. Oh Jesus, we always marvel at your ways. Lord, I thank you, dear God, for this little moment of inspiration today as I look back and see how it was all just orchestrated. The people sitting around Carol and I at Olive Garden didn't have a clue. My wife, bless her heart, she didn't either cuz she just sat there and I'm sure she noticed I got quiet and I started sending myself emails. She's used to that because we'll be driving down the road and I'll see a sign or something and I'll tell her send me these words text or whatever it is email. So, she's used to use dealing with me in odd and strange locations I guess. But I thought how how awesome you are. I wasn't down on my face praying but sitting there in Olive Garden waiting for her our lunch and in just a few moments your inspiration come. Why? Because you love us so much. You want to speak things to us that help us Lord. Oh Jesus. You know how many of children tonight present and those that'll stream this service, those that'll go back and archive it. Maybe they're sick, their symptoms are bad, they can see from the diagnosis tonight. But may they not just focus on the diagnosis, but the treatment, the treatment. Lord God, your word. Forgive us, Lord, if I've ever treated you like a dog. If I've ever treated you like a pet whenever you would do something in the way that I acted that I gave you a treat. Forgive me, God. Forgive my people if we've ever done that to you. Lord, may this transform our lives. I pray. Father, may we gain a complete new perspective and value on sacrifices of praise. We worship you tonight, Lord God. Thank you, heavenly father. Praise the Lord. With every head bowed, I just wonder tonight how many of you can say to the Lord, "Lord, I myself have experienced this battle fatigue syndrome. I've been on the battlefield against sin and even some of my family, Lord, and even sometimes church people, people we go to church with." And Lord, uh, my my emotions is affected and psychologically I'm affected and but Lord, you let me make a trip tonight. Except I didn't have to get all ready to go to the doctor's office, but the doctor came to where I lived. Jesus, you still do house visits &gt;&gt; and you certainly specialize in church visits. So, thank you tonight, our doctor, for making a church visit for your children. We're needed tonight, Lord. And we'll take your diagnosis cuz we know you've never lost a case. And you're not practicing medicine. You're doing it. Cuz you don't have to practice like doctors and nurses and PAs and all that do. They try this and they try that. They're doing their best. No doubt many of them are. because there can be several things that'll have very similar symptoms. But you don't have to give us this and then if that don't work, we'll take another antibiotic in 14 days and if that don't work, we'll try another one. You know exactly what we have need of at the very first visit. &gt;&gt; So I believe tonight, Lord, we've come into your presence and you made a visit to us. Hallelujah. We got ready and come to church tonight. These people didn't even know. The only ones even knew this title was the brothers that got the notes. And they probably looked at it and thought, "Oh, wow. What's he going to do tonight?" Even Carol didn't know the title. I didn't even tell her. But you knew tonight, Lord. I thank you for it, Jesus. Hallelujah. We can leave this place tonight with great joy and happiness knowing that the doctor has diagnosed our case and he's done pronounced it. Your time under the juniper tree is going to restore you. And we know that Elijah was able to come out from underneath that meal and he went on the strength of that for days on in supernaturally. That food kept him beyond way beyond what it should have because you loved him and you cared for him. Father, how many tonight would raise your hand to the Lord? Lord, I need your help. I've been going through a spiritual battle. Been going through a physical battle. Lord, I've come through a surgery. I'm wiped out. I've got this. I've got that, the other. Lord God, remove this fatigue from me, Lord. This battle fatigue syndrome. Get my em my emotions straightened out, my values straightened out, Lord. Hallelujah. Would you lay your hand on one another? Praise be to God. Heavenly Father, brothers to sisters, brothers to brothers, husbands to wives, parents to children, whatever it is. Maybe one battle scarred veteran lays hands on another one. You see our needs tonight, Father. Oh Jesus, may you help us, Lord. Lord God, we need you. We need your strength, Lord. Hallelujah. Lay your hand on me. Dear God, as we have our hands one on the other, we bring our fellow soldiers, oh God, into your presence. Lord, you see where they are. Maybe they've left Carmel and they're on the way to the juniper tree or they're there and they've had a nervous collapse. Dear God, I pray for them tonight in the name of Jesus. No doubt. Dear God, sons, daughters, those that's been saved for years and years, they find themselves in that place tonight, dear God, and you have discerned their very hearts. Father, we believe when you do that, you have medication in your pouch as it were. It won't be a hit and miss, dear God, but it'll be an absolute hit. Father, in the name of Jesus, would you minister to your people tonight, Lord? I know many of them have had great disappointments and it's put them through great valleys and trials. Lord Jesus, I pray you'd restore their joy tonight. Father, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, may they regain the value of that sacrificial praise that they still have got so much to thank you for. Father, in the name of Jesus, I pray not only for the visible audience, for all those that'll stream the service, those that'll archive it. In the name of Jesus, may the burdens leave them now. Father, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, take your hands off of God's people. You've robbed us of our joy. You've robbed us of many of the things. It is the king who determines our inheritance, not you. Father, move for your children tonight. I pray, Lord, in the name of Jesus. We worship you, Lord. Strengthen her. Help him tonight, Father. He's such a blessing to your people. God, I pray you would help him tonight, Father. Lord, we've not talked about it that much and we've not went through it that much, but I know him well enough to know. I know how much you loved Eric. And I know, Lord, when she was taken, I know it was a hard thing for him. Strengthen him, Lord. Strengthen him, Father. Lord, others here in the church have lost their husbands or children or wives. They're still dealing with that lost father in the name of Jesus. Would you bring strength? Would you bring healing, Lord? Help them to realize they've still got so much to be thankful for, Lord. If they lost that husband and he was lost, or lost that wife and they were lost, or that child, oh, what a terrible thing that would be. But Lord, to know they're waiting for us just beyond the river. We've got so much to thank you for tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; We worship you, Jesus. We worship you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Now, each of your prescription dosage tonight, I will give it to you by dosage according to your particular need. Some of you might need it five times a day. Some of you might need a 50. So, it's not a one-sizefits-all. So, if you're pretty low, you may might need to start praising God going home tonight. &gt;&gt; That that be the last thing on your lips. Let it be the first thing on your lips in the morning. &gt;&gt; If you're not so bad under the juniper triion or you're half under and half out, you know, three or four doses per day might bring you back to normal activity. Some of you it might take a few services, but we do expect great results by at least next Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't work, be sure and email me and I'll preach this again word by word cuz it is God's promise and it will work. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, children? Oh, how good he is to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sing something for us, sir. Don't it make you just want to love him so much? Don't it make you feel so sad in your heart if you think you've treated him like a pet or a dog? You reward him? If God would have healed your husband, your wife, and you'd still be praising him for it, but God didn't decide to take him, and you stop praising him. So, you haven't rewarded God since my But that's one thing we love about him. All the millions of excuses that we give him. And he says, "But I still love you."

And they took her out of that little bed she was in. They moved the tubes and stuff around and put her in my arms so I could hold her. Just a little old thing. All those tubes. I begin to sing this song. In moments like these, I sing out a song. &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when the Lord came and all the tubes was took out, she came out of a wheelchair and her eyes came open and we came home and all the people that were there that day. And when everybody left, me and Cheryl and Jessica sat down on the couch and I took her up in my arms and I sung this song in moments like these because the situation doesn't change who he is. He's God in the valley. He's God on the mountain. And we may have great problems and great sickness. And I'm not belittling any of that. But I'm here to tell you, we have a great God tonight. &gt;&gt; And I've looked all over and I found none greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't mean it don't hurt. Sure, it hurts. It hurts. It still hurts. It's been years. It still hurts. But we'll praise him in the storm. And we serve a God who cannot fail. Amen. And we will be victorious. Do you love him tonight? Have you enjoyed the word of God tonight? And hasn't it spoke to your heart? Thank you, brother Donnie, so much. Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. We have a word of prayer and then close with that. I looked all over. Couldn't find nothing. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Amen. Just take someone up on your heart now as we pray and just remember them. Heavenly Father, Lord, what a what a wonderful word that we've heard tonight. And Lord, not only did you tell us, Lord, the symptoms, but you gave us the cure. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord. And Father, I pray tonight for my brothers and my sisters, Lord, and for the families, Sister Newsome, Lord, and the children, dear God, and their families, Lord, that you just comfort their hearts. Others, Lord, who are suffering, God, different afflictions, I ask you, Lord Jesus, may you just pass by their way. word, take that affliction from them. But Lord, until we see an evidence, we're going to praise you. We're going to thank you for it, Lord, because you're our healer. You're our sustainer, our comfort, our joy, our strength, our peace, our physician, our friend, our bridegroom. You're our all and our all. Lord, go with your children now.

Lord, bless the services there and here we pray and the little bride around the world. We're so glad, Lord, that there's no one greater than you. And what a privilege it is to bow our heads.
