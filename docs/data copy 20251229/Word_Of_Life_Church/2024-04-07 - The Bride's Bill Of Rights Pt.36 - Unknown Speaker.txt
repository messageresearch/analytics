days of my life in the house of the Lord [Applause] forever no greater words could we teach our children than those words amen so grateful for the opportunity that we can not only believe the truth ourselves but be able to impart that truth to our children brother Michael and Sister Abigail if they'll come we'll dedicate their baby to the Lord today there you want sing it for us bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus what you think about this sister [Applause] huh let's bow our heads together heavenly father it's such an honor for us to be able to stand together today and to acknowledge The Gift of Life as a great science has been able to move along in the centuries and the ages yet they cannot create life that's you and you alone that can do that and we're grateful today our brother and sister have assumed another portion of responsibility to be able to bring this little child this little daughter into the Earth she didn't come with Emanual when she was born yet they we believe that you've given us your word that would help us to be able to train them to teach them in the right way we bring a little life to you today Father we pray Lord Jesus that you would just help her help her mother being the Fifth Gospel help her father being the house band as the word is to be able to bind the house together with love and admonition and Truth father we pray pray of time with Terry that she'd be old enough to be able to make her choice no right from wrong maybe she able to make that choice when she's young before the evil days would attack her may you keep her from the sickness diseases of the day we commit our little life to you today Father in the name of Jesus amen sister we don't believe in women preachers [Applause] Lord I don't blame her if that screaming holler and preacher had hold of me I'd probably cry too wouldn't you stand together just turn today if you would to the Song of Solomon chapter 5 while you're turning there the um Brothers on the boards want me to make a an announcement that they're having some issues with the PA system I'm sure you've heard that already also with the streaming and U are trying to sort through it all and try to get it fixed so be patient with them while they while they do that Song of Solomon 5 verse 1 I am coming to to my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my myrrh with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I drunk my wine with my milk eat o friends drink abundantly oh beloved now this is him talking in verse one and this is her in verse two I sleep but my heart waketh I sleep but my heart WTH it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh isn't that strange a voice would knock it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my Dove my undefiled for my head is filled with Dew and my locks with the drops of the night I've put off my coat she says how shall I put it on I washed my feet how shall I defile them my beloved put his hand by the hole of the door and my bows removed for him we're going to pray together and may let it be remembered today as we go before the Lord just hold your request in your heart Heavenly Father we count it again a privilege and an honor that we could be here today in your house and your presence realizing Lord Jesus that one day we're all going to stand before you and when we do we will not stand there as a church we will not even stand there as a family we will stand there as an individual what we've done how we've lived the way we've reacted to your word we will all face that again we will have no lawyer that can come and plead for us there'll be no mother that will shed tears of compassion there'll be no father that would try to stand between us in your judgment it would just be us in you so I pray that you'd help each of us to come to that realization today that one day this God that we pray to that we sing about that we worship one day we will either meet him in peace or in Discord we desire to meet you in peace Father we believe that you've made a way for us that we can while we're in this life in this journey be able to settle all things with you and meet you peacefully on that day take your word speak to us you saw the hands that were uplifted signified many different needs only you can come and take care of those today granted I pray father help me to get out of the way Lord Jesus speak through me words of life I ask in Jesus name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated what is it about us human beings that we tend to be lazy sometimes slothful sometimes not Resolute as we should be toward the lord we can be so convinced of things of life things that are around us that really don't amount to a whole lot but yet when it comes to him his word his his work it seems that even those who love him those who are redeemed and filled with his Spirit they still have that element that element is this of course to try to deal with it can make you to where you don't recognize him it's a sad thing when the Sinners do not know who he is when ages and generations have not known him but yet whenever his people don't recognize him when his church does not hearken to his voice now this setting is as we looked at it last Sunday the they have become married now they have joined together he has left the bridal chamber and went out to the invited guest the ceremony would have been about 7 days long the groom is crowned crowned the king of the ceremony and the bride is crowned queen of the ceremony they will be eating drinking rejoicing for seven days but this is the first night so he goes in unto her and he brings out the as the Bible calls it the tokens of her virginity and he tells his friends to Rejoice because here is the proof that she was a virgin she was true true she was pure she was undefiled he's not really gone that long just a short time but she already goes to bed she's tired the festivities of the day she's worn out she's under anticipation of being joined to him now that's happened and he's become a little bit common to her already now remember who this is this is in the anot type at Solomon and the shulamite the shulamite was a girl that lived in a hidden reclusive part of the kingdom of Judea and Solomon happened to be through there one day and he sees this beautiful young woman she has no royal blood in her she is not a person of great reputation her family no doubt very small not recognized in the tribes of Israel but yet Solomon's heart is taken with her remember this man could could have any woman he wanted as long as she wasn't married to be a wife his consorts would have been queens and princesses he was a man of renown the greatest King on the earth at this time so he could have had basically any woman beautiful Rich wealthy didn't matter no limitations to him but he fell in love with a popper fell in love with a girl that would have had so little to offer him looks like she should have been so honored that he did but yet again there's something about us human beings that Grace bewilders us Grace overcomes us sometimes and Grace can be so Bountiful and yet as rich and wonderful as it is it can still become so commonplace it's around us every day of our life Every Breath You Take every moment that you live is the mercy of God and in spite of all that graciousness that he gives to us it can still become so common and we can become so spiritually lazy to we that God in his word isn't really the preeminent part of our life as humans there's something about us being of the world that we came out of it leaves that taint upon us and our Humanity that we tend to fall in love with dead things our cars our homes our jobs our clothes our Hobbies our pastimes and yet none of those things and many others that I can mention live breathe you can love your car you can make an idol out of your car you can polish it and rub it and oh my you can just spend so much time on it and it will never have one finger to ever reach back and touch you your home as beautiful as it is as nice and comfortable all the things that we love and we possess yet none of them have any arms that they can ever reach and pull you in and embrace you your job no matter what we think of think about all the things that we love and think about how many of them are dead they have no life they have no ability to love us back so you look at your car and you smile do your car ever smile back what about your home what about your clothes your sisters what about your possessions your rings your purses your dresses your shoes your brothers your whatever it is your toys are do any of them ever reach back and just say I love you so much and yet we F our lives with dead things dead things dead things that cannot speak cannot express emotion cannot express pain sorrow compassion passion understanding totally completely dead things and look at this Bride As she responds to to him I I I've washed my feet I've changed my clothes and she took off her day clothes and put on her nightclothes and she had a pan beside the bed unlike us didn't have carpets and things like that so the floors would have been Dusty and they would wash their feet one of the last things they would do before they get in the bed they would wash their feet and get in the bed and she I'm already in bed I can't believe that you would ask me to get up I I just cannot believe that you would want me to get out of the bed and take my night clothes off and put my day clothes on and you're right there at the door why why would you do this why why would you inconvenience me this way so he who could knock down the door knocked on on the door he who could have demanded she get up ask that she get up he who could have demanded that she loved him I command you to love me but he didn't he asked her to so he puts his hand by the hole of the door as I mentioned last Sunday this is very unfamiliar to us of course the way that our doors and locks are made but it shows us that her heart was not totally closed off from him so there would have been a latch and there would have been a latch on the inside a little door and a door if you will and she could have latched that part to keep him from admittance but she didn't she leaves that to where it's open and she says in verse four my beloved put his hand by the hole of the door and my bows which seems odd to us but with the Hebrews it's the way that they looked at the seat of their passion the seat of where they felt their emotions and things come from and she said my bowels were moved for him so there's something about the Slumber that she's experiencing at least it's not all the way through to her soul unlike the leans that she she's around you understand what I'm saying that that they are through and through Soul spirit and body but hers was more the body but it had so affected her it had led her to this spot of sleep in this leosan age and we know that sleepiness is all around us everywhere and Matthew chapter 25 the G Jesus tells us the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened unto 10 virgins five were wise and five were foolish while the bridegroom teared they all slumbered and slept and about midnight they went forth to cry go you out to meet the bridegroom then the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out then the wise said unto the foolish not so lest we not have enough for ourselves and for you also but go to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they were gone to buy oil the bridegroom came and the door was shut and they were left on the outside so we can see that there is this Spirit of Slumber that affected both wise and foolish virgin and you're she is she's actually already bride entered into this Union with him but yet this this Slumber has come over her and she's trying to shake it she doesn't want it to be that way what is the matter with me why am I this way this man shouldn't even have looked at me this man should not even have given me the time of day as we would say and yet he chose me above many rich women he chose me above many women of royalty I have not one drop of royal blood in my vein she could say and yet he chose me above all those women he sent his personal bodyguard 70 well-trained men in his own pacquin a pin was a short type of s about six 6 and 1/2 ft long about 3 feet wide it would have been overlaid with gold silver blue and purple it would have had men on all four corners and it was his own personal ride as we would say it was carried upon the should shoulders of the men he sent that to get her not another person Solomon built this himself not another person according to the scripture or according to history had ever even ridden on this Peloquin but he let her ride on it I remember he did not go to her house it would have broken protocol for him to go to hers but he met her big house and his house it was a few days journey for them to come so he sends these personal bodyguards and every one of them are well-trained men and they knew how to use a sword in their couple of day Journey no doubt she's still getting the final polishing and the honing in tell me about Solomon what kind of man is he what does he like and and and what does he dislike because I I've never got to be around him that much please you are his personal bodyguards tell me what what am I expected to do she did not know anything about Palace etiquette she didn't know how to behave in a palace she's a country girl she didn't know what to do how how your manners are do you pick up a fork with the left hand or the right hand do you curtsy do you bow what do you do she didn't have a clue and yet whenever she comes close a messenger goes before her as they begin to get close to the city and he sends out music and he sends out incense burners and he sends out all the singers and the great celebration starts just as the bride is coming close to the city this hasn't been but about three days prior to this already she forgot already it had become common well well I'm the church I'm the bride H I just I go to church when I want to if I get there I'll sing if I want to if I don't want to Brother Lou ain't going to make me sing glory to God ain't nobody telling me what to do Hallelujah if I don't want to smile I don't want to smile if the preacher says say amen and I don't want to say amen I ain't saying amen I do what I want to do see already Grace is becomes so common to us that somehow we think he owes it to us he owes us nothing he doesn't owe you Grace he doesn't owe me Grace he doesn't owe me mercy come on somebody he doesn't owe you forgiveness he doesn't owe you pardon he does it because of who he is not because he owes us one thing now want you notice as she looks at this she says that her the passions of her soul has now been able to hear and recognize her voice or his voice rather but she recognizes it a little bit too late in verse 5 she said I rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrr and my fingers with sweet smelling myrr upon the handles of the lock so she didn't respond to his voice when he knocked but she did respond when she saw his hand come through the opening of the door now what's what's how that how that his Mercy is extended you know his hands in the Old Testament as well as the new were signs of his glory so whenever we talk about the hand of God doing something it is generally a glorious manifestation in the realm of the supernatural so it was when she saw the hand move that she recognized she better do something about it so instead of hearing the voice and the voice captivating her heart and her responding to the voice she waited till she saw the hand which was a move and you see again even he and him Merc in his Mercy instead of turning and walking away just when the voice came first stage he did not do that he stood there a little while longer while the do is still falling and he's standing there the drips coming down on his shoulders down into his beard getting His Garment now saturated with the Dew of the night and his voice speaks and speaks and she doesn't move and finally he decides he'll have one more Outreach of mercy so he reaches his hand to the hole in the door and then she responds his voice was not enough yet it was The Voice by which she was married it was The Voice by which called her out of the darkness that she was in but it wasn't the voice that she yielded to after she become bride but she got so dependent upon the hand move instead of the voice move you following me this morning now sir the opening of the door was the latch now remember there was a hole there by which the person would be able to reach in and get the latch but there was a little small covering on that which a l a latch on the inside and she did not totally close that because she expected him to come in so her heart was still an element of it moved toward him so the king did not force his way in he did not beat the door down but no doubt he was disappointed for every child of God that sits here today if you are truly a child of God you don't actually have to leave here today and go out and pull a big drunk you don't have to go out and shoot up with some type of drugs or narcotics or something like that run over somebody and kill them to feel like your heart is broken toward the Lord but if you miss him in the least way it is such a disappointing appointment to a child of God how many knows what I'm talking about how many has been so disappointed at yourself at times with the Lord no me too I have to raise both of my hands and you see disappointment runs both ways no doubt he was so disappointed but unlike we are whenever we do things for people and they break our heart or break their promises to us and we tend to throw it back up to did not I do that this for you and that for you and that I can't believe that you do that to me I just cannot believe it oh but I'm so grateful that he's unlike me I'm grateful he's not like you too so she says I rose up to open to my beloved now being willing now after he's done turned away she realizes that she's mistaken and missed his voice so the shulamite went to the door and when she did she reached forth her hand and she realized he was gone now what's she doing she's reaching forth her hand from her side of the hole the opening she's wanting her hand to touch his hand the supernatural so her Works she's wanting to align with his works now listen to me I believe in the Supernatural I am a walking Miracle every person that's here saved today you are one too but I do not want to just know him when he sticks his hand to the door I want to recognize his voice amen amen I don't want him to have to open the Red Sea every time he wants to speak to my heart if I'm fixing to do something wrong or fixing to say something wrong I believe a child of God can live so close to the presence of the Lord that if the devil is got a trap laid for us the spirit of God can simply speak and we will avoid that snare anybody else believe the same thing today why would he have to open the Red Sea why do we always demand such great supernatural phenomena for him to be able to speak to our hearts why canot we have that Harmony between him and us to where if we start to do something wrong or start to say something wrong or anything that would displease him that his voice which will be totally unheard by the people around you but your communication line is so that if you were to do something even plan to do it he could speak to you and say child don't do that amen and you just simply turn and walk away I don't know about you I long for a church like that instead of a church that has to be ripped and beat and thrashed and wore out is that what we think Christianity is consummating in a church has got to be Beat to Death constantly every time we come to church we're so stubborn and so hardheaded the preacher has to constantly rebuke us and constantly God has to give us hard Corrections and dealings my greatest desire is to be a part of a church of people who are in such harmony with him that every move of their everyday life is so synchronized to the will of God even his very thoughts his thoughts is exactly what they wish amen yes amen say you're crazy no I'm not the Bible says as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God I believe in forgiveness don't you I'm grateful for the blood of Jesus we need it all the time but to me the same spirit of God that can come and forgive me when I mess up cannot that spirit of God stop me from messing up in the first place if I live in harmony with him is that where we want to live live that we constantly want to live under confession and repentance all the time you mean that's all that's all Calvary done that's all that Calvary done you mean Calvary has no more power than that that's all the power you understand that's the epitome of the majority of Christians in the day that we live in that they do not live above sin it's constantly falling and repenting falling repenting falling and repenting you mean that's all Calvary done that's it that that that's the success of Calvary in other words we're still struggling Sinners we don't live a life of Victory we can't even have one day that we're above sin and we're above the things of the world and and that's all that Calvary did well I don't mind telling you I'm very disappointed I saw the Bible tells me that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now do we believe that today so cannot he that lives in me also give me instruction and wisdom and victory inside of my life not just on Sunday morning I want just as much Victory tomorrow as I've got right here today I want just as much on Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and off service days I want just as much Victory then as I've got right here this morning if not than all Calvary really has done has provided me two days Wednesday and Saturday by which I can have Victory or Wednesday and Sunday whenever it is you have your church I don't believe that I believe the power of Calvary can be able to produce the life of Jesus Christ in the heart of a child of God to whether they're in church whether it's the middle of the week if it's on Monday if it's on Saturday they can live a holy life they can overcome sin Satan Darkness Leia everything that Satan has to offer in the age we're living in because the Bible goes on to tell us this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith so what is good about this relationship that this woman has and it's just young now you imagine some of us have been serving the lord for decades decades upon decades and yet there's something about Christians that from time to time we need a renewal a refreshing how many understands want I'm to say it a renewal a refreshing it's just like a man and wife that love one another and yet Lord willing if if the Lord lets Carol and I live to July we will be married 51 years 51 years oh how I'm grateful for how I appreciate God for giving her to me and yet there's times that Carol and I will need just to be able to get away for a day day or so I actually never get away really because as long as I take my cell phone with me it's a prison you know what I'm saying so from people around the world if I just had this church here to take care of that's a burden within itself I have people all over the world that I have to try to help and take care of so I never actually get to a place oh brother Donnie go without your cell phone what I wouldn't even enjoy it if I did I wouldn't enjoy it if I would cuz I'd be worryed about you that some of you might need me for this or that or the other but we need a Time on the occasion where we can just try to relax a little bit and get away for a refreshing where we can just spend time together I believe our relationship with the Lord Jesus is exactly the same way you ever get to that spot to where you just feel like you need a renewing with him now you know it's not him it's not on his part no fault of course on him that he's been really busy you know working on your city and and working on your new mansion and all that sort of thing and he hasn't had time to talk to you he hasn't had time to spend with you it's never him it's always me it's always you anybody say Amen to that but yet there's times that we need that renewing and that refreshing now I want you to notice that there's even in the end time to where there's so much things around us and many of you maybe remember the sermon that I preached here years and years ago called The Bondage of time and it was going down through even at that time we thought was was in bondage then it wasn't near as much bondage as it is today and it seemed like there's so much demand for the time that we have and we have no more time than what Adam had when he stepped out of the Garden of Eden 24 hours in the day s days a week and here we are we've got more demands for our time and some of you thought when you got older you would slow down you still looking for that person that lied to you I am I'm looking for the one that told me that cuz it sure ain't happened yet and yet we realize as we go on in time it will be that way there'll be more things that'll one our time and we would sit down and figure it out and allocate how much time that we give to God how much time we give to school how much time we give to soccer how much time we give to football practice baseball practice basketball practice you know all kinds of other practice this that the other all the things in our life and we would really figure how much time we get to God would' probably be ashamed of ourselves and yet he himself will take it if that's all that we will give him if we will give him 10 minutes of personal time now by that I don't mean you and WhatsApp you and YouTube you and Tik Tok you and Instagram you and Tick Tock and Jesus Jesus don't want you in Tik Tock he wants you without Tick Tock Jesus don't want you in Instagram he wants you and him together praise the Lord and yet look we've got more things than ever in our entire lives to pull on us and it's amazing though because in that thing when people are thinking about that and many of them are convinced that they don't even need to go to church anymore because I can be just as good a Christian staying at home and we have a move in our ranks that is promoting and believing that all you need to do is stay home and play a tape I really don't care if you get quiet on me I'm going to preach it with you or without you just up to you remember the angels are take Taking note today so if they know you didn't say Amen that kind of goes against you I find it amazing especially since the Bible says that forsake not the siming of yourselves together and that much more as you see the day approaching and somebody said so whenever we need really more time together to be in the presence of God people are somehow convinced that church really isn't that important that vacations are more important and some people have so many vacations honestly don't know how it's even a vacation no more because I have so many of them how could it even be you know kind of special anyway I'm still trying to figure that out let me know if you know the answer to that but I want you to I want to want to show you something here that whenever brother random was here he had moved to Tucson and many of the people from Jeffersonville Georgia different places some of them uh they took up their homes and their families and so on and they moved out there and whenever they got there there was no church for them to go to that was preaching what he believed now there was brother Brock brother Gilmore Assembly of God Church of God there was Apostolic different ones like that but there was no church because he himself did not go there to start a church so they would go from one Church to another and I know from talking to family members that brother Randon would go and visit those churches and many of them would whenever he would go they wouldn't even acknowledge he was in the building that morning so they wouldn't even say we're glad to have brother brandham here today they wouldn't even acknowledge he was there and yet I know of one at least one instance to where that he went to one place that didn't acknowledge him and he went back and he told his family they were're going to go at least to go visit and one of his family members said Daddy you know that they didn't even acknowledge that that you were there how how can you turn and go back he said they didn't Jesus either but he went back anyway amen so you know it had come to the spot now to where that the people following this message were there in this vicinity and they were not attending church and perig green brother perig green goes to on Stone Avenue there I think was the address where it was and there was where two churches and merged together Assembly of God and he feels in his heart to start a church so brother Brandon is here and this is what house will you build me this is 11:21 65 I want you to notice this day I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I want you to listen to this request now and desire on his heart this is a little bit over a month before he's going to be taken from the Earth a month out from eternity and listen how he's feeling I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it some experiences I just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when I was first saved So Glorious to my heart now remember he's had all these great things to happen to him and he's within a month of Crossing into eternity but he's longing brother skip he's hungering to feel like he did when he first got saved you see there's something about Ministry that takes a great toll on you amen you deal with people and they will use you they will lie on you oh you're the greatest man that ever was until they find somebody they like better then they won't even have enough respective and come and talk to you before they leave they'll just walk away and yet the gifts and the Supernatural is wonderful but there's something that it pulled and pulled and he had so many scars on his heart and it does something to you and if we're not careful we become disappointed with people that's around us and people that we go to church with and Christians you think if anybody's going to be honest and people of integrity and character should be Christians am yes sir but I've got to be honest with you I've been treated worse by Christians than I ever was by Sinners my greatest wounds today me personally are from Christians probably some of yours are the same way are they not so it can take something out of you and if we're not careful little by little we go to losing something about that initial love that first love as the Bible calls and we become accustomed to the more hard calloused disassociated part of our lives and it becomes normal and we accept it to feel this way so we go to church we don't feel God we pray we don't feel God we read our Bibles we don't feel God we go through the religious ritual and we don't feel God and before long that becomes the new Norm oh my don't raise your hand but I wonder for some of you is that your new Norm Lord Jesus speak to us father that's something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious in my heart and we can come into a place that we can sit and we can see it among us that we are dry and we set here in the desert and I get among my brethren they talk with me and I talk with them always a little way of watching and feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see the condition of that Brethren I want you to think now they not only have the recorded sermons they have the prophet of God himself right there with them and among them and they are drying they're becoming indifferent am praise the Lord I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit now notice no doubt they were still playing taste now remember this date November 6th so by then they had hundreds over a thousand tapes recorded sermons and they had the prophet in flesh so the recorded sermons was not keeping them from drying amen the prophet in flesh was not keeping them from dry you know what they were missing going to church and not only going to church but getting in once they get there now if that did not keep these people in that date what makes people think it will keep them now here that's right how do people are convinced in their mind they don't need to go to church they don't need to worship God they don't I don't need nobody you are so wrong now watch it's happening right among them and the prophet thank God he was bold enough to be able to admit it notice what he says I begin to feel us all you what's amazing about this he's not standing there just poting y y'all need to do this and you need to do that and you need to do something else he actually puts himself in the same category I want you to notice the word that he uses the pronoun he said I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God now listen to the message not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts wow not only the flame of the hour but the flame in our heart see it it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself thank you Lord so our knowledge and our our ability to memorize quotes or scriptures or Greek terms and Aramaic words and Hebrew words and so on and so on without the spirit of God helping us we will never be able to pack the word of God Amen now he he's gathered here with some people and he's admonishing them and telling them they're going to need Sunday school teachers and officers in the church and this this is what he's telling them jump down and go with me to paragraph 33 he said keep the message honorable and live the right kind of life don't let no smut come upon it we're living too late now we're too late in the hour let's live it clean my life your life all our lives need to be picked up before God and the church said amen I want you to notice some of the things that was bothered him our young people just ride around from place to place from sh show to show drifting further and further away from God message youth message kids riding around from show to show why no church on so I ran into one of these women one day on the street and said did you go to church yesterday she said I'm not no legalist I wash my clothes he said you done wrong you should have been the church somewhere I find it amazing that the people who believe this trash cuz that's what it is you'll never hear them quote this quote I just quoted to you you know why I'm going to tell you why they don't believe it amen I don't care what their last name is first name middle name they don't believe what he said now this is a true prophet of God now watch Bring it on down to us that's the truth I see it in my children I see myself getting to a place now here's the answer you've got to assemble yourself El together Lord now do you understand there will be many message people so-called that will absolutely go straight to the tribulation period they will be playing tapes the day after the Rapture and when they stand before God these things I've read to you today will stand there and be a voice against them why because they don't believe what they say they believe well come on somebody I don't care how they try to reason it how they try to explain it away you see here's a man that is experiencing it himself so he's experiencing what it is to be around the message in and around the message and believe it or not there was actually some Sundays that they played tapes in their own home the brandham family and yet they're still drying and their children are getting more loose brother brandom could see it in his own children and what was missing the quotes what was missing there wasn't enough Bibles what was missing the hair was too short the dresses were too short uh I know what it was the men were wearing miniskirts no there was none of that what was missing church amen [Applause] Church oh my when we see this day approaching that much more together he said there's only two people people there you be one of them oh is that your desire brother Fred you be one of them oh Hallelujah if we come together and worship together then we just something another about it Jesus said with there two three gathered in my name there am I in the midst and you see this is what had happened to the shulamite which is the feminist form of the name Solomon she was his love his beloved his dove look at all the attributes that he used to describe her he didn't stand up her say you Harlot you prostitute I'm going to divorce you and put you away no he loved her I've got to be honest with you there's certain people that have hurt me over the years and had I known they would have done to me what they did I probably would have never wanted to make their acquaintance anybody feel the same way you're just saying ah no no thank you no thank you keep them at arms length but the Lord Jesus knew when he saved me how many times I'd disappoint him he knew how many times that I would question him why do you want want me to preach I don't like to preach I don't want to be a preacher I'll say it publicly for the first time I've ever said it you know what I would have rather been than a preacher an archaeologist okay huh your' life in what I wanted to be well thank you I love rocks I do I love rocks I love finding fossils I love digging around I took care said when I get older and re retire from the church I want to move to Israel I'm going to give me a grass sack and I'm going to give me a little hammer and a mallet and I'm goingon to go around just dig for the rest of my life oh you think that's funny do you me humanly I'd much rather been that than a preacher I'd much rather been that to been a pastor I just go out by myself I'm a Loner I just go out and dig around dig around bring it home shorts Carol look what I found an ascalon look what I found a 16-year-old boy just a few weeks ago found a Roman lamp a Roman lamp over 2,000 years old I envied that little guy with all of my heart but me Carol was talking about that this week and she said well darling God still lets you dig around in rocks cuz you dig around in his word and you dig out Treasures for us as the people of God I said well I guess that's that's true you think that pleases him when I tell him I don't want to be a preacher why' you ever call me I don't like traveling I don't like going overseas I got more invitations this year in the first two months of of 24 than I've had my whole Ministry and I don't want to go nowhere I going to stay here with you I mean if I've got to preach anyway I might as well say with you all right you said get pleases him you think it pleases him when he has to beg you to read your Bible or pray or if the song leader has to give up come on let's everybody now let's Worship the Lord let's raise our hands and we go up like this and back down this just close our eyes and worship him we do it for a few seconds and work out and you see God isn't just asking us to do this for himself but he also knows there's a great benefit for you and I when we worship notice the way that the prophet says this whenever he talks us about going to church now it's not just going to church and taking up a spot in a Pew or in a seat but it's actually pulling us into the spirit of God because does something to us when we get in his presence so whenever I go over to the stoneyard on the Bristol Highway right up from Grand and I know that guy in there pretty good because I've been there a lot so I don't even stop at the office no more I just wave as I'm going by and I go out there through his rocks and I just pick up rocks and I just look at them some you say I knew that man was out of his mind now I know for sure he is I do I just think what them colors come from and I found all kinds of little animals and I think little guy how old are you how old are you how long have you been there embedded in that and what if I would have been an archaeologist how many people that are saved today under this part that I don't want to do and their name will be identified with me for eternity how many people sitting in this place today were sealed by the Holy Ghost to the day of your Redemption because of a part of my life that God gave me but I wish you hadn't gave it to me what makes me that way what makes you that way that's right this is our greatest enemy how many can acknowledge we need help brother Paul we need help I Rose to open up to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrr and my fingers with sweet smelling myrr upon the handles of the lock I'll open to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone what he desired was his bride to come at the beckoning of his voice so he just speaks co co that's coded Dove talk for open the door sweetheart open the door I've just presented your tokens of virginity before the judges you are declared innocent oh my am it's not that he's come to punish her he's come to tell her the news he's just presented the tokens of her virginity before the Eternal himself she is accepted Hallelujah but she's asleep so now now she goes to the door and she puts her hand through the hole of the door and when she does she gets that M the aromatics of sandalwood and myrr that special ointment that the high priest alone could wear he wanted to be embraced by her but instead he turns and walks away in The Damp of the night open to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake I sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave me no answer dear Jes Jesus so now it's hitting her I've slideing my husband I've offended him I've grieved him away remember Paul says in Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption that's speaking to those of you that have the Holy Ghost things that you could do or say that would grieve him and he just kind of pulls his presence away from him how many's ever been there besides me and it makes you feel so awful I sought him but I could not find him now that she is stirring he withdraws himself I called him but he gave me no answer in job 30:20 he said I cry unto thee and thou Dost not hear me I stand up and thou regardest me not verse 29 when he giveth quietness who can then make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can Behold Him whether it be done against a nation or against a man only Lamentations 3:44 thou Hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass through Matthew 15:22 Behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word you see weak face need needs immediate response and comfort but strong faith is Tried by delay strong faith is Tried by DeLay So maybe some of you today are questioning why God would take a certain person from the earth and well why would God take that person and not take that one well first of all he makes no mistakes but a lot of times the reason he takes hist because they're ready and the work is done they can't take that one because they ain't ready and the work ain't done God can delay a real son and daughter of God for months on end they cry they beg they agonize and he remains totally silent amen because he can trust them and other people who do not live half the life they live they pray seems like instantly they get an answer that's not a sign of great faith always many times it's a sign of weak face cuz they're mashed potato people they're microwave people they have to have it right now brother amen I hope pray to God I'm not a mashed potato Christian I hope and pray to God that you're not a microwave child of God that God can delay brother John and God can put off the answer and God can say to the devil about John horac have you considered my servant not job but John he loves me he trusts me I have intentionally delayed answers and he still keeps on praying still keeps on worshiping he believes in me he answered or not a word and his disciples came to bes him saying send her away for she CRI after us and he answered and said I am not sent but into the lost sheep of the House of Israel boy if you have said that to us this morning there wouldn't be 12 people left in Word of Life Church with it we'd get up why I cannot believe he would well he said he would even sent for me can you believe that my goodness I never seen such an arrogant man in my life but this was her response then came she and worshiped him she had such faith that Jesus himself could not run her off that's the kind of Christians I want to produce in this church let me close the kind of Christians that when you go to the Lord Jesus and the Lord Jesus says get out out of my face get away from me leave me alone you're boring me you're agitating me I don't have time for you that you stand right there and look at him and say I am on your hands my blood pressure needs to be healed and you're a blood pressure healer my hair's been falling out since Co you're a hair healer my liver ain't working right my kid ain't working right my children ain't working right my husband ain't working right you're a husband saver you're a wife saver I am on your hands Lord Jesus and Jesus look you right in the face and say did not I tell you leave me alone and you say I ain't doing it but you see many Christians in this day we live their walk is so flimsy so puny a preacher runs them off somebody in the church don't shake their I ain't going back no more but a real believer not only withstands the devil but they're like Jacob if they have to they'll grab the angel of God put it in a headlock and say I ain't letting you go come on somebody is that the way you believe God notice Jesus response again then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs woman hear me well you ain't nothing but a dog she said amen praise the Lord glory to God and she said truth Lord oh Hallelujah yet the dogs I find this amazing in the Greek language because there's two different words used for dogs Jesus said it's not me for me to cast the children children's bread to dogs Jesus used the Greek word for big dogs but she used the word for little dogs so Jesus said it ain't me for me to give the the children's bread to you you're a big dog she said no I'm even little than that I'm a little dog praise God and Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy face be it unto thee even as thou as thou Wilt and this is the way she willed it and her daughter was made whole from that very hour Jesus did not say it will be as I will it but it will be as you will it if she would have willed it so it could have been two days a week a month or a year but when she she grabbed that word from God she took that personal word that Rama word from God and took it in her heart and purposed it in her heart all right if that's the way it is I want it from this moment right now I will it to be so from right now don't you you love him let's bow our hands together Hallelujah I wonder before we pray today is there any or would there be many that would say I want to be closer to him than I've ever been before I don't want my things I don't want my job the dead things I fill my life with to hinder me one thing about her friends if you love Jesus Jesus can love you back un like your car you speak to Jesus Jesus can and will speak back you love him he can love you back oh Hallelujah father as we come to the close of this portion of the service now we're asking you first of all that you'd forgive us I'll be the first to ask for your forgiveness today I've told you countless of times since you called me to be a preacher when I was just an 18y old boy I didn't understand it then and I sure don't understand it any better today why he'd ever want me anyhow unlike the sun I've not been so good unlike the moon which is now never disobeyed you I've fallen short of your glory I've claimed Lord I've asked you to take it away from me and I've I've reasoned and triy to say well I'm getting too old now I can't do it crazy me when you first call me I said I was too young to do it now I think I'm too old to do it it and yet you love me anyway I just have this feeling Lord down in my heart that I'm not the only one that's been there maybe not them in preaching but and them wondering why you love them there's people in this pace have fallen flat on their face so many times they couldn't even give an accurate count of it and yet you love them anyway when it comes right down to it they love you in spite of their failures their faults I trust today that we have heard your voice as it's knocked on the door of our hearts and me know as the artist of old and his painting went into the Hall of critics and one man said sir there's one thing I find wrong about your painting he said great sir what is that he said all L but you did not paint no handle to the door on the outside oh but you see sir I painted it thus for the latch is on the inside how many days and nights have you knocked and we've been busy we've had plans we've got this at the together going on yet you want our love so much you love worship you love praise you love our attention it just Thrills you as it were when we give you attention and love I can remember as a boy Lord I had a flashback of it one day this week going to the elementary school there in Monella when the bell would ring for break I would go outside and stand on that playground I didn't have a friend it would ring again up in the day and I'd go out I'd stand out there by myself that happened in the first grade second grade third grade fourth grade it happened till I moved up to Middle school it happened then too and if anybody would even speak to me I just couldn't hardly believe it of course we is poor and I dress poor so I know what that feels like help me Jesus that I never treat you that way so here you are in the religion here you are in the churches and do people want you in their church do they want you to really move as you desire to move I'll ask our church today how many of us here want you to come save the Lost f with the Holy Ghost heal the sick change lives or do we want to put you in a form in a ritual a way that we can control you and tell you what you can and cannot do Lord Jesus help us today may we take our restraints off of you father not only in church but in every day of our life I believe you desire to pull these daughters closer to you when they're making their beds of a morning they go to singing and saying oh Jesus I love you so much making their children's breakfast the tears can go to trickling now of their eyes when they got their duties about the house or their job whatever it is that they do that they can go to worshiping you and you show up same with the brothers father forgive us for robbing you of what we were created for help us today Jesus I pray thank you Father if you'd like to be remembered would you just raise your hand there before the Lord ask him to help you to be a better wife to be a better Christian but brother Donnie what can I do you can love him you can tell him so you can thank him you can praise him you can share with others what he's done for oh but I'm not a preacher you don't
