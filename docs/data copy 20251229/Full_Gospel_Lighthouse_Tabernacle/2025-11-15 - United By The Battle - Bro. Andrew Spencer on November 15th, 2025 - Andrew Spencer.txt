Now one [music] day old king David gave came home from a city call it black. And while he [music] was gone, the enemy came to stole everything that he had. [music] But see David courage himself to the Lord. He made up in his mind. He said, "I'm on my way [music] down to his king and I'mma take my property back. I'm taking it back. [music] Everything that the devil stole from me, [music] I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil [music] stole from me, taking back my soul, my [music] dreams, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking [music] it by everything that [singing] the devil tells of me. Well, we all know that Satan only comes to steal, to kill, [music] and destroy. And I must admit, there been [music] some times that he's taking away my joy. Oh, I've certainly know the devil [music and singing] today. His king is under attack cuz I'm on my way [music] down to his king and I'm taking my property back. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil [music] stole of me, I'm taking it back.

I'm taking it back. [singing] Everything that the devil [music] stole me. Amen. And is that your commitment this evening to take everything back that the devil over stole from you? Amen. Let's go to these prayer requests. We're going to take each and every one of these back from Satan and we're going to put them in the hands of the Lord that God would just touch them richly. [music] I want to remember all of our elderly during this time of year, colds and things going around. Want to just uh pray for [music] them. Want to remember our pastor, Brother Ron Spencer. God will just touch him and strengthen him [music] daily. uh sister Teresa Delaney and then as well sister Wanda [music] Hinkle. She's gaining her strength back every day as well. So just pray for them as well as our brother Jeff Breeden [music] that God would just touch him, drive out that cancer as well. I want to remember our sister Judy [music] Hinsley in prayer. She has a need in body as well as sister June Shifflet. [music] And then we also want to continue to lift up our brother Roger Sailor that God would just touch him and strengthen him in body. He has some sickness and things going on that uh really needs a touch from the Lord. How many would [music] say, "Lord, just pass by my way. I have a need in my body." Amen. We know our [music] God can just move on all these requests, don't we? I'm going to ask Brother William if he would just come lead [music] us to a throne of grace. Amen. Let's bow our heads in our hearts. Dear gracious, [music] kind heavenly father, Lord, we just want to humble ourselves before you this evening. Lord, we just [music] thank you, Father, for all your blessings, Lord, and your goodness, your grace, and your mercy, Lord, that you bestow upon us, Lord. And we're just unworthy, unworthy people, [music] but Lord, even while we were yet sinners, Lord, you loved us, Lord. God, we thank you for your love and [music] we thank you, Lord, for your predestination, Lord. And the Holy Ghost that, Lord, came and despite of where we were in life, your Holy Spirit came and found [music] us and plucked us out of the world and turned our life around, Lord, when gave us a heart and a desire to serve you and to please you, Lord. What a great, wonderful God that [music] you are. What a loving father that you are that you refuse to give up on your children. And Lord, now your children have gathered together, Lord, under [music] the presence of the unchanging word of God. And Lord, your word says that where two or three are gathered together [music] in my name, there I am in the midst. And Lord, there's more than two and three gathered together, Lord. And we just come as your children. We come boldly before your throne of grace, Lord. We come with the authority as the queen of heaven, [music] Lord, and already seated together with you in heavenly places with in with and in Christ Jesus. And Lord, we bring these requests to you, [music] Father, Lord. And we approach your throne of mercy and healing and grace and power. And Lord, we lay all these requests at your feet, Lord, and bring them all to your attention, Lord. all the elderly, Lord, that would love to be in the house and would love to enjoy the presence that we feel here. But Lord, due to circumstances of life and the frailty of humanity, they're shut in. Lord, may you just reveal to them, Lord, that you they're not forgotten. [music] Lord, we just pray that you bless them in a special way even this evening and go to them and minister to them and touch their lives. Lord, all the sicknesses, Lord, that Satan has attacked, [music] Lord, your children's body with, Father, you took stripes for that impalish judgment hall. It's already been bought and paid for, Lord. And we just now want to confess to you that we believe, Lord. When you were here on earth and you'd perform miracles, that's all you would ask is, "Do you now [music] believe?" Father, we want to confess with our heart and with our soul that we believe you. And Lord, we just commit all these requests and every life [music] under every hand that was raised. We commit it all to you. We rededicate our lives a new to you, Father, in this service. We give you all the praise, honor, and glory. We just pray over the word as it goes forth. Bless your servant tonight, Lord. May he step out of the way. May he yield to that gift you've put in his life, Lord, that it [music] may minister the word to us. We love you now. We thank you in advance for what you're going to do. We give [music] you all the praise, honor, and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. We have sister uh Julia come sing for us.

Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. My goodness. Hallelujah. And that's our heart is to cry out holy unto the Lord God Almighty. [music] Amen. Isn't it a pleasure to be in the house of the Lord? Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we'd like to go into the book of Philippians chapter 1 and verse 27. Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 and also 1st Samuel chapter 22 and verse 1 Philippians 1:27 and only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel, and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of predition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. 1st Samuel 22 and verse 1. and say amen when you have it this evening. David therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave Agilum. And when he was brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him. And everyone that was in distress, and everyone that was in debt, and everyone that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him. And he became a captain over them. And there were with him about 400 men. How many has a need that you'd like to make known to the Lord tonight? Amen. Let's just talk to the father just now. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight. Lord Jesus, we're your hungry children and we are desiring to be fed tonight. We're asking, Lord Jesus, that your sweet, holy presence, Lord, would just begin to sweep over our lives, Lord. The songs of Zion have been sung. Your presence has been felt, Lord. Even in the specials, I was back there in the back office and felt your presence just like a cool breeze in the summertime just come rushing through the office. We realize that you're here tonight to do great things. Our expectations are at an ultimate height. We're asking Lord Jesus that you would come, the creator of heaven and earth. You would take both hearer and speaker tonight and you would speak to us, Lord, from thy word. We love you so much, Lord Jesus. There's not enough words in the human vocabulary that could describe how much you mean to each of us here tonight. Father, we're asking Lord Jesus that you would touch every one of these hands, their hearts, Lord, their needs. We ask, Lord Jesus, that you would be God to their situation just now. And according to thy word, we have faith in it. We believe it. And we pray the prayer of faith over our lives in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. You may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord. Tonight, I'd like to speak to you a little thought that I have had on my heart for over a year, and it looks like the Lord has just given us a little bit of grace to minister on it tonight. I'd like to speak a thought to you on united by the battle. United by the battle. And I would like to just go back to go verse 27 in Philippians verse one, chapter 1. and says, "Let our conversation, your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, that I might hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, in one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel." And I believe that is something that we ought to do ever so presently in this hour is that we ought to strive together to be in one mind and in one heart for the message of the hour. And I believe if there's anything that's worth doing and it's worth doing right and that's the message of the hour. I believe that the message deserves our every intent. It deserves our very best qualities that we can put to this life. I believe that our God deserves the best worship that we can absolutely give him. But I believe it's even greater that when we can come together in one mind, in one heart, and fully come together and realize that we've got one purpose. We've got one goal, we've got one great God that we're serving. We've got one big enemy that we're going out there to try to destroy. And it is by this message that we are even here today together. And we find that in this moment that we could say that we are united by the battle. That we are fighting an enemy that is wanting not only just to make us sick, but we are facing an enemy that is wanting to kill us and to destroy us. He doesn't just want our preachers. He doesn't just want the leoty. He wants the little bitty children in every way. And I believe that God has equipped us with the greatest greatest weapon that we could ever put in our hands. And that's this message. You find this this great drama that is set here tonight. You see King David. Yeah, I say he's a king in this moment. He doesn't look like a king, but he is a king. Even still, YOU FIND THAT DAVID is here in a cave. And if you've ever spent much time in a cave, I I remember as a little bitty child, I always wanted to find a little bitty hidden cave over in the mountains where we was hiding, hunting there in Pilot, Virginia. I like to find them little places. You ever get in them caves? Them caves ain't a very, very pleasant place. But there's something about a little bitty boy that he wants to find them little holes that maybe bears hide out and foxes and different things. But here you find a king hiding in a cave. And you can imagine what this cave may be made of limestone and different things of stelactites and stelagmites maybe hanging in different forms. And it it is the historians actually say about this cave of Agelon that it had a very small entrance. But as you entered into this cave, it had great big halls and different chambers in it. And you can imagine David the anointed hiding here in a cave. Yet he wasn't he wasn't enthroned in his in his c with a crown with a throne yet. But yet he here is a king that is a fugitive. Here he is. And what is he doing in this cave? He is fleeing FROM KING SAUL BECAUSE KING SAUL IS SO JEALOUS. AND HERE he is. He's so jealous of the gift that David had in his life. SO HE'S HERE HIDING IN the very cave of Agelon. BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THAT even in the midst of a cave THAT YOU CAN FIND THAT GOD'S plan is working out in David's life. AND I BELIEVE THAT MANY TIMES that if WE WOULD LOOK THROUGH OUR LIFE THAT there were times that we were hiding in a cave. There were times and we were HIDING FROM DESPAIR BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH way to GO AND MANY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU SEE, YOU FIND WHAT DROVE DAVID to this TO THIS CAVE WAS THAT KING SAUL HAD GOT TO A PLACE that Saul had lifted himself up IN HIS OWN HUMANITY. AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE GREATEST IN THE LAND. But David's SUCCESS IN A MATTER OF moments began to be even greater than Saul EVER HAD IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE. DAVID ACTUALLY WENT OUT JUST ON ONE TRIP WHEN HE COME BACK AFTER KILLING GOLIATH. AND HE CAME BACK AFTER ONE TRIP BEING UNITED WITH JONATHAN. HE COMES BACK AND THE SISTERS OF THE CITY OF THE MESSAGE STOOD OUT THERE AND BEGIN to scream OUT, "SAUL HAS KILLED HIS THOUSANDS. BUT DAVID, HIS TENS OF THOUSANDS." IMMEDIATELY THE SPIRIT OF JEALOUSY GOT UPON KING SAUL AND HE CAME THERE AND HE TRIED TO DESTROY. HE TRIED TO DESTROY THE GREATEST ANOINTING THAT WOULD EVER BE A KING IN ALL THE LAND. YOU realize that SAUL'S OWN SON JONATHAN actually became David's very own best friend. That there was a loyalty that was locked between between Jonathan and David. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS UNITED BECAUSE OF A BATTLE. There was a relationship THAT WAS SPENT AND STRENGTHENED BECAUSE OF BATTLE EXPERIENCES. And they had a covenant of love between one another. YOU EVER HAD THAT THAT KIND of a friend that there that that that the reason why that you are friends is because there's something that DREW YOU TOGETHER. THERE'S NOTHING like a friend that could that can go with you in the middle of a battle. YOU SEE, THERE'S A lot of people that can be your friends before the battle, BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, YOU'LL FIND OUT WHO YOUR REAL FRIEND IS. AND JONATHAN WAS THAT KIND OF A FRIEND TO DAVID. HE HAD BUILT HIM IN SUCH A WAY. HE HAD SACRIFICED HIS OWN LIFE IN SO MANY PLACES THAT JONATHAN ACTUALLY GAVE HIM OF HIS OWN HIS OWN KINGLY GARBS. JONATHAN DEFENDED HIM AGAINST PRESSURE AGAINST HIS OWN DADDY. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DIDN'T WANT SOMEBODY THAT WOULD BE JEALOUS BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS GREATER IN THE KINGDOM. GOD WAS GOING TO RAISE UP A LITTLE BITTY DAVID. HALLELUJAH. HE WAS GOING TO RAISE UP A DAVID THAT HAD PREPARED HIMSELF FOR BATTLE BEFORE THE BATTLE EVER SHOWED UP. HE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO PRAY BEFORE THEY EVER GOT INTO BATTLE. HE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP BEFORE THEY EVER GOT IN CHURCH. HE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP IN PRIVATE JUST AS MUCH AS THEY COULD WORSHIP IN PUBLIC. HE WANTED SOMEBODY, HALLELUJAH, THAT KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE UNDERQUALIFIED. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE in victory. &gt;&gt; Other man said in the message, "Hear ye him." HE SAID, "HOW THE WORLD IS WANTING TO SEE TODAY the real display of Christianity OF REAL HEROISM THAT'S WILLING TO TAKE THE LORD JESUS IN SPITE OF DEATH, CRITICISM, or whatever IT MAY BE, STAND OUT THERE AND BE A SOLDIER OF THE CROSS." HE SAID, "THE WORLD IS WANTING TO SEE IT." AND I SAY, IF THE WORLD'S WANTING TO SEE IT, THEN THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK BACK TO DAYS OF PAUL AND TO LOOK BACK TO THE DAYS OF PETER JUST TO LOOK BACK THERE AND SEE THE DAYS OF REAL HEROISM HEROISM AND CHRISTIANITY. BUT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. IF THE WORLD IS WANTING TO SEE IT, THEN WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IT TO THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon WENT ON TO SAY, HE SAID, "IN THE GOD," HE SAID, "THE GOD ISN'T GOING TO TAKE ONE OVER this way and one over that way and send one east and one other west. He's going to keep you together." He said, "IF WE'LL JUST LET THE HOLY GHOST KEEP US TOGETHER. WE'LL BE ONE." YOU SEE, THE ATTACK OF THE ENEMY, IT'S TO COMPLETELY DIVIDE US. IT'S TO DESTROY US. IT'S TRYING TO GET IN BETWEEN BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD. BUT IF WE COULD BE ONE, IF WE JUST DON'T LET THE DEVIL PULL YOU OFF on one wrong road, WE'LL BE ONE HEART, one mind, ONE ACCORD BY ONE SPIRIT, THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE GOD OF GOD THAT WILL GUIDE US TO ALL THE TRUTH. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU'VE GOT [screaming] TO FOLLOW YOUR GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WE ARE FACING AN ENEMY THAT WANTS TO COME BETWEEN YOU and between THE PREACHER. WE ARE FACING AN ENEMY THAT WANTS TO COME IN AND DIVIDE THE VERY SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS, THE VERY SPIRIT OF LOVE, THE VERY SPIRIT OF THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY WHERE IT STARTED AT, WELL, IT'S MANY, MANY YEARS AGO. BUT WHERE HAS RAISED ITS UGLY HEAD WAS IN 2020 WHEN CO CAME IN AND THERE WAS MORE DIVISION IN BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD THAN EVER WAS BEFORE BY ONE DISEASE. BUT I'LL SAY THAT THING WAS OF THE DEVIL. AND THE GREATEST THING TO BREAK UP DIVISION IS THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 4:9 says, "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe TO HIM THAT IS ALONE when he fall. FOR HE HATH NOT ANOTHER to help him up. Again, if two lie together, THEN THEY HAVE HEAT. BUT HOW CAN ONE BE WARM ALONE? And if one prevail AGAINST HIM, TWO SHALL WITHSTAND HIM. AND A THREE-FOLD cord is not QUICKLY BROKEN. SO WE'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WE ARE MORE RESILIENT TOGETHER. WE ARE BETTER WARRIORS TOGETHER. WE OVERCOME THE ENEMY, HIS ATTACKS BETTER TOGETHER. Can you say amen? I read this statistic many years ago AND I I STUDYING THIS AND I WENT BACK AND FOUND IT. BUT I WAS READING I I HAD READ IT THAT certain Belgian Belgian HORSES OR OR PERSON HORSES THAT ARE DRAFT HORSES, THEY ARE BUILT IN SUCH A WAY to carry a load. AND THOSE PERS ARE BUILT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD 8,000 LBS BY THEMSELVES. AND IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH power that they have. But when YOU PUT TWO TOGETHER, YOU WOULD THINK THAT EASILY IT WOULD BE 16,000 lbs that they would pull together. But absolutely, it's it's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN YOUR MATHEMATICAL MIND CAN figure out. Because when you put these TWO HORSES TOGETHER, THEY ACTUALLY pull three times their weight, they can pull 24,000 lbs. This is where the word synergy actually comes up. THAT THERE IS 1 + 1 EQUALS THREE. THAT ONE force is better with another force. BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IF THESE DRAFT HORSES ARE TRAINED IN SUCH A WAY THAT GOT A MASTER CRAFTSMAN THAT KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AS A HORSEMAN, HE STUDIES THEM. HE LOOKS AT THEIR DNA AND HE PAIRS THEM WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HORSE OR THE RIGHT KIND OF CHURCH MEMBER OR THE RIGHT KIND OF WORSHIPPER. THAT HORSEMAN CAN GET OUT OF THOSE TWO HORSES NOT 24,000 BUT FOUR TIMES THE POWER THEM two horses together CAN PULL 32,000 POUNDS. HALLELUJAH. WELL, I SAY IF horses could be TRAINED TO PULL THAT KIND OF A POWER COME ON SOMEBODY TO BEAR A BROTHER'S LOAD TO HELP A SISTER OUT WHEN SHE'S FALLEN. THEN I SAY IF ONE WILL PUT A FLIGHT A THOUSAND THAN TWO 10 THOUSANDS. I SAY THAT WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER. I SAY THIS I SAY THIS THAT YOU'LL NEVER REALIZE THE POWER OF BROTHERHOOD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You see David was powerful by himself BUT YOU PUT HIM ALONGSIDE OF JONATHAN THEY WERE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. I GOT SOME FRIENDS LIKE THAT. I HAD I THOUGHT I HAD FRIENDS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS OUT THERE in the world and we was A WRECK. WE WAS SOMEBODY THAT YOU DID NOT WANT TO MESS WITH. I AIN'T going to call their names. Praise God. Some of them sitting here. BUT LET ME SAY THIS. I GOT BETTER FRIENDS NOW THAN I EVER HAD MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. YOU PUT ME WITH MICHAEL RAY, TIMOTHY PUIT, MATTHEW SPENCER, WILLIAM BORAVON. [screaming] HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S MESSING WITH. Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU PUT SISTER KATIE WITH SISTER TRACY, HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOT. YOU PUT SISTER GABRIELLE WITH SISTER ABIGAIL, HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S MESSING WITH. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise. I believe that too many times we got independent Christians on. &gt;&gt; I can do this on my own. I'm battling this thing on my own. I'll handle this thing on my own. LET ME SAY THIS. YOU'LL never realize the power of Jonathan and David's covenant THAT THEY HAD AS FRIENDSHIP WHILE YOU STAY APART. But when they were together, they experienced a spiritual strength that they never had alone. Let me say it to you like this. I'm going to get a little bit ahead of myself, BUT THE MIGHTY MEN WHEN they joined David, their unity turned a fugitive into A KING BECAUSE WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER. LET ME SAY IF YOU GET UNDER AN ACTS TWO ANOINTING AND YOU PUT 120 FOUL 120 ON THE INSIDE OF ONE ACCORD, ONE MIND IN ONE PLACE, THEN YOU WILL RELEASE THE POWER OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Help me Jesus. Brother man would talk about Moses. HE TALK ABOUT JEREMIAH'S MEN. HE SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO go out there and be mocked. He said they didn't want to go out there and be ridiculed. HE SAID, "BUT JEREMIAH," HE SAID, JEREMIAH SAID, he said, "Now, if I don't say these things, if I don't do these things, then it's GOING TO BE LIKE FIRE SHUT UP IN MY BONES." HE SAID, GOD HAD SO MUCH COMPLETE control over them prophets till he WAS THEIR VOICE, THEIR ACTION. HALLELUJAH. He said, "GIVE ME A CHURCH THAT'S SO COMPLETELY anointed with God till every action AND EVERY MOVE IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD." HE SAID, "THEY'LL WALK IN THE SHIKINA OF GLORY." AND HE SAID, "I'LL SHOW YOU A MESSIAH, AN ANOINTED ONE, STANDING upon the earth." YOU SEE WHAT THE POWER OF PENTECOST WAS? It showed they were there in one mind, one accord. They didn't HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE DIFFERENT MOTIVES. BECAUSE YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT REAL UNITY, you got real power. And where you got real unity AND AND YOU GOT POWERFUL CREATURES THAT ARE built to be the very AMATEURS OF GOD, YOU WILL SPEAK things into existence. What did Hattie do? She got in the same mind. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She was just a little bitty old woman and had lost a lot of things, BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF, BUT SHE GOT IN THE SAME MIND THAT THE PROPHET GOT HIT. SHE WASN'T NEEDING SQUIRRELS. COME ON, SOMEBODY. SHE DIDN'T NEED A MILLION DOLLARS. SHE MAY HAVE WANTED IT, BUT SHE DIDN'T NEED IT. BUT WHAT SHE NEEDED, SHE GOT IN THE SAME UNITY OF WILLIAM BRHAM, AND IT PRODUCED TWO SAVED SONS. I SAY IF YOU CAN GET IN THE SAME MIND, IN THE SAME SPIRIT, IN THE SAME SIMILITUDE AS THE PROPHET, THEN OUR PRODALS HAVE GOT TO COME BACK HOME. THEN MIRACLES HAVE GOT TO TAKE PLACE. The Bible said in 1 Corinthians 12:12, for as the body is one and hath many members, all the members of that one body, being many are one body, soul also is Christ. For by one spirit, somebody say by one spirit, we are all baptized into one body, one body, whether we be from grotto or Elton, ONE BODY, ONE SPIRIT, WHETHER WE BE JEWS or Gentiles, WHETHER WE BE BOND or free, AND HAVING BEEN MADE ALL TO DRINK INTO ONE SPIRIT. FOR THE BODY IS NOT ONE MEMBER, but many. YOU SEE, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAVE A ROLE IN THIS BATTLE. And I want to say this that only true victory will COME WHEN WE FIGHT TOGETHER. YOU SEE, IN MANY OF BATTLES, IN MANY of battles, there is there there might be a general, there's captains, THERE'S FOOT SOLDIERS, THERE'S THERE'S ARMOR BEARS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD CHEF IN THE MIDST OF IT. BUT THEY ALL HAVE ONE PURPOSE. THEY ALL HAVE ONE GOAL. IN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "IT TAKES MORE than the power of gifts. It takes more than joining the church. IT TAKES THE BIRTH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO BREAK DOWN OUR WALLS AND TO UNITE US TOGETHER AS ONE CHRISTIAN BODY MOVING FOR ONE OBJECTIVE AND ONE GOAL. IF YOUR OBJECTIVE DOES NOT LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE, THEN YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A SPIRIT OF FELLOWSHIP. IF YOUR GOALS DO NOT LINE UP WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOU CAN BE DOING AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO DO, BUT IF THEY'RE NOT LINING UP WITH THE BIBLE, THEN IT'LL NEVER COME OUT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR WAY AND GOD'S WAY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU CAN'T BE WORKING AGAINST US WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO WORK FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WE ALL GOT ONE GOAL. THAT'S THE RAPTURE. WE ALL GOT ONE GOAL. THAT'S A BODY CHANGE. WE ALL GOT ONE GOAL. TO SEE OUR LOST LOVED ONES SAVED. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We said, "Well, I don't know whether my part's very big or not." You remember when JFK when he was walking through NASA for the very first time? He's down there in 1960s and he's walking through he's walking through NASA and there's a man standing over there. He's a janitor and he's got a broom in his hand and JFK comes up to him and says, "Sir, what do you do here?" He said, "Sir, I'm helping put a man on the moon." YOU SEE, HE REALIZED THAT HIS JOB WAS AS IMPORTANT AS THEM ASTRONAUTS THAT was getting in the tube. You see, the point of it IS NO MATTER HOW SMALL, NO MATTER HOW BIG, WE GOT ONE MISSION. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Come on, SOMEBODY. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? 1 Corinthians 1 and 10 says, "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions amongst you, but that ye be perfectly joined TOGETHER IN THE SAME MIND and in the same judgment." You see, unity strengthens us when we're saying the same thing. You got people, well, brother Man said people saying, you come to question and answer said, "You're saying this and you're saying that people are saying this." He said, "You just say what them tapes say. You just stay WITH WHAT THEM TAPES SAY." AND I TELL YOU WHAT, I HAVE NEVER BEEN wrong in following what them tapes say. I have never preached one service OUT OF ORDER BY SAYING WHAT THEM TAPES SAY. I HAVE NEVER PREACHED THE TALKING MESSAGE AND SOMEBODY NOT GET A TOUCH FROM THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE I SAID WHAT THEM TAPES SAID. WHEN I PREACH ON THE GODHEAD EXPLAIN AND I PREACH WHAT THEM TAPES SAY, THEN THERE IS A POWER TO BACK UP. WHY? BECAUSE THE MINISTRY HAS BEEN BACKED UP BY A VINDICATED PROPHET. Blessed be the name of THE LORD. YOU STAY WITH WHAT? SAY THE SAME THING. HE SAID, I'LL JUST TRANSFER THE WORDS TO YOUR MOUTH THAT IT TAKES TO DEFEAT SATAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO come up on with it ON YOUR OWN. JOSHUA, JUST SAY WHAT MOSES SAID. YOU AIN'T GOT TO COME UP WITH A NEW MESSAGE. YOU JUST GOT TO SAY WHAT MOSES SAID. POSSESS WHAT MOSES TALKED ABOUT. WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAW IT AND HE SAW A PEOPLE MARCHING IN STEP. SO THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE THAT COMES UNDER THE UNITY OF THE HEADSHIP OF THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST AND COME ANOINT it and the message I will restore. He said Pentecost has got a disease. He said it's got a lot of fungus growing on it. That's right. and all of our churches got a fungus growing on it. He said, "We've let the old palmer comes with his stinger and break down brotherhood and break down immunity amongst us." Paul said in the Bible that he wanted us all to speak the same thing. He wanted us all to be in unity. Now, if it wasn't a very serious thing, then why would the prophet preach about it? So, evidently showing us that Satan is trying to come in to break the brotherhood. So, a prophet is giving us marching orders [snorts] as soldiers of the cross to don't pull no punches, TO STAY RIGHT with the word. YOU LOOK OUT THERE TODAY, THIS PAST WEEK, when you watch what the Catholic CHURCH AND THE PROTESTANT CHURCH IS ALIGNING themselves to be one, TO WORSHIP ONE GOD, HAVE ONE MONEY, have one exchange, they are uniting themselves together. HALLELUJAH. BUT BEFORE THERE WAS A WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, HE UNITED ME WITH HIM. BEFORE SATAN'S DIRTY HANDS COULD EVER GET A HOLD OF ME, GOD PLACED ME IN AN ARMY TO BREAK THE VERY SPIRIT of division. &gt;&gt; We're on the same team. &gt;&gt; You remember when brother man was standing there and he's standing right there in the midst of Pentecostal people. He's standing there in the midst of Presbyterians and the Church of Christ and the Church of GOD AND THIS THAT and the other denomination. And he's standing right there. HE SAID, "IF YOU GOT A man out there that's running with the football," he said, "Don't take the ball out of his hand just because he doesn't belong to your church." &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS A PROPHET TRYING TO DO? HE WAS TRYING TO DRAW THEM BACK TO THE OPENING OF THE WORD. But because THE GIFT OF A PROPHET MESSENGER WASN'T IN THEIR CHURCH, IN THEIR DENOMINATION, IN THEIR MESSAGE CHURCH, THEY GOT UPSET AND TRIED TO TAKE THE BALL OUT OF THE QUARTERBACK'S HAND. He said, "Don't do that. Guard for it." Well, you say, "WHO IS A FOOTBALL'S hand in, brother? It's in the hand of the HOLY GHOST. STOP TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE HAND OF THE HOLY GHOST. STOP IT. JUST GET RIGHT BEHIND [screaming] IT. PUSH. KNOCK DOWN SOMEBODY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU GOT TO CHOP BLOCK SOMEBODY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU GOT TO RUN UP BEHIND THEM AND CLIP THEM. JUST GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY SO WE CAN SCORE. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, that was one of my favorite things to do in football is to catch somebody not looking. Cuz I wasn't a big guy. I was not like my brother over here. But boy, I was I was full of it. Full of energy, full of nonsense. So if I REALLY WANTED TO H HIT SOMEBODY AND KNOCK THEM DOWN, I had to wait for the right moment. You see, Matt's that kind of guy, he could just barrel through about three or four people, but it takes me to catch that guy out there waiting alone. You know, he's got his helmet on, but don't know which way he's standing. And then all of a sudden you some redheaded dude comes up and cold him right from the side. That's what I love to do to the enemy is when he don't see me coming. Do you realize who you're uniting yourself to? Do you really realize who you're uniting yourself to? If I could paint it to you like this. You're uniting yourself to a crazy man. You realize what you're doing when you're getting ready to leave your home, leave everything, your reputation as a man, as a farmer, as a worker. You're getting ready to unite yourself with a crazy man. You're getting ready to unite yourself with a man that has has been kicked out of his own kingdom. Men don't want him because he's so spiritual. men don't want him because he's too powerful. So he goes over there and he starts hanging out with Akish and he starts hanging out with him and Akish has got respect for David. But these men come in there and they look at him. These are real warriors. And they look on David and they ask the question, "Is this not David that slay Goliath that destroyed Philistines? What is he doing here with us?" YOU KNOW WHAT DAVID DID? DAVID GOT DOWN AND STARTED ACTING. THE BIBLE SAID THAT DAVID CHANGED HIS BEHAVIOR AND STARTED ACTING LIKE A CRAZY MAN. STARTED DROOLING FROM HIS BEARD. HE STARTED CRAWLING AND SCRATCHING AND STARTED PAINTING THINGS WITH HIS FINGER. SCIENCE. HALLELUJAH. HISTORIANS SAID THAT HE WAS DRAWING A CROSS WHEN HE DID IT. I SAY IF YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU'RE DRAWING YOURSELF TO A CRAZY MAN. DAVID DID THAT SO THAT HE COULD ESCAPE THE ENEMY. WHY DID HE DO THAT? TO GET to you. &gt;&gt; THIS DAVID, OUR KING DAVID, ACTED LIKE A CRAZY MAN WHEN HE COULD HAVE HAD THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN HE NEVER HAD TO DIE, he acted like a thief and he hung on a cross for you. YOU GOT TO BE CRAZY to follow a guy LIKE THAT. YOU GOT TO BE CRAZY TO FOLLOW A MAN THAT'LL DIE ON A CROSS THAT'LL BE NUMBERED WITH HIS ACCUSERS. HALLELUJAH. Brother man, I'm saying now a soldier has got to learn the sounds of his bugle or the trumpet. He doesn't know if the trumpet blows or whether charge or whether retreat if he doesn't know the difference. What kind of a mixed armed army would you have? THE ENEMY WOULD CERTAINLY TRIUMPH OVER A BUNCH OF SOLDIERS THAT WERE NO BETTER TRAINED THAN THAT. HE SAID, "WE GOT TO BE UNITED. WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT THE TRUMPET is saying then, which is the trumpet, THE GOSPEL TRUMPET." THAT'S THE WORD OF the living God IS A TRUMPET. HE SAID, "DON'T MIX NOTHING WITH IT." Let me say this. I have found out about this King James version that it will whip the devil anytime, any place. No matter what kind of pressure that you put it in, no matter what devil you kind of put it in, no matter if you put it up against a SUICIDE DEVIL, A DEPRESSION DEVIL, a a a lust devil, THIS BIBLE HAS the ability to destroy every weapon that Satan could ever throw against us. YOU REMEMBER THE PROPHET? HE ALWAYS LIKED TO GO OUT there hunting and he had that one dog named Fritz. You remember the story? He said, "Now Fritz would go after anything. He would go after anything." He said, "Except for a skunk. He'd just stand out there and BARK AT HIM." HE SAID, "BUT IF I told him, sick him, Fritz," HE SAID, "HE'D GO RIGHT IN THERE AFTER THAT OLD SKUNK." HE SAID, "NOW THE PROPHET SAID, THE BIGGEST STINKER THAT I KNOW OF IS THE DEVIL. AND WHEN YOU START SAYING AMEN, IT'LL SEND THE WORD RIGHT TO THAT STINKING DEVIL AND IT DESTROY. AND IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES, THEN WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN STEADFAST ON THIS WORD. SO YOU GOT TO SAY, SEEK HIM BROTHER, SEEK HIM, BROTHER ANDREW, PREACH THE WORD, LIVE THE WORD, SOLDIERS OF THE CROSS, SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you listen, soldiers of the cross." He said, "When you disbelieve one word OF GOD'S WRITTEN BIBLE, YOU are disarmed. You're disarmed. You surrender, you jellyfish. Put on the whole armor of God. WE'RE IN A BATTLE. WHAT GOD SAID IS TRUE. EVERY MAN'S word is a lie. But as soon as you get you listen to one thing," he said, "That's his tactic. He's got you disarmed. He said, "How many things did Eve have to listen to?" One, one thing, and it disarmed her. Well, I don't know if Brother Random was just talking about his opinion or if he really had, thus sayith the Lord, on that. He said it swept right through in her mind and right into her spirit. And there she was perverted. there. It was before the act ever took place. Let me say this. Before you ever commit the sin, you've already done it in your heart. All you have to do is stay right behind it. Now, you can imagine as David is on the inside of this king, this cave. You ever been into a cave? real dark that [clears throat] real damp air and you just make the smallest move and you can hear it all the way in the very back end of that cave. You imagine these narrow passageways as David enters in and he comes into this cave and he's there. Remember why David is there? It's because Saul is hunting for him. Saul was wanting to kill him. If it hadn't been for Jonathan, David wouldn't even be in the picture because Jonathan was a good friend and he saw that somebody was trying to kill his anointing. So, he went OVER THERE AND STOPPED HIS FATHER AND SAID, "YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT MAN'S ANOINTED." NOW, David is on the inside of this limestone cave. He's got no army. HE'S GOT NO FAMILY. HE'S GOT NO SECURITY. HE'S GOT NO POWER. HE'S GOT NO LOYAL SUPPORT. HE AIN'T GOT A HOME. AND THESE MEN, THEY COME TO HIM. They find the king IN DESPAIR. THEY FIND THE KING, A FUGITIVE IN HIS OWN KINGDOM. A MAN THAT IS ANOINTED TO BE THE KING OVER ISRAEL AND JUDAH. HE'S HIDING IN A CAVE. AND IN DENS, THEY FIND HIM AS A RENEGADE HIDING IN A CAVE. But let me say this. When you're in a CAVE WITH DAVID, THE supernatural is going to happen. When you're in a cave with King Jesus, THE SUPERNATURAL'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE DAVID TAKES THIS BAND OF MISFITS AND HE MAKES THEM IN TO THE GREATEST WARRIORS THAT HAS EVER KNOWN THROUGHOUT SCRIPTURES. YOU MIGHT FIND ME IN A CAVE, BUT WHEN I COME OUT OF THIS CAVE, &gt;&gt; I MIGHT BE A MISFIT ON THE OUTSIDE. I MIGHT BE DISTRESSED. ON THE OUTSIDE, I MIGHT BE A DEBTOR. ON THE OUTSIDE, I MIGHT BE DISCONTENT ON THE OUTSIDE. BUT ON THE INSIDE, &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. THE KINGDOM IS ESTABLISHED ON THE INSIDE. ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, DAVID TAKES A man and makes him a warrior. &gt;&gt; You see, if he can ever get you in a cave, it amazes me. Forgive me. It amazes me in the world that we live in that we literally are raising a bunch of scared sheep trying to protect our children from this that or the other. Literally pull them away when things get too tense, when things get too tight and when things get unnormal, when things get too loud and when things get too frightening, we begin to pull them back. But if you could ever realize there's power in those moments. I'm sorry. I got about the worst headache you can ever imagine. But we try to shelter and keep our children from the greatest abilities and the greatest moments. You see, I realize that sitting right here, if we pull them out, then the world will only have darkness. If we pull them out of everything that's hard, they'll never have be able have the ability to overcome in their own self. You see, if we do all the overcoming for them, then they'll never be able to overcome when they turn 18 years old. Now, &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING THUMB OUT THERE TO THE WOLVES, BUT I'M SAYING THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF ENEMY THAT WE GOT OUT THERE. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THE DEVIL IS A LIAR, THAT HE'S A ROARING LION SEEKING WHOM HE MAY DEVOUR. AND I'M AFRAID that too many parents are raising a bunch of wimps. I'm going to preach. I MIGHT GET KICKED OUT OR KICKED OFF OF YOUTUBE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT TOO MANY TIMES THAT WE ARE RAISING A BUNCH OF WIMPS THAT TELL PEOPLE THAT OUR CHILDREN CANNOT LIVE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Let me say, IF YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW DAVID, YOU GOT TO GET ON THE INSIDE OF THE CAVE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU LOOKED APART ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. IF YOU DON'T LOOK THE PART LIKE YOU LIKE ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, YOU BETTER LOOK THE SAME WAY ON THE OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; BROTHERS, BROTHERS, YOU BETTER STOP WEARING THEM SHORTS AND BEING A PART OF THE BSS SOCIETY. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SISTERS. THEN YOU BETTER START DRESSING RIGHT, PREACHING RIGHT, LIVING RIGHT. IF DAVID IS REALLY ON THE INSIDE, THEN DAVID WILL BE ON THE OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; WELL, everybody else plays their video games. Let me tell you, if you want to teach your kids how to kill, there's a better way to do it than showing them some video game. Let me tell you, the greatest Hallelujah. I I'll tell you what, brother Ron, you better clean this up tomorrow. But you young boys, YOU YOUNG BOYS, YOU EVER WANT TO BE A part of some of the greatest killings, grab a hold of this word right here. What's What's some of them What's some of them games? Is it Fortnite? And I don't I think that's a game. They kill people in there. I got them What do they call it? Call of Duty. You know, we we got a COOD, too. Conduct, order, and doctrine. We got our own cood book. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. YOU WANT TO RE HEAR ABOUT SOME REAL KILLINGS? Let's flip over to 1st Samuel 17. Let's pull over there to 1st Samuel 18. LET'S HEAR HOW HOW DAVID HOW DAVID SO WANTED THAT GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN UP THERE IN THE KINGDOM THAT HE WENT OUT THERE AND TOOK THE FORES OFF OF THEM OFF OF them Philistines up there. If you want to HEAR ABOUT SOME KILLINGS, THEN THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT ALL THAT SHAMGAR DID. THINK ABOUT ALL THAT SAMSON DID. &gt;&gt; MAN, NAH, I don't read that in my Bible. That's because you ain't got a hold of the King James version. &gt;&gt; I tell you what our kids are feeding too much on. It's King James, LeBron, AND THEY NEED TO BE FEEDING ON KING JAMES RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; You want to be a warrior, then get in the cave. Come on, somebody. If you want to BE A WARRIOR, GET IN THIS CAVE WITH KING DAVID. Let me tell you, WHEN YOU GET ON THE INSIDE OF THIS KING, on the INSIDE OF THIS CAVE WITH KING DAVID, YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW he killed Goliath. He's going to teach you the secret weapons. He's going to TAKE YOU THROUGH CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED. HE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH HE WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE ATUNEMENT. He will take YOU THROUGH THE RAPTURE. HE WILL TEACH YOU LEADERSHIP. HALLELUJAH. HE WILL TEACH YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN PERFECT COMMUNION. If you can get on the inside of the cave with David, what happened to David? What happened to these men that they would unite to him over this cause? They had so watched his life, Brother Duck. They had been so acquainted with him that they recognized that God was using and giving him authority and leadership. They had watched that David had so much trusted God. He had trusted him in the good moments. He trusted him in the bad moments. and his integrity towards the word of God actually drew this band of misfits to him. I wonder why did Jesus wait till he was 30 years old to call Peter, Matthew, James, John? It's because he had to allow them to get to a position that he could pull them. Because there's got to be certain spots in your life where you literally are willing to go to a cave. &gt;&gt; How many's in debt here? Everybody can raise their hand. How many is discontent with Leosa? You can raise your hand. Literally, how many people are distressed? We could all raise our hand. Well, you are in the same position that these men were in. Brother Brandham said in why little Bethlehem. He said, "Rise you SONS AND WARRIORS." LET'S CUT BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL BETHLEHEM. Remember when David come to his throne, THESE MEN STOOD BEHIND HIM because he knowed or they knowed he was coming to the throne. And they know that David was going to be on the throne. NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE WAS REJECTED OUT, he was the worst fugitive in the land. Do you realize who you're uniting yourself to? Do you really want to be identified with the worst fugitive in all the land? Am I painting this picture okay for you? He's the worst. The king, THE POLITICIANS DON'T WANT him in the land. He was the worst fugitive in the land. And so is the true word of God this morning. He said it's foreign to all organizations. But when THE WORLD DON'T WANT HIM, WHEN THE WORLD DON'T WANT OUR DAVID, WHEN THE WORLD DON'T WANT OUR KING, THERE ARE SOME BATTLE FORGE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE WILLING TO DRAW THE SWORD AND DRAW THEIREL DAVID. THE PROPHET SAID, GALLANT MAN holding to David because they know he was coming in power. They know no matter what anybody ELSE SAID, GOD HAD ANOINTED on David and they knowed it and they were Gentiles. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY TURNED HIM OUT, THEY KNOWED THAT HE WAS COMING to power. And one day there, he said, "What?" HE SAID, "IT'S A TYPE." AND WHAT IS A TYPO? IS IT TODAY? IT'S CHRIST A FUGITIVE. YOU SAY, "CHRIST, A FUGITIVE?" He said, "According to the Bible," he said, "we just took it through the seven church ages." He said, "This leysian c church, this leodyian church Christ WAS A FUGITIVE OUTSIDE of his church, REJECTED, TRYING TO GET BACK in again. He was a fugitive to his own church. And the reason he's a fugitive, it's because he's a word and they won't let him in. So where does that place you? I'm on the inside of the cave. Come on, somebody. You can shout with me right there. Where's that place you at? If they don't want him, but you got him. Are you hearing what I'm saying? Are you are you are YOU GETTING WHAT I'M PUTTING DOWN? Let me say this to you. If you got him on the inside of the cave and they kicked him out, hallelujah. That dog right there a hunt. IF YOU GOT HIM ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, THEN THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN ROB YOU AWAY FROM IT. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN STEAL YOUR JOY. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM KINGDOM POWER AS LONG AS YOU GOT KING DAVID. I [screaming] LOVE WHAT DAVID DID TO THESE MEN. HE DID EXACTLY WHAT ROMANS 12:12 SAYS. BE YE NOT CONFORMED TO THIS WORLD, BUT BE YE TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF YOUR MIND. HE LITERALLY TRANSFORMED THEM FROM MISFITS TO MIGHTY GENTILE WARRIORS. &gt;&gt; THESE MEN WERE NOT INITIALLY WARRIORS. THEY WERE SOCIALLY OUTCASTS. THEY WERE DEBTORS. But he made them a captain. THEY WERE DISCONTENT, BUT HE MADE CONTENT IN THE PROMISES. THEY WERE DISTRESSED, BUT HE GAVE THEM PEACE LIKE A RIVER. The Bible said in 1 Corinthians or Chronicles 11 12 and 8, it said that the Gadites separated themselves to David. They did this for David. They pulled themselves away from worldly lust and worldly pleasures for David. And there's a lot of times we sing that song, Nearer my God, to thee. But the nearer we can get to Christ, the further we should be away from the world. Let me say this, these men left their homes. When you read the scripture so many times, you read over it and you just read over it like they were some supernatural beings, but they were real men. Had real passion, had real wives back home, children that they loved. They left their comfort. They left their safety. They left their reputation to get David because there's something about this guy. There's something special about him. I don't know what it is, but I'm just I'm drawn to it. These men would literally leave their homes for months to fight alongside of a guy that is hiding in a cave. You imagine when you start reading this and you start seeing these men. These are men maybe not of great stature but there's one that I I absolutely love the story of Banana. It's only a few scriptures wrote about Banana but Baniah man I'd like to met him. I believe I'm going to one day. He was a guy that didn't mind being considered with the top three in the message. &gt;&gt; He wasn't considered with Shama and Adino, the son of a dodo. I love what brother Tom Ray said. How would you like to been named that son of a dodo? He said, only dodo I know is a bird. Doddo bird. And he elabart as long as he's apart. AND BANIAH WENT DOWN THERE AND THE BIBLE said that he went down there and destroyed two men that were lionlike. And we read over that. You imagine these men were as fierce as a lion. Science says when you study a line, there is nothing as close to a line like a man in his nature because he wants to destroy. He wants to get his goal. You see, there's something powerful about a lion. You see, a lion doesn't just want to kill. A lion enjoys chasing. A lion loves to hunt you down. And Baniah was the guy. These are two warriors from their youth, and he's hunting them down. Now, I love I love a good hunt. I'll just be real honest with you. I ain't had too much good success, but I sure do enjoy a good hunt. But, you know, it ain't all about the killing that I enjoy. I enjoy the I I enjoy the strategy behind it. I enjoy everything that is a part of it. And Baniah was this kind of a hunter. And he was looking for two lionlike men. And he got a hold of them. It said that THE BIBLE SAID THAT he destroyed a great Egyptian THAT WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HE WAS FIVE CUBITS HIGH. He was 7 foot 6 in. And he went down there. I love the picture that the Bible pictures TO US THAT BANIAH WENT DOWN THERE, grabbed his sword, and flipped his spear around and killed him right there. BANIAH WENT DOWN INTO A pit one day because there WAS HALLELUJAH. HE GOT DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF THIS PIT AND this leopard WENT ON THERE. IT WAS GOING ON A RAMPAGE AND IT WAS DESTROYING PEOPLE'S HOMES. BUT BANIAH WAS A HUNTER. SO BANAYIAH WENT AFTER THAT LEOPARD AND HE KILLED THAT LEOPARD IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOWSTORM. &gt;&gt; BANIAH WAS A WARRIOR BEFORE HE GOT IN THE CAVE. BUT WHEN HE GOT ON THE INSIDE OF A CAVE WITH KING DAVID, THEN DAVID MADE HIM HIS PERSONAL BODYGUARD. &gt;&gt; Brother Jerry, I know you're a warrior, but before before you got the Holy Ghost, you was a warrior. But you can imagine after you got the token and David says, "No more out there, but you're gonna stand right here." David's saying, "I'm not going to fight my battles." Jerry is. I'm not going to fight my battles. Tom is. You done some mighty work out there, but now you're gonna be my personal assistant. When I need you to whoop a good devil, let me say it like this. When somebody when God needs somebody to beat down depression, he sends a little bitty old woman that's a mother. Maybe she has fought this thing all of her life and it has surrounded her family. So God says, "You know what? I left some work for my children to do. So, I'M GOING TO ALLOW MY LITTLE LADY DOWN there in Elton to be able to whoop THAT THING. NO, I'M not going to do it myself, but she's going to use what I gave her. I SHOWED HER HOW to defeat. I SHOWED HER HOW to destroy. MATTER OF FACT, SHE'S MY PERSONAL BODYGUARD, and I know that I got confidence in her. She'll get the job done. Now, let me say this. I'm a real fighter, but you really don't want to mess with my wife. I'm a good shot, but you really don't want to mess with my wife because I may ask you some questions before I shoot you, BUT MY WIFE WILL SHOOT YOU AS QUICK as a as a hammer gets called back. &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT KIND OF POWER TO GIVE TO CERTAIN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; SO, HE GAVE THE HOLY GHOST TO PEOPLE THAT KNEW HOW TO PULL THE TRIGGER INSTEAD OF PETTING AN OLD DEVIL. SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT AIN'T TIME TO TALK. IT AIN'T TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. How's it like to be the personal bodyguard to David? Well, I tell you what. I was sent on an assignment one day and you know, nobody else would stand, but I was going to stand. And these Philistines were coming in, but this was my piece of property. And the Bible said that everybody ran away but Shama, which means the Lord is present. Shama didn't run. SHAMA WAS PRESENT. AND SHAMA STOOD RIGHT THERE AND DESTROYED THOSE Philistines from taking his spiritual food in DUE SEASON. IT IS SAID ABOUT ONE OF THE THREE MIGHTY THAT HE BEAT SO MANY THAT THE THAT THE SWORD ACTUALLY FROZE IN HIS HAND. THAT ONE MAN WENT DOWN INTO A PIT AND KILLED A LION, SLAYED 800. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because they saw something on the inside of David. And it was through the battle that they literally began to be a bond. Let me say it like this. You ever been in a fight? I hope you haven't been to many fights, but I know that some of you have. But when you are in a fight or a spiritual fight, you will never forget who takes up for you. You will never forget who pulls a sword for you. There is no loyalty like the loyalty in battle. And there was a bond that was built between this band of brethren. Now, there's more than 30, but there's 30 mighty men. And there's three select, but there was over 400 men that came to this cave. I was I was talking to brother Michael Ray, and he he told me this. He said, 'I was actually doing some study on the recruitment numbers of the US Army and how they're higher and they actually beat their own targets. He said, and many people wonder at why. He said it's because they see a cause to fight for. He said, man crave strong leadership and all run to support a cause. He said these men will come from all walks of life to join together in passion to hold up a flag. A bond is created unlike any other. THERE IS NO BOND LIKE the bond OF BATTLE. LET ME SAY THIS to you. You think about the men that have been united here. I think about just our own personal church. And I'm not just talking about our church. There's many. But let me just say it like this. You think about the men that have surrounded Brother, men like brother William, men like brother Matt, men like brother Alden, men like brother Vernon, men like brother VJ, men like myself. What is it? There is something there. We are united under our headship. And if you if you don't go here and you go somewhere, YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT my pastor. You ought to feel the same way. And we are in one battle. AND WE GOT ONE GIANT. AND WE GOT ONE KILLER. WE GOT ONE SLOO. WE'VE GOT ONE ENEMY THAT IS AGAINST US. But we got one stone that is sure to work. AND IF YOU WILL APPLY THAT STONE IN FAITH, THEN GOD WILL GET A HOLD OF THAT STONE. HE WILL UNIFY YOUR FAITH WITH MY FAITH AND IT'LL get to going A 100 MILLION MILES AN HOUR AND STRIKE THE ENEMY AT ITS RIGHT SPOT. THE BIBLE SAID, "WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD overcometh the world, and this IS A VICTORY THAT overcometh the world, even our faith." Faith is not soft. Faith ain't passive. Faith fights. And the scripture said that whosoever is born of God, no matter what the opposition is, overcomes. I want to read this to you as I'm getting ready to close. Don't pack your bags yet. I still got some shout material here for you. Let the pressure down. Praise God. We're about to get out here. Don't tell me. I know. I've sat through some services myself. Y'all ain't got nothing to complain about here. &gt;&gt; If you do, there's the door. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; when the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, he he came and he spoke in our nation's capital just just last year, I believe it was. He stood there in October the 7th and he began to tell some stories about some soldiers who lived this word overcome. I want you to realize this ain't something that you read about in the Bible. This is present day. These are real men in real battles with real wounds that got real courage. He starts telling a story about a man, a soldier. He had no car, had no ride, had no transportation. And when the attack be to break out, he ran eight miles just to be in the front line just to defend his land. No excuses, no hesitation, but he overcame everything that was in his way. NETANYAHU SAID NOW AND HE POINTS out and he has a man set up. He said there's a soldier who lost his arm. He said another this soldier threw himself on a grenade to save his entire company. He lost his arm in THE EXPLOSION. HE SAID NOW MOST MEN WOULD RETIRE AND most men would never return to the battlefield. BUT HE WENT RIGHT BACK TO THE BATTLEFIELD AND THIS TIME HE WENT BACK A COMMANDER. HE WAS WOUNDED, BUT HE WAS NOT DEFEATED. HE WAS HIT, BUT HE WAS NOT BROKEN. HE OVERCAME. &gt;&gt; HE POINTED OUT AND HAD ANOTHER MAN STAND UP ON CRUTCHES. If you ain't seen it, it's powerful. He said, "This man right here, this soldier right here, HE LOST HIS LEG IN the middle of a battle." He said, "MOST OF THEM WOULD FALL BACK. MOST OF THEM WOULD QUIT, BUT HE KEPT ON FIGHTING." NETANYAHU SAID, "THESE MEN ARE UNBOWED, UNADORNED, UNDONEED, AND UNAFRAID. WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE WORLD." NOT BECAUSE WE'RE STRONG, NOT BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN WOUNDED, NOT BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN A BATTLE, NOT BECAUSE A BATTLE IS EASY, but because we met God in a cave. &gt;&gt; Whether I can feel him or not, I'll fight for him. Whether I see him or not, I'll fight for him. Whether I whether I can ever feel his anointing again, I I'll forever preach this message is right &gt;&gt; and I'll back up what he's got to say. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. The musicians can come. That's what real overcoming looks like. I was in I was in uh New Zealand with brother David Sour. We sitting down for lunch one day. I took the morning services and he took the evening services. We sitting down having some lunch. I believe we was actually having lamb that day. This is funny because we're sitting there and we're just kind of talking and I never been to South Africa, but brother brother David had been there, many others. And there's a brother by the name of Brian Jones and he's actually he's actually you can see him on YouTube and different things. He's actually very he he he get united with these animals and talk to these animals and these animals can talk back to him and he actually he can bring them apart to be a part of his his own their pride and tribe and different things. He he's got a his own basically compound where these animals are like a zoo that he lives in and these monkeys coming in and out of his house and different things and all these animals and different things. He he lives with them. I'll never forget this. And brother David got to talking about he said there was this one line that brother Brian had. His name was Big Boy. If I don't tell this story right, I believe I I I believe I got it just right because I'll never forget this moment. Brother David said he said he said he had this line named Big Boy and he said, "Now, Brother David, he said he said he accepts me as one of his pride." He said he thinks I'm part of him. He said, "Now you go down there." And he said, 'You stand right here, right in front of right in front of this cage where big boy's at. And he said, 'Now all of his females are sitting over here in this corner. And he said, "Big boy's there." He said, all of a sudden, Brother Brian says, "He's all the way up on the hill." He said, "Big boy." And big boy was in there. [snorts] He said every fiber of that lion's body was breathing. He said his muscles and everything. He said, "Big boy, big boy," [screaming] he said. And before long, he let out the biggest roar you could ever imagine. He said, "But when he did, his female started backing him up over here." He said, he went, "Whoa!" I'll never forget it, Brother David. The spirit of God got on brother David. He said his female was backing him up. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. HIS FEMALE WAS BACKING HIM UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHEN THE LINE OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH &gt;&gt; WHEN HIS WIFE STARTS BACKING UP WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY? IT AIN'T JUST HIS WORD. IT'S MY WORD. [cheering] BIG BOY. BIG BOY. Big boy. LET OUT A ROAR. I AM THE LORD THY GOD THAT HEALTH ALL OF THY DISEASES. HE IS THE LORD MIGHTY IN BATTLE. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION. WHOM SHALL I FEAR AND WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID? Big boy. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Get that devil. Seek him. Seek him. ARE YOU WILLING TO BACK UP THE LINE OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH? &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said. I'm going straight off inspiration right now. I love what the prophet said. He said, "You don't have to fear. GOD DOESN'T CALL NOBODY THAT'S THAT don't have bravery on the inside of their heart." He said, "You are kin to the line of the tribe of Judah. You are kin TO THE LINE. THERE'S A LION SHUT UP ON THE INSIDE OF MY BONES. and a lion wants to hunt. And if we got A LION OUT THERE TRYING TO KILL our young people and kill our anointing, then let's anoint. Let's come together. Let's unite. I'll never forget how brother David described it. You could almost feel the lion's breath. You know, you ever been in a story and somebody's [music] got you right there? You're right in the moment. I could almost feel the lion's breath when brother David was talking about it. I can feel it right now. It's on you. The Holy Ghost is on you. The anointing is here. [music] Why are you here? WHY DID YOU COME TO THIS CHURCH? WHY DID YOU come to this cave? Why? Cuz there's a line set up on the inside of you. You may not know it. You might be a misfit. You might be a Solomon on the inside of Uriah. [music] Hallelujah. But you're going to come. You may not realize IT, URIAH, BUT YOUR DADDY WENT TO A cave so that you could give your life. Uriah. Uriah went to this cave. Solomon, do you realize what David did? Oh my Uriah. Brother Brandham said, "The very first man I meet in heaven," [music] he said, "I want it to be Uriah." Why were these men drawn to him? Uriah was so loyal. He would not leave the king's side. He would not leave the king's side. And David was getting ready to do something. But it shows something about the power of going being on the inside of a [music] cave. You see, Uriah had to do that so [music] Solomon could come forth. Why are you here? Why did you come TO THIS MOMENT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING at limestone and entering through a cave? Cuz there's an angel that'll meet you in a cave. God bless you. Hallelujah. I'd say whatever you have need of right now, the Holy Spirit's here to minister to your heart. He's here to touch you. Oh, [music] overcomer. I'm an [singing] overcomer by the [music and singing] blood of the lamb. By the word of my test, overcomer. [music and singing] Oh, I'm an overcomer. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb. By the word.
