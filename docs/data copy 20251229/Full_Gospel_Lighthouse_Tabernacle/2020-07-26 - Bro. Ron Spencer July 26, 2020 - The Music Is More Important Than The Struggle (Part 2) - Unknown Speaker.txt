thought from last week i ran out of energy last week and i'd like just to kind of continue our thought if we could on our struggle of our music i hope you enjoyed that i think it's i think it's actually going to be played this morning in edmonton and and they've been playing the services and so i think they're going really well because i got quite a few notes last night after church andrew

uh that there we love those people with all of our hearts and love the bride around the world we've been able to meet some very special friends in our life and we're so thankful for that amen maybe before we go to the book let's let's talk to him lord jesus you see the frailty of our humanity even now lord we ask you that you would come among us in a very supernatural way today lord we've

are thankful for that miracle that you would healer raise her back up in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and amen amen saint john chapter 18 and verse 2. and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus oftentimes resorted thither with his disciples and jesus then having received the band of judas then heaven received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees come thither with lanterns torches and weapons now they were going to arrest a carpenter's son and look what all they brought with them 500 men 500 men come for one man that don't have a sword don't have a knife don't have a submachine gun and a traitor and 500 men viciously to get jesus watch what happens jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him that's quite a statement we could preach for a month knowing the things which are coming upon him went forth and he saith unto them whom seek ye knowing what they were looking for they answered him jesus of nazareth and jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which portrayed him stood with them and as soon as he hath said unto them i am he they went backwards and fell to the ground you may be seated hallelujah well this is going to get good so let's just get started so there you are in the midst of all your trouble in all the midst of your seem like the chaos of your life some of you know what's coming on you some of you can see it coming for quite a while some of you find yourself in the midst of a struggle that god has somewhere bragged to the enemy and asked have you have you checked out ron spencer job have you checked out karen pruitt you've been going throughout the earth seeking whom you may devour you're you're wanting to destroy somebody i've got confidence in this one you do what you want to they're not going to they're not going to be swayed by you what whatever takes place you and i wasn't privy to that information but we knew that in this life we're going to be molded and we're going to go through some things and we're going to have some disappointments this isn't hollywood this isn't disney world man is born of woman few days if you live to be 140 years old few days full of trouble some of the things that we struggle with at times are petty you wore two different colored pair shoes to church this morning in the side of in the sight of god it's okay okay your hair didn't turn out like you thought it should okay you bought a new truck last week and it's already in the shop because you wrecked it it's okay it's okay i was shopping for a truck last sunday it's already in the shop because it's wrecked it's okay it's okay it's just got a new dink they unloaded it last week now they're going to fix it but i want to say this to you in the midst of your darkest trouble if you remember who you are [Music] all of that was to set you up in the midst of all of your darkest trouble if you remember who you are you're greater than every devil in hell now i want to just kind of give you a little background here jesus had just prayed in the garden father if it be thy will let this cut pass from me are you with me he prayed brother graham said even in one spot said he prayed against the father's will he could look at the word and see what the word said about him that these are the things that he was to fulfill because remember he was a man and as a man he had human feelings he wanted to stay here and preach he wanted to stay here and have a family but he was the redeemer are you with me what sent him to the cross why didn't he give up why didn't he turn around i'm the reason i'm the reason the lamb's book of life redemption was the plan are you with me he had showed through his life he had power over death hell he had the power to raise to kill a tree to raise a man back to life he had the power over creation call a storm out of existence turn water into wine take fish and and bless it and it would become enough because the power of his words that there would be more fragments are you with me you possess the same power in your life but it's a it lays on the inside of you but it operates by law of faith there's a few things that jesus could look at the word and see they're going to beat me like no other human being that has ever been beaten they're going to cover have a trial on me because the word told him this is what they're going to do the people that you love is going to hate you they're going to send you to calvary you're not going to be even able to carry your own cross it was written in the scriptures it was written in the scriptures about this is what you're getting ready to go through he had to surrender himself to it before he ever said i am he now judas sold him out he sold him out for a handful of change sold him out thinking jesus would take a different direction i wonder how many people that has sold the message out how it turned out for them i'm not speaking about locally i'm speaking around around the world are you with me and and when jesus is standing there and here comes judas with his 500 men of well-armed soldiers of the of the sanhedrin council as they're coming to get jesus coming to get a preacher coming to get a healer coming to get a man that's that is quiet in his spirit and they bring 500 men vicious warriors no wonder you have so much trouble in your life when satan sends demons to your house how many does he send and you look like a little puny housewife about a 130 pounds or whatever you are i'm not here that way are you with me and you just flicked devils off you just flick them off because you remember who you are are you with me go back to hell satan just go back to hell i'm not put up with you today when jesus said i am he 500 men collapsed the force that was released in i am he who was greater than no doubt had a dirty robe on he'd been down wallowing on the ground praying tears running down until his blood became his his sweat became his blood stains on his on his on his robe and he said i am he the devil knew who he was but it fulfilled the scriptures that they would fall backwards and they were slain in the presence of jesus christ getting back up getting back up to arrest him and peter would get so excited he would grab a sword and cut off of the the high priest here are you with me jesus had to remind him this is not a flesh and blood affair this is not a flesh and blood affair this isn't what we do and jesus told his lead disciple get behind me satan and then he healed he took the the the priest's ear and put it back on and it was healed the devil knows who he is i want to tell you the devil knows who he is you'll not convince the devil that he ain't greater than him just laying some foundation here the devil knows how powerful he is that's the reason he tries to convince you that you're not who you are [Music] i want you to get this part because if you get this part next week will be better you remember a couple of weeks ago i told you a little bitty woman a woman that works two jobs wrote me a letter 20 years ago she heard me preach on champion and in the middle of about a 26 page letter she told me she said brother ron be a champion and something in me rose up in first corinthians chapter 9 verse 21 22 paul writes it like this to the weak became eyes weak that i might gain the weak i may i i am i'm made of all things to all men that i might by all being saved some this i do for the gospel sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know you not that they which run in a race run off but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striving for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it they do it talking about olympics they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight eye not as one that beateth the air i don't have any time to waste here that's what he was saying but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others that i myself should be a cast away paul says i'm not going to get caught up with everything that's going up around me second corinthians chapter 12 and verse 6 for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say that now i forbear lest that any man should think of me above measure that which he seeth me to be or heareth of me unless i should get exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me that means blow after blow after blow after blow it would go it would come and go it would come and go it would come and go i want to draw something out on this if i could this morning for this i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and if they sayeth unto me my grace is sufficient for thee god says this my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in mind affirmative that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake alone for when i am weak then i am strong how many of you ever feel overwhelmed how many of you ever feel so so really to the point that you're exhausted you're burned out you feel like quitting you feel like that you just keep knocked and frailed you get so far you get knocked back down you go so far you get back knocked back down you seem like you go from one trial to another trial to another trial and you just feel like hey i'm just overwhelmed with life you can feel free to raise your hand just to show that other people that yup it's me too you felt at a point in your life you were burned out you need a refreshing there are times that people buy and live in 20 houses because they just move from one house to another house to another house to another house or buy a car and they buy another car to buy another car to buy another car preaching on myself now preaching on myself now buy another car preaching are you with me sometimes if we're not careful we'll move here move there move here move there thinking our problems will get better moving doesn't settle the problem changing friends doesn't settle the problem the problem is you it's not blaming it's not blaming it on everybody else it's you it's you look at the man in the mail it's you you know here we are in a here we are in a very intense situation with covid america's fallen apart we're literally on the footsteps of stepping into eternity we're we're getting ready to move from here to to heaven i mean pre-tribulation conditions is all around us we're standing in the darkness it is no wonder sometimes you feel overwhelmed are you with me are you with me now we as pastors we have come to a spot in our lives to where that we understand it when we come to church we can't hug one another we can't shake one another's hands we can't be intimate with one another like we have been can have picnics and and and and all kind of functions together that that become a function of a body we can't have all of those things and are you with me and we still we still want you to keep it going keep moving keep pressing forward press the battle like never before and people have overcome everything in the world and now we have challenges coming to church are you with me and as we start to get to people to be able to come back to church people are scared to come to church not scared to go to walmart not scared to go to go to work not scared to go to mcdonald's and sit for two hours [Music] but terrified that when they go to church my god i could get sick i got a license here you can get mad at me if you want to but i'm the guy that should be terrified of being anywhere but i'm not scared i put masks on i go where i want to go if i'm hungry i'll go eat i go to martin's i saw you the other day you were packing and and uh i didn't bother you because i really didn't want it wasn't supposed to be there i was too early in the game are you with me what a crazy society we are in a year ago if you walked into a bank they would press a button [Applause] but now if you walk into a bank and you don't have one they press a button [Applause] oh notice the scripture says for this i prayed three times i sought the lord thrice about this now i want to to just just think just for a minute this is the man that is writing your new testament this is the man that has the most powerful ministry in the entire new testament he stood before kings great leaders he has raised the dead he has prayed for people and they have been healed he was locked up in prison and about the midnight hour they begin to rejoice this man has shook hell he is the one of the greatest orators of all of the history of the bible yet this man will write the new testament from a roman dungeon and he's got a condition in his body to which that it overwhelms him that he's dealing with he's got a condition in his own flesh to which he goes before god and he seeks the face of god that this thing would leave him i'm preaching to you now and it was consistently there it was consistently battling him as a matter of fact he uses the term that it kept him humble he found something good in it andrew asked me that he said make a list dad as you go through this trial make a list of what you want to be better have better god do for you to be better well on the first the first top i said sister connie i i want god to to to be with her be with her through this trial because through a trial like this it's your loved ones that's got to take care of you because i ain't always preaching in strength and power are you with me and then i i at the bottom of the page i i just wrote down i need to be sweeter mattis is not here to say amen so i walked to the pulpit this morning with with my sugar level at 400 so i'd say that that scripture or that request has been fulfilled but god is god god is god in your trial or out of your trial and you are who you are in your trial or out of your trial david writes oh spare me that i might recover my strength that's quite a statement god spare me that i might recover my strength before i go hence and be no more psalms 27 same writer the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i feel the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me eating my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear if you know who you are if you know who you are for shamgar 600 men was not enough [Music] for samson a thousand men was not enough obviously in this trial satan found out he didn't have enough when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host encamped against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life so in your source of strength is in god it's not at barnes and noble to find the book of how to overcome your battles it's not on google or youtube this is your your your strength this is your source [Applause] if you'll notice we have came a long way in a few weeks because i knew that if i could get back into this spot it would renew the inner man it would renew me and strengthen me back up to where i'm at are you with me not laying on the couch with the pity party [Applause] get back into the house of god that's where my strength is sister connie one night we'd come to a spot of just a pivotal spot about four and a half weeks ago and it was a night of desperation and she began to call out to god i got a visitation in the night and in that visitation to which that god spoke to me and into speaking to me he took me like a man standing any any kind i'm just going to share some things if you don't believe it you don't have to i just have to tell you what's real to me there's people make fun of supernatural experiences but i can tell you i've had something that's been powerful so i'm going to for the next five minutes i want to share a couple things with you and these things changed my life i i saw a vision and then this vision it was a of a great a great it seemed like a great tearing down of things and and it would be a great restructuring or rebuilding and i was standing there and as i was standing there it seemed like many from this church was there and we were working and i was looking i was looking at some chaos that was going on and the angel of the lord came and was standing behind me and he turned my shoulders like this ladies hands on my shoulders and i was standing and standing down my bedroom about four o'clock in the morning i was standing looking over my bed and he and he was just speaking to me he says and he just kind of held his hand out brother homer would do that can i hold his hand out like this and he said now ron you must see past what you see don't look at what you see but see past what you see and he paused and then he said you must think past what you think amen well the next day you know what i did i went and said what saw what brother branham said about that and brother bam uses the same terminology and look into the unseen he says you can't look at the things that you see with your human elements your human senses you must look into the unseen realm a week exactly later i'm still frail i'm still weak i'm still struggling through the days i'm still sick still having great trouble a week exactly i got a visitation in the night a power hit hit that room and i went to my office and now i you're welcome to cut the tapes off you're well welcome to do whatever you want to do but i think it's a nice nice for you i i felt like it what it must have felt like with abraham sitting outside the tent it was as though he was sitting just a couple of feet from me and talking to me there was a question i would this was the first time ever in my life in my dealings with the lord that i ever was able to ask a question and of all the things that i ask brother doug i asked about esther because i saw i saw the dead raced i saw cripples healed i've sought cancers delivered i saw every every miracle that you can see i saw the transformation of drug addicts people turned around in life become real pillars of society become preachers in your church i i saw this one of the sisters came one time when we were there and she came i spoke on sunday morning and she came and she stood right here hair about to her knees and she came she says i want my husband back they didn't know her husband and she said i just want him back well he'd been gone for a couple years living with another woman and he's in florida and i just said and your faith is so be it we prayed a simple prayer brother roy asked me said will you will you come next sunday and so i came the next sunday we preached and i preached and at the end of the service here came a man down the place exploded his name was tom it was her husband he said on tuesday morning a voice spoke or on sunday that sunday a voice spoke to him and said it's time for you to go home and he said on tuesday he said i got there and i sat on the porch waiting for her to get home that man that was in all of that condition has been a pastor of a church you're talking about god rich in mercy i've seen god do phenomenal things absolutely phenomenal things across the world i've seen him do incredible things in germany in switzerland are you with me my sister stood in switzerland she said they've given me only days to live god called her out and she had she had cancer and she was dying of cancer god called her out told her she only had days to live healed her right there she went home from that meeting totally healed god can do anything he can change the elements of your body in just seconds [Applause] the lungs that now has cancer in them now standing right here they repetitively tell me there's not a thing wrong with your lungs 12 years ago those lungs were burned out [Applause] but god healed those lungs [Music] hallelujah [Applause] can i just tell your niece sister barbara your niece probably the worst conditioned situation i've ever saw tabitha sister barbara calls me and says would you go pray for tabitha i pray for tabitha a lot she had a condition i'll need some help cirrhosis they were given up to die and that was that was a long condition we prayed for minute prayers you guys were having a uh uh something going on at the fellowship hall and i was sitting on my computer and sister barbara costas will you pray said she could she could they say she'll die within hours and i do what i normally do i i tell i told her i said i'll go to prayer now and i went to prayer and that voice spoke to me said go to her okay i closed my computer i told sister call sister bartman said uh he's told me to go to her so i'm i'm going i'm on my way i make the hour trip to uva i go through the emergency unit i i make my way up i speak with her husband and her husband is talking to me about funeral arrangements kind of how the insurance is and he's just giving me real private information he's just he's at a point to where that you know this is what it is i'm resigned to the fact and i'd say we talked 30 45 minutes i i kind of just talked small talk trying to console him and then it just kind of hit me because i didn't know what god was wanting to do i just knew he wanted me there and i just turned to him and i said what's his name tim i said tim i don't believe god sent me here to talk about your funeral plans i i just don't think he sent me here to talk about funeral plans i i believe god's got something in store [Applause] he didn't just go to jerry as his house to preach a funeral told him fear not listen god's not just fooling around in your life to see whether he can or he can't are you with me now listen he's gone over your job he's got over your finances he's got over your life [Applause] [Music] sometimes you get aggravated at your job but you prayed for it sometimes you get bored with it but you prayed for that job [Applause] sometimes you get burned out but remember you pray [Applause] young moms get sometimes exhausted because of diapers and crying in the night and they get all excited but you prayed for it that's what you're praying for come on help me preach now come on help me preach that girl coming down that hour prayed for that baby [Music] and that's why you spend time in siberia are you with me this ain't a sermon that'll make you shout but it's a sermon that'll do you good he's god in your good times he's god in your bad times he's god [Music] i went over and tabitha hadn't responded for quite a while i took her head in my hand she weighed about 80 pounds now she was green as any person i've ever seen in my life she was green i called her name and her eyes came down she looked right straight at me and i talked to her i said a couple of things to her that she would recognize of who i was told her i was going to pray for her and i began to pray and i found i found favor with god and i began to pray before god and as i prayed before god god came on the scene in that room when i finished i turned to tim and i said she'll walk down the hall with you tomorrow i want to pass the nurse at the end of the the bed she said i i think you've misunderstood some things she's going to die before the night's over with and i said i didn't say it he did i'm not the healer god's not the healer tim pruitt's not the healer donnie reagan's not the healer brother branham wasn't the healer god is the healer you must keep your focus on him never lose your focus no matter how tired how weary how backslidden you get don't lose your focus on him [Applause] there's an interesting statement that i want to share with you that the lord dropped into my heart on that visitation the second visitation that means something to me this morning that i just want to i want to bring we had edmonton and us together last weekend now want to bring us in shreveport or us and brother tim's church together this morning sister karen went to church this morning after a brain bleed to which that they opened up the side of her head and it actually the cut went from here here here here the whole side of her head so that meant that they shaved the head and then of course they shaved the other part to match the sisters did they actually talked to brother tim about do you think that she would want to have this surgery because there's a we don't expect her to live or at best she'll be a vegetable the rest of her life he said of course we want you to do the surgery but you know you how you and your humanity feels when it feels like your gut has just been pulled out you have just been told that your husband has three major tumors in his head and they're cancerous tumors sister connie put her head between her knees and we called for our our boys and they came and held her while i was getting the diagnosis probably live uh of just a few more months those are difficult times [Music] but when you catch your breath once you catch your breath and absorb the punch greatest battle ever fought brother bam said he's got a punch coming to you but once you remember who you are [Applause] come on let's remember who we are this morning alden and i was walking down the my driveway together here about a month ago he's walking along beside of me and at that time i was i kind of had a slow step to me i was just kind of doing the best that i could do to kind of keep one foot in front of the other there's times i just had to beg myself to get up off of the couch i just couldn't hardly make it i just i just felt like my head weighed 200 pounds and if i could just get my head to hold up you felt like that brother run yeah yeah but you see as i was walking down the down the pavement with brother alden i said brother alden i'm beginning to feel a little wind in my wings if you can ever get a little wind in your wings you get the sand out of your wings and if you can ever get the sand out of your wings you get to work you can fluff them a little bit and after you start fluffing them a little bit you you figure out they got you off of the ground once they'll get you off of the ground again andrew came to the house one night after a saturday night service and i was sitting at the end of our table that seats 18 and i sitting at the end of the table and i was having elijah's pity party and he throwed a rock in the cave you know sometimes you gotta throw a rock in the cave so the next day i threw it back at it out at him [Laughter] [Music] because that night i was seeing a cake the cake so he threw a rock in the cave and the next day he was saying i can't i threw it back out at him the baby's not going to die it won't die it'll be all right it might think he's going to die right now i probably got devils screaming about like this right now there's things that you've asked god for for two to three times and god just tells you isn't it interesting when god says no it didn't always better when he said yes don't you just love it when god just answers a prayer for you in 10 minutes and it's over we all love the miracle of tabitha the next day she's walking down but it's when your trial goes on for months when it goes on for months and months and months on i know i'm preaching to you cause i can see you you need this service cause i'm looking at you come on church you know who i'm talking to now i'm right with you now you've been sought the lord many times and blamed a lot of things with it but i want you to understand it's you it's you that needs the refreshing it's you that needs the revival in your life and what you really need is a fresh drink from the king [Applause] there ain't nothing like a fresh old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost in your life [Applause] you don't need a psychologist and a nerve pill you just need god [Applause] you don't need to quit and walk away that ain't gonna fix your problem [Applause] the devil will tell you if you pick up that cigarette you'll be better yeah you'll be better you'll get you another man you'll be better yeah you'll be better just drink this alcohol you'll be better all the things that i just described that satan says will make you better will destroy your life [Applause] satan offers you what looks the best but it'll kill you it'll destroy you it'll take your virtues it'll rob you of everything that you are you're with me now staying home from church is not your answer [Applause] nobody can take your place so sometimes you gotta walk in sit down in service [Applause] fill your way make sure it's your pew don't get mad at the ushers because they put you somewhere you're not you're not used to [Applause] this is your service don't let the devil rob you i'm taking time because i'm i i'm dealing with something now this is your service to get what you need in this service don't let the devil rob you [Music] you gotta fight your way when you come to church sometimes you gotta fight your way into the service you got to fight your way past your feelings sometimes you got to start patting your hands when you don't feel like patting your hands you got to pat your foot when you don't feel like patting your foot you got to say man when you don't feel like saying hey man you got to get on your feet when you don't feel like getting on your feet you got to shake yourself past yourself so that you can have victory in your life [Music] [Music] [Applause] i don't care if you feel half backslidden i don't care if you wish you wasn't here you gotta fight your way past the thing in hell because it's worth it you're worth fighting for you're worth fighting for [Applause] hallelujah now i want to talk to you and i want to talk to people that will watch this i want to put a few things together when i was talking to the lord that morning and i ask about esther he just simply made a couple statements i'm taking care of her but i'm going to take care of the greater esther i didn't understand because i can't see into the future i can't see but i can have faith it did not hit me you know i i write everything down i write everything down i called brother tim i told him some things shared with him and here i get a note one morning that sister karen has been taken to the hospital that night with a with a brain bleed and they don't know if she's going to live or she's not going to live and we're days later after the visitation and she may be a vegetable this is a horrific scene her head is shaved her brain has bled it has shifted her brain completely over we don't know if her extremities are going to work whether she's going to have any memory whether she'll be able to swallow whether she'll be able to cognitively do anything or not i'm walking down my driveway i'm walking down my driveway and i'm praying for karen and he spoke to me he said i told you i would take care of the greater esther before the greater esther ever had a brain bleed who's the greater of our esther that we're always praying for her mother so god had it already planned and we were looking at one esther and he was looking at the other i'm nobody but the greater esther went to church this morning and i want to show you sister suzanne that god has everything pre-arranged before your trial ever gets there he's already got it taken care of knowing in a few days the greater esther is going to have a situation and he tells a preacher 17 hours away i'm gonna take care of her i walk to the pulpit that weekend and i preach a sermon call must get to jesus and in my must get into jesus what you didn't realize that as i was preaching i was not preaching about jarius 2000 years ago i was preaching about ron spencer as jerry as 2000 years ago and whether you realize that i was struggling with my mortality and the deity at the same time can i live through this trial and you as an audience loves me and puts up with me in weak or strong but whether you knew it or not i was preaching i got to stand here in this environment because i got to get to jesus i come to church in a very feeble condition but i gotta get to jesus are you with me now i'm stronger today four weeks later because in that service when i went home and days later i recognized that god spoke to me in the service to make an insane trip to louisiana no i didn't get lightning i didn't get thunder but we had a prayer meeting [Music] three boys got the holy ghosts hallelujah sister karen got a supernatural touch through that entire visitation i went to church on wednesday on wednesday night with i was going we were going to stay at home or we were going to the service i was going to sit in the back brother tim said i'll sit in the back with you forgive me if you don't think this is a sermon but this is a testimony and i had a suit on i put my suit on put my tie on you know sometimes if you don't look if you don't feel the parts you got to look the part and i was sitting in the back i was going to sit in the back and i looked at brother tim and i said you know what sometimes generals has just got to go out in front and show the troops that we're still standing so you saw the picture last night [Applause] now listen i'm reminded in the scripture there were some people that made a trip the queen of sheba made a trip she made a trip are you with me and she got what she saw philip made a trip jesus made a trip to a well and told the disciples don't come with me he had a predestinated seed that he was after are you with me sometimes you got to make a trip abraham and sarah they made a trip to greer somewhere between the tenth visitation where they met a man like i met the other day somewhere between the tree the the tent visitation and to greer their bodies changed and they become young again i want to tell you somewhere between louisiana and virginia because when i got home i went to work with the boys the next morning when they showed up for work i had my work clothes on what are you doing today i'm going to work how do you feel i'm going to work i got my mask i'm going to work haven't missed a day [Applause] [Music] now you can choose a pacifier baby bottle thumb sucking coward christian pity me all the time or you can get up [Applause] and say god's got this he's got my back he's fighting my battles though god slayed me yet i'm gonna trust him i'm gonna pray for people if i'm throwing up i got up the other morning took my medicine threw up for about a half an hour finally got myself together walked out and the boys were ready to go and they said you going i said yep we're going i could have went back to bed sure the medicine's gonna make you sick supposed to killing cancer are you with me it's what it's supposed to do but it ain't gonna make me quit because i refuse to turn back i refuse to turn around we are christians and we believe god will do what he said he would do when god comes to your house he is prepared to fight the battle for you he is a great provider he is a healer he is not going to have to run back to his house to get more resources he's got everything that he's needed he has never failed he has never turned around he has never given up he knows what he's doing he is in control god is never overwhelmed he's got it he has got it don't you love the lord can i read you one more scripture he give a power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength you don't get might and power from things that are not of god i just want to say this to you the reason people are backslidden they don't spend their time with god you can't look at every nonsense of the world on your internet and expect your spirit to not be dirty are you with me then walk in here on saturday night and get your fix and say i'm fixed i'm all over again and then on monday be right in the same trashbot again [Applause] preaching to you i'm actually reading your spirit so here we are you cannot live in the realms of darkness all week long and expect a supernatural revival here on saturday and sunday morning you can't be a gamer six hours a day [Applause] and never read a scripture there's a reason your marriage is falling apart you know who that was for it's all right you get over it even the youth shelf shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall notice this next scripture but they that wait upon the lord don't get ahead of god wait on it i like it when god just tells you jonathan hey listen you don't have to be out front just follow me i make a good follower i make a really good follower there's so many times we want to tell god how to do it he's got it he's got it you just follow him he's got it just follow him he'll open the doors that need to be opened he'll close the doors and need to be closed come on church i'm with him but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint help me lord help me lord to wait in the scriptures that talk about rapture which we're right in front of there's a couple of scriptures that i want to bring to you that will help you this morning verse 9 of first time thessalonians 4 says but it's touching brotherly love you need not that i write unto you for yourselves are taught of god to love one another and indeed you do it toward all brethren which are in all macedonia but you but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more now this is a powerful scripture and i read it to sister connie this week and you know sometimes you just preach to her homer would preach to nancy and i'm and i preached the connie and if the boys will sit still i'll preach to them now i want you to read this next verse with me because this is going to do you some real good and that you studied to be quiet oh god help us and do your own business [Laughter] somebody just put their hands together and say yeah this is for this church you know sometimes god's word just makes your smile if you mind your home business you won't be mind and mind study to be quiet it's an art it's a gift if america could get the scripture just quiet yourself down and do your own business and to work with your own hands oh glory oh glory oh glory i could get on the soapbox right here just for a few minutes brother vernon you'd love it you'd like it you like it you know i'm not smart i'm not smart and i'm no politician but if you take people in and you tell them to go home and don't work and give them 900 a week they ain't gonna won't go back to work [Music] you give them 900 to stay home they ain't gonna go back you mean i gotta go back and sweep floors and put up with human beings and i gotta go back and sweat i gotta leave my tv and i gotta leave my games and i gotta leave my house oh no i'm scared that's kind of what's going on in churches all across america you knew i was going somewhere you might as well just come with me whether it was your favorite preacher this pastor or whoever it was that was sending you into your homes and you were sitting there in your golden slippers and sipping your hot chocolate you didn't have to change clothes and you were sitting there eating roast beef while the sermon was going on preach it andrew preach it andrew [Applause] and andrew doing some real good preaching right there honey and you're doing some good preaching but it comes to time the honeymoon's over and you gotta get yourself up and you gotta go to church and you gotta put your hands together you see covet was a test there's more more stuff coming oh yeah there's more stuff coming there's a lot more stuff coming there's wars coming there's pestilence coming but if you couldn't live right in your own little house with your token applied you know what they're saying now more people had affairs while that went on more people had affairs while covet went on than any other time amazing in it because you are what you are when you're by yourself [Music] i'm preaching to you are you with me now i want to go back to the original scripture that i came to the devil knew who he was fooling with when he came to my house when he called me out into the road and said we're looking for ron spencer and i said i'm he i'm the man i'm the man i will serve god though he slayed me i'll serve him are you with me the blindness hasn't left me but i'm still serving him i am standing in a paradox as andrew preached last night it was prophetic sermon they still say i've got brain cancer and they still say i've got lung cancer i'm taking double the medicine but i choose a different attitude the cancer didn't change the medicine didn't change only got worse but it was when i recognized who i was that's what made the change [Music] are you with me you say brother ron why would you be honest and tell us that there's a lot of people behind that camera that are listening they're fighting cancer and all kind of conditions and feel so defeated because of the trials that they're in i want you to remember saints just remember who you are and say i am he and if god be for me who can be against me [Music] i don't know what your trials are because i've fought some enemies this morning i don't know what your trials are i don't know what you're going through i can't fight your battle for you but i want you to write this down i am he i want you to write it down go ahead and take the time i am here i am she you know what you are yeah i want you to write it down because when you find out who you are the devil already knows he already knows but when you recognize who you are you are in victory mode hallelujah hallelujah good aunt chris hello i am hallelujah hallelujah now i want you to write a scripture with it first john 4 4 greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world hallelujah hallelujah thank you for praying that i would be restored to where i could preach again now the devil's worried how long i will preach again hallelujah don't you love him now do you believe what he just what i just had you to write down you believe that you believe what you just wrote nathan when you wrote down i am he and you recognize who you really are that you're a predestinated son of god that will overcome laodicea and you'll be ready for a rapture this message will get you ready for a rapture and god wants to live on the inside of you and he is greater than every devil that you will ever face in your life every devil that you will ever face hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah and amen god bless you hallelujah let's stand this morning do you believe it with all your heart i am he now some of you thought that this was just brother ron telling stories this was god at work there are things that have been transpired here this morning that have left me overwhelmed at watching the
