the world lord you've orchestrated things you place things in their place lord just as you did the sun the stars and the moon lord you've moved on hearts touched lives you've been through this week father just watching your hand at work lord we know that we're in this place for a predestinated moment in a predestinated time father we just asked now that you would come and you would take our hearts and our lives take it under your control lord we give ourselves to you father we ask father that you would come not only upon the speaker but also those that are listening father whether they be in this building or online wherever they may be they may hear it sometime later but god take them under your control that you can work in their lives and touch their hearts lord i believe that

you take your hands off of god's property she don't belong to you she never did belong to you she belongs to jesus and you have to move back at the name of jesus lord in this place there's lord those that was with cancer and diabetes and sugar problems depressions and anxieties and fears satan this is god's property and you don't have a right to be here and we command you to go in jesus name for the glory of god that the glory of god can be revealed among us lord and as you set hearts free as you lift us up father lord we just commit ourselves to you in this service in jesus name amen amen we let you be seated for a moment before we go into the word i just like to share some things that's on my heart amen i don't normally do this i normally just read get to the scripture and get into the word because i don't really count myself as a as a speaker i need him amen but i i believe all of us needs him amen you know i i uh had felt to come here for some time and and we made plans and actually this next week is me and my wife's 25th anniversary amen god gave me a good wife and i really appreciate her and we've been through some hard times we've been through some good times but we still remain amen amen because god is greater amen amen and so but i want you to understand i don't come here just to come here i come here commissioned i have fought through obstacles i've fought through demonic attacks mind battles i've fought through spirits of oppressions attacks against my own family even my own mother but i felt the lord had directed me to be here at this moment you know whether you know it or not the spencer and the pruitt family have been very close god put us in this place for a reason and for a purpose and even though maybe you haven't visited our church and maybe some of our church hasn't visited here our churches are very close very close in atmospheres very close in spirit amen it's the churches that stand for the supernatural and what we're seeing right now is an attack against the supernatural and so you know we have been brought through though through the fire of adversity and i want to just take a moment to say how much i appreciate you as a congregation standing in faith creating an atmosphere so births can take place healings can take place deliverances in the house of god can happen and i i i want to say thank you for being that kind of church and and that kind of people because your ministry needs you right now amen they're under attack the demons of hell have come against us but we're not going to retreat we're not going to turn around we're going to go forward amen and i would like to just take a moment to share some notes as you know the story of uh just what 2007 when he was in that fire and we've we've told that quite a bit and it's a wonderful testimony and it still is true yet today of how god moved on the scene god would very directly orchestrate brother tim to come at a certain moment in a certain time to be here to minister to you brother ron was in the hospital but ron had been even looking very very dim and very dark and a dark place in the dark time but he would get up and he would preach the sermon on god will have a testimony and we have shared that testimony around the world of god's healing power and god's healing grace now as it would be that brother tim couldn't be here today but i'm here and i'm not here as timothy pruitt i'm here as a son of god bought by the blood of jesus christ to fill with the holy ghost an adopted son of god who knows his position and knows his place you know and i'd like to share some things of even a year ago as brother tim would come here as we first heard the news of brother ron's diagnosis and i want to share some of these things maybe a little personal but i feel like it's a time to do this it says this is brother tim as he would write these things down as he returned from the trip just over a year ago today we arrived in charlottesville virginia and brother ron sister connie brother matthew was there to meet us it was a very emotional time his brother ron sobbed and wept on my shoulder it was like we were there alone as hundreds of people walked by we are oblivious to anyone around he had prayed that morning saying god i need a boost we went from there to his home where brother donnie and sister carol reagan were waiting inside brother ron was not going to wait for another day for prayer he wanted prayer right now he was unlike pharaoh who wanted one more night with the frogs so brother donnie and i began to talk of divine healing and deliverances and how god had delivered others who were dying gary stanky brother ron himself when he was dying from the burns and that it was the will of god to be healed amen and the ladies were in the adjoining room and they come in as we were about to pray and the holy spirit came down and anointed us and we prayed and we cursed that demon of cancer and for his immune system to be activated to seek and destroy this cancer and i'm here to remind that devil he's still cursed amen brother donnie began interceding in the spirit as tongues from the heavenly languages began to flow from his mouth we were charged by the holy ghost and demanded that evil spirit of cancer to leave his body it was a powerful and anointed moment i would preach on saturday night on who hath believed our report on sunday night as our on our redemptive rights on that saturday night we received a testimony that meeting that i was ministering to japanese and didn't know it here's a testimony doctor you as was is originally from tokyo japan he'd been in the us for 25 years dr you is an international correspondent affairs professor has several phd titles and he's originally from tokyo he has lived in the united states for 25 years he's alumni of penn state who taught three classes his sister angela senor that was writing this as i taught three classes i had during my graduate studies he's a philosopher and always shared you must have scientific evidence to prove anything the dissertation for english literature had already been accepted and i was very thankful we had a year in review on monday and tuesday i shared that contradictory to many opinions the supernatural occurred several times in history without scientific understanding i used several examples in the bible knowing the art regardless of scientific proof it rains 40 days and nights and god shut the door not noah another example was joshua and the sun standing still and the question was asked how in scientific research says there had to be movement i started i don't know how god did it i just know it happened before leaving the campus i shared i would be at jmu and visiting special friends in the church family in elkton i shared the youtube link and expressed you could check out the link you'll be blessed and encouraged last night during the service my phone kept vibrating i knew i had to be urgent for my family i knew because i knew i was at church and i checked it and it was dr you he had decided to check out the youtube link and heard brother pruch's comment about joshua and the son standing still he shared he was so overwhelmed by a presence that came into his room he immediately gave his heart to the lord he was thankful that the lord understood him as he had never prayed he asked me what should i do next i replied be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he quickly said he knew someone who did that so thankful to share this good news that we're and we're looking for the last one brother tim would write he said as you know i was supposed to be leaving to minister in japan but god had other plans and sent me on a mission and while here god saved a japanese professor this is an incredible miracle but since hearing the news on brother ron i've been praying earnestly for a visitation from the lord via a dream or a vision or his voice or any way he wanted to i felt as if i was like joshua looking at the walls of jericho trying to find a way to get through the big walls in order to conquer the enemy sunday night i had a very vivid dream i saw young but matured buzzards that had left the nests and had not yet learned to fly there were about 12 and i was feeding them to pigs monday i had a day of fellowship and preached all day to brother ron on the about the promises of healing on tuesday morning we would go to the hospital and find news of the treatments and plans then i'm to fly out for home at 2 40 in the middle of the night i had an experience of waking up and i thought i was singing the song we shall see miracles when i got up for coffee i was greeted by sister connie as i poured the water into the coffee pot she asked how our night was and i said find fine but if it's any consolation to you i woke up during the night singing the song we shall see miracles she began crying and said brother tim brother ron couldn't sleep and i woke up at 2 30 and was singing the song we shall see miracles on the way to the doctor to discuss the cancer and plans i suddenly remembered my dream and it came to me that brother branham told that buzzards represented cancers and disease and afflictions it says a cancer in the spiritual he's a devil but in the natural he types a scavenger a buzzard he eats dead things i was puzzled by what pigs meant and i scanned over 150 quotes on pigs and couldn't find a clue in the sermons but when the doctor was talking about treatment using immunotherapy i did an internet search on cancer and immunotherapy and pigs and found that they developed the immunotherapy using small pigs like i saw in the dream there was about 12 of them and i fed them to the pigs one by one and i could see them chewing them up ripping apart the guts of the buzzards as i fed them you know it would be last year brother ron would feel to come to louisiana to be prayed for and i spoke to him and his sons on the phone just a week prior to him coming and he said now you watch satan is going to try to block it in a few days my mom sister karen would have her third brain bleed it would be so bad that she would need surgery it would be so bad that the doctors gave her no hope but she's still here we felt for brother ron to come anyways and he came and we would begin to have prayer meetings in the little cabin on the lake and that cabin god would come down and he would meet three boys two of them my sons and one of them here brother adam would have an experience with god brother ron would receive in that moment's supernatural strength to go home and continue now for another year and now a year later satan has once again tried tried to block a visitation my mom has again been attacked by confusion and memory loss but our god is awesome his brother tim and i would talk about this trip we felt we had to we had come to a spot like the red sea well we back up and turn around or will we speak and go forward we're here tonight because we're walking by faith and not by sight brother tim would call me on the way here as i would get off the plane and would drive up here on friday he'd say tell me and he would tell me look son we've been together in many things we've been together in the church the ministry you've helped me on the farm when we had goats you helped me sell them when in time come when we had cows you helped me find buyer buyers and you sold them for me he said now i'm commissioning you to sell pigs the last buzzards have been fed it's time for the pigs to be sold oh let's give god praise why don't you just lift your hands and praise him right now and say thank you lord you're in control of this situation oh hallelujah what a mighty god we serve yes lord we thank you father we thank you for this moment lord we you woke us up this morning at 6 30 lord and our body was so charged by your presence we know you're here this weekend lord and when you come good things happen you've tried to block it you tried to stop it you've tried to hurt you tried to harm you tried to keep families from being here but they're still here lord tonight and the blessing is here for them as well we commit this service into your hands in jesus name amen amen let's turn to hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. how many can say god is good also revelations 1 and verse 10. hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 we ought to know this by heart brother brandon would make this the theme of his ministry amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen let's just read that together jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever revelations 1 and verse 10 says i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou see us right in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia verse 12 and i turned to see the voices spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and the midst of the seven candlesticks one like under the sun a man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about with the paps with a golden girdle and the head his head and his hair hairs were like white were white like wool and as white as snoke and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass and as they burned up in a furnace and his voice was the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen god bless you can be seated i'd like to speak to you on jesus christ the same omnipotence omnipotence as we would know the word means all-powerful there's nothing greater there's nothing higher and then omnipotence there's nothing that you can add to there's nothing that you could make it any greater it is all-powerful this is who god is this is who god is in this day and this hour that we live in now i'm very thankful that we can have a scripture that would be placed in the bible that would give us confidence tonight to stand upon that says he is the same yesterday today and forever so if you want to know who god is today you can go back and see what he was yesterday amen that's why it's written for us to look back upon because we can look at him and we can see how he judged the enemy we can see how he fought against the enemy we can see how he came against the spirits and all the things that went on and we know that what he was in the old testament he was in the new testament amen the jehovah of the old is the jesus of the new and jesus would show very quickly who he was and he would show that he had dominion he had power over every spirit over every demon of hell over everything that would try to come against him amen and so when an omnipotence begins to move there's nothing else that can there's nothing that can stop it because it is the greatest power it's the greatest voice it's the greatest the highest authority there's nothing greater than omnipotence and god has showed himself over and over to be a great god amen greater than the word that we can even describe him in you know god is so wonderful and so great and sometimes it's so hard to understand as a finite or a human being just how great and how wonderful he is and i'm so thankful to know that he's not somewhere up in the heavens today and you know and he's moved somewhere and he's off and you know doing something else but he is very present he is right here in our midst he is right here touching our hearts he's been orchestrating as we spoke about this whole week and things that have went all amen god has been on the scene already you know i mean there has a song would say even when i don't see him working even when i don't feel him working he's still working amen just because you hadn't seen him just because you hadn't felt him just because you may not realize he's around you god is on the scene god is on the throne amen god is working amen he would he would make it very clearly in this scripture as we read that he is in the age that we are living in as he was in the first age of second third fourth fifth sixth all the way down to our age he is still here among us he's still working miracles he's still healing he's still delivering he's still doing all of these things amen as we read here it says it says it's he begins to describe who he is here in revelations and brother branham would pick this up and he says see he said he that walketh in the midst of the golden candlesticks this is he of whom it is said this same jesus is both lord and christ there he is of the one and only lord god almighty beside him there is no other there he is the savior there he is the healer there he is a deliverer there he is the satisfier there he is everything that we have need of and he's walking in our midst hallelujah amen the seven golden candlesticks represented the seven church ages and he is in our midst to every believer he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he was in the first age he is in all ages what he did once he's still doing and we'll keep on doing he said but you notice jesus is walking along in the midst of the church there is no one else with him neither can there be for he alone has brought her salvation he alone has purchased her with his own blood he alone is her lord he alone is her master and she will give him all the glory she will give him all the honor and he will not share it with another notice there was no pope with him there was no mother with him there was no archbishop with him there was no prophet with him it was jesus christ and jesus christ alone [Applause] hallelujah amen he does not speak and turn to the father for he is the father he does not turn and give orders to the holy ghost for he is god the eternal spirit and in his life is flowing and pulsating in the church and has given her life and without him there would be no life for salvation is of the lord there was no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but it was him who hung on the cross it was him who gave his blood he is the author he is the finisher of our faith well i love that tonight he who started the work in you will finish the working year amen he didn't start you on the journey to bring you halfway and to drop you off somewhere and say you're on by yourself he said but i am the author and i am the finisher oh no what a finisher he is hallelujah he is the alpha he is the omega we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to a church we belong to him we don't belong to a law we belong to him we don't belong to creeds and dogmas and constitutions we belong to jesus and jesus alone walks in the midst of his church it is god in her willing to do in his own good pleasure never forget that you only have one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] hallelujah omnipotence there he is with the seven stars in his right hand in the right hand and then that arm signifies the power and the authority of almighty god and if we did not witness it in this day as that star would begin to shine in his in his hand listen i want you to understand that star that messenger that spoke did not come on his own accord he was in the hand of the one walking in the candidates of the candlesticks he was walking in the power and the authority of god brother would say over and over i cannot do this on my own i cannot do one thing on my own william branham has no power but he when he comes [Applause] hallelujah oh my in that right hand of power are those seven stars of the seven church age messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are about behind the messengers of every age they go forth in fire and power the holy ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is not their own light it is his life amen that's why we don't worship a prophet that's not why it's why we don't lift him up to a place he becomes our advocate or he becomes our intercessor or he becomes all that's not who he was that's who jesus is hallelujah matthew 28 and verse 18 will say jesus came and spake in them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth all power that's why he would be able to speak the words i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases because he's omnipotent otherwise he couldn't say all because he didn't have all power or all authority i don't know i'm glad he put it like that i'm glad he went ahead and wrote it right there in the word i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases amen so it doesn't matter what you face in life it goes in all it doesn't matter what kind of sickness you come upon the devil's been coming up with new ones and new ones and new ones it still goes in awe it still fits in all he can come up with a hundred more different kind of sicknesses and a couple hundred more other kind of things that come against you but it still goes in all i'm the lord god that heals all [Applause] all power it's been given unto me all authority has been given unto me so these messengers were full of the holy ghost and faith on fire with the fire of god holding the word of truth and i'm thankful for them amen and there he stands to back them up and think of it not one believer of any age needs to say in his heart or cry in his heart oh i wish i would have been in the first stage or i wish i'd have been there there's no need to look back look up behold him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches behold him who even now is the same yesterday today and forever behold him who never changes either in essence or in his ways i'm thankful to serve a god who don't change [Applause] oh hallelujah i'm thankful he's not some fickle man that one day loves me and the next day hates me one day he's got a good thought about me the next day he's got a bad thought about me but god thought of me at the beginning and he has a shame thought today of you who's been lying to and he's telling you i the devil devil's been saying this this message is not for you and you don't belong to you it's for your mama it's for your daddy it's for somebody else that's a lie the devil let me just say it like this when the devil is lying why don't when he's speaking he's lying right so if the devil is lying and he always hears why don't you just take exactly opposite of what he says if he says the message ain't for you that means the message is for you if he says you're not healed that means you are healed if he says you're not delivered that means you are delivered if he says you can't be free that means you are afraid hallelujah he is a sustainer he is a life-giver of all things in the church he who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are these words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as christ our life for in christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she's simply a religious society she's a club she's a meaningless gathering of people a corpse bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse they could have the looks of a church they could have the outside or a look and appearance of a church but the spirit of god is not there they are a corpse dead amen so the church no matter what her programs are what her efforts might achieve without christ she's a corpse but with him in the midst oh hallelujah with him motivating her with him becoming the wonderment of his all his body the fullness of him feeling all in all in this very hour he's walking in the midst and as he walks in this age will be exactly as he walked in the first age jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever without christ you're just a corpse without him we're nothing [Music] but listen let me tell you he's not just standing there as a complacent onlooker he said where two or three are gathered in my name there i will be and not only in their myths as a complacent onlooker or just a recording angel but he's there expressing himself that he is the life of your of the church he is a sustainer he's a giver of life christ is here tonight to take on human battles christ is here tonight to take on cancer and sugar problems christ is here tonight to take on depression and anxiety and fears christ is here tonight to take on sin he's already paid the price for it all it's already done christ is here to defend you when you can't defend yourself he's here to lift you up when you can't lift yourself up he's here to boast you or to boost you to to bring you up into another round i listen let me just say it this way that devil does not have the final say over your life he has a voice and he's always speaking and he's always mind battles and every kind of thing listen you wouldn't believe the mind battles i've been through this week i had to keep casting down imaginations i said devil i'm not listening to you i got my eyes on the goal i got my eyes on a promise hallelujah amen we've all been how many has been through mind battles you have to cast down imaginations you have to keep putting them down and say no devil that's not me that's not who i am you're a liar hallelujah and you take to captivity every thought that tries to exalt itself above the word of god now the word of god says you're healed the word of god says you're saved the word of god says you're delivered the word of god says you're free the word of god says your son the word of god says your daughter the word of god says you're his so every other thought tonight cast it down i'm not listening to you no more you've come but i'm throwing you down where you belong and you are under my faith your situation does not dictate who you are your problem you're in that's not who you are amen that voice is speaking over your life it don't it's not the final voice but there is a voice in this place tonight and it is the force not of death it is the voice of resurrection [Applause] that's the one who has the final say and he is your defender i'm going through some scriptures real quick i'm not going to take time to tell you where exactly they are and don't have to follow just listen the lord is my strong defender he is the one who saved me how many can say that he is my god and i will praise him he's my father's god and i will sing about his greatness deliver me from my enemies oh my god defend and protect me from those that rise up against me declare me innocent o god defend me against the ungodly people rescue me from these unjust liars my god is my protection and with him i'm safe he protects me like a shield he defends me and keeps me safe he's my savior he protects me and saves me from the violence oh may the lord answer you in the day of trouble may the name of the god of jacob set you up on high and defend you don't rob the poor just because you can or exploit the median court for the lord is their defender lord listen to this now he will run anyone who runs oh them blessed are the poor in spirit the devil's been after you amen he's been trying to come in against you unjustly i want you to understand there's a word that's coming on your defense that's standing between you and your enemy just as he stood between the children of israel and the egyptians a pillar of fire wouldn't stood between them that same pillar of fire is here tonight and he's standing between you and death he's standing between you and depression he's standing between you and hell he's standing against you between you and the lies somebody told against you he's standing between you and every kind of spirit the lord is your mighty defender your god is faithful i could just about have me a dancing spell on that because his word is true he would not put it in there unless he was telling the truth [Applause] a matter of fact he would come to the laodicean church age in revelation chapter 3 and he would say unto the lao and to see in church aids right the faithful and true witness the amen of god [Applause] let him speak let's let the true witness speak tonight let's let the amen say something tonight amen he did it in this generation amen why would he put it there why would he say the amen because he came behind the prophet of god every service and he'd say amen brother branham would say if i've told the truth let him come he said he's a faithful and true witness so apparently what he told was the truth because he came and he would begin to discern the hearts and he would tell him your address is such and such you're going through this and you've been having this problem you got this situation you're near death but there's a light hanging over you why was that light there because it was defending them it was pushing back the cloud of darkness it was pushing back hell may that light fall upon you tonight that holy ghost is the defender that'll stand between you and death itself psalms 3 1 would say when the when when i hear when they would flee from absent lord how many are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me many of them be the same my soul there's no help from him and god but thou o lord are shield for me my glory and the lifter up of my head i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me oh hallelujah maybe you've been crying he's heard your cry [Applause] it might be like daniel it might be 21 days for the angel was able to get to him why because the prince of persia withstood him but i read in revelations where the dragon came and he prevailed not [Applause] because omnipotence is in the place when omnipotence comes the devil has to bow down and flee [Applause] he is the amen he is the final say he's the final say over your life oh omnipotence is these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the amen has a voice therefore the amen has something to say and what he says is final but what your doctor says is not final but what he says is final but what the devil says is not final what he says is final but what depression says is not final what he says is final but what pornography says is not finally jesus has given us a description of himself in relation to this last age the days of grace are winding up he's looking from the first century right through the 20th told us all the things concerning this age before he reveals the characteristics of the last stage to us he gives one final look at himself this gracious supreme deity the capstone relates the revelation of himself thus saith the amen jesus is the amen jesus is so let it be of god amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the seal of god the amen approves of you [Applause] therefore you don't have to seek others [Applause] [Music] approval you know i i was well you know they got this there's a thing called chosen out they borrowed that because we are the chosen but i thought it was a very unique moment in that place that really spoke to me you know they they portrayed matthew as being kind of a unique kind of guy and i don't know what kind of guy he was but you know i know there are people that are like matthew unique just to be honest every one of us is unique we got we all got our quirks we're going to slow down for just a minute we all got our quirks but philip came into the group and came john and sent him to jesus to follow him and he said and he comes into the group and he comes and begins to speak to matthew and he's drawn to matthew in this series and he begins to talk to him and matthew begins to express well i'm just not accepted and and i got all these issues and i think he's talking and philip tells him but what's important here is not what you are what's important is he chose you i didn't tell some of you young people he didn't put you in the family that you're in just by accident i think about it all the time he didn't put me here by accident i could have been born in any country in the world born any color born under any kind of language but he put me in a family of a preacher not just a preacher of of any kind of doctrine but a preacher of the message of the last day do you know what kind of odds that is do you know what kind of odds it is where you're at tonight why are you here because the amen said you would be [Applause] therefore when you realize he chose me i didn't choose myself god chose me i didn't even i didn't have one able to say i want to be in certain family in a certain state in a certain fashion a certain region i couldn't make that choice but he chose me and he put me there so i might be quirky i might have my own quirks in my own ways but god chose me that's what's important therefore when you can rest on his approval on his choosing you don't go out into the world young ladies and look for some other kind of approval you don't go out there boys and look for some other you have been chosen and approved by the amen you have been placed in the family you're placed here by the amen [Applause] god chose you that's all that matters [Applause] he said i want you he said i want you to watch something carefully see something really sweet and beautiful i said this in his end time revelation of himself when the day of grace closes the millennium comes shortly very very very shortly thereafter read with me in isaiah 65 and 16 that he who is blessed blessed himself and the earth shall be blessed shall bless himself with the god of truth and brother branham talks about the god of truth is the god of the amen and he ties it right in that the jehovah of the old is the jesus of the new amen he begins to talk about the amen he said see god of truth god of the amen god of amen he said what is it because it is it is god now coming in this time showing us us himself that who he was in the old testament he's still in the new testament and who he was in the old and the new testament he's still in our day oh amen because he said i am the god the amen amen it says see the new testament does not reveal another god or further revelation it is the one and same god christ did not come down and make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two gods he talked about one god and now in this last stage we come back to that capstone revelation which is the most important revelation of the godhead that jesus is god he is of he and the father are one there is one god and his name is the lord jesus christ he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never change what he says it stands fast he does it and it's done forever hallelujah oh hallelujah none can take from it nor is he what he says or add to it so let it be a man so let it be aren't you glad we serve that kind of god you can know exactly where you are with him at any time in all time he is the amen god and he won't change these things saith the amen that means that whatever he says is final [Applause] what he says is final what he says is final not what you say or what somebody said about you or what the doctor said about you or what some test said about you what he says is finally hallelujah it means that whatever he said in the first stage and the second and all ages about his true church and about the false vine is exactly right and it won't change it means what he started in genesis he'll finish in revelations he has to for he is the amen so let it be and we can see again why the devil hates this because he knows when he speaks he's finished oh hallelujah these saints say the faithful and true witness he's faithful he watches over his word and he will bring his word to pass not one little bit of it will fall to the wayside not one jot not one tittle will go unfulfilled but he will fulfill every part and every place devils can scream devils can howl they can line every devil up but when the omnipotence speaks and the amen says that's finished it is over with it is done with and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it [Applause] hallelujah you remember when the amen spoke over your life you one time drugs had you the voice of hollywood had you the voice of all kind of spirits had you but the amen began to call and woo upon your life and begin to speak and all of a sudden the holy ghost fell into your heart what was it it is finished there's no more going back there's no more looking back i already got what i came for [Applause] he is the creator he is a sustainer i'm lifting him up tonight i'm lifting him up for a purpose for by him were all things created that in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether it be thrones or dominions or principalities or power i like to let the devil know again you are a created being therefore as a created being you have limited power you know there's another thing i like to remind the devil and i'd like to remind him at this moment brother ron how many goes to the store and when you get a jug of milk and you pull that jug of milk out what do you look for yeah expiration date man this milk's about to go out ain't buying that let me find something last a little longer you're looking for the expiration date well let me let the devil realize something and understand something and be reminded of something he has an expiration date [Music] that cancer has an expiration date that sugar diabetes or that sugar problem has a expiration date why don't you go ahead and tell that devil that's been torn me in you devil you have an expiration day because the amen when he speaks it's finished i say let him speak tonight let the god of heaven fall in our hearts and fall in our midst and faith arise and say devil it's over with cancer it's over with sugar problem it's over with anxiety it's over with fear it's over with [Applause] devil we're through in the name of jesus [Applause] oh just go ahead and rejoice for a moment in your liberty we're talking about the king of kings and the lord of lords there's no one higher there's no one greater he is the i am he's not the i was or that i will be he is the i am and he's in the house tonight he's right in the midst of it all you've been thinking you fighting this battle alone you ain't been alone you've been thinking you're by yourself you're not you're not by yourself he says not only is he right there as a great shepherd of the sheep he is the very existence of his own and his very existence is for his own oh my god he loves them cares for them his eyes ever upon them when the word says your lives are hidden christ it means exactly what it says he said i'm so glad that my god abides faithful he's true to himself he won't lie he's true to his word he'll back it up he's true to us he'll not lose one of us but he'll raise us up at the last day i'm glad i'm resting in his faithfulness and being confident of this very thing that he which begun the good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ he is the true witness amen hallelujah he's a faithful and true witness he sent his comforter he's coming to spirit to move in his church just like he did in the first age brother brown we'll talk about is how you say talk about that vine he said if it ever produces another branch it'll be just like the first branch it'll be a continuation of the book of acts this is what we're seeing in our generation is a continuation of the book of acts my god what happened on the book of acts it was 120 that were gathered in the upper room they were getting all one mind in one accord beginning to think on the goodness of god and all the things they had witnessed and seen in this generation and all of a sudden a sound like a mighty russian wind began to blow through the building i say wind of god blow tonight and tongues of fire where a pillar of fire showed itself in their midst and tongues of fire began to fall upon all of those that was there they began to speak in other languages as a spirit gave utterance until what people thought they were drunk so what is this some kind of new wine he said this is not new wine it's only the third hour of the day but this is that that the prophet joel spoke about in the last days i pour out my spirit upon all flesh hallelujah those men that used to be cowards those men that used to fall back and wouldn't answer questions those men they used to be uh just backslidden as they could be and away from god would now stand with boldness begin to declare the mercies of almighty god to where three thousand would give their lives to jesus christ that's the book of acts that we're looking for amen live is being born into the kingdom of god it would be that those two men peter and john went down to the gate called beautiful and there said a lame man been sitting there begging of alms said silver and gold have i none he said we don't have it i don't have money i don't have it but such as i have give out to thee in the name of jesus rise up and walk and what happened the lame man began to jump to his feet and went leaping and praising god it was miracle after miracle sign after sign wander after wonder that was performed under the unction of the amen the spirit of god the absolute brother brown would preach from this he said it's the last words just the amen he said you see you hear people say absolutely that's it that's the last thing he said the absolute is unlimited there's nothing else that it's in its way it's the supreme it's the ultimate it's the it's it's reached us in it's the amen oh hallelujah amen the amen he's a god who don't make mistakes he's a god that don't they don't don't don't make wrong choices oh praise the lord he's a god that don't make make a wrong move brother branham was in his younger years in ministry and had this young lady that had had come under a nervous breakdown and had lost her mind and she's in a insane institution and the family's calling him to pray and he goes and he goes to pray for her and and and it goes goes goes to pray for this young girl and you know doctors were doing all they could do she they said our lady of peace the catholic institution was trying to do some kind of shock treatment it was a shot in the dark he said if there's a doctor here i don't mean to offend you by that but sometimes it makes them worse than ever so they gave her a shock treatment it made the child worse and they sent her back home few weeks had to bring her back she wasn't really in a terrific shape so they tried to they kept her and tried to to doctor up over there and for quite a while and she got worse and continued to get worse the mother began to call for brother branham to come so he comes comes into the institution behind locked doors and into the place where she was at he sits down beside her and he says ruthie do you remember me i'm brother branham you used to call me brother brother brother bill cause i presented you to christ do you remember me she'd just look at me beautiful girl tried to get her attention i couldn't do it she was just staring she was just gone i said i sat across the foot of the bed and the mother said on the other side of the little bed and this little single bed in this little room the girl was sitting on a little while took a little seat built on the wall and the sister stood standing up and the father standing by the girl the mother was standing there tears running down her face she said you see billy what can we do he said listen norma christ is christ that's good advice for any situation christ is christ she said this was our last chance if they take her up there we never know what's going to happen you'll never maybe never see her again if we do that the treatment they'll do and said norma let's not be excited let's just wait a few more minutes no more said that there stood the a girl before me and a vision normally well smiling she was looking towards a young man i looked at the young man and the vision left me i said norma does she have a boyfriend kind of tall and dark hair she said yes does he do something with them like singing she said yep that's right i said don't worry i have thus saith the lord she's coming out of it [Music] [Applause] in the face of darkness in the face of every kind of fear and dread over the family thus saith the lord was released you say well do you have thus saith the lord yes i do have thus saith the lord by his stripes ron spencer is healed i am the lord god that heals all thy diseases i am the resurrection and the life when that happened norma threw her hands up she hit brother branham on the knee looked up at her husband said honey it's never wrong and i'm here to testify this word is never wrong if he said it in his word he declared in his word and we have got to stand upon it and god will bring it to pass that girl never changed a bit i said all right norma you know i wouldn't have told you that now unless i had seen it and god can't lie i went out on out of the hospital got in my car about two hours from then the phone started ringing i come up from when i come up from mr woods down below it was her father he was on the phone he said brother branham i got to tell you something you ain't been gone 20 minutes until she came to herself just as normal she's been examined by the doctor and the whole staff we're taking her home in the morning [Music] morning is coming morning is coming hallelujah amen i believe in just a few moments that body's going to line up to the word of god doctors have done all they can do amen we prayed we believe but just in a moment is all it takes that body's going to line up to the word of god and cancer's going to flee sugar problems are going to flee every kind of thing that's come against his organs is going to turn loose in the name of jesus because it's not my word it's his word he said so i didn't say so god said it and if god said it the amen said it i can believe what he said because he's never wrong having an anchor for an absolute there's been a storm a bonus listen to brother ron's last two sermons praise him in the storm why could he praise him because that wave can only take him so far it can only do so much it only has so much power because there's an absolute hole it's an anchor not just a bottom of some bedrock in the bottom of an ocean but it's an anchor beyond the veil anchored into the blood of jesus christ and when those howling winds begin to blow and it gets real dark can i say something we're right at the moment jesus is going to step on the bridle of the boat what happens when he steps on the brow of the boat omnipotent speaks peace be still omnipotent steps on the side of the boat it says peace be still and the cancer and all of his war and and all of his raging and all of his anger gonna sink him i'm gonna take him out but a voice speaks it's jesus right now on the 701 proofville drive there's been a lot of storming going on he warned us it was going to happen storm's coming but he wouldn't have warned us unless he was going to be there to take care of us and i know without a without a doubt that we didn't go off without him [Applause] we're not in this journey without him but no he's with us in the boat i've witnessed him every service here i witnessed him moving in your midst there's no doubt we could tell of testimonies that happened right here in this moments while your brother was going through this storm miracles have been taking place signs and wonders have been showing why because jesus is in the boat can i say this tonight amen there's a little boy here that's about 16 18 months old that hasn't walked but he's going to because jesus is in the boat and he's the same yesterday today and forever if he healed a lame man one time he could heal him again if he took bones it couldn't walk and three muscles they couldn't operate and he put such a power in him by the house speaking of the holy ghost silver and gold have i none but what i have give unto thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk hallelujah amen there's a demon of hell that wants to stand there but we say get back in the name of jesus christ i don't come to you with my own power i come to you in the name of the lord [Applause] i feel like david right now walking down into the valley to face goliath but i know what happened in david's case whoo hallelujah in david's case at the end of that story he was holding that giant's head up and he was shouting the praises of almighty god because god had brought the victory in the hearts of the people of god and when they saw that head come up others said we can do it too hallelujah amen i believe that we're going to hold the head of this whole cancer up and the reflex of this brain bleed up you talking about a celebration party i don't know if you built a building big enough when god comes on the scene and he sets him free what are you talking about brother timothy i'm talking faith right now there's faith to believe all things are possible [Applause] come here come on up here buddy i felt that devil trying to tell me no that little boy ain't gonna walk well here happens to be one who did [Applause] in our day about 18 months old seen walking and he did [Applause] hallelujah right at the moment my mom had just had her first brain bleed and she was not giving much hope at that time and she was in her room and thinking about her time and her days and what's left of her life and real down and depressed but all of a sudden her hands go up in the air i'll say it again mama put your hands in the air put your hands in the hair cause god's still on the throne christ is christ and if he done it one time he's gonna do it again hallelujah if he done it one time this got to do it again amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he is our god he's our god he's not somebody else's god he's your god tonight he's over your situation tonight christ is christ and he's never wrong i said he's never wrong he said why are you swaying that old white flag for brother timothy brother branham said tonight the black flags of hell are down but the angels are waving the white flags of victory here to wave this white flag of victory tonight victory in the house of god victory in your home victory in your lives victory in your hearts victory in your party victory victory victory victory oh god put a faith in our hearts to go down into the valley and grab that stone that's already there before david ever went to see goliath i was there in that place i walked down in that very same valley i walked down to that same very brutal very same brook i picked up some rocks oh yeah i got those rocks and you know what thought hit me that before david ever found goliath was going to be there before there ever was a goliath there was a rock prepared for his destruction before there ever was cancer there was a rock prepared for his destruction before there ever was depression brain bleed spirits of every kind there's a rock prepared for his disc all you got to do is walk down into the valley walk down into the place prepared this place was not prepared for your death this place was prepared for giants to fall this place was prepared for you to walk on water this place was prepared that god could come on the scene and change it in a moment and a twinkling of an eye oh the waves may be flowing maybe hitting against the whole boat but it's still holding it can only go so far because there's an anchor hole oh praise the lord you got just a few more minutes oh my let me get this right god has the final say that ought to put a rejoice in somebody's heart god has the final say we face situations that look permanent like they're never going to work out so therefore it's easy to get discouraged it's easy to accept that it was just meant to be but it's not over till god says it's over the medical medical report may not look good and that's sick but that sickness does not have the last words god has the final say people may be against you you may have opposition but people don't have the final say no disrespect but doctors lawyers bankers experts judges they may be good people but they're not on the throne god is on the throne and him being for you it's more than everybody being against you and god will not let you come to a problem that he can't get you out of [Applause] oh my he wouldn't let the three hebrew children be thrown in a fiery furnace he didn't know the fire was if he knew the didn't know the fire wasn't going to harm them king nebuchadnezzar thought he was in control he thought he had the final say that the fire would finish them off and that's what always has happened they've thrown them in there before and they died he threw them in there again and they died but these three said we ain't bending we ain't bowing but this time he wasn't dealing with ordinary people he was dealing with children of the most high god and they came out without the smell of smoke you know there's something about you that makes you unstoppable you have an advantage god has not only breathed life into you but he's put a hedge of protection around you nothing can touch you without his permission you're not at the mercy of bad breaks you're not at the mercy of sickness you're not the mercy of accidents are you brother davey not at the mercy of accidents not at the murder people may be against you none of that can stop who you are none of that can stop who you're going where you're going you're not going through life by yourself but god is behind the scenes orchestrating it all out for your good all things work together for the good to them that are the call according to his purpose first peter 3 says jesus has the last words on everything now you may be dealing with sickness the medical report says you're not going to make it that's one word but god has the last word a diagnosis is not a verdict it's not the final word but what is the final word i am the lord god that heals all thy diseases what is the final word is i am the resurrection and the life there were some couples there's a couple ladies one time that was all down and depressed their brother had died that sent off for their friend who they'd left everybody to follow and sent off for him and he went on a four-day journey away from them let me just drop this in here mind battles they had them mind battles jesus had them don't you know the mind battles he went through as he continued to go four days he had a vision but a vision don't stop mind battles the devil is still there to whisper whispering in the ears we've seen it we've heard the vision of the bride walking in step onward christian soldiers but it hasn't stopped your buying battle no jesus had him he had mind battles he had such mind battles that get the garden of gethsemane to where his sweat turned to blood and yet he had a vision of giving himself he had the word but he still had mind battles we all go through them even if we got a vision we go through them even if we got the word of god we go through them the devil is never going to give up that moment in your your mind to try you but you got to take that that is that is exalting itself above the word of god it's the devil trying to put a thought in your mind that's saying it's more important than what god said and here they are and he's walking away i thought about this as i was driving flying this away my mom was in her situation it began to strike me jesus having those mind battles it was on tuesday that i was really in a con quandary trying to figure out what i do what i where do i go do i stay lord used brother david kigley over there on a mower texted me and said you know the lord spoke to me and said for me and my family to be in those meetings i'm going to be there did that stop the mind battles no he still had them i still had them matter of fact he got up this morning his daughter is mariah is that right fainted had to be taken to er he was at a moment do i turn around do i say well we just stay home or do i speak and go forward he spoke and come forward because he knows god has something to store for his family his family has a need and god's here to meet that need he's heard your cry he heard their cry the very first day he heard it but he continued to walk because god has showed him something you know i was studying studying some of this and the in the history it talks about the sadducees that believed that a dead man could lay there dead for three days but his spirits still be there so if he rose in one two and three days it wasn't a miracle so god allowed it to come to a place to where everyone had to say this was a miracle god allows things to come to a place that critics can't deny it oh yeah they may laugh they may carry on there was a lot of them sitting on that hill laughing and smoking and making fun when he was standing there said jesus wept but he probably god said he gathered that little frame together and he said roll away the stone brother donnie one time at a youth camp done it so beautifully he said what happened he said he told martha and mary roll away this way the stone he said there's something you got to do you have to roll away the stone you have to put an act of faith in your heart to believe that all things are possible i'm gonna be there regardless of what happens he was rolling away the stone i'm gonna be there no matter what takes place you're rolling away the stone i'm going to be there if the situation gets worse i'm going to roll away the stone because i know when omnipotence begins to speak he said your brother was going to live and she said yay lord and the resurrection he said i am the resurrection and the life he brought her to this moment this is who i am right now and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the devil may have decreed death over your life but there's another voice that is speaking right now i am the resurrection and the life [Applause] lazarus come forth in the name of jesus your diagnosis is not a verdict it's not the final word sickness you may say you may you may have a say devil you may have a say but i have good news what you say is subject to my god what you say is overruled by my god he has the final say on my life he has the final say on everything i go through so instead of say considering your circumstances you need to look at how big your god is and the bigger you make your god the smaller problems become and the more faith begins to rise up in your heart [Applause] experts can be wrong they can make the most educated guesses they can say what they know but be wrong but what they fail to add to the equation is there's a seed gene of god on the inside of here it's eternal life that's paul say [Applause] hey hallelujah brother ron it's not just your immune system that's fighting it's eternal life on the inside of you that's fighting against that cancer saying get back in the name of jesus christ get back in the name of jesus christ whoa hallelujah let's add our liquor fire with that lick of fire and say get back in the name of jesus christ satan you lost your hope you made your boat i don't come to you in my name but i come to you in the name of the lord jesus christ and we're here tonight to take your head off [Applause] you're not on your own the lord is on your side i'm reminded of colonel travis when he was down in the alamo and he was fighting the standing and making that last stand and the mexican army had come all around him surround him on every side they sent a letter of declaration of surrender and the terms of surrender and he wrote a he wrote a letter instead of you know said told him that if you don't surrender when we come in we're killing every man and the odds were stacked against him in his letter he said i write this to the tech fellow texans and all americans he said i've received this day such and such a letter of surrender with the decree and all the things that would take place he said i replied with a cannon shot colonel spencer general spencer i've been hearing a lot of cannon shots coming from this way hallelujah the devil said ronald surrender ronald give up i'll praise him in the store i'll praise him in the store he's called me into this place and i'm going to stand here and decree that he lives what you are hearing from this pulpit or canon shots it's time some of you let some go for yourself and say devil boom i'm not putting up with your nonsense boom get out of my life boom in the name of the lord flee from me i'm not surrendering to you i'm not retreating from you but i'm going forward in the name of jesus it's time that omnipotence speaks [Applause] he wrote that whole letter in the bottom of it he signed p.s the lord is on our side whoo my god if a colonel could make that declaration fighting a war over some piece of dirt how much more could we make that declaration fighting a war over heavenly places tonight that is our inheritance that is our place boom devil get out of it this land belongs to us healing is ours deliverance is our show almighty god we ask that you would come right now and put such a fire in our hearts to light the cannons and say devil we're not taking another one of your threats but we're going to fight back in the name of jesus and if god be for us who can be against us omnipotence is the most powerful force in the universe and it's moving on your behalf he has the final say he has the final say over your health he has the final say over your children he has a final say over your situation may there be one that rise up against you many there be that rise up against you but thou o lord or shield for me when abraham was 100 years old i'm coming down sarah was 80 there was 20 years after the promise they came into a final word sarah gave birth to a son god overrode all the laws of nature he overrode what the expert says he overrode mistakes that they had made if abraham were here today he would declare don't let circumstances talk you out of what god put in you it may look dead it may seem impossible but the experts have no say they may say no way but they have no say but i can tell you firsthand god has a final say oh praise the lord let me say it like this i don't mean to turn carnal here but anybody ever watch the ball game oh boy you're people pulling for their favorite team and their team's got the ball and it's the last last last throw that they can make and tom's just about to run out just a few seconds left quarterback runs back he throws a pass and you're getting ready to jump and shout and it's intercepted [Music] turn the old radio off i've heard of people turning the tv off and walking outside being all discouraged and down because their team lost but there was a final say that was there and a referee stepped up and blew a whistle said there was too many men on the field on the defense play one more down but what happened they played that one more down quarterback went back threw a touchdown game over they won but guess what you missed it you know why because you turned the tv off too soon you went outside you just walked away and thought there ain't no hope there ain't no way this is going to happen it's over with it ain't over with till god says it's over with the other team may be dumping gatorade congratulating their coach but there's a final say that's about to speak that is even speaking right now devil let me remind you you celebrated too early 2000 years ago hallelujah down in hell 2 000 years ago they was dumping gatorade and they were shouting they was waving old pom-poms and they was dancing and making laps around hell but it was too early they're coming knock on the door and it was the i am they had read the first part of it but they failed to read the last part of it oh hallelujah and he walked down into hell and he said devil i've come to claim what's my give me those keys right there and he took the keys of death hell and the grave do you know what that means the devil don't have the key to his own house a key is something that's put in a lock it gives power to open it or close it it gives power to lock it or unlock it but the devil can't even do that therefore if he ain't got power over his own house he don't have power over that cancer he can't lock it or unlock it it's the final voice that has the final say the aaa man is here to speak he's here to touch hearts he's here to touch live god has your key [Applause] so i encourage you don't turn the game off too soon [Applause] the word is still in effect the word has the final say and here is the final say amen victory you shall overcome you shall rise above it you will be made whole [Music] whoa hallelujah hallelujah devils are on the move for jesus christ the chief captain said in my name they shall cast out devils he said they failed to get it 40 years ago but we're coming now into our promised land and the same pillar of fire the same chief captain is leading the host of the lord is on your side it's your land god promised to prosper you in health he gave you your body it's yours by possession and the devil has taken to trying to take over it but he hasn't got authority to do it and he's trembling tonight he's trembling tonight hallelujah the great world of god's power is right now moving in this building satan's trembling oh what if they only have faith his heart's about gone it's about melted in him well the doctor said yeah but just realize the host of the lord is moving towards you right now no matter how high he's wallet he may have walled it out the side of the doctors he may have walled it out the site of medical science but he's a big bluff and he ain't no bluff to god he's moving in jehovah's moving in don't be troubled he's here tonight to take over i believe the pillar of fire is in the building right now the captain of the host of the lord is here and our swords are pulled he may be afraid of that he's afraid of not afraid of medical science but he's afraid of the captain they're trying hard maybe to try to find a cure for cancer something to do with it but so far the devil thinks he's got the bluff but the devil thinks he's got the bluff on them but the sword of christ has come down in this hour and he will never he will never he will never withstand that he will chop every cancer loose he'll raise up the blind and the afflicted he's doing it everywhere whose report do you believe
