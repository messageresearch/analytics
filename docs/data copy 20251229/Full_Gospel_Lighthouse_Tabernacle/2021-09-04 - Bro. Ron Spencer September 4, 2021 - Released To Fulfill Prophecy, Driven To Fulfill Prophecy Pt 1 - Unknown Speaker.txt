if you'll turn with me in your scriptures tonight i have a thought on my heart that just had been bawling and sometimes bombs just come and here we go and so amen amen we believe that we are not looking for the bride's revival but we're in it if you'll remember brother branham will use a term about the welch revival he said there were some critical preachers that went there and they were looking for the welt's revival and carloads of them were looking and they came to a police officer and was standing there waving and they said we're looking for the welch revival and he said you have arrived so if you're looking for the bride's revival i i'd like to just tell you we have arrived it's not coming it's here amen and so we we know it'll be a short quick work we're seeing phenomenal miracles take place and uh if you haven't seen a miracle lately right here's one just to still be standing so amen amen we love you with all of our hearts i'd like to speak to you on released to fulfill prophecy driven to fulfill prophecy brother branham will use a couple terms and he would say this day this scripture is fulfilled literally in a service literally in a service four or five hour service literally in that service prophecy that had been laying there for hundreds of years in a gap of about four hours now's history now now that's quite a statement it's quite statement to give you an idea of what we're thinking of prophecy intercepts with time it can it can actually hover around the earth for hundreds of years and when the time comes and the individuals comes that have been pre-planned to be a part of that then it just happens it doesn't matter what the critics say it just happens mary was standing going to get water and an angel stepped from another dimension it did not matter what the critics said there's a bride on the earth that is standing here are you catching it now we're not looking for her she's standing here amen amen isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17. for behold i create a new heavens and a new earth and the former shall be not remembered nor come into mind imagine what isaiah was looking at the same one that prophesied a virgin shall conceive but now he's looking at you but be glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem of rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more hurted her nor the voice of crying these are phenomenal thoughts there shall be no more offense and infinite of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die at a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred year old shall be cursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the earth and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like a bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat and they shall not hurt nor destroy in my holy mount saith the lord can i just share with you one more scripture while you're standing revelations 19 and verse 6. and i heard as if it were a voice of a great multitude as a voice of many waters as the voice of a mighty thundering saying hallelujah the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb amen i'm talking about you now i'm gonna spend much of this service talking about you blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true saiyans of god maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to lift it before the lord just now amen almighty god we love you with all of our hearts we thank you for every individual that's standing here present and those that are watching even now the many needs that have come before us this week and god you're able to meet every one of them father there's not a god of this earth can meet one of those needs but you can meet every one of them you're the alpha and the omega the beginning of the end we ask you now that you would anoint this service in a mighty way drive back satan that would try to hinder this service in any way anything that would be done that would be irreverent i ask you now that you would anoint this audience with praise anoint them with worship anoint them that the seed of the word can ignite their hearts like never before father in jesus christ's name we pray a man and a man and amen you can be seated amen thinking of this pattern of scriptures and this is the great quote book itself john is as as i cannot even i cannot even fathom what it would have been like for isaiah to be able to see the end time he saw the the redeemer come he saw as a as a literally to be able to write the basically a commentary of the entire bible and then to to see the beginning all the way to the end and to see the bride even sitting at the marriage supper of the lamb and walking in our new city where a wolf and a lamb would lay together sometimes we just let words like that roll off of our lips but that could never be done in this fallen condition but god is not going to just recreate you you being a part of that eternal plan but this earth is part of that eternal plan where that this earth will be made over again where a lion and the lamb can lay together hallelujah a place where there'll be no pain no agony no death no graveyards no hospitals no drug addiction no sin nowhere nobody impatient only worship on their mind what a land to be from hallelujah can i talk about it just a little bit john was sitting there and he's on the isle of patmos and he's he's in one realm looking into another and i saw a new heaven and a new earth 21 verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away let me just say right here at this junction of time don't plan on staying here don't plan on staying here this morning i i got up and i i just went to tears the messenger to sodom the messenger the pastor of presidents i i i read a commentary every morning from billy graham and i read a commentary from several guys but but anyway one's from billy graham and he just brought me to tears and he said for hundreds of years we've looked at newspapers and we've looked at telegrams and the news and it catches us and we're if we're not careful we'll be consumed with the headlines and he said it'll cause us to get emotional one way or another he said but i want to tell you this this world will not be here much longer there's a kingdom of christ that is coming and he's going to make everything new i'd like to echo that thought these presidents that we have up and down and and economics that we have up and down and and even this covert that we have that has everybody terrified just today i got two calls about is the is the vaccine the mark of the beast well let me just say this to you if that is the mark of the beast we have missed the rapture [Applause] are you with me well brother ron you know they've got a little piece of a chip of computer that they're putting in your body what are you reading what what are you reading well brother ron that that's a that's a sign of the mark of the beast brother branham got those shots i don't care if you do or you don't it's your health i don't care i don't i don't want to be a part of your politics but there is a mark of the beast [Applause] and it's a whole lot more dangerous than this covert that we're fooling with now let me let me just let me just bear in mind there's going to come worse and worse plagues on the earth are you with me and we've lost four from this audience we've three and then brother meadows's son would be four let me just say this to you they stepped from this dimension to that dimension and listen as a christian we don't lose we don't lose well brother ron i'm afraid it'll make me sterile well you might have been sterile before all of that there's a sister that's sick here they're taking in the rescue squad sister rachel vance and so we want to remember her in prayer let me just say this to you but we're looking for a new city and that's the scriptures that we bear in mind whose builder and maker is god watch what he says he said and i i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city in the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven can you imagine that scene that he was watching prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death think about these things we're coming to a time where death will not have a grip of humanity anymore neither sorrow nor crying there shall be there shall and neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new i want you to understand this is not a president this is not a dictator of russia this is god this is the god that spend the earth and the 70 universes that we even know about god's first bible in the heavens it's that god that said i make all things new we get excited about a 42-inch caribou or a a bare silver-tipped grizzly bear before they got back down off of the mountain because that was a vision prophesied and now takes place and they're walking in the vision but if we can look at it you step from the pre-planning of god are you with me now you step from the pre-planning of god and regardless of what you've been through in your life they said you've went through some real difficult things and i just said at the end of my table the other day when you call me about you and melissa are getting married and thank you for inviting me to be a part of that brother andrew will do that for you but i thought i just i just kind of ride back at the chair and i said satan you can't stop god see you say well brother on my life's been marred it's been defeated over and over again don't you know this that god will not lose a one hallelujah he's not in the business to lose if he saw you before the foundational world and you are an attribute in his mind regardless of what you have been through in this earthly time period [Applause] this earthly time period doesn't change the mind of god you say brother on i don't know how in the world i'll make it through if he saw you before the foundation and he saw you in that new city there's not a devil in hell hallelujah there's not a devil in hell can't stop the plan of god glory be to god i like how he says it these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning in the end and i will give unto him that is a thirst a fountain of water of life freely you didn't do nothing to earn it hallelujah hallelujah there's people that's brains from their waist up they got degrees all over their walls there's ac there's people that are are way more handsome than i am maybe way more scholarly maybe greater speakers than i am but god deposited a seed on the inside of you and he watched over that seed all the way since adam and if god could watch over the pre-planning of that natural seed being carried through every generation [Applause] don't you have a weak god that can't get you from today till tomorrow i've got a god that can carry me from here to eternity let me just say it like it is stupid cancer can't stop the plan of god paul is writing now and he's writing to this church he's writing to every church brother branham said every one of them every one of the believers went down in faith looking for the rapture they were not defeated by death but they went down some of them were burnt some of them were heads were cut off some of them were slain asunder some of them have died some incredibly cruel deaths i think about the believers there's a church of in afghanistan of believers message believers that were that were destroyed by no hold himself he'll be held accountable of that but they were given testimony as the bullets were ringing out that god was faithful to them don't worry don't feel sorry they stepped from this dimension to that dimension and that stupid devil that pulled that trigger didn't know what he was doing he was releasing them from that tyranny of pressure and tormentors and they stepped into another dimension one of our brothers that was in prison came out of prison two weeks ago and i got pictures this week of he's already baptized three you can't stop this revelation 21 verse 7 i missed something i want to catch it he that overcometh shall inherit all things i will be his god and he will be my son amen but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murders god is a pre-planner and the whoremongers and the sorcerers and idolatrous and liars shall have their part in the lake of fire now people don't want to hear about hell but jesus talked more about hell than he talked about heaven and the reason he did that was to try to keep you from going there and you will have to step across the blood of jesus christ to go to that place don't worry god don't send you there you send yourself don't worry god don't send you to hell you send yourself there there's a scripture says that touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm that's what it that that's what it says so men can live a life 50 70 90 years and in five minutes make a superior bad choice by speaking against the wrong thing if they could have just left it alone but they were driven to fulfill those going to the lake of fire i can't give you the positive without giving you the negative judas had a place in the scriptures are you with me now judas actually had a place in the scriptures he was pre-planned in the scriptures he had a place notice but he couldn't even live with his consequences of his choice i'm going to preach to you tonight i'm afraid there's way too many maybe you're watching this today there's way too many that has made choices against the messenger of this hour [Applause] and made very cruel statements against what did brother branham do to you what did these pastors do to you we're just trying to get people to not go to hell to live a citizen of the kingdom of god just be real christians but instead pick out thoughts and failures brother brother ron i'm an official critic won't that be a tag in hell won't that be something in hell to be the official critic of the message of the hour oh but brother ron he missed it on this and he missed it on that okay i don't even know why i'm here but here i am okay okay how many souls have you won how many cancers have you seen fall off with your prayer how many blind eyes how many people night after night for more than 40 years and never miss one time i'll tell you that's the same spirit that was standing there against noah don't you feel sorry for those people don't you back off and say well i feel sorry for those people they're headed for hell come on i'm not going to make it easy on them come on don't look for mercy from me you crucified my lord [Applause] you crucified this message you crucified the former pastor here and myself as well don't expect mercy from me because the pre-planning is here i'm preaching this sermon to you if i were you i wouldn't get mad at ron spencer i'd get on my knees i'd get on my knees and i'd start praying god forgive me don't send me no emails don't send me no text don't waste your time with me i've wasted four minutes of negativity just to let you know that god knows you're there you know i was given specific instructions to go there so i went there i don't know about those instructions brother ron okay is charlie in the building he's in the back won't you stand it was your wound and i was given instructions to pray for her and charlie was born about one year later sister autumn won't you stand right the same angels visit in your house and she just came through incredible surgery this this last week don't you know that the angel of god that was watching over sister autumn was watching over that he was going to be visiting your house was in the surgical room you know what a consolation that is davey davey whitney i haven't there you are david won't you stand just as a witness just now there's a man that was crushed but the vision said he'd have seed satan did his best to stop it come on how many miracles we could point out across this building of the saving grace [Applause] god don't care about the little things can i drop one more to you i'm going to preach when i started chemo they told me not to take any vitamins or any supplements and i just purchased two bottles they were quite quite expensive bottles and i just had purchased two bottles and i and i looked at it and i said i don't need this anymore and i thought about throwing them in the trash now you think about the odds of this and the lord spoke to me and said shannon would take those hallelujah so after service i called shannon over and i said brother shannon and i i don't know even how to say this but i was going to throw these things away and he told me that you could use those and he just kind of looked at me funny and he said i was going to order them today in that rain the other day he called me about a job situation and he was in the midst of telling me and i said wait a minute let me tell you what you're getting ready to do i said i was sitting i was bidding on an auction site and and there was a con there was a conductor statue that was about that tall and i i really wasn't interested in it and i was bidding actually adam and carly was sitting with me and they're right adam and carly and they were sitting with me and and i i actually bought a circle of those things but there was one i really wasn't interested in it and when i passed it by the lord said shannon's going to be a conductor hallelujah i bought it so shannon was cl he was talking to me the other night in on the office has been weeks ago and he was talking to me and i said wait a minute i can tell you what you're going to be and i sent him a picture while i was talking i said god spoke to me that this was going to be your position get amen right now we got the devil mad here just now let's spare him just a little bit more brother donnie and i sung a song one night together and i called on him come on up and sing a song and i began to talk and you would have thought it was rambling when i said brother don it could be offered a job and taken away from church be offered good money and he just stopped and he said this week i was offered a position good morning let me just say this you god knows about your every detail [Applause] are you with me we've got a little boy that hadn't moved his legs and had tried and never tried to stead up and god spoke to me one morning on a sunday morning pick him up and i simply i saw the vision of me carrying him down the aisle and i said lord and i actually talked while the vision was happening i said he'll never let me pick him up and about the third unction i stepped off this platform and i picked wesley up you sent me video this week don't tell me our god's not alive you can't way too late let the critic be a liar i stand for the truth of god this message will produce a rapture it will produce a resurrection hallelujah i'm no great man for you to look at but i serve a great big god he's an alpha and on me to god he is a he's an unlimited god and all things are possible [Applause] that's a pretty good starter in there now paul is saying if he could stand here and preach let's just let paul preach here just for a minute i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep this encompasses all that's in the ocean all that's in the sea all that's in the grave all that's been burned at the stake not just your mom and your daddy and all of the others that you so temporarily know but hundreds and thousands of years god's made a covenant with them hallelujah brother ron do you believe he'll do it again i got news for you abraham isaac and jacob walked and took a little whistle stop in jerusalem when jesus came back leading captivity captive and even unbelievers saw them in the street and had to testify hallelujah come on church the same melchizedek now was jesus that abraham had been sitting there looking into his eyes and now he's following out of that abraham's bosom and he's walking out of that grave one day our mamas and daddies are going to step out of that grave and brother homer's going to step from that dimension because god said so not cause i said so god said so so what is cancer so what is cancer that's nothing to fear brother branham was in in the cave with the angel of the lord they were having a conversation brother random was actually the one that brought it up to the angel and he said not even cancer so the angel didn't even think that cancer was even worth talking about but being cancer was the demon of this age the messenger brought it up and the angel said not even cancer i've got some of the greatest oncologists that you can have and they see no hope but they always say but you're god don't they sister connie but you're god you're in the one percent category your god let me just echo that across this audience tonight you may be told some of the worst things tomorrow morning or next week in a hospital room but your god [Music] brother harold satan would have destroyed you a long time ago but he didn't have enough he didn't have enough he would have destroyed many of you a long time ago but he he would have if he could have but it didn't have enough they gave me four months because the enemy came in with his sword to destroy my life but he didn't have enough now satan if you're here and you're standing on this platform i want you to just remember over the last year and a half of how many miracles have happened [Applause] i want you to just think about how many miracles have happened because god said i'll use you like never before and you did everything you can to stop the ministry of the bride but you can't stop it [Applause] you can't stop tim pruitt you can't stop donny reagan you can't stop joe green you can't stop at biscon you can't stop these men of god you can't stop this five-fold ministry you can't stop this bride you've tried you've lied you've cheated you've tried to destroy but this word will destroy you beloved jude 1 3 beloved when i gave you all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints we are not a dainty wish-washy spineless we are a powerful army [Applause] more powerful than the archangels that's in heaven i'm not talking about ministry now i'm talking about every believer sitting in this building why don't you just point your at your chest right now that seed that god deposited has got power to speak a world on the outside of it it's deity himself living on the inside of you so don't talk negativity talk positive take god in his word hey help me god verse 14 and enoch also the sabbath from adam oh that must been a misquote no he intentionally the writer intentionally left cain out oh but that's just one place in the scriptures okay in your entire old testament in the entire old testament it never mentions janice and james's by name never mentions them by name but over here in the new testament when god is riding he remembered them he remembered them you say well brother ron but it you know i can say anything against the message i may forget it but god will remember [Applause] and that was only an afternoon in janus and jambore's life now i'm preaching and i'm preaching now and i'm on target don't waste your afternoon working for satan and let me just say this to you don't waste your life working for ashes oh but i've got a house to show for it those things that came through the other night from a hurricane had it chose your house i don't care where you paid a hundred thousand dollars or 50 million dollars for it in a few seconds don't waste your entire life working for ashes but what do you do for jesus there was a man that wrote a letter to his grandchildren and this was a kernel but it makes a good statement he said when i get there i'm a carpenter here on earth but when i get there i'm going to help the lord build your houses try to send up enough material to build your houses i want to speak to you about being driven so many people are driven in the wrong directions we live in an age where everybody's con confused because they watch so much media every outlet everything don't tell me if you would have taken as much time reading the scriptures if you'd have taken as much time reading the scriptures as you took reading about a vaccine i'm going to preach to you whether you like it or not you will not get yourself in rapturing condition reading the wrong materials [Applause] come on don't write me no tax after church i'll block you [Applause] that is one of the greatest buttons on your phone if you have not found it yet block is the greatest i'm gonna give you a piece of my mind andrew you can clean all this up tomorrow sure you want to take a couple days off with me the doctor told me the other day said you're gonna have to start taking some more time off you know in some cases i'm gonna protect her afterwards don't y'all get mad but i'm gonna take them but their words satan's going to be happy too don't get scared i'm 60 years old now and take care of old people i've been getting senior coffee for a long time just i've been doing that for a long time i've walked in way too many airports and people look across the counter and say do you enjoy traveling with your daddy trophy wife whatever i've heard it all but if i look this bad i might as well get the free coffee [Applause] what'd you go that way for brother ron because some of you getting too tense i need to relax you for a few minutes now remember remember enoch preached for over 300 years he prophesied for over 300 years while he was doing that he wrote god's bible in a pyramid and it was perfect actually the angles they cannot they actually say it's alien and and i have to agree with them they said alien activity helped create that pyramid well they were right they're right they're not always wrong because the god of our world helped enoch put that exactly right because no man could do it like that and the alien of this world our god helped him write the bible now here's where i want to go with this you're living in the most wicked age sodom is everywhere it's at walmart i don't go it's a target i don't go it's at amazon it's everywhere sodom's everywhere and if you're paying any attention to the news sodom is making the news every day and you hear all the fuss about abortions it's still murder and let me just let me just background here just for a minute all this fuss about afghanistan all that is is bullies taking over the opium fields so who is in control of the drugs ain't nothing else there are you with me see every kingdom is run by the devil it's run by the devil and even the fuss over the abortion issue if you really look into it deep enough it's about organs being big enough to where they can harvest them and it's millions of dollars that is at stake if they can't wait till a later trimester it's still myrrh come on it's still murder and i'm making the case right now why america can be destroyed [Applause] and i stand as a gospel preacher of this message and saying god is a righteous god and the cup of iniquity has ran over out of the cup and it's random off of the table and it's running in the floor i say even so come lord jesus well let me just stir the dimple just a little bit longer [Applause] i heard that old song song since i was a little child just a little longer please jesus why don't you get your writing self born again get born again and give your life to jesus christ sin will only take you to hell come on no man or woman or boy or girl is going to be without excuse this message has went throughout the whole world well is that enough is that enough of the negativity is that enough of that do you mind if i preach positive here just for a little bit in her day fanny crosby though she was blind though she'd been blind since a child though she was blind she could have sold being a pulper couldn't hardly afford her own apartment could have sold her gift to the world and could have written the national anthem of the united states of america or or the south she could have written all of those phenomenal songs but refused to write them that she could be an overcomer in her age susannah wesley that had three houses burned down 19 children were born from her womb only about six or seven of them would survive but yet she would pray three hours a day from her womb would come john which would be a messenger of the hour and charles that would be the song leader that would write thousands of songs she lived in horrible conditions but if she didn't have enough to do she wrote john's commentaries and diaries to where that literally millions could still read them today she don't talk about her deplorable conditions she raises her head above all the fanaticism [Applause] what about the wigglesworth what about the saint martins that brother random said he raised his head above the fanaticism that was around him what about the spurgeons and the calvins and the phoenix what about the great men brother brown said charles feeney when he preached he said he had a terrible wine in his nose he said when he preached he whined and yet thousands would come to hear him preach newspaper articles people would come and to write about him they would say what draws people to you he said they didn't come to see me they come to see jesus brother branham said he preached conviction so powerful the anointing of god would flow from the pulpit and men going to work five miles away would drop their lunch pail and give their heart to jesus christ 97 of his converts held these are one of the ones that god released from his hand to fulfill the word of the hour now watch this he wouldn't release feeney until a right time he wouldn't release martin luther until a right time he wouldn't release the believers that were under these people until the right time he would not release william branham until the right time i want you to think about this satan has always been driven to destroy the seed help me now he's always been driven it was in egypt he was driven to destroy moses it was with jesus he was driven and destroyed a generation to get a hold of jesus he's been driven to try to destroy you but god knew that that was going to happen and so he put something on you that would raise the standard against that devil chris you had to be born a certain day a certain hour with certain parents you were born to fulfill the purpose of more than setting a seat more than coming to church but that this message that's not going to rapture taper corners he's not going to rapture your books and your pictures he's not going to take he's not even interested in all this equipment that's around us he's going to rapture you you are the very molecules now jesus walked on the water and i believe that with all my heart amen because he made it he blessed water and it turned into the best wine in the entire city he took a leper and he didn't have to pray all night he was greater than that leprosy when he came to your life he was a lot of different things it didn't take him 10 years to fix you in a few seconds it was done here's a young man that came into my into the brain operation he came in he had an agenda his life was in turmoil he'd been a phenomenal ball player but that has an end if he went to the nfl it would have had an end and he had offers he had offers but it would have had an end the room was full and all of a sudden it became empty and it's just me and you and i knew when it became empty like that some of my business associates was actually there and they just they just walked out of the room and it was just you and i and i knew i'm going to have a brain operation and you're getting ready to have a heart and a few minutes it was over everybody came back in on just after it was all over with everybody came back in they didn't know nothing about it and that boy was changed in just a couple minutes it's done it was just done it was over it was done it was over and now almost every decision he makes it just people tell him he's got a golden horseshoe i'll tell you what the horseshoe is is god if you let god have your life let me say it if god is your partner can i say it hallelujah if god is your partner you better have big plans hallelujah [Applause] just when you think there's no way you just tell the devil watch can i go just a few minutes longer we've been expecting the bride's revival but just as quick as the bride's revival begins here comes the critic don't want no music don't want one worship wants everything dead but we're driven like ruth and esther and tamar and rebecca we're driven we realize that where we are and what we've been called to and there's nothing nothing that can stop us nothing nothing nothing nothing we don't need pumped up we don't need primed all we need is opportunity and when we walk into the house of the lord we're here to fulfill one thing he inhabits in the praises of his people hang on to your seat belt just for a minute let me just brace you just for a few more seconds here are you with me now if god be for us [Applause] if god be for us who can be against us who shall separate us from the love of christ your tribulation distress persecution famine or nakedness a parallel sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're counted as sheep for a slaughter nay and all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded i'm driven i am persuaded that neither death nor alive nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord give the lord a great big hand right there the lord is my light and my salvation of whom shall i feel the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up on me to heat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me and this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life and to behold the beauty of the lord and inquiring his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about therefore i will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing [Applause] i got stage four cancer and if i can preach like this you ought to be able to shout well brother ron i need a quote okay i want to give you something make a joyful noise unto the lord all your lands serve the lord with gladness and come before his presence with singing know ye the lord he is god and it is he that hath made us not we ourselves we are his people and sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with thanksgiving into his sports with
