you that we could just come to a building and come to a church Lord I just long all through the week that we could just come and be able to come and just be with you Lord and be in a presence of just like-minded people that are just wanting to grow and be more like you and be able to just be influenced by the spirit and Lord we never want to stop and stop and become stagnant we know that stagnant Waters they they'll have worms but Lord Jesus we want running Waters Living Waters Lord to be able to be flowing through our life and Lord if we ever fill our feet or are standing still allow you to just be able to come and just give us a little push to continue to go further Lord and I just believe that just as we lift these prayer requests up to you that we're not doing this as a ritual we're not doing this just as to be able to let anyone know who's sick or we're doing this in power Lord we know that we know that we have the word here and the word in spirit is what it takes in this day and I would just hear the prophet today as he would talk about how we need the Dynamics and the mechanics and the Dynamics is what makes this message live Lord and I just believe that we have the the money in the bank to be able to cash those checks and Lord I just pray that you would just come in each and every one of these prayer requests there's many dire need you see sister Pat there and

are the one and only that can come down the great physician that can heal over over each and every one of these Lord Jesus it's not just one it's not one greater than another Lord Jesus if you would just come and I just believe that you could take every Cancer cell out of out of the entire bride that we have here that's the God that I serve and Lord Jesus I'm looking for a for a day that you come and not only just heal us of cancer and heal us of sickness and the injuries and things that the that just living this life and being human brings but Lord Jesus you you take and change our whole entire bodies Lord in the Rapture and Lord I just long for that day and I just ask that you would just come and you would be with us Lord continue to be there with sister Bethany Hatfield and go and

did I'm not nervous I'm super nervous so I just want to say thank youon family it's been the last five years it's been amazing to see this family and the church finally I saw many streamings I see uh familiar faces so it's it's an honor am and it's by the grace of God I can stand here behind the same pit my daddy stood amen that's just God's grace cuz I was I was far away and I think I wrote myself off many times that's things I've done things I experienced I just was lost couldn't find my way back but prayer changes everything so I just I just want to read one scripture um John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that who that whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life thir of January 2020 I could I could put my name Isaiah in there I know I I know to the to the grace of God I have everlasting life thank you Lord so I want to give a a small background um on my life oh and also don't want to forget my pastor Brother David Iverson I I texted him said I have to I not I have to but well I have to give my testimony this when they asked me said oh I'm going to die I said I'm going to die but if if my nerves get on control I think I'll do all right yeah so uh but David ion giv you gives his greetings so um this can go so I was raised in a Christian family my daddy was a pastor in a small Church in Brussels um there was six children four boys two girls that was the third one in line um we had we had all we we needed we weren't very rich but God provided and we have what we needed so bro my dad he truly lived the life that's he truly lived he loved this message message and he lived it sadly I realized this after him passing away that's something that's hard to handle because he was he was truly a general he was I mean he went out to places yeah I I wish I was with him at at those times but it was a different plan I remember very well how I started drifting away must I been 21 my friend bought me my first beer I did not buy it he just pushed it into my hands and that's how I went downhill very very fast drinking that was the thing I I did I was good at it sometimes I went home standing behind the corner seating my dad and family going to church so I could go in house and get some sleep that was 8:00 830 I was waiting just for them to go to church so I could get my sleep and go to bed drunk if I'm going too fast or not speaking properly just raise your hands okay no what did so I'm good I'm good okay so so that that went on for our well for for a long time you know when you have a thirst in your heart you want to fill with something you want to F with something is it alcohol is it is it lust you want there's a void that wants to be filled and I I use the wrong the wrong um uh longings to feel that void so that was something yeah I just I tried alcohol just to get away to to to have a good feeling to just you know I many times I called my dad crying in the night just weeping said Daddy I'm not going to make it because you know inside there's a truth somewhere and I know I could call my dad any time one time I called him it was in the afternoon I said that I think I'm dying please pray for me CU Satan he he will oh he will he will keep attacking you he will drag you along and then he would drop you just like you're nothing and he he he did it a couple of times so I I can tell you many stories how God spared my life life I wrecked a few cars I don't know how many I think two or three but I sometimes I woke up in the morning where's my car at I I had to find look where my car is finding a bumper missing one time I hit my car in a in a tree i l in a ditch next morning I went up to find to get the car I called um what you call the the trucks who who um tow truck so the the the thing was there was a brother from the church in in Gent he just drove by on his bike I said I said why why now so he he knew I was drunk so but he didn't say too much but I I felt so so ashamed of that but that wasn't still enough for me to come back that wasn't that wasn't enough so one time me and my buddies so-called buddies wanted to go to um to a club disco club disc probably club right um we we uh took off with three cars there was me and a guy who drove like crazy I mean he was like he was speeding passing cars and along the way we had to stop we couldn't find the the the the club so we all got out of the car and there was uh the car behind him was four girls and said Isaiah please come with us come with us this guy is driving crazy you you you get a wreck so no I'm fine we'll we we'll make it we'll just have to find a way so we take off again 2 minutes later I'm I'm at the car with the that crazy guy who drove like I don't know a car from the other side missed us like few inches and hit the car behind me with the four girls two broke their backs I pulled them out and I know God spread my life one more time just he Satan can he can he can touch you but he can take you away so God saved my life many times many times I wish I could all I could all tell you what God has been doing for me so um this lifestyle continued and at 27 years old I met my wife uh my future wife Julie I always say she was 17 years old when we started dating but in in fact it was 16 and N months so that was yeah so you can imagine me and her dad wasn't wasn't best friends in the beginning now we get along very well but so Julie she um she never heard about the message they have some Catholic backgrounds and but don't do not practice it just me before um um if somebody dies or um you know what they practice in Catholic church so we stayed together until 2011 but because of the drinking and the party Ang Julie said she she would she would leave me she she couldn't handle it no more you know what if you have a house a home and you want to work work work and then go to a bar not go home is because you it's not a happy home so so I I I broke her heart many many times so 2011 I promised said listen I will stop the drinking I will go back to church because I did not want to lose my wife and you know how you start you know what I will I will skip the beer and the alcohol but I will stay with the wine that wasn't getting any better so I stopped doing that also I went to church for a couple of months so that was 2011 but Julie then she saw this is this is from the one extreme to the to the other to the other side of the extreme not that for me I had some rest but it it was it was like me doing it I can do this I can stop the drinking and the go out just to save my relationship with with my wife but no that that didn't work so we broke up for a couple of months I went to church we had we had some contact but not a lot but I broke her heart and mine was broken too see Satan he will he will Dag you alone he will drop you he will drop you just like my youth so when I came so I went to to a couple of meetings went to Canada and but that's still that's still same void I still had it just I just I just couldn't find I just couldn't find uh peace and rest I started backsliding again dropped out of church got in contact with Julie again I I I don't know why he even she even took me back but it must have been for the grace of God it was meant to be so we got married and we got married in 2015 uh we got married in Italy the place called deoi I think five five years later we found out it means God willing didn't I did not know no this so we got married there in the place called de so but still the still the drinking that was that was yeah so we had a shield uh our first born I got the date right this time 18 April 2016 Billy was born March 29th 2018 but again we not have a happy home I would just go out even work Saturdays not to be home because I can do whatever I want on Saturday I said I I'll go to work and at 12:00 I was in restaurants with friends having well I won't say dinner was more drinking party so I'm not proud of that no I just alcohol is something it will take you it it will take you so far it's it's not only alcohol it's other things but I don't want to get into that because that some things I you get the scars and that that will stay that will stay until um I get my glorified body but I have scars that I I am I you know I I don't want to talk about that but so but my our marriage was wrecked fast forward 2019 our Mar was just wrecked Julie called my dad B A gido she said I'm at the end of the road divorce was Insight it was just a matter of time and she would take the kids and just move move out you know what my dad said to Julie said you know what keep praying for him so Julia uh I will say I won't I won't say it now but then she was an un unbeliever she didn't know God but she said you know what I tried everything I will ask God to see my husband's getting saved so 2019 1 of November bro suddenly passed away just my my world just it just fell apart that day the drinking stopped somehow Julie felt this would change everything I she just had this feeling this will change everything but because she knew the life my my parents and family lived that was something special so she said we should go to church on Sunday and their life began for next couple of months a thirst came into my heart for reading the Bible and the message just constantly listening reading my Bible a hunger for God in January we had the meetings when for the young people um Newport meetings when we had last year last year brother uh Andrew came so but this was the meetings in 2020 so the 3rd of January brother Timothy Peru spoke a message born of fire oh man that was that was changing that was changing the end of the service he made an alter call I didn't have like the the feeling to go up Suddenly something spoke Isaiah you go forward I went I went forward and Brother David mayor started praying for me I I don't I I I prayed I don't even know what I said but in 10 seconds God came down and filled my whole life with his Holy Ghost and from that on I knew I found I I I I I found what what I was looking for I found what I was looking for I found that on that day third of January so God gave me something special and when I gave my T testimony in in Newport I didn't mention that but when this happened you know what surround system is Right surround systems I heard a choir from this side and from that side going back and forth back and forth it was just amazing to hear that choir sing it was just I mean it was something amazing I can never forget that so that was just something God gave me something extra to carry this so but of course uh Julie was with me in that in that youth meetings and she was in the room so I go up to the room I said Julie I finally found what I what I was looking for she looks me in the ey she I think she thought I was crazy I don't know but she looks up okay Isaiah I'm very happy for you so but then she she saw the change in my my life and she said that this is something special because I knew him before it's not the same husband I have now so she she was like okay this is he started coming to church with me just actually in the beginning because I was happy I found my rest but then she didn't experience and she gave her hearts a couple months later she was baptized and gave her heart to Christ so so if you talk about a miracle well I guess here I stand God bless you all we would all be happy to see someone get out of a wheelchair on or for cancer to leave but those are the greatest Miracles amen that's eternal that's Eternal Hallelujah that's Eternal you know God has determined I will not lose one if you have a loved one that's just walking in a very very rough way you get them to watch this you get them to watch this bear drugs the wrong kind of living doesn't satisfy that thirst CU if you're a child of God there's only one thing that will satisfy it and that's what you found right there amen sister Beth I think you're scheduled to sing this evening is that correct am I right sister Beth God bless you you can be seated I want to make sure that you heard something that when he gave his heart to the Lord he heard a choir a Heavenly Choir singing both on his left and on his right and there was no choir in the building but Dimensions Blended for him and listen when that happens you'll never be the same just never be the same God bless you Sister [Music] Beth I Will Bless The Lord forever and I will trust him at all [Music] times he has delived me from all fear and he has set my feet upon us a rock and I will not be moved and I'll say of the Lord you are my shield my strength my [Music] porion deliver my sh shter Strong Tower my very present help in time of need home help I in heaven but you there's none our desire beside you you have made me [Music] glad and I'll say all the Lord you are my shield my strength my portion deliv I shelter Strong Tower my present help you are my shield my

very presence and H you are my shield my strength my portion [Music] deliv my Shel strong to my very present help in time of need [Music] my very present help in time [Music] of Amen praise the Lord isn't it wonderful to be in the house of the Lord amen man we've we've had a very wonderful week and uh we're so so happy to have our friends from Belgium here with us it it means so much to have them here they brother Isaiah has become a a real friend to me and uh the past few years just getting to know him and being uh being around his dad's Ministry has certainly certainly impacted our life here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and has meant a lot to the ministry here and uh to be acquainted with his brother brother Joshua and his sisters and brother Isaiah we just we're very blessed people and and uh last night we we had an event uh take place uh uh we had a a date night here for uh for all the married couples here and uh that was a that was a really neat deal and uh it was it was super enjoyable and uh I don't think we've ever laughed so hard in our life and uh it it was it was rather enjoyable and we found out that we found out a lot of us ain't painters and uh and so they they had a little deal where basically the husband had to paint the wife and the wife had to paint the husband and just basically give a portrait and uh brother alen wins the award for the worst painter in the building and uh and I wasn't too far behind him but you know I was thinking about those things we we have these youth events every weekend we have we have these events like that and you think about the the denominations and the outside world they have to have those events to get people to come to church but we have church and then those things are added benefits to our to our church and we I think it's so powerful to realize that you don't need some event to keep you coming to church you don't have to have some you don't have to have some system you don't have to have somebody socialize you to keep keep you to come into church but the Holy Spirit drives you and fills you and wants you to be hungry for the power of God and it's it's a wonderful thing to enjoy those things but this is what a real Christian feeds on we don't feed on events we we have a gym we have those nice things but the word of God is our strength and it is it's our everything and I tell you we're just a blessed people and we we ask that you'd be praying for us this week brother Ron and myself will be headed to Canada to speak in brother Tom Ray and brother Michael's Camp there their family camp this summer and we just ask that You' be praying for us as we are traveling there Tuesday Morning real early and just to be a part of those uh six Services there we just we know that the expectations are high and we're expecting powerful things to take place and if you wouldn't mind just saying a prayer for us and be remembering Us in those meetings we certainly would appreciate that and our hearts have been set on those meetings for quite sometime and and uh we're just looking unto the Lord looking unto the Lord so as we get ready to uh bring forth the word let maybe we'll just sing that song uh worshiping you worshiping you we'll just invite you to stand this evening amen worshiping you worshiping you oh oh oh that I would rather do I Love You Lord worshiping you worshiping [Music] you you

the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings and they like men have transgress the Covenant and there ha they have dealt treacherously against me Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of the priest murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel there is whoredom of Ephraim Israel is defiled also oh Judah he hath set an Harvest for thee when I returned the Captivity of my people now we we know that by by studying and being Bible Believers we know that throughout the course of time that Israel has became and was a scattered people from her from her Homeland we realize that that Israel can never be blessed outside of her home and and when Israel begins to get scattered they begin to get their eyes upon they get their eyes upon false gods and false things and they begin to invite false things into their worship and here as we' read in Hosea chapter 6 we realize that that Hosea has been scattered and she that Israel has played the part of a harlot and brother Brandon would use these or or the he would use these words in the message recognizing your day in its message and you read it here in Hosea that he that uh Israel was scattered they were torn and they were blinded do you see the reason why they were that way was because they had forsaken the true and living God they had forgot his statutes and when you begin to read the book of Hosea that the book of Hosea is in three different parts and the first part is the Dishonored wife and even Hosea takes unto him and marries a harlot and a and then then that Harlot returns unto to her ways but if you go to reading Hosea the book of Hosea that there Hosea becomes to her and he restores her back to his her position as his wife in the second part of Hosea he begins to describe what the sinful people but he doesn't leave them there but God restores them and the third part is the ultimate blessing and the glory of Israel and it is said that the book of Hosea is summed up with two words that is loami which you can read there in chapter 2 meaning not my people and the word Amy which means my people and it's a powerful thing when you begin to read the context of Hosea when you begin to look at it when you begin to see them that God was rejecting them and then you begin to see God begin to return them back un un the word of God and brother Brandon he uses this text of Hosea chapter 6 on recognizing your day and its message and brother brandham he goes in there and he said then notice hoseah after two days he said he would return them to them he would he would receive he would receive and give us or revive us he said now revive doesn't mean Resurrection revive there mean it is the same word as used anywhere else he said I just looked it up he said it means a Revival he will revive us after two days that would that that would be in the third day that he would revive us again after he scattered us and blinded us and tore us and there brother brandham lays out some very powerful powerful message and Powerful things and Keynotes there in that message but there we recognize that that two days is not like 24 hours but a a day is like a thousand years unto the Lord and it's so it's there 2,000 years and it's been over 2700 years that this has has been transpiring but notice what the Bible said that after two days that we shall live in his sight that we shall have life in his sight that we shall live in his sight which means to have eternal life in his sight you see you see the Jews have been dead to the fact that the Church of the Living God has been living under a Pentecostal Feast but in the third day that God is going to turn his eyes from the Gentiles and he's going to turn it back to the Jews you see is literally after 2,000 years of a Pentecostal Feast but we recognize that the hour that we're living in after after 2,000 over over 2,000 years to see that the Church of the Living God is in her position but the church that Israel is in her position and to think that it's at a spot where the six-star flag of David is flying over a nation it's been it's been there it's it's the first time in history in many many thousands of years that the that Israel is back in her Homeland and those Jews are there waiting they're waiting on their Messiah they don't even realize they don't even realize how they got back there but they but the spirit of God begin to call them to come back to their Homeland and and the reason of it being is that the Jews are there waiting they're waiting there on the Feast of the trumpets they're waiting there for a time that they are going to recognize the atonement and notice this that the Church of God has has missed their day the church the the church world has missed there they they have not recognized what is taking place the church world has not recognized what is taking place but God has recognized what has taking place when when men turn down throughout the year throughout the Bible History men would turn down prophets but God always recognized those prophets and if God would ever send a prophet then he would have a people that would believe what that Prophet is saying you see the church is blind like balam like balam was blind to the angel just like it is said in this generation in Revelation chapter 3 that that this layout of see an age is blind and they're naked and they don't even know it it's just like the Jews that they were blinded but they don't even know that they're blind minded but you see they're there they they got there by the wings of an eagle they were they were placed back there in the middle of the night the spirit of God begin to drive them back to their Homeland when when when all of the the Pol the the political worlds they drove them out of there brother Brandon would say it like this that he said that National Force put Israel national Force pushed her out but the spirit of God put her back in that place and to think that that there you begin to see that the very same night that William Bram is receiving a commission from the Lord that if you will get the people to believe you that not even pray that not even cancer would stand before your prayer and that he would give him a sign he would give him a commission he would stand there under under the confirmation of that commission but it was on the same night that Israel has a peace treaty and she's put back in her hom land now this has just been going on this has just been going on but it happened to be that the same night that the Gentile bride was receiving a commission to only believe but it was the same not it was the same not that the Jews were literally good put back in their position you remember when brother randam is he's there and and that Louis petus he he sees the the sign of the Messiah he sees he sees the inside on what on William brandom's life and he he tells him said that he said I've got a million books and he he he said I've got a million Bibles and we're shipping them over and William brandham is making his way back to Israel he's making his way to Israel and he's he's there in Cairo Egypt and he's there in the airport and brother Ram is standing there and the spirit of God the spirit of God stops him because a Jew will recognize a sign of a prophet and brother brandham realized that his ministry was not just an ordinary Ministry but it was a Ministry for a dispensational change and there he he goes and he's got this yearning to go and to and to preach the message he was going to preach the same message that you heard but he was going to preach it right to them Jewish people but the spirit of God speaks to him and tells him it's not their time yet you see because Elijah was on the scene but there's got to be a Moses that'll be on that scene and to think that the Jews were blinded so that you and I could have our eyesight it's the day and age where there's got to be a spiritual eyesight to be able to look into the Realms of the holies of holies you see when brother bham is standing there and recognizing or Christ is recognized in his own word brother bham begins to lay out the characteristics of the body that here the body the body has a hand the body has a feet the body has a mouth but the body has an eye and he comes up to it he said now your hand can't see for you and your feet can't see for you he said and your mouth can't see for you he said but this is the age of the eye again where you're able to be able to see he he said now you don't get any higher intelligence than that of player he said you can't get no higher to the Realms of your flesh than the eye he said the very next thing that is to come is the intelligence he said that's the reason why people now notice if you want to profit you bald Brothers he said if you want to if you want a prophet's words brother random said that's why that men go bald sooner than other he said because he said sooner than later he said because he said there's no muscle up there to to actually make make the hair follicles stay in their position so they turn loose it's a mystery it's a paradox how them Sisters still got their hair maybe maybe they got more muscles up there than we but what it brother manam said he said now notice he said the next thing from the eyesight is the intelligence he said now you can't get no higher than that eyesight he said so it takes he said it takes an eyesight to be able to see where you're living at notice what Paul tells the church in 2 Corinthians 4:18 he said it's not that it's not that we he said with this temporal things that we see these temporal things that we see he said they're temporal he said but the things that we don't see are Eternal the things we don't see are Eternal and maybe you don't see your Revival in the room maybe you don't see where your Revival's coming from but your Revival is right here maybe you don't understand where exactly the power of God is coming from to bless you in your position that you're in and maybe maybe every single one of us could say that we go through a spot that we need a fresh Revival that we need a fresh Revival I would say that we could all say that we come to a spot where we just needed to pray again that we needed to reestablish the family altar again and get back get back to God and get back to reading the message get back to playing tapes and get back to to praying again and I promise you that if you'll start right there if you'll start in prayer if you'll start in reading your Bible then you'll see a Revival don't just pray for a Revival in church pray for a Revival in your home pray for your Revival right there in your home don't wait for your children to get here to teach them how to pray and teach them how to worship and teach them how to ask God I would say this teach them right there right there where you are and I say well you said well brother Andrew I'm fighting so many demons I'm I'm fighting this in my home I'm fighting this in my life maybe you're like Samson and you've been beat down you've done beat down a thousand Philistines and you're needing a refreshing from the Lord but I want you to I want to tell you this don't throw away the best thing that God has given you don't be like Samson and say God don't leave me out here in my trial don't leave me out here in my crisis don't leave me right here but refresh me are you going to sit here and let me destroy my enemies and let me die right here give me a refreshing and the thing that Samson used to defeat his enemy was the same thing that God give him to give him a refreshing if you go to studying out genes or uh you begin to study out judges 15 excuse me I'm I'm just I'm just going by inspiration here I believe it's judges 15 that that even Samson called the name of that place in haakor which means one that called upon God one that called upon God in haakor which is near Lehi according according to scripture in haakor means one that calls on God David would say when I get nigh when I when I'm in fear or when I'm in trouble all I had to do was call upon the Lord I'll say this to you it doesn't matter the crisis it doesn't matter the trial you don't have to live in a mental state where Satan can whip you around and think that's all you've got to live in I I just want to say that Satan is a liar that Satan is a liar you can live higher than what Satan is telling you you can go further in the presence of God than Satan is telling you hallelujah it's seeing time it's seeing time and every the brother Brandon would say that every time a fresh Revival would come it was when men and when men would get back to the word of God it would be when men and women get back to the word of God and you know good and well that you've received a restored word in this hour and William brandham would stand there in 1962 and he would preach a powerful message I I love how brother brandham did that he goes after brother Neville preaches a powerful message that morning and he says I went home and I wrote down a few notes and he comes back and preaches a three and 1 half hour sermon on the restoration of the brid tree that's when you know that there's an angel that is leading you by scriptures when you can just take a few notes but there brother random say some very powerful things he said now notice he said you and I have been given the privilege to enforce our claims on Satan that if Satan has stolen something from you you have a right to enforce the claims let me say it like this that if I was in trouble and somebody was robbing my house all I have to do is call on Gabriel and the men that he works for and somebody that has the a commission that somebody's got a seal upon their life that that man can show up at my house and he has a right to enforce a claim not just by hillbilly claims not just by hillbilly laws but by the claims of the state of Virginia he can have a privilege to to cast that man into prison and Satan has come into your life to steal to kill and destroy he's stolen away your joy he's stolen away your peace he's stolen away your worship he's stolen away your family atmosphere he's stolen away your courage Hallelujah but a prophet didn't just send us a word and just leave us halfway restored he sent us a restored word a restored word a rest stored word and you as a Believer how many believers do we have here tonight it is your privilege to enforce the claims upon Satan and say Satan give it back you do not have to be you do not have to be a critic or you don't have to be a you don't have to be somebody that falls that falls under the falls under the crushing power of Satan you don't have to be the victim you might have trials you might have trials and you might have tribulations that come but you don't have to be a victim to it in the other hand you can be a Victor because God is going to raise up a people that that refuse to retreat they refuse to give in God is going to have a people that have been restored back that have been turned back Hallelujah what's Satan stolen from from you if he's stolen away your prayer life take it back if he's stolen away your joy take it back if he's stolen away your peace take it back if he's stolen away your family take it back if he's stolen away your breakthrough take it back I just feel to say those things tonight those ain't in my notes I just fa to say those things tonight I was I was was real I was real concerned I was real concerned exactly how the path of God would lead me but I I feel really I feel really pushed to say those things that God is coming to us as the rain not just a former rain which is a teaching rain but he's come unto us as a harvest rain which William Brandon would say is rapturing Faith you see now notice notice in the days of Noah in the days of Noah then then in those days you see there was in those days the water would come forth from the ground the water would come for the ground and it would water the plants it would water the ters and tomatoes and green beans and all those things but after Noah's commission and after his dispensation God was going to rain down he was going to rain and there he would be the source of those plants life and brother random would take us brother random would take us in broken cens out of Jeremiah 2:3 he said not give it give it to me there sister sister Stephanie God bless you for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me they have forsaken me The Fountains of Living Waters and hewed them out sists broken sists that can hold no water and the prophet would take a very powerful thought on broken cister and in there brother brandom said now he said that sister he said he said it's okay he said but in there it's got It's got wiggle Tails he said that cister is depending on local rains you see if it don't get no rain if you got a sister right now living in a drought that we're living in you're living in a troubled time but if you've got a if you got a hold of a something a little bit better than artisian whale you see that sist is drawing from a Revival maybe from last year's Revival maybe from two years a labor day or maybe from this brother coming by or that evangelist coming by a sistern is depending upon local rigns but that Arian whale it's depending on a resource it's depending on a resource that's coming from a fountain that maybe he don't see maybe he don't understand it maybe he don't understand the pull of the message but something is pulling at him it's pulling at him and it's drawing at him to come up what is it it's a resource now if I if I it's okay if I preach from inspiration just for a minute if I would take this which is a source right this is a source and the Bible tells us that Jesus Jesus had the spirit without measur it's John chapter 3 that Jesus had the spirit without measuring and the prophet would teach us he would tell us he said now you and I have the spirit with measuring he said but if you go down to the ocean and you take a teaspoon out of that ocean he said you take it and you test those chemicals it's the same Source it's the same power that's there that's there in that ocean is the same thing in that teaspoon and I could take this water out of this source and if I had a cup I could pour Noah a little bit of this water and if I gave you a cup I could pour you a little bit of this water and if I gave Jay a little bit of this water they would all say that they receive something they have a resource from a source they have a resource from a source and maybe you don't understand why you feel the pole to live this message like never before but I want you to tell I want to tell you keep on drinking keep on drinking this water it's your resource of life it's sustaining if it met a woman at a whale it's that kind of water that'll make you it'll make it'll put on the inside of you Living Waters it's amazing if Noah gets to drinking that water that I gave him and he goes to telling somebody you know what I don't have the same holy ghost that brother Andrew has or if brother Jordan starts saying I don't have the same source as brother Andrew has or Brother Jay says I don't have the same source as brother Andrew has you see there's a lot of people that go around and say well I don't have the same power that the preacher has the same holy ghost that I got is the same holy ghost that you got you see I've been drinking from the same well from the same Fountain some the same anointing come on somebody come on somebody the same anointing that gave Noah water was a same anointing that led him go across the Judgment Waters the same power that gave Moses the power to stretch forth his Rod stretch forth his rod and walk over on dry ground was the same power that anointed Jesus to walk over on the waters and get to Peter the same power Hallelujah that was there in the lines then with Daniel was the same power that kept Paul and Silas in the prison cell the same power the same power that said Joshua tell the son to stand still was the same power Hallelujah was the same power that that little old woman reached out and touched him it was the same power because he had a hold of the same resource I tell you the same power that anointed non to dip down into the waters seven times was the same power that that leper grabbed a hold of Jesus and Jesus looked on him and said be thou clean it was the same power I'll tell you the same power that anointed Elijah to go up there and withstand 850 false prophets was the same power that gave Jesus the power to withstand the religious worlds of that day I'm going somewhere and don't even know where I'm going but I'm preaching to you just for a minute I say it like this the same power that fell on the day of Pentecost you don't have to want about the about the Holy Ghost that Paul had and the holy ghost that Peter had and the holy ghost that William brandham had that same power is a power that's falling on the Church of the Living God and you have a privilege you have a privilege to take your power and return back to the Lord because Satan can't get a hold of that little life that's laying on the inside of you that's the same power you said well when do I know if it's time for me to go up and take my privilege and enforce the claim David David one day he was waiting to see when his time was he was waiting on his time brother Isaiah he was waiting to see if it was the time of the lord and there he got underneath him mberry trees he got underneath him mberry trees and you might be wondering is this a service that you drive out Satan is this the service that you really receive a break through is this a service that you get a hold of something is this a service that you receive A Change Is it is it time is it time is it time is it time I say you're in the midst of it oh and David was seeking out the mind of God he was seeking out the mind of God whether whether he should go up at this time or go up at another time but the Lord said unto him it's time to go now when the Angels over top the mberry trees and David said I heard the sound of a going what was it it was a sign unto him that it was time to go and you may have been living here you may have been living with the devil you may have been living with trouble you may have been living with sin but I want to tell you right now is a time right now is a time you are perfect in the sight of almighty God and the only thing that is stopping you from removing Satan out of your life is unbelief the only thing that is keeping you from moving Satan out of his position is unbelief but if you could just let that little flame of fire gets a whirling up on the inside of you and said Lord I believe it now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen our God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and if you could turn loose your faith just real quick come on Mary I'll say even now even now now even now it's time it's time it's time you let loose of it you can either be traumatized by your trial you can either be traumatized by your trial or you can traumatize your trial you can either go along with the Mind battles or you can battle your mind let me ask you something how big would you dream if you couldn't if you knew you couldn't fail how big would you ask if you knew you wouldn't get the answer no how big how big would you ask if God's answer was yes how big would you dream if you knew you couldn't fail well little bride I want to tell this unto you this is a church that is a continuation of the book of Acts you are an invincible Army that means you are too powerful to be defeated hallelujah what you going to ask for you're in the midst of the greatest Revival that's ever struck the face of the Earth what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with your Mountain are you going to be like clay Caleb and say give me my Mountain are you going to let some Amorite inhabit your inheritance the rest of your life you see as long as it's a promise it's just something out there in front of you but if it's a possession then you can say it is my inheritance and I'll say this at Malachi 4 Malachi 4 came and pointed out your inheritance so this is your this is yours this is yours brother Maron would talk about the fundamentalist in the Pentecostal he said if I could ever get them two hooked up together one's got faith and he said the other one's got the power to make he said but if I could ever get them two hooked up together I tell you what you are Church of the Living God you're not sitting here as a limited bride of Jesus Christ you are sitting here as the most powerful people that's up on the face of the Earth you have unlimited resources unlimited resources to tap into a realm how say it you're fundamental Pentecostals you know you got money in the bank and you ain't scared to write the check how big would you ask would you ask for your prodical would you ask for your family member would you ask to get over this trial how big would you ask let me just preach let me just finish preaching right there how big would you ask if God would send a boat by your way and tell you to get on it and all of a sudden all of a sudden all kinds of millions of maybe not Millions but hundreds of animals start getting on that boat I say it's time to get on there how big would you ask when you are wanting to see the signs of the signs of the true belever fall into the Church of the Living God and you see somebody by the name of Isaiah vber Bron that didn't look like he was coming back to God that shouldn't be an in a picture according to Satan how big would you ask you're marriage is worth asking for your joy is worth asking for the pain you've been going through is worth asking for hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah it's your time it's your time to ask you say brother Andrew I can't find a time to pray let me tell you you better find it you better find it was I don't really I don't see no sources I don't see nothing coming from my prayers I'm here because of Mama Prayed Zoe always talking because a Mama Prayed Hallelujah you're sitting here because a husband prayed how big would you ask if prayer was powerless then it' be easy if prayer was powerless Satan wouldn't war on you about spending time in prayer if it was powerless then he wouldn't afflict you in your prayer life but if it's got power then Satan wants to keep you from it sister Julie brother gido told you to pray and you wasn't even a Christian you didn't even know but you started praying how big was it how powerful was it how big is your question mark I want to say that God is on the other side of your question and the answer is bigger than you can imagine I'm praying for a supernatural Revival well it's here I'm praying for a breakthrough well it's here I'm praying for a Revival in my children well it's here come on somebody you don't have to wish for days gone by you don't have to wish be to be back there with Paul and Silas you don't have to wish back there to be with Peter you don't have to wish to be back there with William brandham you're in the greatest Revival you're the a bride's Revival you're here it's a dispensational changing time it's a season it's a season it's a season of Revival and this revival ain't going away one time when I was a I was a young I was a young preacher and sometimes when you're young you just say what's ever on your heart you think everybody understands what you're saying you think everybody's on the same playing field as you you find out real quick they ain't you're in Revival and they're not in Revival you're having a prayer you're having a powerful prayer time and they're not you're having Victory and they're not and I I just a young preacher and I tell you what I I was on fire I was as much on fire then as I am right now and I got to talking about how powerful God was doing things that he was saving this one I wasn't just telling our stories I was telling the stories any I tell you one thing as as long as I'm alive God's going to have a witness and I don't care if it happens to me I I'd much rather I'd much rather tell your story brother Timothy than to tell mine but if if if if God ain't doing nothing else I'll tell my story I'll tell my story and I I started telling this I I started telling this used to be message preacher that walked away from it I started telling him about the Revival that was taking place I started telling him about this brother I start started telling about this healing I I said man this is It's a bride's Revival this is everything that we have believed on and waited on and it's here where in the morning moments of it and and we're seeing it and he said no it's just a season you watch I've been a pastor for I've been a pastor for 40 years now and I watch those times come and I watch those times cease I watch them come again and I watch them cease he said it's just a season of it brother well he's gone and I've been in the same Revival I've been in the same Revival for 20 years now almost 20 years now and it ain't left me one time cuz I tell you it's kind of like that little stream that brother Brandon would talk about what makes you so happy let me tell you church let me tell you Church coming to church is one of the greatest things I ever done in my life but it didn't start here it started in my truck it started in my house it started beside my bed I've been drinking from my Fountain and ain't running dry let me tell you there is unlimited resource on it Hallelujah I was reading a little bit of article and I promise you I'm done I I promise you I'm done cuz I ain't even I ain't even preach my message I ain't preaching my message I'm just preaching by inspiration I hope you're okay with that tonight but that's that's honestly I was reading a little I was reading a article that the that the Earth pulls on 40 million metric tons of water every year pulls on 40 metric tons of water every year and job said that God hangs the world on nothing now that's it's like 14 quadrillion trillions and 18 zeros behind it I don't know if that's exactly right ask one of these teachers they'll probably be able to tell you but job said God hangs the world on nothing and it takes on 40 metric tons of water every year and he hangs it on nothing surely he can take you and he control your little world it can control your crisis he can control your problems God bless you God bless you hallelujah how big is your problem and how big are you going to ask you're drinking from the same source that I'm drinking from you're drinking from the same power that I'm drinking from and I believe maybe if you don't believe maybe you can take my faith just for a minute I believe for you I believe that all things are possible I believe that if you're wanting to see a miracle and maybe you ain't got the faith to attain it just yet take my faith take my faith take the right mental attitude towards any God's promises and he'll bring it to pass let the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother and Randall you got the words that
