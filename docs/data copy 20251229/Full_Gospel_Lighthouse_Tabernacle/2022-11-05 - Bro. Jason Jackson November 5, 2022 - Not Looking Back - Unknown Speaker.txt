anoint me to get myself out of the way Lord and we'll be careful to give you the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints say amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen I just want to say it's uh been a great weekend already and we ain't even had Church hardly yet and uh I told Andrew one of those you just sing all night but you know I'll be happy back there just worshiping the Lord and and certainly thankful for all the hospitality for brother Ron and sister Connie and sister Katie and brother Andrew and and all those that have been partakers in that may God bless you and and we love you in the Lord and we've been coming here now for quite a number of years we was trying to figure it up while ago I don't know 14 15 years something like that and you know I've seen some of you grow up and I've seen some of you grow gray but but nevertheless we're here together and you've watched me go bald and gray so uh you can't say a whole lot for that but we're just thankful to be part of the body of Christ tonight and trust and good to see you good to see you brother Chris and Sister Mary Sister Mary used to go to our church back a long time ago so I probably know her longer than anybody else in this room so we grew up together as kids in the same church and and you know what we're still pressing for the same goal and that's to get out of here in a Rapture and in a body change but we can't go in this thing I don't want to leave here like I am now I want a brand new body something that you know what I can run in heaven and the knees won't hurt I take off running right now I might need a stretcher but I get over there it won't be no need for a stretcher amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening turn with me to Philippians chapter 3. foreign Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind so whatever happened back there forget it forget all your past don't go back and dwell on your past you can give testimony how God brought you forward but don't go back and live in the past but reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus God bless you this evening you can be seated hmm and I want to just take for a thought tonight if the Lord will help us on Not Looking Back God designed us so that we could look all around us but he placed your eyes in the front of your head and not the back of your head you're not like a frog tonight you don't look backwards we're looking forward and I've been a believer in His Garment doesn't have armor on the back of him that's what your brother behind you is for is to protect your back but we are Marching forward as the body of Christ we're not looking behind National Science scientists don't look back today at what some scientists said 300 years ago when they believed that you couldn't go over 35 miles an hour you would leave Earth because now you know that's obsolete because people travel in a couple of hundred miles an hour now and they keep pressing on and they don't stop they're always trying to break another barrier so science always points forward brother Brown said in one place he said if we're not careful scientists is going to find God before man so we don't want that to be us we want to keep looking forward says this he goes you know sometimes looking back we look back to see what Vinnie say say what Moody say and they're fine men but so was Moses and Joseph and that was another age now it's not that they didn't have some good things that they preached and they didn't have some truths of their day but this is an age of a different message and this message wouldn't have worked in their day and their message won't work in this day this is a new word we're going forward so if you want to know what he said look in the word what he said for your hour look in the scripture let's see what he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we know that so then if his word is still yet was good then his word is good tonight [Applause] if he ever healed one then he'll heal another one tonight if he ever gave the Holy Ghost then he's obligated to give it tonight whatever your need is he's obligated to supply it we can look around and look at the churches that's gone on and the day's gone by and if we're not careful we'll be living in a glare instead of the light and we're looking at something that's passed I heard a man preach years ago when I was a kid and he made this statement he said if you're not looking where you're going you'll be going where you're looking if you're going this way and you're looking that way you're going that way you'll eventually Veer off the path but we ain't here to Veer off the path we're here to stick with a message of the hour for this is what will put you in a body change [Applause] Glory you drive down the road and look in your rearview mirror you're gonna wreck I can barely drive going forward anyhow he ain't Rogue with me much foreign you can't look behind you you're looking in front of you if you're looking behind you you'll be going that way eventually you'll Veer off the path and want to go backwards listen but I ain't here to to compromise and go backwards I'm not here to give up on this message and say well maybe some other church has got something greater let me just tell you there is nothing greater than this message this message will Rapture you it will change you it will change your desires if this message won't change people and keep them run me out of the country and never let me back here again but I'm here to tell you tonight I bet you anything in the world this message will keep you change you change your desires [Applause] foreign [Applause] this is a changing word it transforms you it does not conform you it transforms you but now you know you take the natural side of that when people get older they all of a sudden want to look younger and when you're younger you want to look older you don't really want to look older you might think you do but once you get older you're like man I wish I was 20 again huh it's coming to you and let me tell you something sister all the Botox in the world won't make you 16 years old again it'll just empty your pocketbook cost you a lot of money and you'll only look good for a season still yet but beauty is not on the outside that God's looking at God don't take his church and pump him up with a bunch of Botox so to speak and pump them up with everything of The World God takes his church and fills up with the word and the word then becomes expressed on the outside of the people [Applause] and when that happens when you heard that word actually expressed itself on the outside of the people you ain't got to preach all the time [Music] oh don't cut your hair don't wear your pants don't somewhere another you gotta grow up I realize everybody's on different stages and ministers have to minister in different areas for different things but as a majority of us we've been in the message long enough how many's been in the message five years or older over okay about 95 of you we have no excuse if you ain't been in a message at long you might have a reason but if you've been in a message 5 10 15 20 years you'll have no excuse not to know what the message says you have 1205 sermons you have on I'm telling how many books you can read the word you can dig in the word and you can become the word I can't give you a revelation that ain't in here [Applause] Jesus said you must be born again and Paul says in other words we're going to look forward we're going to forget what's in the past we all got to pass and maybe you were born in church put your bubble gum under the pews cut your teeth on the church pews I used to say we don't have pews anymore we have chairs don't gnaw on the nylon or the material you know it's not as easy as wood on your you know hit mess it up a little bit people can notice it more I remember sitting in church Sister Mary you remember this our church pews were old old pews way older than our church because we were poor in Arkansas we couldn't afford any other pews and if you put your hand under the edge there wasn't very many pews in the church or very many spots you couldn't find bubble gum I don't know what church they got that out of but they like gum why but we're grown up we're not cutting our teeth now on the Pew anymore listen we're up we ought to we ought to be up here experiencing the great things of God experiencing the Revival of the word that God has said into your heart and say the man-made Revival that God sent but it was the word that was restored that causes you to Rejoice that causes you to change so message of the hour usually a church gets mixed up he said and everything till when it comes time for the word to be fulfilled they're looking back at something else what was it like at Azusa Street I'm not living at azuzu Street that was a message for that day I'm living over here in the bright age I'm living here in the Rapture age I'm hearing the word age where it's time for me to take a change I get a change by going backwards and looking at the age before or before or before we appreciate those ages they all had partial truth but why in the world would you want to go back digging in something for personal truth when you had all the truth why do I want to go back I'll try to get that I'll try to behave your live stream now so you know I try to behave it won't matter okay if something tries to Sidetrack you and take you off the revealed word of the hour and point you back to another time watch it because that's the rear view mirror and you're gonna wreck soon because God wait listen when Wesley when Luther came up and had his life and then Wesley come up to there became wrecks brother I said you turned the corner and every time you turn the corner there's trouble there was trouble in Luther and Wesley's time there was trouble in Wesleyan Pentecostal time and there was trouble in this time when people left Pentecost and coming to the message because this message isn't Pentecostal denomination this message is the word being revealed in its power it doesn't do away with all the blessings of God but the thing is is now you got more you got what they had plus the truth you got more God just gives more and more and more Apostle Paul couldn't come and change his revelation he could only add to it and God ain't going to change his Revelation about this message this message has come in his fullness now it's just now that we're understanding parts of it it's been laid in there for 55 60 years now we're just understanding some things but it's always been there but it wasn't the hour of manifestation yet but in the hour of manifestation the bride begins to rejoice in it you grow in it man you don't want to go backwards all their stuff was fine in their day but we ain't in their day seats not over the shop brother says this neither will a Christian eat on that dead carrians from the old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour God promised rabbits in the days of Luther and he promised other things in the days of others would you just go to a mill now if you're on a diet that's another story you go to a meal and a Mill's been prepared it's a seven course meal and you say oh they won't wrap it I don't want no vegetables I don't want no starches because I'm on Atkins or whatever and so you know but if you're just you're looking at it you don't want certain things but now in this day God promised you a seven course menu meal cause all the seals have been revealed and ready for those who can receive it so that when you receive the meal you're eating of everything that God has placed in there down through seven ages and all the Seven Seals that's been revealed he's opened them up and you are partaking of the book why do you want to go back to Luther's day when there's only rabbits on the table yeah guys we got it all no need to just going back and choosing one thing we get our Traditions wrapped up and you know what those all right for that day but Jesus said you search the scriptures see what's promised for your dead see what's in there trying to see what was in his day see the type of horse rider that went out in his day went to meet him exactly with the cunniness of man Reformation but this ain't the day of reformation this is the hour of restoration this is the hour when the word has been restored and when the world's been restored that in itself should make you rejoice foreign I like good music and I like shouting and I like praising the Lord but when the word comes forth that's your meat that's the meat of the word and that right there brother said after the service after the word has gone forth It's really the time to worship you've just plowed up the ground brother Andrew did get ready for the seed to come forth and when the word comes forth then he comes back and Waters it with his spirit and that's why when the word Goes Forth in his power and demonstration lives are changed it's a process search some scriptures well where are we living at them brother at the coming of the Lord Jesus we're living at the very hour he could come at any moment and now you're all in trouble I forgot to hit my timer I have no clue how long I've been preaching already so I'm not going to worry about it you got an extra hour of sleep in the morning we didn't come here to operate my clocks we come here to operate by the spirit [Applause] I'm not long-winded normally so you can rest cities but you know what if he comes by we don't care see because we're not going to look back to some other year ago yeah you know he was too long back there what you're going to remember is what you take away and if somebody gets saved and somebody gets delivered and somebody receives the Holy Ghost that's what you need to take away from a service his lives were changed forever it's not just a putter this word lives we're not going back into history but we're in the writing writing but we're in the last moments of the world foreign writing history books he said won't be nobody here to read them bombs were fixing to fall well Justin don't scare me like that it don't scare me Russia having a bomb don't scare me Russia's threatening Obama America don't scare me Russia threatened to bomb America or to make you happy but brother listen I love my country I do too but this country's gotten rotten and it's turned us back on God and the only thing for us to do is leave here this world is not your home you're not destined to be an American you're destined to be the wife [Applause] Hallelujah they're already trying to shut it down try to shut the gospel down for just somebody not you know they're not trying to shut us down but they're trying to shut the Gospel Light off everywhere they go the nominations now allow whoever to preach they want to preach it don't matter if you're a trans or whatever they ordain you to preach they can ordain you all you want but the word don't ordain you and what the word says is truth and that's what we gotta stand on I'm not going backwards and it's compromising with a bunch of churches that want to take us backwards brother Jason this is my four no more I don't been in that system I ain't going back to that I don't been there where they told me there was only about four or five preachers that could preach the word I don't believe that God has men all around this message all around this world that preached the gospel it has power you can't limit God well brother we just don't have to listen to you oh yes true you don't but if you're in here tonight you get to you're not streaming me and you that's sitting here so you get to hear me so we just trust that something be said that encourages you the word's always right right look at when the two angels went down the Sodom let's look at lot and his wife just for a moment two angels go down to Sodom and they they show up at lot's house and lot let them in and it ain't long a bunch of men's knocking on the door who you got in there isn't that we've seen a couple of men come in the age we're living in well nothing nice trying to get to the angels and lot actually went outside and said take my virtuous daughters and do with them as you please what a state he'd Fallen to instead of saying get out of here and having a Godly backbone he had done coward down to give him his own daughters I think my daughters do with them as you please and the angel said I'll tell you what you're going to have to do lot you're gonna have to go to your son-in-law's you're gonna have to tell them we're leaving we're not staying here but we're leaving foreign well brother lot goes mayor a lot has been called is he goes to his son-in-law's and he says well you know what boys I got two men in my house that says they're going to destroy the city with fire and brimstone and we gotta leave and the two son-in-laws said we don't believe that message that's what they said we're not leaving so in other words they're saying we don't believe God sends Messengers we just don't believe it so he goes back to lot and he says now Lord take you and your wife and your two daughters your two virtuous daughters that's in your house and take them and get out and escape to the mountains and don't look behind you one simple phrase don't look back it's pretty simple sounds like and they get out there and lot begins bargaining with the angels don't send me to the mountains something will eat me up there let me go down to this little town it's a little town isn't it yeah it's a little town we'll go on down there then because lot was afraid to go to the mountains so he Bargains with the angels and they permitted him to do that that's what the Bible tells us but the key was get out of here and don't look back listen they were our example Abraham and Lauder and the word said don't look back so you will never get away from this as long as you win this life you're always going to hear these words don't look back don't look back don't look back Hebrews chapter 11 said these men are our examples they're a great cloud of witnesses around this so let us lay aside every week that does so easily beset us and let us run what are we gonna run a race you can't run a race in reverse you can only run a race going forward listen you're going around this track of life [Applause] good bad ugly everybody's tracks different we don't all get to say how we want it to go but here's the thing I want you to remember when somebody comes up and tells you and preach and tells you it doesn't matter if you you don't have to do it exactly that way brother Brian I'm or Paul or whoever didn't really mean it exactly that way that ought to be a red flag to you because Paul said don't let nobody change it or let him be a curse and the prophet said I preach what Paul preached so if somebody comes trying to turn you away from the Vindicated word leave them look at them and say I love your sister I love you brother but you ain't turning me back to what God brought me out of God brought me out of the world I ain't going back to the world God gave you the Holy Ghost you sure enough don't want to say God I don't want that Holy Ghost [Applause] some people don't want to get it because of the way I'll make them Act because sometimes they make you do things you don't want to do brother Jason y'all just get too excited scream too much where's Ali years ago she said why do you have to scream scream she's my buddy though I'm not I've had people at home go man and I'm not meaning to scream I'm meaning to get something to you this word lives and there ain't nothing out there worth treating this for there ain't no party there ain't no Honky Tonk there ain't no bar room you've ever been in that's ever better than what you're feeling right here tonight when the Holy Ghost comes by your way it will stimulate you it'll give you revelation brother Brown said I'm so glad that a man can be so drunk on the Holy Ghost till he's drunk every day of his life that don't mean he's always staggering cause you can be in the dumps and be drunk there's been days you've been down but you still drunk I remember sending a picture when they were doing the gamma knife radiation all those big things on his head but he's still drunk he was so drunk until there was a room full of people that emptied out and there was one man left and he said what do you need I'll just paraphrase this in other words brother Gabe said what you got that's the point of it I need what you got you can get it right here in a hospital room and let me tell you something thank God you ain't look back young man you keep pressing the battle there ain't nothing back there worth this right here there's nothing back there we're losing what God's already brought you through what he's already done for you don't give it up oh yeah devil will try to entice you let me just tell you what Jesus said remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife all she did was looked over her shoulder that's all she done one word she disobeyed one word that she knew better but the prophet said she had a more of a right to look back than what you got because she had screaming grandchildren down there burning up in a fire doesn't make any mother want to turn her and look back but you ain't got grandchildren burning in a fire not yet anyhow so the thing for you to do is press on press forward forget the things that's behind Lord you know my children out there in sin I give them to you I claim them in the name of Jesus I'm marching forward I ain't turning back I'm not going to go back and I'm not gonna go compromise with my kids and sin I'm going to preach the same gospel her heart was broken she turned and looked back once you go to looking back from the word excuse me it's been restored to you you'll miss where the spirit's leading you at today we've turned the corner in the Rapture message brother I'm says we're at a corner leadership two days later he goes we turn the corner in two days time he finished the corner and in a couple more days he's gone because it took a real master builder anybody can lay a wall but it took a master builder to turn the corner and when he turned that corner if I could just give you this illustration you could see it let me do it like this come hold this microphone I can't preach and draw too justification sanctification right Pentecost he said gifts restored all right now we're at a corner and he said we've turned the corner and we're looking towards heaven we're looking up We're Not Looking Back we're not looking to the right we're not looking to the left they can't we're looking upward listen he's coming back like he said and The Church Must Be resurrected soon and be ready to go so our eyes are on Glory my eyes ain't on this world and what this world has to offer because they don't have nothing to offer all right just so now I'm going to read something to you who means ever been tempted to go back and do things that you used to do just be honest you can all be honest because I got a quote says you all have I'm not going to try to trick you I'll just tell you from we've all did it all right we're sometimes tempted to go back many of you tempted to go back to the domination go back and take up because of the world says what denomination you belong to what church you affiliated with we're tempted to do that all of us are our sisters are tempted to go back go back and join up with some of the rest of the churches some of the assemblies some of the Church of Gods or some of them still be Pentecostal but they let you cut your hair and you dress any way you want to you're tempted to do that to go back to be popular in this wicked generation that we're living with you're tempted and he goes on and says and the major sin of our day is worldliness escalator of sin age she's rich Needham has a need of nothing and don't know that she's naked wretched miserable blind that's the center of our day and when you hear the word of God call out against it then you take the other route you're unpopular with the world and you're tempted sometimes he said to go back you're in the path of Duty walking along serving God and the devil tempts you when you just like to go back not really the devil might try to put those thoughts there but if you stop and entertain them there's where you're gonna get in trouble you'll end up like Nelly Sanders did that time remember her she was the best dancer her and Leo was in the country and she got there and and you know what she come to brother bam she come down the altar one night she just come in the back door stumbled down the hill altar brother random I need Jesus he said Nelly he's right here all you got to do is accept him on the basis of the word she accepted him she prayed through she got up she rejoiced but about six months later she's walking down Spring Street and she heard by the music call and she heard that old music going again well Jason I never would have stopped okay let me just see how self-righteous you are have you ever been in a restaurant and I saw him come on Mr listen do now how many is Holy without God we're all lost of course the devil gets in your memory and takes you back to when you used to listen to country music or rock and roll or whatever it was and that song will stay in your mind all day and you'll catch yourself throughout the day humming and you're like what in the book cause that memory part's still there see the Soul's been cleansed but the memory Still Remains he don't necessarily wash your memory clean he washes your soul clean because we're still humans and we'll still make mistakes I never really was well I just walk up on the steps and listen just a little bit maybe I get a chance to witness to somebody she's on the devil's territory but she goes up there and the next thing she finds herself in the arms of a man dancing on the floor again and she comes to herself and she runs to the place where she knew she could get help [Music] cab door shuts brother branham's babysitting I say babysitting but adult sitting a buddy of his named William blessglow he's a drunk and brother Brandon rescued him that night Gabe so you wouldn't pick him up or somebody in your in your Workforce that's why he took him home put him in the bed Wayne why do you do these things oh Don't Preach to me Bill wasn't long enough comes knocking on the door he goes to the door it's Nelly brother right now I'm lost I don't know what's happened I'm done he goes what's wrong Nelly you're having a heart attack no what's the matter until she tells him the story he said Nelly you just messed up when you stopped to listen he said now I hadn't been preaching but about a year he said but I said I believe there's something in the Bible that says in the name of Jesus they shall cast out devils so he starts praying he goes now Satan whoever you are you have no right to my sister and he said God is my witness the screen store started shutting and slamming and they said what's that he said I have no idea but he kept praying and he said in the name of Jesus Christ leave this woman and when that demon come out of her like a bat with long hair went over behind the bed Wayne went out of the bed he got sober all of a sudden he jumped out of the bed his mama shook the sheets but you know what Nelly was restored now they just made a mistake she wasn't lost she just got sidetracked and when you're right in the line of duty and an obstacle sometimes to lay in your way like it did to children of Israel when they got ready to cross the Red Sea and you know what they started to look back we'd have been better off in Egypt oh no no I'm not better off in Egypt I don't want to go back to Egypt I'm not going back to Egypt and God began to work on Moses and he tells Moses fear struck the people and what they wanted they didn't know what to do and brothers says this because that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they're writing the path to duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light key number one Heaven fellowship with God key number two with his people key number three and the Holy Spirit is upon you four things and you mean an obstacle five things God's grace is going to be sufficient and you mean an obstacle right in the path of Duty don't stop keep pressing on press into the mark of a hot calling remember keep pressing on God Will Make A Way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see God when I can't get over it I can't get under it I can't get around that God makes a way through it somehow another his grace is sufficient so when you're in the bath and you're doing all the things God told you to do you're following the word you stand up and watch it open up you don't turn back and quit then I don't have to tell you what this man's been through but has he turned back you can write a book this slick on all the things he has been through and he never turned back and he never quit following the message and he never quit serving God and even though he was weak many times he still yet knew in whom he had believed and that's why he's sitting here tonight is cause he didn't turn back he didn't quit trying he didn't quit believing and you can't quit trying you can't quit believing you got to press on little bride press the battle don't quit things get tough don't quit then Press On you look back we don't want to be identified as frogs three unclean spirits went out of them we want to keep pressing through the anointed word of the hour because the devil's got a false anoint him one and he tries to Sidetrack us with it you know brother Ram said it would be so close the Bible tells us still to see the very elect so then it's not some nominal group going to deceive you as somebody Among Us trying brother man said so much like the real till he even said it was a Pentecostal movement like the real and a Pentecostal Spirit like for real so the devil's you know what you say well Brothers yes I'm having a great time in God the devil's sat there beside you every Revival produces twins you just gotta know which one you are and if you stay with this word you know which one you are you're identified in this word and this word will be your breath it'll be your life it'll be your everyday everyday meat it'll be more to you than life itself when this word is Vindicated don't leave it it'll keep you when everything else is Fallen huh it'll keep you but the devil going to try to take you back well brother Jason you know I one time you know I had a guy he was my neighbor of mine I may have told this here before but he come to me one day and he said actually I went to his house I was visiting about something and he says you don't believe in the initial evidence do you are not like him he said what do you think it is I said well for one let me see your life see if your life lines up with the word he says are you saying I ain't got it I said I didn't say that I mean he was living with a woman that wasn't even his wife and wanting to tell me he had the initial evidence listen church I'll tell you the evidence and Prophet said the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being able to say Amen to every word of God not just with lips only but with your life and if your life can say Amen to it and line up to it you Hey listen there ain't no better evidence than that [Applause] we love all the things that come with it we love the rejoice in the worship the and this is part of the blessings of God that he gives us and anybody in their right mind enjoys it if you don't enjoy it something's wrong brother Jason I think we should all come to church quite as a church mouse well even the church mouse squeaks every once in a while anyhow didn't mean to go there huh foreign we're not looking for a false we're looking for the real the false is here but we're thrill we're not interested in somebody's made-up thing we're looking for what the word produces you want a word Revival it's here but you have to step into it and become it and believe it whatever you do don't look back to something outside of the Vindicated word stay in it Ruth don't leave the field stay in it and when she found the man she was looking for he stayed in the field she wasn't going back Naomi said Ruth why don't you go back with or if I can go back oh no no no no no your people Gonna Be My People your God's Gonna Be My God were you down though where your church is that should be my church your people your Prophet whatever you have I want it to be mine he finds boaz's field and she rests when she goes to the threshing floor he only says now he's a near Kinsman but here's what you got to do you gotta go to the threshing floor and you got to lay at his feet and when you get at his feet you just stay there he'll find you there [Applause] you just stay there thank you stay there because gradually eventually he's going to wake up and he's going to say who's at my feet I'm Ruth you're my near Kinsman oh Hallelujah he says I will pay the price of your Redemption and she rested on that and this bride is at the feet of the Lord Jesus and we're resting on that and the prophet said I preached what Paul preached and me and scream I'm resting on that [Applause] keep walking in the path of Duty brother makes a statement in Oneness he says a real true servant and feel humble and feel stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty but if he's off the path to duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him knowing he's just a man or a woman he's obligated to that person excuse me as long as they're in the path of Duty as long as you're walking in the light worshiping God in the light and you make a mistake like Nelly get back up humble yourself come back to church don't quit Church presentation but the preachers are all mad at me and they'll listen don't listen to The Devil he's lying to you that's just a lie of the enemy nobody here hates one another we're in this thing together [Applause] we're trying to get out of here in a rapture thank you we're here to defeat the Devil don't stop and look back you keep marching forward in the path of Duty you just remember this eternity hinges on this word and if eternity hinges on it you can hinge on it and you can rest assured this word ain't going nowhere this word is perfect it don't need no interpreter it don't need you to tell me what it says I don't need to have to tell you what it says you know what it says you know when God's speaking to you you know when the words going for it God's deserting you you know that I don't have to tell you you already know long as you're in that line of duty and keeping God's word if you say to this mountain but if I quit and I look back I lose that Authority but as long as I'm in the line of duty I can say to this mountain be thou removed and don't doubt but believe it with all my heart and I can have what I ask for program said sometimes we're just afraid to use it we get to the place we're afraid he won't keep his word he will keep his word cause he said he would Hallelujah that ought to be good enough God said he'd keep his word he'll keep his word I was telling the brother's day we have a sister at church she she was there to message of the future home and brother Branham calls her out she's the second lady her name's Mrs Alexander and brother Brahm calls her out and he says you have you've been praying and she had prayed but she was also thinking Lord let this man hurry up because I'm smothering because it was so hot in there but God never mentioned that he said you're praying you live at a certain address up by Chicago you have a thyroid condition you're healed and you know what she couldn't have any more children she had three more now I'll let the church with her today you know why because God's still a Healer but you got to keep the word years later probably about 10 years ago she she had to go back on thyroid medicine she's sitting in her living room one day and the Lord spoke to her and he said didn't I heal you of this once before she said yeah you did Lord and she took the pills and threw them away and her thyroid has been perfect ever since [Applause] if you say you're in the line of duty you ain't looking back you're looking forward I'm going to read this quote I don't have a clue how long I've been here but he says now you Christian tonight you're in a line of duty you're trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer grabbed you death grabs you a cancer TB whatever it is in the line of duty you have the same right that Peter had what was that brother Jason Lord save me lest I perish in desperation he called out and hand reached and picked him up you have the same thing but he screamed out Lord Save Me Lord he heard my despairing cry and from the waters Lifted Me Now safe am I that's what it is when you cry out Lord save me God has looked back but saved me God I failed you but save me [Applause] and he says Lord maybe this woman or whoever it is this grandson or nephew cried out an inspiring God heard then we find out that in Sinking God heard him he failed no matter if you fail but you don't have nothing to do with it we all fail we're a failure to begin with but somebody's standing now with a strong hand that can reach down his hand for you and when you make mistakes his arm is there he's not going to let you fall he said Lord these handkerchiefs I got my hands laid on but sick and afflicted Satan has crossed their line and is hindering them in the line of duty Satan crossed your line and hindering you in the path of Duty let the power that raised up the Lord who's present now come upon these handkerchiefs and whoever they touch May the devil get scared oh don't worry devil gets scared while he looks down through the blood of Jesus Christ and may every one of them be healed and continue on their path of Duty granted Lord and anytime the Devil comes at you and you're an apothe Duty you have a right to tell the devil I'm in the path of Duty I'm Not Looking Back I'm not giving in I'm not quitting this message I'm not going to go back out to the world God's done done too much for me how can I go back and serve the devil when God gave his life his only son for me why would I ever want to go back foreign brother Jason man you don't get popular preaching against sin I didn't get called to be popular we got called to be Warriors we got called to be Fighters we got called to press the battle we got Paul to forget the things behind us and pressed her to mark of a high calling and try to get you to press with us because we don't plan on leaving the hoof behind there ain't a person in my home church that I want to leave behind I don't care what they said about me they might not said anything but if they did I don't care I don't care how they acted against me they're still my responsibility God has given you a responsibility as a pastor or whatever your position is and you have to be faithful to it not give up but you know I heard

thrilled over the top to have these two brothers combined to be a part of this meeting but last time brother Jason and brother Danny were here together in my in my understanding in a meeting it was when brother Danny was speaking at our Labor Day meeting when you remember brother Danny's Voice went out and he was trying to get brother Homer to say what he was saying and trying to get him to go but brother Homer couldn't hear what he was saying so he started whispering it to brother Jackson and four and all the fire got a hold of brother Jackson he started preaching away there were people that got saved and filled with the holy ghost in a meeting like that and I believe that tonight this weekend that the same Holy Ghost is here to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think according to the power that works within us so we want to remind you to be praying for brother Danny in the morning come expecting in the morning remember to roll your your clocks back we roll back we'll give you an extra hour of sleep we'll take it away from you in the spring but God bless you God bless you as you go tonight aren't you thankful for what he's done for us amen God bless
