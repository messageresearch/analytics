praying amen thank god for doctors that can help us through some very difficult times and so amen i'd like for the great doctor to touch me i i'm just extremely dizzy this morning so if i just stand still a bit you'll understand why so good to see you hey we love you with all of our hearts and so glad to have brother thomas back with us and and he's sitting in the back there and doing much better and i tell you what this copic business is a bad deal and so amen just uh thankful that that if you get sick go to the doctor go go to the hospital go you get sick it's not a play it's not not a game amen we're we're praying for brother keith's family keith turner that passed this week with with covid and uh you know it's more than being political more than whether you get your shot or not or you get sick this is the real deal amen this is a plague there's more coming but we got to get through it and we're not scared of it but if you get sick go to the doctor understand that i i'm not going to get into the politics of masks and shots and all that kind of business and but we believe in prayer we absolutely believe in prayer and i i was just thinking as thomas was sitting beside me there just a few moments ago i was thinking i'm so thrilled to have him sitting in my office and and not not a not in a tomb not in a tomb and he said one night he just prayed it was a thirsty and he just prayed and he just they just knew he was going to die and he said all i could do was pray amen thank god that god hears thank god it god hears and so we're just so thankful for what he is doing so many that are sick and want to remember them in prayer they prayed for a friend of mine this morning billy owens he was a i i don't think he's ever been here but he's just been a precious friend of mine they're actually transporting him right now from giles to uva he has a brain bleed it's very serious condition i don't think he i don't think he can talk but he's tr but he is uh but he is uh able to function to text and and so i just text him just a moment ago just before just to let him to know that we were going to have prayer for him prayer works there's a lady from brother biskell she's a precious sister i've known him for i've known her for many many years she sent me a wonderful letter and i'm not going to take the time to read it but she sent me a wonderful letter she felt led to to buy this tie for me and then send it to the men's prayer meeting and on a friday night they prayed for it and she sent it to me and so today i'm wearing it and i just sent brother tom a message that i am wearing the tie that you guys prayed for today so may god heal my body as i preach the word amen so we want to we want to we want to thank them sister margaret is a precious person and she actually in that letter talks about two different prayer lines that she was in and god just touched the very needs of her heart amen so we want to remember her as well deep on my heart today is the churches of ukraine and uh we're you know we have a lot of believers that are in the ukraine actually brother biscuit is of ukrainian descent and uh they're they're precious people just really precious people i've been able to keep in contact with brother robert fisher that was here and he's in poland and he's keeping in contact with the ukrainian people and so i would like for you to remember them in prayer we realize that prophecy is going to be fulfilled the same the same words that come for them come for us and we believe before one great big bomb is dropped we'll be gone in the rapture and so many of those people are already on the move to leave ukraine and so let's just pray for them that god would just have them when you hear these political things happening you realize they're only rattling the saber they're only rattling the saber and uh and and russia and china and and those countries will fulfill they will fulfill as much as much as our nation and donald trump placed jerusalem as a as the the capital of israel and israel came back in as a nation god's going to have a bride god's going to have a bride and i i just was looking at some things this morning four different prophets in the old testament talked about how the jerusalem would be the capital of israel and here we had a had a uh a president come in this election it's not about republican and democrat god's got a job to do and you move that move that and you think well all of the other presidents didn't do it but this one did well you see the prophecy has to be fulfilled and so we are at the time and i believe i'm preaching to a group of people and i want to speak to you this morning god has not brought us here for us to lose the battle hallelujah i love you with all of my hearts and and we want to remember them in prayer maybe you have a need on your heart this morning that you would just like to say would you just remember me brother ron amen amen i want you to take your neighbor by the hand or man man to man or sister to sister husband to wife whatever and let's just pray let's just pray almighty god how we love you today our thoughts are in the process of could we be in the last services before the coming of the lord somewhere noah gave his last sermon somewhere joshua preached his last sermon somewhere our messenger stood and speaking leadership and then communion lord now may our hearts be prepared for our last service god it is you that gives us strength to stand in this pulpit lord i ask you to send your word to brother joe and heal his body as he sits in this audience today the same god that's in this building that stood in audiences all over the world and called men by name their situations their post office boxes and told them their condition what the doctor had said you're the same god and i ask you today as we said in this service may healing sweep across this audience may a refreshing of the holy ghost feel our vessels dear god with all like never before may we be found full oh god fill our vessels with the holy ghost lord minister to us today i ask you to touch my own body today i believe you're the healer i stand here to black the devil's eye one more time cancer does not have control in the name of jesus christ i ask you now lord may this dizziness leave my body may it leave father in jesus name lord my precious friend billy owens who have been instrumental to lead him to the lord i ask you now that you would be with him may you touch his body lord whatever the surgeons are to do today or tomorrow i ask your father that you would preserve his life touch his family oh god and lord while we're standing here may you show mercy to those that are lost while they're still hours of mercy that door is not closed stir their hearts like never before in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen he's here he's here if you will turn with me to first samuel chapter 17 and verse 17. amen thank you for the songs and amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts so good to have brother joe and his wife with us from from ohio and uh amen making some thoughts about coming here to be a part of you and so so we're we're certainly thrilled to have them with us and made their journey be blessed and watch over them so good to have each and every one of you amen i'd like to speak to you something the lord spoke to me the other morning about two weeks ago i was putting wood in my in my wood stove and as i was putting it in an audible voice sometimes it's an impression in your heart but an audible voice spoke to me and it just took me i actually wrote it down very quickly so i made sure that i got it right and uh i'm going to share with you this morning my thoughts from these things he has sent not sent me to this battle to lose this battle so we're going to talk about more than cancer we're going to talk about rapture we're going to talk about laodicea he's not sent you to this battle for you to lose to this battle is that all right amen and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephon and a parchment of corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look now thy brethren fair look how my brethren fair and take their pledge now saul and they and all the men of jerusalem were in the valley of elah fighting with philistines and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded and he commanded and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to fight and shouted for the battle for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army and david left his carriage and the hand of of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name how the armies of the philistines spake according to the words to the to the same words and david heard them and that's quite a big statement and david heard them goliath would have been incredibly in good shape but david heard them and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and and were sore afraid and the men of israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy israel is come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his make his father's house free in israel and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel who is this uncircumcising that he should defy the armies of the living god you may be seated this morning david's arrival was a very bad thing for for goliath your arrival to this end time age is a very bad time thing for this satan's eden condition you're the people that are bone of this bone life of his life and power of his power you're more than the words that were in sermons that were preached from 1947 to 1965 you're more than just quotations you're more than just just good powerful good powerful lyrics of the message but you are the physical attributes of god that god thought of before the foundation of the world and he knew to send you to this hour i want you to think about that this is your battle and david was sent to this battle god in his great orchestration knew exactly who to sin they had a backslidden king they had rejected they had the sons of kish that was there they had all their fine intellectual condition but that wouldn't defeat goliath you can have all your intellectualism you can have the intellectualism of the message but you got to have a holy ghost inside of you that same god that lived here 2 000 years ago that worked in the prophet of god that stood here night after night defeating the devil that's the same god that wants to live inside of you and accept the challenge of this hour [Music] are you with me now our god reigns our god has never lost the battle i wonder how disappointed the devil felt when he didn't get the body of moses even in the scriptures of jude there's still a disruption in an argument going on about the body of moses i want to send him a warning he's about to feel the same way again there's a tens of thousands times thousands times thousands of us around the world that is not going to get our bodies [Applause] our bodies are not going to go to the grave we are the alive and remain group and we're standing here victorious victorious with the message proclaiming it loud and strong we have not been sent to this battle to lose this battle i imagine as the reports will go back to hell them people that you sent us to torment today they're gone i want that to just settle in because we're coming to that point there's armies just literally on a on just a almost a hair trigger ready to fight an army fight a battle and don't know that the fulfillment of the word of the hour is taking place when david stepped off of the off of the hillside that day none of his comrades went with him nobody else went with him sometimes people want to they want 10 000 people around them for security there's sometimes you've got to stand [Music] there's times in your home that you've got to say no that will not come in here we don't listen to that kind of music we don't dress that way you got to tell yourself that way you got to look himself in the mirror and say that don't work sometimes you've got to resist this laodicean spirit and push back brother joel just brought me a plaque of the man in the arena it's a favorite it's a favorite speech of mine and in the opening opening statement it said it's not the critic that counts there will always be observers on the sideline telling you how to do it they'll do it with their computer they'll do it with their iphones they'll do it with their their voices but they'll never get their hands dirty are you with me so many times if we're not careful we'll become spectators in church and expect a revival and not call for it ourselves we'll come to church and put nothing in and walk out of service wasn't that a dud you only get out of it what you put in [Music] david had been in preparation for this battle david had been taking care of sheep and when he comes to saul he begins to give him testimony about a lion and a bear who both represents kings and powers and god had gave him a lion and gave him a bear and he knew that the same god he wasn't able to do with his own human flesh but the same god was able to give him this uncircumcised philistine because the principle of his belief was his god was greater and his god was alive and all that god needed was somebody in his hand that god could use and he had surrendered himself into that hand oh god help us tonight hallelujah the scripture says our god is a law a mighty god who saves us over and over the lord yahweh rescues us from the ways of death many times and he will crush every enemy shattering them he will make heads roll for they refuse to repent of their stubborn sinful ways stupid devil ephesians chapter 6 tells us finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might and put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood and against principalities and against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places now notice all of this is happening now he tells you wherefore taken to you the whole armor the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand brother ron i haven't done nothing what you might say great you're still standing you haven't walked away you're still standing hallelujah paul would write this from a dungeon and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose and and for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified if god called david to do the job [Music] don't let the devil whisper in your ear full of doubt stand like you've never stood before god chose you not a president not a dictator not some hollywood star god chose you i like some things that andrew i liked everything andrew said but there were some things that andrew said last night about this reality nonsense that's in the world it's just like they have these singing they they try to solicit these singing stars to come up and they win this prize uh american idol that's the most damnable thing that could happen to that person what they don't realize they got a record label but they just sold their soul are you with me remember hollywood is satan's seat it's satan's seat and what it is is the inspiration from hollywood is from hell itself literally through your screens trying to defile the word of god by literally searing consciences of humanity and allowing the sodom and gomorrah h to be commonplace to where you don't resist it anymore to where crossdressing's okay i know you'll get quiet for a moment but women's been cross-dressing a long time they've been doing it a long time and they seared the conscience and that conscience as it is seared it becomes a gray area if you're not careful the spirit in you will become subdued to where you don't even call out against it anymore before long it becomes to a place to where that it's acceptable in your home listen two men two women will never be acceptable in the word of god you got to remember the reason why that god's going to destroy america he's going to destroy it because of the sodom condition and remember this it's not just america that's going to be destroyed for that that spirit is around the world and it's a spirit of death you didn't mind me killing goliath but but isn't that amazing how you get quiet when i start on that layout of seeing spirit i'm going to the scripture says all power sin heaven and earth is given into my hand go and i'll go with you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you tell the devil no to and bind him as you apply the token as you do things into your own life you got to just re-keep reapplying you just got to keep praying young people i want to say this my prayers are with you because you face it in your schools you face it in your textbooks the writers of the textbooks they're inspired from another dimension listen a first grader don't need to be learning about sex don't go stick your head in the sand now and say well you know that's another person's deal to do we're parents we got to rise up against those things [Applause] are you with me let's let men be real men women be real ladies sodom and gomorrah is everywhere what we are seeing today in our news and what we're seeing that's going on around us is the harvest of the seeds that have been sown weak pulpits weak pulpits that sold out for the money or popularity or denominational systems that place boundaries upon them to where that pulpit became bridled brother branham felt that bridle he felt them trying to stop him from telling women how they needed to dress or telling men how they needed to conduct themselves when he's preaching in future home and he spends the first 45 minutes to an hour on the conduct of people that will live in that new city it's important that conduct won't start when the rapture happens it's got to happen now and i believe you as this body of believers i you're you're real believers i don't have i don't i don't have a stone to throw in any of you but i want you to understand we represent this message we represent this word are you with me now and let me just say this to you this is our time this is our opportunity to live a kin kingdom life kingdom our kingdom is not of this world i love america i love i love her as a nation i love where i live i think we live in one of the most beautiful places in the world but let me just say this year this is not my home i'm only passing through the dimensions of hell and the dimensions of heaven are blending we can see men without any reason at all going into homes going into schools taking guns in our community here for those that are on the internet may not know this but in our community here we are grieving because of two precious officers who many of us knew were innocently taken their lives they had homes they had families they had great lives they were great men but some demon-possessed idiot from hell went to a school that's a bible-based school and begin to murder no you don't want me on your on your jury amen we hear it every day this one shot many multitudes shot this one ravaged this one taken away this child is gone amber alerts it makes me long to go to that land it makes me long to go to that place where there's no dying you see because of eve eat off of that tree of knowledge of good and evil it produced death every baby that dies every sickness this covet every situation listen that's not going to be in that eternal realm we are seeing the results of sin and sodom this is satan's eden i want you to remind you he's not some posh baby he is an enemy satan is an enemy that kills steals and destroys and he comes in innocently and he begins to grow up amongst you and before long he's bigger than you are before long he consumes your family before long he consumes your life many times innocent things destroy your marriage an innocent argument over nothing destroys relationships with children innocent things seemably happen and will destroy some of the best churches that there is because the devil is at work help me now help me now the devil is at work it's not your brother it's not your sister it is the devil at work so step off of the hill with a rock in your hand and say goliath you're coming down the earth is shaking volcanoes are going off we don't need another sign we'll not get another messenger sodom is here the conditions are here every biblical prophecy has taken place smart cars are everywhere uh we don't have to wait for that vision to be fulfilled women has done what they've done every one of those visions except for bombs dropping over america i don't want to be here for that people want to argue with brother brown i'm a prophet will you stay around long enough you'll become a believer they want to argue with noah was he a prophet or not just stay around long enough if you get to live long enough you'll see he was the real deal when jesus was hanging between heaven and hell i want you to just look at it just for a moment here stands two men hanging on a cross on either side justly they were justly there one recognizes jesus to be god himself the messiah and he says some precious words remember me remember we when you come into paradise let me just say when jesus said this day you'll speak be with me in paradise let's give i was giving great thought to that this week now i'm going to come home here in just a second what if they untied those men and let them down off of the cross one man will go right back to becoming a terrorist one man is going to go right back to his ways of wickedness but one man would become the pillar of a community and the church how many people sit on our pews today pews across the world and hear the message of the hour the word will change you one way or another don't tell me that you're not going to change one way or the other the word's going to move you in one direction maybe the enemy will only try to numb you not reject but numb you i just had a cancer burned off of my face and dr cropley put a spoon across my eye and then they they began to spray it and they sprayed it and sprayed it i didn't flinch he looked at me said you're one tough human being i said well i've had a lot of things done to this body he said generally we have people crying we have people hollering we have all different kind of reactions and i watched you you never even flinched well that's great but when i go to the dentist i get laughing gas i give them i get i actually ask for extra shots so that when they start dealing down getting down in my gums and pulling teeth or doing root canals i don't want to feel it it's due to the novocaine or the numbing that they put in there well brother ron uh i'm just tough well i just chose a long time ago sitting in a dentist chair is not a place for me to be the champion it's not the place for me to show how hero i am it's a good place for numbing i'm tough brother ron probably because you don't want to pay the bill and i've got news for you when you die naked you came into the world naked you're going to leave so i don't care what you accumulate in this life you ain't taking nothing with you [Applause] well i got 10 million dollars you count pennies you count pennies with god i was talking to somebody the other day and they were just kind of they were kind of talking to me about ties how difficult times was to pay and i said you know i'm amazed this is not a believer but i i'm amazed that people get all tore up about tithes and they've got their money in an ira and they just signed the bill the other day to where they're going to start taxing your ira accounts and your and your retirement now rather than wait until later listen it's already been signed thank you president are you with me so you you can put your wealth in a lot of different things i chose a long time ago where do you put yours [Applause] well that was another goliath that i just killed i don't know where you know it or not how many of you actually do have a critic in your life actually you have a critic you got a critic yeah some of you just plain not honest right now let me say it good old southern hospitality english how many of you got somebody just a burr in your saddle i knew i found you there's more details i could give you but burn the saddle is a good way to put it let me leave it there you got to remember that the critic they're listening this morning i'm going to actually applaud them the critic is the one that testifies you're the masterpiece why don't you just go ahead and smile right now so i want to publicly say thank you for being my critic give them a hand right now let's go ahead let's go [Applause] my ahead stupid death why are we are as america where we are we have lost our moral compass we've lost our moral compass and we don't know which way is up and which way is down and i want to give you the reason why we did that is we turned the message down amen you say well brother ron a lot of people don't know about brother brown let me let me just today is alden's birthday aldon is 53 years old can we get a camera on the alden real quick brother halden will you stand up now brother alden is the one seated he's standing beside of the seated brother josh but josh is still almost as tall as brother halvin's seated now it's not an accident that brother alden is here brother homer the founder of this church when he came to the message he stood against a lot of resistance it was not popular it's not popular now but it's not popular then and he stood and preached water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ that one god he preached this message with all of his heart and he did it with extreme passion and extreme power and and his legacy is is is outstanding today and he stands with generals brother vernon stood with brother homer with great opposition i want you to think about your choices just for a moment god led him to make that choice by election of a predestinated seed but still the humanity had to stand and feel the arrows but i'd like for brother vernon's family to stand family extended family i'd like all the frasers to stand the extended family and family thomas you don't have to stand you're good bacteria do you realize that you're a result of a choice somebody made thank you you're a pillar in a community i don't know i'm not gonna get done but i'm just gonna this is all right that's okay that'll teach the devil to make me dizzy i want you to think what if brother vernon would have chosen an easier way what if you would have chosen an easier way when people walk away from the message it don't take many generations to see that they fall off of a cliff and they do things that they never thought they'd do never dreamed that they would do because this word's not holding you are you with me when you walk away from the word it will not hold you no longer you leave the protection are you with me now listen when you when you're making choices even now maybe you're not the brother vernon but you're making choices right now as a young man and a young dad think about the children that are not born think about the children that are going to come you are a pillar of a family young people think about the homes that you're going to be stepping into don't mar your testimony don't mar your life as a young person with the world and all of its entrapments let the word keep you that's why we have meetings like louisiana that's why we have meetings like here that are calling for more of the holy ghost in our life a real experience a real experience that will be the type host in your life that you can point back where god i'm talking about a personal supernatural experience not a learned behavior i know what a supernatural experience is like many years ago as a young man my life was a mess now i'm just going to share it with you my life was a mess i'd made some bad choices and it had taken me away from the presence of god i was homeless i was making really bad choices i was working because i knew the fundamental thing if you want to have money i obviously wasn't living in this time but if you want to have money you got to work people need to get up and go to work that's what they need to do well brother ron i i want the government to take listen the government's not going to always be here brother homer preached that night and he preached the sermon what will the holy ghost mean in your life and the theme of that was he'll be your god he'll be the light in front of your footsteps he will help you with your choices and you need to know more than just the message you need to know christ himself the very spirit of christ and he'll be there when you give up that was the theme of brother homer's sermon that night and i sat there as a message believer now back in church married and i i went to a place because i was just so ashamed of ron and i went to a place near sister dawn and near the piano you remember it was an upright piano and had i believe it had a curtain on it and i got down and i began to pray brother bill came and wrapped his arms around me like a bear and he began to pray for me and i began to pray these words god i need more than my mom's experience i need more than my dad's experience i need an experience of my own i knew the message i knew the words i knew the lyrics i knew all of the the powerful quotes but i didn't have christ i didn't have that anointing of the holy ghost living inside of me brother bill was holding me he couldn't give me the holy ghost but he was there and the support that's what we need as men and women in this church to support our young people and pray with them until they get an experience for themselves because every generation has got to have its own revival [Applause] [Music] that night i walked out of that building changed we can talk about matthew at the louisiana camp when they came to me in the middle of the night your son's still speaking in tongues i wasn't ashamed amen matthew's still speaking in tongues he's a great big boy and we had to carry him to his bed weighed about 250 at that time that boy was was speaking and comes i tell you why i rejoiced hundreds it came to the altar but my son received the holy ghost because i knew without it he couldn't hold on i said in the office when colleges were making their offers and he walked in the office and sat down beside my my desk and he said dad football's over it's over you don't know how proud that may be i was proud when he when he was sacked a quarterback i was proud when he would do his things but i was more proud that he chose god you want me to be proud of you young people you want me to be proud of you parents when you choose god when you step off of the realm when there's nobody else there with you when you step off of the hill that day and you choose god [Applause] let me just say this you god can heal you raise you up take you from death's door and that be a miracle but there's listen you can go and live a sinful life and not even have any redemption to you just because he heals you don't mean that he saved you at the same moment but what you need is you must be born again and it's more than a formula it's more than just good quotes it's more than learned behavior it's a supernatural experience where god himself feels you he's he's took those devils out of your life and he's washed you clean and he comes and lives in a vessel brother ron that's real elementary some of you are facing some end time battles let me tell you about wars wars will happen on a lot of fronts the enemy will get your mind in a whole lot of different directions and i'm going to be personal right here at my home i've got a box of medicine it's about that big it's got 20 i take 20 pills in the morning then i take more chemo in the afternoon you better have faith you better have faith when you're putting all of that in your system i just talked to a pharmacist last week and he was telling me he said you are a miracle to be alive from the medicine alone i went to get scammed the other day and the and the and the person came out to scan me she was about my age and and and i thought she was a christian because the way she wore her hair and i i talked to her a bit i i never did gather that but i i talked to her a bit and she said you know i looked over your case i looked all the way back to the beginning and she said in my mind's eye i thought i was going to walk out to a man in a wheelchair you're a picture of health and i just simply said that's my god [Applause] but cancer is not the only front that you have to face many of you fight fronts on your job there's no job perfect can i give you a news bulletin there's no job perfect no job perfect young people when you go get a job let me just remind you when you go get a job the only reason that that that you're you're there is they need you [Applause] if they could have did it themselves they would have did it themselves and saved themself a ton of money but they need you to do the best that you can do and be the best representative that you can be so quit hating your job and do it to the best of your ability somebody ought to be standing on their feet right now you could be seated if there's anything that i just distaste and i'm sorry i'm still preaching if there's anything that i distaste is somebody to walk to my table and tell me how bad they hate what they're doing i'm looking around can we get somebody else to wait on me or to walk up to the counter at mcdonald's and and it's as though it's as though they're they're there with their their their little little and they're just they're in another world and you don't mean nothing when we were on vacation across the road was a was a house being built now i'm not off course there was a house being built and i walked every morning brother alden walked with me connie walked with me and i walked every morning but i'm always observant i'm always watching and i watch when the guys got there they never picked up a hammer for an hour oh come on they never did anything they smoked they took bathroom breaks they sat on the porch they never did anything constructively for an hour now if your job says for you to sit in behind your desk put your feet on your desk enjoy the job do it right i'm not talking about you look over at your neighbor say he's not talking about you just he ain't talking about you you ain't talking to me he ain't talking about you because this baby is about to turn amen come on heads or tails okay we read david and goliath but we're not david but we're facing goliaths i'm not brother branham i'm not the apostle paul but god called me to do the job just like he called men all across the world to do the job now he knowed exactly who was going to come to this church and be in this church and enjoy this church and be a part of it and we're a team here we are a phenomenal an absolute phenomenal team i mean there's teams of sisters there's teams of brothers there's teams of families there's this is this is a church that just has incredible teams that's in it this is a praying church this is a this is a tape listening to church this church has has has deep roots in the message it's a powerful church now don't come to this church if you want to

as a job is expecting you to do your best above any job above any situation above any sports world above anything in the world god's expecting my best hallelujah he's expecting the best for me in my life not just on saturday not just on sunday but every day of the week i want to tell you this message works this message will destroy every devil that's in hell this message will produce a resurrection this message will produce sons and daughters of god that can live in this age follow the dynamics of the holy ghost call them when they pray it works point at those young people they can live and overcome in life in spite of all laodicea puts on them we have not come to this battle to loose give the lord a great big hand this morning [Applause] just look around at some of god's
