we're going to have my mom come this evening she'd like to give a testimony I'm just kidding we've asked her to give a little bit of a testimony for the appointments that Dad had this week amen yeah absolutely gotta have my best man my best friend um as all of you know um on January the 10th um Ron had a a a normal a scheduled appointment with the oncologist um team at UVA and during that um process normally you know I have went in with him but those rooms are so small and so that day I had some we had some errands he saidwell why don't you just go do the errands and then you just come back and meet me here in the parking lot so that's what we plan to do well um I'm on my way back and I get a call and he says Connie I need you to come in and so we go into the office and um it was a couple hours waiting and um they the doctor had seen two mass in his eyes on both eyes at the exact location and so then she called in another doctor for a second opinion and so he's saying that of all his years of practice he had never saw that a person would have two masks at the exact location in both eyes and you know I'm thinking it's nothing you know they've read something wrong you know in my mind how can a person have two mass at the exact same location and so she came back and she says well she says it's maatic and as you know Ron has stage four melanoma and it had went from his lungs to his brain and so you know she said we'll be um getting back in touch with you so during that time on around I think January the 18th brother Tim and brother Donnie um came and you all were that were here witnessed you know what happened and um the service was very both Services was uh very moving for us and we just kept claiming and believing you know and but the enemy would climb up on my shoulder and tell me well you know these stairs these seizures that he's having well that's probably what it is you know and I rebuke him and I've always kind of felt a little um comfort and I know people may judge me for this but I would go and visit my daddy's grave so during that week my heart was just so heavy so I went up to my daddy's grave side and I just prayed and I told the Lord I said Lord you've been so faithful to us through this whole journey and I asked you just be with us help us if it is we'll give a test ony of your healing so on the 14th of February uh we had to go he had lots of scans from his brain to his abdomen uh pelvis and those scans came back they they look great and so then this um you know they were stable yeah there there's still the cancer is still there it hasn't spread sprad to no other organs and so then on the 18th when brother Tim arrived um Ron gets the call uh right when brother Tim has arrived and um that he they want him to come see this specialist and we found out this week he's the only specialist in the state of Virginia that does this um scam and so we we went there this Tuesday the 27th and while we were there we're sitting in the room and uh it's a big room and the nurses doing all kinds of test on him scans getting him prepared to see the doctor and so she starts talking and she says well she could see the Mass you know and so then Ron asked her you know he's inquisitive and so he asked her he said well what do they do for someone that's got eye cancer and to back up this week we had so many appointments and so the day before we'd been at UVA and there was a lady getting on the elevator and she had a patch on and Ron being the gentleman he is he speaks to her and talks to and and uh so she proceeds to tell him that she had eye cancer and they had to remove one of her eyes well you know the enemy he's right there on my shoulder so uh then the next day we go for this appointment and and so he asks this nurse he said what will they do you know if it is and she said well she said they will most likely remove one eye to keep control of maybe the other eye not getting it and or they will take one to save one and then they'll do uh gamma knife radiation again and then um uh we had even asked Dr gone about this and she said well she said let's not panic she said there's all kinds of treatment and she said when we get to that spot she said you are going to the best oncologist opthalmologist in the state of Virginia and she said we will wait to see what he tells us so Ron goes back into another room they're doing all these test and and um so then they put us in the room and he comes in and and uh he's looking at everything on the scans and he says you're stable and I'm like oh thank you Jesus you know I just kept praising him and so and he's telling us everything that he had saw and so we said is there is it melanoma and he says no there's no melanoma in there he said there are two lesions so you know he's going through everything he said but I do want to see you in six months and and he said we'll we'll watch those lesions and I saidwell what did they come from and so he said well you know he said uh it could came from mackler degeneration the diabetes and so he goes on out and his assistant is standing there and she's writing notes and so I said to her and Ron said to her well why did Dr valir say he had cancer in both eyes and then she called in this other doctor she said you know what let's go back let's call him back in here she said and I don't blame you for questioning that she and so he comes back in and he says let me tell you this is miscommunication he said there is no cancer in your eyes so I sat there I just shouted I cried I thank the Lord and so we're walking down the hall and and we tell her we said we're sorry we you know we had to wait and take away your time from lunch you know and she she said you didn't take away from me she Saidi don't blame you she said I would want to know and I would want to know and hear those words that you do not have cancer in your eyes and I want to thank God for that Lord we thank you oh Lord we thank you oh Lord

prosper and if God be for us who can be against us amen aren't you thankful to be on the Lord's Side amen amen he he's here what an honor it is to be here this weekend and uh two weeks ago I hadn't planned on it but I I just started texting brother Ron one morning and had been thinking about him and praying for him and and ask him you know when you ask him how he's doing you get the positive side so a lot of times I ask the ones that'll tell me the all of it but uh I didn't that time and so I was just he was sharing a few things we was going back and forth just talking about life and he said won't you come preach next weekend I said well I can't next weekend but let me see about the next and it worked out and we just have to believe sometimes that these things are orchestrated by God and not by man so I I know a lot of you and there's a lot of new faces now that I don't know but we all love one another in the Lord and and we're all one great big family you may not like me after tonight or tomorrow but the thing about it is brother Gabe you don't have a choice really when it comes to the marriage supper of the Lamb because whether you like me or not I'm going to be there and I hope that God sets me right across the table from the person that hates me the most I won't care my only desire is let me be there and let me worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords for all eternity amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we come to you tonight Lord we count it in honor Lord to be gathered back in your house this evening worship you tonight Lord in spirit and in truth and father it's an honor to be back here in Virginia with our friends and we count them Lord as family and Lord we just pray tonight God that you would come and may you remove the vessel Lord and may you come by and speak to us in a supernatural way Lord and may you touch your children this evening Lord and give them Faith father and give them courage and give them strength Lord for the battles Lord that lay ahead of us father we realize we're in trying times and we're at the end time but Lord greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world now Lord I yield my body to you my spirit Lord you take it may it be a vessel of Honor tonight Lord For Your Glory give me the right words Lord to say and father we yield it to you now and we'll be careful we'll give you all the glory and all the honor and all the praise and all the saints of God said amen amen if you have your Bibles turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 2 Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 12 and 13 sure appreciate the hospitality brother Ron and brother Matt and brother Andrew has has shown us and and their wives and their families and you know it's we've we've known each other since 2006 now and you know in in 200 10 that didn't seem like too long ago but now it's 2024 and and we're all getting older and and so uh I might not run as fast as I used to run but I'm still running amen it's he that endureth to the end amen Jeremiah 2 and verse 12 be astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be horribly afraid and be you very desolate saeth the Lord for my people hath committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and the second sin they hewed them out cister and not just a sister but a broken sist that can hold no water so it's leaking out all the joy all the happiness all the victory all the dance whatever it might be you put it in a cyen it's broken and it leaks out but if they would have stayed with the Fountain of Living Waters they would have had a fountain that never went dry may the Lord had his Blessing this evening you may be seated I'd like to speak tonight on what is real power we find here in the Bible that Israel is Accused by the prophet of two major sins they had turned from God and then they had made them aister that was a man-made Contraption to be able to capture water but these weren't just normal ones these were leaking so in some cases now if some of you younger ones don't know what a sistan is it's it's how you capture rainwater to be able to drink out of and I don't know who in the world invented that but who would want to drink out of something that had everything in it right but some of us was that way some of us were in denominations we were in man's Creeds we were in our own ideas and were drinking from a man-made Cesspool just put it plain you know where I'm from I'm from Arkansas so we're just playing but there's something about a sister that you must understand it does not produce anything it don't have no power within itself to be able to produce all it has in it is the ability to corrupt so therefore a sister can't be relied on it can't fill itself it has to depend on local re Reigns or local revivals little Revival here and a little Revival there well if you ever get the Fountain of Living Water you have a Revival from the day that you're born again it's always with you so it's not self-sufficient it depends on something else to fill it comes off the top of Barns and sheds and all the dirt and the dust and the you know some of you lives on farms you know what dust is there's all kinds of stuff mixed with it washes right off into the drinking water washes right down into a man-made tank we don't want that corrupting our churches in the message we don't want man-made IDE ideas corrupting us we have a Fountain of Living Water and we don't want to go out and build something that's going to leak that's why a lot of people they come a little waves and they quit come a little waves and they quit it's CU they're not built upon the right thing listen you ever get built up the Fountain of Living Waters it is an Aran well springing up self-supporting water that comes from it is fresh Pure Clean it's the unadulterated word of God it's coming from the hand of God it's that real it's got a secret of its power is within itself and if it's in itself then you don't have to prime it up you don't have to pump it up you don't have to push it up it bubbles up Hallelujah so now there's something else about aist where I really get the preaching or pond it's basically about the same thing when the temperature changes just a little bit gets a little bit colder it'll freeze when the atmosphere changes it freezes and it gets ice covered over like a lot of churches yeah church will get the same way if they don't stay in the spirit and they don't keep praying and they don't keep listening and they don't keep digging into the word of God then we'll get the atmosphere changes a little and we'll freeze over or will you know if it starts to thaw a little bit then you know you get on it you walk a little bit and then you fall in but an artisian well never changes it's got the flow all the time it's got that bubbling up on the inside of it and no matter how cold it gets a real artisian well will stay at bubble from all down within it's way down in there and it pushes everything that gets in its way out push it all out of it you remember the story brother actually preached a sermon on broken cens and he tells about this this bubbling artisian well that he used to drink out of and when he come up to it he said you know I thought my goodness this well is so happy and he said I took my hat off and I begin to think you know what is making this so happy why is it so bubbling and he said I thought well you know what I'm just going to talk to this well and if I could speak to it I would ask it a question why are you bubbling and so happy is it because that I drink from it and if it could answer it would say no brother Brandon it's not because you're drinking from me well it because the deer drink from you no it has nothing to do with the deer that's drinking from me well then why is it that you're always bubbling and if the well could speak it would say because there's something down on the inside of me that keeps pushing up and that's the way it is with a born again Christian you cannot contain it it's a Well of living water bubbling up into everlasting life and there's something about it you have nothing to do with man-made tanks of freeze they're begging for Revival what was it doing at ashbery they begging for Revival they were praying for Revival and they got some type of Revival but you know what a real Revival will do to a person it will cause you to go back to the word so you can tell if it's a word Revival it causes you to fall in love with the word and when you fall in love with the word you have a Revival all the time Sunday morning Saturday night it's bubbling up on the inside of you it's 365 days a year pure clean fresh it's that word bubbling vindicating itself speaking itself for itself don't matter whether the rain's coming whether it's snowing whether it's whatever the weather is if the holy spirit's in there it's bubbling it's happy all the time it's kind of like brother B said you get a man drunk on the Holy Ghost he's drunk every day of his life listen you don't find him today well I don't know if I'm saved and I don't know if I've got it and and I don't know and I I tell you what it's just been the worst day of my life brother Jason I've just had it so bad you know some days I think that on Sundays I think boy i' I just don't feel like preaching today and then I think well brother Ron's probably preaching so and I do realize we ain't all built the same me and Andrew don't had this conversation we ain't all built the same we might have a little gumption but that's a bulldog when he's down he's still happy right when he's got the walls and everything stacked against him he still has a song in his heart that's any real believer when their backs against the wall they still believe they don't give up you don't quit when the when things get tough you still go to war cuz there's a hidden power it's the secret that lies within you I didn't tell you this brother Ron but I told Andrew this I said can you imagine being in a boxing ring with you huh I didn't understand I told my wife I said you imagine he would beat you to death cuz he don't know when to quit but it's a good trait to have listen every believer ought to have that I'm going to fight I'm going to keep fighting listen my real power is not within me it's within him that he placed within me so you don't pull it up pump it up pray it up pray it down it's just there and it's a fountain filled with blood where Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains you don't make a church member out of that kind of a person you make Christians out of them kind a Fountain of Living Waters it's pumping has no listen its power he said is within itself it needs no priming it's it its own life is in itself and the seed of God is in a man's heart the life of God is within the individual not in the church in you it's in you you're the one that has the germ of life in you it's not the church building it's you those those who God fornew before the foundation of the world he has ordained to this listen the rest of them will never see it you don't know why people can't see the message they wouldn't ordained to it they wasn't predestinated to be able to catch the revelation of this hour but thank God there is some that regardless what man says regardless when they were things stacked against them they'll always know the Bible said it so I had a guy here a while back it's been year or so ago he started texting me all this nonsense and he said uh don't you think brother brandham should have rephrased some things for today's culture don't you think it's a little out of order I knew where that demon was coming from yeah he done attack the wrong guy on that one so I let it go for a little while cuz he was kin to me bless his heart but he kept on with his nonsense and kept sending me messages and finally I just had all I could handle well don't you know brother Brandon was wrong here and he was wrong you're a liar you're a liar and he kept on with that nonsense and finally I said listen man I ain't got time to talk about it I believe it that's it well are you afraid to talk about it I said listen boy I ain't afraid of anything you got I don't have to defend this message God shall defend it he's already Vindicated it it's thus sayith the [Applause] Lord so with my phone I go Block it's on messenger so then he starts texting me and I go block you want to talk to me you talk to me about what I believe you don't come talk to me and trash what I believe cuz that's a good way not to talk to me and I was cocked and loaded I had to do a funeral for my uncle I was cocked and loading I'm like I hope he says something to me but no he's a keyboard Warrior so he didn't have the nerve to face me he was there but he wouldn't say nothing cuz I done made my mind up what I was going to say why have you allowed the devil to put it in your heart to come against the sword of God why have you allowed Satan to henter [Applause] you the problem is he has no power right he don't know where power lays power lays within the word and within the seed how many there's a power within the seed that God has deposited in you and if it's in there you didn't choose for it to be in there God chose you to put it in there and if it's not in there you can't make it in there so I called my cousin I called his sister and I said what what's up with this dude you know it's off the deep end I said you even believe there's a God well he's not sure I said I can't talk to him I cannot have an intelligent conversation with somebody who is ignorant enough to believe that everything just boom hey if you want to get real we can talk but if you want to tell me about Darwin I ain't got no time for that cuz I got something that's real and this don't need no pumping up priming up it comes from within you it's bubbling on the inside of you that's the way the seat of God is in a man's heart it's just there one day it crosses the light Gabe one day it crossed you you was raised in it you was probably pushed down your throat in it somewhat you was made to go to church you didn't want to go to church not really but one day you did one day he reached down his hand and he spoke to you and he changed you huh and then that's where the real power was rest of them is never going to see it Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that the father ha given me might come will come Hallelujah so there stood Judas he had a light shining up here but back down in his heart was a dark seed and when The Showdown come the darkness showed because it always does during a showdown then there's a little woman at the well she's all black up here in the front but down in here was a predestinated seat and when the light come to her it scattered the darkness out of her life and she said sir we know when Messiah comes that he'll tell us these things and Jesus said I'm he I mean and her life was exposed and she runs into the city sadly I got something to tell you man I Met m I'm just going to tell you right now if you ever meet him he changes you and when she met him she ran into the City and said come see a man that told me everything I ever did and he told her one thing according to the scripture that's all we know he may have told her other things but that's all we know but she knew she's open he's he he he's done seeing everything he needed to see so when it's back down here it's a genuine predestinated seed when the light comes down here and it drives all the darkness away from you and puts you in fellowship with Christ he's the one that gave you life before the foundation of the world to begin with otherwise you never see it oh brother Jason we got all the mechanics down right we got everything going right in the mechanic field that's good glad you got the mechanics you know how to dress you know how to act you know how to conduct yourself in the house of God you got all those that's good that's part of it but that ain't all of it mechanics will only cause you to be a church member but you're going to have to have something else with it that causes you to live mechanics won't make the engine run but when you put that octane gasoline in there and then the fire begins to strike it a combustion takes place he's the same yesterday today and forever amen his word never changes Amen brother Ram goes that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens so mechanics without the spirit is no good listen or brother there I shout and I scream and I do all these things that's great I love to do the same thing I ain't got nothing against that you know that but the thing about it is that's the blessings Fallen but then let a life come in you the spirit of God comes in you and causes you to put the word on display and it actually puts a life behind your worship that's what it's all about let's get life behind us let's get life in us let it Bubble Up in us then it's not just a church service brother Jason where I used to go in it was dead than 3:00 well it usually ain't here huh maybe you don't know what it's like to be in a dead church I've been there done that don't plan on ever going back I want something that's got life something that can give life listen I'm not just talking about all of our worship I'm talking about real Godly living that'll cause a person to live right talk right treat your neighbor right and the rest of it will follow it mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word that causes it to work you can have power and not have the Holy Ghost Samson had a hidden power but because there he wasn't where he needed to be with God he got weak spiritually we all know the story my brother told me the other day he said Jason just spit it out 15 minutes we can have it all man you don't need to preach an hour and a half just give it to us we can handle it if you want to know exactly how he is right set not over a map they're clones you get them two together it would be bad sister Mary you know him but the thing about it is you know we're here to Feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man if a guy preaches an hour and a half or he preaches 30 minutes just know your limitations of where you need to be preaching that's the key you can preach as long as you want as long as the spirit's moving right so don't ever just let it become a church Gathering don't get like Samson get rocked asleep by a woman Samson tell me your power show me your power where is your power where does your strength lie and so he starts entertaining it a little well if you buy me with new Roots if you do this to me bust his him finally she said Samson why have you lied to me tell me where your power lays he had got comfortable with his head and the lap of Delilah he got used to being there she petted him she told him how much she loved him and how handsome he was and blah blah blah blah blah and when you you get older they don't tell you that anymore amen thank you but the thing is is he begin to lose his identity first before he ever lost his power because he flirted with the world instead of staying true to God listen church and he finally when he tells her his secret she brings the Philistines in they cut his hair off and he jumps up I'll defeat him again but he didn't have no strength he lost everything he had in a moment's time and not only that he lost his sight they took him down there and made a slave out of him listen Church we've come too far in this to be slaves now we don't need to go back to Egypt and be a slave to the devil no longer you've come out of Egypt stay out of Egypt stay the promised land you go back to Egypt you lose your power Samson Lost His sight I say God help us tonight keep our eyes on the word God don't let me ever become critical you ever been critical before all right there's five of us in here that's honest okay we'll have a prayer meeting for the rest of you at the end the prophet got critical but it didn't make it right but then he had to repent and he said this on his African trip or his India report rather he said I come back and and first thing was placed in my hands was the voice of healing and I seen AA Allen's meeting and seen how scriptural that it is and then I criticized it and I thank Lord them poor people lovely people was out there following that and seeing him going him hones hearted people and I looked around and I seen all the other things that goes on and I started criticizing in my heart and he says I don't want to get that way if I do that I will lose favor with God and that's the last thing we want to do he said then I looked at America and I I seen how they dressed and I seen all the the sins and stuff America was in and people who claim to be Christians and doing all the things of the world he said it nauseated me and when I think of the other side is and then this look between I think oh God he said but hear this whose battle is it God said let the weeds and the wheat grow together and then the Angels would come and do the separating so then he says this I'll move on so help me as I stand here with my hand up at the pull pit help me to criticize nobody help me God will you give me a spirit in my heart instead of criticizing it I will love them anyhow and go on that's real power when a man can take people and see the sin you see if you're a prophet like he was he he didn't look at things like you and I did he looked at him through Supernatural eagle eyes and when he saw sin it made him sick should make us sick but it made him nauseated to think about it and when he was nauseated then God began to deal with him whose battle is it something don't go like you like it in the church whose battle is it we're not going to always all agree 100% of the time we're humans we're going to have disagreements but the key factor is we do have one thing in common that's the message of this hour and this revealed word this thing we do have in common and this we do believe together and this is what we'll fight for enough of this this fighting in the front yard between Believers we ought to stand together in the front yard discuss our problems in the [Applause] backyard and say God give me the courage give me the faith give me the ability to submit myself to your word give me that real holy ghost power the spirit of God's not something that's schooled into you it's something that's predestinated into you by the hand of almighty God hallelujah we don't have no power on our own we're helpless didn't Jesus say I do nothing till the father shows me first sister brandham brother bram's mother she would say Bill what's going to be my outcome when she got sick she was dying and he said I don't know mother until God shows me I can't tell you anything because if I do I'm a failure to begin with right so I have to make sure that I don't tell you something that's not correct so I have to wait and he said we are only God's agents to which God can work through and God works his own will through but see but he said but it's when those super duper people that's always having this and they this and the other he goes you better stay away from that somebody's always got the answers well stay away from him he said right because Jesus himself didn't do that he waited till the father showed him and that's real power because you're controlling yourself when you can control yourself that's real power you can control this and this that's power well brother I I could shake the building down well great you might could even beat me in arm wrestling probably probably Ally could I never was any good at it but that's not the kind of power we're looking at we're looking at a power that causes you to live an overcoming life a power that can come into the church get sin out of the way and let healings take place and let Miracles take place we're looking at the kind of power that came at the day of Pentecost the original so don't just go by an experience you got to go by the word too you got to get away with an experience as am measuring line if it don't line up with a word but if it lines up with a word run with it there's one Plum line in this hour and it is a revealed word of the hour that's the word repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed now Prophet said that's the whole of the problem right there people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto the receiving the spirit Believing on Jesus just a step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost people stop there they go as far as the water and they stop and they believe and they stop the Bible does not say you receive it when you believe but have you received it since you believed that's the reason people don't have any power in their lives they stopped short of a true Pentecost they don't know God in the power of his resurrection they know him appear but they never Dro this brother jeel said it ain't never dropped 18 Ines to get down here into your heart but once it gets down in here brother Jason we need the power well the word had to come first and with the restoration of the word it brings a restoration of the power that's why we can say Satan get thee behind me Satan leave in the name of Jesus Christ had a good friend of mine last week his son texted me he was a friend and he said they had take her I think it was son yeah running dad to the emergency room he's having chest pains well they got him in there and started running tests and he'd had pneumonia and so they started checking him for his heart and found out he had a 99% blockage so they went there with the exent and fixed it but they couldn't keep his blood pressure regulated so the very next day I called him I said our text Luke and I said hey man how's your daddy doing man that can't regulate his blood pressure just up and down up and down I said really yeah I said Okay that was I don't know four or five o'clock so I just started praying Lord help St touch him he's not a believer of the message that's don't matter there's a power within the bride to use the word so I just said Lord touch him next day I text Luke or called him I said hey how's your dad goes man the craziest thing happened he said last night about 6:00 after I talked to you dad's blood pressure ly out and it's been perfect ever since I said really kind felt like thought about brother Brandon when he was up there on the mountain and storm left and he come down they said there's a great storm coming but all a sudden they just laugh and he goes really so I text his dad and I said hey man I've been praying for you thanks buddy he said see they know where God moves you don't always have to tell everybody everything just be a light to them huh just let them give them a little bit at a time and then when they take that you give them a little bit more and you take that and you give them a little bit more we have a brother at the church just last month he come up he was standing right there for prayer and I was preaching I said we can lay hands on you and cast you know anoint you with oil and pray for you or you could be like the Roman Centurion be under just speak the word and that man so helped me he's standing there with his hands up he turns around he says at Thy word Lord and he walked right back to his seat praising God now he had a heart condition and he went like the next week for a heart cath and there was a afraid's going to have to go in there and change some heart valves out so they didn't do anything that day they didn't tell him anything either come back three weeks or whatever see the surgeon walks into the surgeon's office two weeks ago I think it was and they said uh well got good news you don't need heart bowel replacement surgery and you don't need open heart surgery come back and see me in six months see but it was because he believed the real power was already within him all he had to do is Gras I ain't against praying for people laying hands but the greater thing is you to receive the word Hallelujah Lord be unto me sometimes we need those hands to help build our faith because our faith ain't always on the same level each trial and so we have to have somebody to come help us put my faith in the word of God let me know Lord not because I got a miracle cuz I've had my share and if he never gave me another one I know he's a miracle worker but just because he heals my body is no proof of my forgiveness the proof is is my faith in his word that has changed my life and now my experience is lining up with his word hallelujah what we need today is another baptism of the Holy Spirit and the real power of God that identifies the works that Jesus did that was promised for this day not so much as what was promised for another day what do you promise in this day I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh they'll prophesy they'll see Visions they'll see dreams right did he not tell us that that's what Joel told us and this is that which was prophesied this is the restoration of the word that has come and now the restoration of the power is here also when Jesus brought the man to him he said arise take up thy bed first he actually said thy sins be forgiven go and send no more send him away and they said who has power to forgive sins he goes or would it be easier for me to say arise take up your bed and go home huh he had it all and that's the thing church we have it within our grasp we have it in our hands what are we going to do with it what are you going to do with this Jesus call Christ well brother Jason I I just really don't know I just think sometimes y'all go overboard you preachers y'all go overboard with getting excited you think if you've been where some of us have been brother they wonder why you get so happy sometimes maybe but if you been where he been if you was where he was if you walked where he walked if you've been through what I've been through then you might know why I get excited you might know why I Want To Praise Him you might know why I love him Hallelujah he came all the way down from glory to pick me up when I was a sinner when I had habits when I couldn't overcome there was always a hand Jesus said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll go with you to the end and your path may not be easy but you're going to make it it won't always be the easiest road but if you'll come into full obedience to my word it entitles you to the token and when the token is in your life when the word is in you then it becomes Christ in you then we're not looking behind us we're not looking ahead of us we're looking at what he's doing now and today is the day of salvation now is the time to give it all to God I I ain't felt power in my life in forever I tell you it's high time you start praying let me give you this we okay on time all right today we got the wrong conception of power he said from that time 1961 power is overcoming returning good for evil yeah am how many's ever had to do that all of us okay he goes that's real power that you can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you I like to use another one at home some ever so often I'll use this quote brother said you must like everybody you see the looks on some of them faces brother Jason I didn't say it he did like and love everybody okay well that's not in this quot so we'll preach that another time that you love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God power Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man that can return good for evil from his heart because not because of a religious duty but from his heart and he said and we're always complaining about what the world and how how the world is and how Wicked the world is I didn't realize they part of the same quote how Wicked the world is don't we say that this is a wicked generation it's horrible put your kids on the street it's just horrible you don't know somebody's going to shoot you when you walk out the house it's a wicked world but we fail to realize he said you forget to realize how much more powerful the church is than it used to be Hallelujah so the world's getting more wickeder but the church is getting more powerful Hallelujah so Samson Shake Yourself wake yourself up in PR and realize your greatest Victory will be when you confess that you've been wrong and when he Shu himself I just heard the prophet say it this afternoon he goes they didn't notice Samson's lips moving when he's grinding at the meal he didn't even say he was praying out loud right here sometimes when you pray out loud the devil hears it but when you keep it in your heart the prophet said the devil can't hear that and he's sitting there praying Lord forgive me I failed you God I was born to destroy the enemy that's what you're born for to destroy your enemy Lord I I I Repent I'm sorry and and he's Samson's going through the thing no doubt all kinds of memories flood in his mind if I hadn't went that way if I have just listened to my father and mother if I hadn't went that way and I'd have stayed with the right girl I wouldn't be here right every thought's Crossing through his mind and he's grinding and he says Lord forgive me I'm ready now to die die to surrender to give up everything God I'm ready I'm to the point now Lord I'm broken I have nothing else to look forward to I can't see anymore I've lost my sight but God I was born for a purpose and Lord I'm asking you to restore my power give me my power back God God says you got to be willing to die I'm willing Lord to die of everything of this world his greatest victory over the enemy was at his end time and the greatest victory over the devil is going to be at the end time whenever Devil's going to be under your feet Hallelujah well brother I'm just the souls on the bottom of the feet that's a good thing cuz the devil's still under you he ain't got on top of you yet Samson said I'm ready and they bring him out and they start making a sport of him they have a big rally and his greatest Victory he overcomes himself and what he thought he could do without Christ we can't do nothing you understand we are helpless we're worthless without Christ we need him more today than we've ever needed him and in the morning you'll need him more tomorrow than you ever needed him temptation's going to come and you're going to need him the greatest Victory is at his end and he says to the lad cuz Samson remembered there had to be some pillars that held up the building sunny boy put my hands on the pillars they still wasn't watching Samson they done too caught up in making fun like people do us make fun of us for the way we worship God in the way we live and the and the way we do things and because we believe in our prophet and believe his message and they make fun of us that's okay cuz what I'm going to do is Lord let me lift my hands let me put them on the pillars Lord this is the end time God let this be our greatest Victory and he wrestles them on the pillars and he starts praying Lord now's my time to go give me the power and another thing they failed to see is during those months into prison his hair got back down to where he had locks again yeah the power had been restored Samson knew knew the power he could feel the power I know it's back now I'm just waiting for the right time to take out the enemy the power is there it's there let's just put it this way what was the date you was at doctor Wednesday Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday brother Ron was sitting her in the office and he was still down we're going to take one of your eyes and you're going to lose your sight and we give you two months to live but he's praying oh he he's troubled here but not down here cuz down here there's something happening his little wife sitting there praying God do a miracle she said I could see the changes in his face but God was working may I put it this way the locks had begun to grow and he reached back there and he got a hold of the locks when that doctor walked in there he said there is no cancer he grabbed them rocks Hallelujah listen Church that'll make you dance a little dance right there when you realize the power has not left and if God did that much can he not take the rest of that where is your strength o Samson where is it o bride in the power of the word and the word said healing is my bread it might not be a major but it's pretty major when it's you oh but it's still yet bread so we still yet have to eat yeah so we take of the word of God and we eat the part that we need for the season that we are in it's part of our power we have the authority to use that power in the name of Jesus Christ every demon has to flee Samson where's your power just remember brother Ron when the enemy enemy comes and tries to throw you into a seizure and if you can think about it just go like this oh yeah it's still there it's still there he brought me through one that's one lock he'll bring me through another he'll bring me through another he brought you through the fire he brought you through the lightning he brought you through the snake bite he brought you through the stroke and the two or three heart attacks he is that kind of God and that's what you must believe in as a [Applause] church let me tell you something musicians come let me tell you something no matter how it looks or what kind of report this man may get in the future let me ask you a question whose report are you going to believe the Bible says he's already healed by his stripes he's already healed so you as a body of Believers no matter how dark it may get remember down inside there is light and you join your faith with his faith and then we'll ask God to give us his faith and then we'll march on the glory I had a brother he's Landing in a nursing home tonight he told me the other day at his house where he had to go to the nursing home he said brother Jason I asked my wife why don't God let me die I said buddy maybe God ain't done with you yet maybe there's there's one more person just one more I said the key is is are you ready should he call you he said I believe I'm ready I said then you ain't got nothing to worry about I said cuz if he don't hear you then in just a few moments you got he said I got a new body I said there you go but we're believing cuz we are believers God can still raise this man up out of the nursing home I don't know what God's plan is but I do know what his word says he allots a man 70 years the prophet said and if Satan comes before then and tries to steal it you have a right to tell him to leave I say God grant us the faith to enact that quote and to believe it with all of our heart and all of our soul and never look back I want you to do me a favor I'm done preaching but I know the majority of you I've come here for almost every year for I don't know how many years and if time terries and the Lord would allow and I ever come again I want you to be doing one thing standing standing on this message and standing behind your pastors that's right and when there's a need in their life act like it's your body yourself cuz when you can enter in for the next man it makes a difference in your prayer you begin to cry out God send [Music] Victory Lord send your power Lord let it bubble up not within me brother Steven don't let me look to the right or to the left but let that fountain that artisian well begin to Bubble begin to say oh God at Thy word I'm going to march on I'm going to give it everything I got brother gave you give it to him proud of you buddy proud of what God's made him and made you brother Steven spit our place God raises up men places them where he needs [Music] them
