honored to be with you this weekend amen I think brother Ron sister Connie and their family for all the hospitality and amen you know some people are just so dear to your hearts and we're just thankful for the Lord and allowing us to be together in this time that we're living in amen I you know you'd love to hear about Paul and all the different heroes to the Bible but we have heroes in this day as well and it's honor to better serve together with them and with you a man as the children of God fighting the same enemy and gonna come out victorious amen I'm not fighting this battle to lose I'm fighting to win amen so I'll bring you greetings from our church and also of course for my father but the team be here in a few days but amen we just love you with the love of the Lord Daniel chapter 5 and verse 12 says for as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and showing of heart sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar now let Daniel be called and he will show the interpretation amen we'll let you be seated this evening I like to speak to you this evening on the dissolver of doubts the dissolver of doubts you know this scripture that we just read was at the moment where the writing came on the wall and the men of that Kingdom and of that day could not give the interpretation but it was remembered that there was a man in the kingdom who could and he was able to give the interpretation who had the an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding of interpreting of dreams and showing of heart sentences the dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel now this was not Daniel's ability this was not his own thinking this is not something that he could he could produce on his own but amen this was actually the spirit of Christ that was showing through Daniel Amen the knowledge of God as it would come to Daniel and would come into his into his life a man and I believe that same God is in it at this hour that we're living in he's still the dissolver of doubts his spirit is still here his spirit is still anointing men his spirit is still anointing you a man in the hour that we're living in now when he goes to dissolve our doubts he has to you has to give you a place that you'll be able to stand upon that you'll be able to rest upon him and he does not give you a theology or an idea he gives you himself his word Amen that you can stand in the face of every kind of torment and spirit in the face of every kind of doubt and fear and anxiety or whatever you're facing he gives you something that you can stand on now just because he's giving it and he has given us a message in this hour and I believe this message that we have is a message that's been vindicated by the presence of the pillar of fire of Almighty God amen showing that it's not just the ideas or the thoughts of a seventh grade Kentuckian preacher but it was actually God come down and this day to reveal himself amen that God came to speak to us to show us who we are in the hour that we live in a man and he vindicated in such a way that there shouldn't be any doubts there shouldn't be any kind of thing that would clouded but you know how Satan always coming to come against those things and he tries to bring up doubts but God came in at night after night after night amen showing him so showing that it wasn't just a man that would speak him but God was coming behind it and saying amen amen you know as he said there in Revelations three and two the Laodicean church AZ said I am the faithful and true witness the a man of God he's a faithful and true witness now God does not witness or stand for anything that's a lie or wrong or or you know is it's false or some man's own interpretation or some man's own ideas but he is a faithful and true right amen a witness so it has to be something that's true for him to stand behind it a man and that's what we have witness in this hour through the ministry of William Branham was God coming behind it I know and be able to discern the thoughts and intents of a heart no man could do that now a man can maybe do something say a few nut words of knowledge and get it right every once in a while but this was a hundred percent every time and there wasn't a man that can there's not a man they can do that Daniel couldn't do it nobody could do it only God could do it what was God doing he was coming behind the word and saying amen this is my word this is my prophet this is my this is my thoughts as the mind of God that's being spoke amen I am saying Amen to it Amen I think of the time but the Branham was actually I forget the sermon but right off the top of my hair but he was actually telling about the cloud that had come in in the desert there and the picture that we have in the Life magazine he was showing it to the people Amen that people want to say nowadays was caused by a rocket or something like that but whatever but he was showing this and he was showing it that it was the angels of God that were there a man as he whereas he was the seals were being revealed to him and you know it amazes me that people want to make it out to be a liar or make it to be a fable but right during that same sermon was a man that fell over dead with a heart attack and then brother Branham goes down there and begins to pray for him the man's give him back his life again what was it it was God coming back behind it saying a man he's a dissolver of doubts and he he has given us a firm foundation in this hour that we don't have to go anywhere else he's given us a word to stand on to dissolve our doubts and to give us a perfect peace in the time of storms amen but you know that doesn't mean that you're not going to have my own battles that doesn't mean you're not going to have troubles that doesn't mean you're not going to have tests that does not mean you're not going to face fear or have mind battles by mind battles are nothing new they came right at the very moment the fall took place mine battles beginning to take place I mean could you imagine the mind battles that Noah faces he built an ark could you imagine the videos that were put out in that time of how I left noah's message Amen just because somebody can put a video together why I left a message or why I did that doesn't make them to be true a man they had have made the same things that Noah's could you imagine I've been there and there and looked at the Ark Encounter of how they've tried to replicated the best of their knowledge and it's an incredible thing no doubt there was many people that laughed and made fun of him and said are you done lost your mind you're crazy look at the weather ahead rain and how many days before and there's no rain in the forecast you're a crazy guy but no doubt at every nail went into the wood that whispers Satan was coming and saying yeah you just thought you heard the Word of God you just thought of it it was 120 years he preached this but God's Word his prophecy amen will be fulfilled hey man and he's dissolves the doubts how does he dissolve the doubts by fulfilling his word amen and Abraham no doubt faced mind battles he waited on the promised son it wasn't a quick thing it wasn't just in a moment it was some 25 years he waited for the promised son amen but God brought it to pass amen Sarah no doubt had my own battles you know God would speak to Abraham God wouldn't speak to her and she didn't even know if she was part of the promise and she tried to fulfill it on her own and try to bring it by by her own mind her own abilities but that wasn't the Word of God but God had her in his plan a man you know you know I can think of Abraham as after he received the prompt could you imagine the mine battles he went through is and when God said now you take this boy and you go sacrifice him could you imagine the mind battles he went through hey man you no way you said well mind battles I've got mine everybody's he has mine battles the greatest battle ever fought it is in the mind it isn't World War one two and three that's to come the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind the Satan has a right to attack you there and he's constantly trying to whisper in your ear no doubt today he's trying to tell you this message ain't for you or he tried to tell you that he listens to somebody else's ideas he's trying to tell you you're lost and you cross the line he tries to tell you all kinds of things Abraham would say that when it woke up they said told his services you stay here and watch the mules the lad now we're going to worship and the Ladd and I will return why what was he going back to no doubt he had in mind battles but he would go back to the word the word said Isaac was the promised son and out of Isaac shall thy seed be called so he knew that if grave he had to slam God would raise him up God would provide his sacrifice he went back to the word amen you know as annoyed but no doubt the devil stood on one side and as he said that the lad now returned on that but the devil stood there and said Abraham you told a lie you know he's always there to whispers for a moment but there's something they don't know there's some a browser there's something down here that tells me even if I have to kill him I'll receive him as one from the dead God can raise him up again the lad and I will return why because God told me through this son the seed would save nations and he changed my name and he put H a.m. on the end of my name I'm the father of Nations through this seed I don't know how God's going to do it but he's going to do it hey man it gives you something to stand on when you go back to thus saith the Lord hallelujah and listen that's not just some Catholic cynical story or something Tisha's fairy tale it's thus saith the Lord God makes no difference for how we're coming back hallelujah amen when you have man battles about your own children and their salvation you need to go back to the scriptures and said they shall be there and their offspring with him I don't know how he's gonna do it makes no difference for me he said it I believe it hey man could you imagine Jacobs mind battles as he waited to meet his brother but what happened to Jacob he changed his life forever well around him cities he was on one side of the river deceiver on the other side of the river a limping prince he met an angel has done saith the Lord changed his name a man Moses had my own battles wondering how God was ever going to use a failure like him he had tried to do it he had tried on his own and produce one dead Egyptian how God is gonna use me I'm just gonna go out in the desert and forget all about it he may have forgot all about it but God didn't forget come on somebody you may have forgot about God's calling purpose in your life but God hasn't forgot hey man brother branham had mine battles we read this through you said this morning I was listening a few days to a broadcasters seem to want to tell that creation just came from some ashes blowing together and some fossil faint and a few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine now created ain't it amazing it it takes more faith to believe two little things come together and we got what we got today than to believe God said let there be a man you didn't know what a theist had more faith than we got mercy to believe that and all of a sudden two little particles floating out in who knows where all of a sudden happened to meet someday and boom and now that way it was a boom all right it was let there be here's a boon hey man he said but that thing begin to work in his mind you know and he tried taking my little girl to school on the road back I went to he said Satan started trying to punch at me that this is the way it was he says going up the street and Satan said to me said do you know that there's man you called Jesus was just a man like one day in his day like Billy Graham or Roberts he was just a man that just to have a few people to gather around him and say he was a great man and after a while he became greater and then he became a god to them and now it's scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all and I said Satan how a liar you are hey man that's what you need to look at that devil and I said Satan you're a liar how a liar you are and I turned to those Crossin Graham says that Satan you that's talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the Hebrew prophet spoke would come who was the Anointed Messiah who was the man who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got it who wasn't the foretold it right down to the letter that he would call me be numbered with the transgressors wounded for our transgression he was grave was with the rich but he would rise up on the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might as well get away from me because it's written in the word and every word is true he fled from me just give him the word he is the deserver of doubts Amen Jesus had mine battles we can read about it you know where you think of things sometimes in one way but when it talks about he went into the wilderness or was tempted in the devil taking them up to the holy city and seen him put on brought him up to the pinnacle of the temple if he was watching that whole thing you wouldn't have seen the devil you'd have saw this man going up to the top of a temple and looking down and wondering going through all the strain of a mind battle the devil talking to him amen remember what did Jesus do he would take him back to the word that's the only place you can stand on is the word you only stand on your own conviction so long your own idea so long but you can stand on the word eternal because it is eternal Amen God but in every case God sent his word in every case when they were backed in the corner they could stop and rest upon the word and you can rest upon the same word today God has given us a word in this day he Christ is a solid foundation we can stand on he is over vindicated this message we can believe it no matter what critics say no matter how Satan would come and try to tear it down God is the dissolver of doubts and one day all these doubters are going to be left behind just like they were in the days of Noah just like they were all the way down through the scriptures one day as they walked out of Egypt there was some that doubted and we're left behind Satan is always there to try to bring unbelief let's turn him to second Kings 6 and verse 24 and it came to pass that bit of dad king of Syria gathered all his hosts up and went and besieged Samaria there was a great famine in Samaria and behold they besieged it until ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and a fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver so that wasn't a bad situation I had to look that up what in the world has doves done I know man know what it is but what in the world would it be worth that kind of money for and just Seifer Josephus actually was one of the theologians of the Jewish traditions and things he actually says that it was actually sold as salt for food and he had to pay five pieces of silver for doves dung and as the king of Israel was passing upon the wall there cried a woman saying help me O Lord when did we going down to the store how the data they've gotten such a famine because of the siege that was taking place until they begin to eat their own children it was in a bad situation and they go but they go to the prophet's house and they go to the prophet's house and they begin to talk to him and in chapter 7 and verse 1 says and Elijah said hear ye the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow at about this time shall a measure of fine flour be showed for sold for a shekel and 2 measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria what a turn Amen for a head of a donkey in for doves dung to be sold for an exorbitant amount of money until we're fine flour will be just as common a few pennies could buy you a meal in just one day is all it's going to be that'll be rejoicing in the streets that have been shouting and praising God for the Prophet had said thus saith the Lord now they had enough history with this man they knew this man knew what he was talking about because before this story Amen Elisha is in the in a place era and he begins to uh he begins to Missa besieged by the Samaria of the Syrians and you know the story walks out and this is his servant is all tore up about it and he's wondering why it was source around and he said boy there's more with us than there is against us he said well what do you mean he said Lord open this boy's eyes and he said of the old house came up and he saw chariots of fire horses of fire and angels of fire all around them I want you to understand those angels are still here because the Bible says they encamped about those that fear Him hey man hallelujah they in Captains angels are still here and you would think after all of the things and it goes right down to the the man there himself said the leader of Syria and walks right up to him and leads him right into the city a man feel therefore hip for the different into a trap and they don't even know who he is they knew this man to be a man of God they knew he knew what it was when God spoke to him come on somebody a man had enough history to know when he said thus saith the Lord it meant thus saith the Lord but the next verse said then a lord on whose hand the King leaned answered the man of God and said behold if the Lord oh that's a big word if if the Lord a man would make windows and heaven might this thing be so in other words God's gonna have to do it the way I think he's going to do it hello somebody notice this wasn't capital L Ord this was little lor D the Lord on whose hand the King leaned answered the men of God said Behold if the Lord would make windows of heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt and the man that prophet of God answered said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shall not eat thereof oma but there were four lepers they heard what the prophet said now I know leprosy represents sin and and we take it down that road but lepers is also beggars there also the loss of the of the totem pole so to speak but we were all born in sin shaped iniquity but there was something on the inside of us they could believe what a prophet said hallelujah we hired a crowd from another dimension somewhere Amen those leper says why sit here until we die either the prophets right or he's wrong but I'm gonna believe what he said and I'm gonna take him at his word hallelujah and he said that we should if we say we shall enter into the city then the families in the city and we die there if we sit here we die therefore come and let us fall into the hosts of the Syrians and if they save us alive we shall live if they kill us we shall die and they rose up at twilight to go into the camp of Syrians and when they come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord had made the host of Syrians to hear a noise of chariots for lepers to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses even the noise of a great host Oh hallelujah all it took was for people to say I believe this word I believe what the prophet said and I'm going to take him at his word and I'm gonna go down there and take what's mine oh come on somebody you have the moment tonight to be able to believe he is the dissolver of doubts amen all he needs is one person to start moving towards the promise and the devil's gonna hear great noise hello it's the sound of freedom it's the sound of a miracle taking place come on somebody all he needs is someone to believe someone to say yes Lord this is my service I'm tired of the devil capable of my promise I'm tired of him all my joy oh my happiness all my fees only say I'm going down take back what the enemy stole from me hallelujah not one more night with the devil now one more moment with him I'm going down and all of a sudden angels of fire peal of power begin to move down and begin to gather around whoo hallelujah for lepers if God can do that with four lepers what can he do with a church full of believers how let me tell you the devil's in trouble hallelujah I love the wheel it was a noise of a great house so you need to understand when you go back to take your promise you're not going alone when Joshua walked into the Promised Land begin to look over Jericho try to make the best plan he could come up with he turns around there's a man standing there with a sword drawn Joshua walked over that Jordan River into that Promised Land but he didn't walk alone there's a man sitting it with a sword drawn Johnson was pulled his sword he said are you for store for you are you against us he said neither what does that mean what was he saying to Joshua I'm not on your side you're on my side oh the devil needs to understand Amen we're not on his side he's on our side he is with us amen and these times you've been going through maybe some of the darkest trials of your life you're not alone see God open our eyes and I to see what is around us I believe tonight there's an angel station and every - I don't know what's our zone just saying come on believe believe tonight you're 9 all I need is just a motion that I'm coming and you know what happened and they said to another low the king of Israel has hired against us the king of the Hittites and the king of the Egyptians to come upon us have you ever thought about the devil having mine battles he's having something right now he's like what is going to happen if they start believing what's going to happen if they start believing to their children has been bound by drugs or alcohol and they start believing no matter what the situation God's going to turn it around what's going to happen I believe and he starts having all these mind battle this is what was going on in the enemy's camp Amen if we could just go down into hell for a moment we realized the devil ain't quite as brave as he we think we'd make him out to be as we heard last night he's stupid he's a felicity I can hear him tonight good when you go down to hell for a moment we crank he'll open we look down in there here's this devil over there he's beat up he's got bandages all over him he just finally getting over a few wounds and Satan saying hey you need to go back up there try to get that wrong Spencer do you see what's what I'm do you see how I look I've been in better with him I don't want to go I want to be the kind of person that's a devil don't want to mess with him I believe we can be that kind of people the devil say you need to go that no I don't want to go I say no I don't want to go there the last time I went there they destroyed me the last time I went there they woke me from one side of that church to another I don't want to go there the devil is having my battles tonight let me tell you the devil is already worried about this weekend is coming hi why I'm going to the enemy's camp and I'm gonna take back what he stole from me hallelujah he stole my joy I'm taking it back he stole my peace I'm taking it back he stole my happiness I'm taking it back oh come on the hell it is the sound of the hosts of angels that are gathering here [Applause] hallelujah and the lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp and they went into the tent we go back where for there rose verse seven and in the Twilight and they left joy and they left peace and they left happiness and they left comfort and they left all the things that God had given to his children because why why because the land that they was on belonged to the children of Israel a man and they fled for their life for leopards walking down the road headed to the camp he's hired somebody to come against this that's not and they fled and the lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp and they went into one service and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and went to another service and entered into it and came and went and hid it and they went to another service we do not well to stay of day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry to the morning light submissive with Carmona's now therefore let's come and go and tell the high Kings household and they came and called him to the porter and told him we come to the camp there was no man there no voice of a man oh the devil is whispering voice has been shut up a man the horse's time they asked his tie the tenses they were and they called the porters and they towed it to the king's house and the King rose of the night and said I will not show you what the Syrians have done to us they know that we'd be hungry therefore they've gone out of the camp to hide themselves and then when we come out of city they'll catch us still unbelief why because he was leaning on the wrong Lord he was leaning on his family's traditions or his family's ideas or whatever we got all kinds of crutches we lean on we can lead on generational curses and say well my grandfather had it my daddy had it now I got it listen you don't have to continue with a generational curse you don't have to relate on that Lord there is a Lord for you to lean oh I lean on Jesus hey man we lean on our daddies experience and her mamas experience we lean on all kinds of things there's only one to lean on that's capital L Ord but we go down this was Johar on they walked in the ways of his father a have made in himself false gods the people of Samaria fallen just like their king that forsaking the God of Israel they didn't remember the words of Jacob the Lord that God is one God so in wicked idolatry they bow down to idols of heathens therefore the Lord of Hosts suffered their enemies to oppress them and they come to this moment but for the elects sake Elijah's sake the Lord sent a promise that the next day food would that could not be obtained at any price would be able to be obtained at the cheapest price he did it for the elects sake amen he says we may picture the joy the multitude when the prophet prophesied they knew him to be a prophet he'd been vindicated all his past prophecies have been filled that fulfilled they knew he was a man sent from God and proclaiming God's message surely the Kings eyes would glisten with the light tomorrow tomorrow our hunger would be over and we'll feast to the fullness but however the Lord ellic little lor D an intellectual man a great man said impossible if the Lord would make the windows in heaven might be such a thing but it's in laying the fact that after repeated proofs of Elijah's ministry he still yet disbelieved no matter how many miracles he witness he still didn't believe he had no doubt seen the marvelous defeat of Moab he had see been startled at the tidings of the resurrection of shoe those shoe to my son he knew that Elijah had revealed better their secrets and smitten his hosts with blindness he had seen the bands of cereal blinded him brought into the heart of Samaria he knew the story of the widow who's always filled with field who's all filled all the vessels and redeemed her son he knew the cure of naman that was common no doubt common conversation in the court getting in the face of all this evidence he doubted his sin was unbelief Spurgeon was say it like this and this is just this is amazing he had a way with words he said unbelief has more phases than the moon it has more come colors than a chameleon common people today say the devil that he is sometimes in one shape or sometimes in another he said I'm sure this is true of Satan's firstborn child unbelief for its and for its forms or Legion at one time I see unbelief dressed as an angel of light it calls itself humility and it says I would not be presumptuous I dare not think that God would pardon me I'm too great a sinner false humility his unbelief hey man well I'm just humble no it's unbelief we call that him humility and thank God he says that our friend is in such a good condition he said I don't think God for any such delusion it's the devil dressed as an angel of light it is unbelief after all and other times we detect unbelief in the shape of the doubt of God's immutability the Lord has loved me but he will cast me off tomorrow he helped me yesterday and under the shadow of his wings I trust but will I receive help in the next time he may have cast me off he may be unmindful of his covenant and forgetful to be gracious that is unbelief because God cannot change his thought of you all glory to car a man can change this thought one day I like you the next day I hate you but if God ever put his name in you he cannot change his mind about you he said sometimes this Sun belief is embodied in the doubt of God's power surely this difficulty is too great and the Lord cannot deliver us we strive to get rid of our burden find that we cannot do it we think God is as short as ours so at God's arm is as short as our arm and his power is as little as a human's of power fearful form of unbelief is that doubt which keep us keeps men from coming to Christ which leads the sinner to distrust the ability of Christ to save him the doubt of the willingness of Jesus to accept so great a transgressor but the most hideous of all is the traitor in his true colours blaspheming God and madly denying his existence but in every one of them it's still unbelief amen brother Brennan would say the greatest enemy God's got greatest enemies faith God his unbelief he said you know even Jesus himself could not do mighty miracles because of their unbelief no matter what they saw but we find the battle comes in two minds the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham talked about the mind with what God took the heart Satan takes the mind and Satan is always there in your mind every day it seemed like every moment thoughts oh brother Brad will tell the teller and it's so true so simple he said you know you can't keep us like a bird you can't keep them from flying over your head but you can keep them from building a nest but meant some of us walk around with these huge nests look like ten crows living that dude hey man we got all kinds of things and we've allowed Satan to cram onto a listen I know I've been there we just build all these thought kingdoms you know in these thoughts and Satan's in our thoughts and our minds they say we're so low that we can't even get enough enough victory about us to raise their hands in church and the worship of God anymore why because of our thoughts but let me let you in on some it ain't your thoughts it's the devil's thoughts come on now it's his thoughts amen it's his iniquity it's his sin it's his lies it ain't mine hallelujah I don't know maybe it's safe to tell this here we're my dad Adam in his house these certain birds I won't call the name cuz it's basically illegal to shoot them but anyway they'd like to build big mud huts on the side of your house he was building his hood on the side of his house if we tried to shoo it off tried to be nice tried to do everything we could you know what take care of it kaboom yeah Oh paint no tree-huggers here tonight but that house wouldn't a bird's house he was trying to take something that wasn't his a place that wasn't his that never ever ever ever belonged to him and the devil wants to do the same thing to you take a part of your mind and your mind and take places that never ever ever ever ever ever ever belong to him hey man but I know one thing to take him out is a double-barrel shotgun the old and new testaments aim that promise right out here and say devil I'm not taking another moment from you hallelujah you can't help him from coming here but don't let him build a nest don't let him get a foothold take him back to the word you say the word is true you take the word he says let the spirit come to your heart open your mind and say thy word is true how many can say that tonight that word is true and Lord I ain't gonna pay any attention to how I feel or what anybody says what self says I'm stop I'm going out every Avenue all the frustrations and the doubts and unbelief that I ever had ever feeling I've ever had all the sickness I ever had everything else I had I'm pulling it all out I'm by passing by that and I'm coming straight to that spirit Oh Lord you said you made me a free also agent you are my son he said alright I'll open up my heart my mind come in Lord Jesus he said grab the faith the sword of the Spirit and say thus saith the Lord and scream hallelujah he said then go to cuttin every enemy in front of you that is cut every enemy else mouki spirit making you feel all down cut him out of the way cut that thing out with the word of the Lord and say the joy of the Lord is my strength get out of my way black you cut him with the word you keep going down through every sickness whoever disease take the word the spirit and the sword and go to whacking him with it Oh hallelujah let's grab our promises the night and go to whacking him with it this is how I fight my battles I don't fight my battles with my own abilities or my own mind I'm on intellectual understanding I fight my but this is how I fight my battles because he is the dissolver of doubts hallelujah he said when you whack it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again if I put a gun bullying that gun I shot and I miss I didn't go throw the gun away and say forget it and let him build no I went back out there with another bullet Amen it's time we quit being a bunch of sissies and allowing the devil to push things on us loud and comming now come on father's allowing him to come in our homes and take our children a wife it's time we take a stand and be courageous and stand on the Word of God put another bullet in the gun that bullet will work if it's aimed in the right direction listen if the bullet don't hit the mark it ain't the bullets fault just adjust a little bit amen he said it don't move whack it again maybe they ain't even moved yet in his service just keep on working he said whack it into your chip a hole through he said like a little chicken tipping itself out maybe you've been in a shell I've been all shelled in Satan's talk to you into your corner into this little hole you know what happens happens when we get in those conditions let me read you something right quick I may have read this here before but this is worth reading again if I can find it what happens when we get in our little in our little corner we get old we got old all into our own thoughts and it's our world becomes all about us and pretty soon we lose the burden for others we lose the burden for the other people and it becomes just about us and our problems times some of you start pecking your way out I can't do it this isn't a little chickie and a pet and an egg you want to help him so bad because you're you know you can able just come but you're killing me he'll die right there if you try anything he's trying to get his way out I can't do it for you brother Ron can't do it nothing ain't enough amount of counseling can help if you don't start pecking start whacking at it saying I'm not going I'm not gonna be this way this ain't Who I am listen you don't have to be living with a bitterness in your heart you don't have to be living with unforgiveness in your heart you know what he's what Jesus said in his own prairie said forgive us as we forgive others so what was he saying the same forgiveness that you give is the forgiveness you'll receive we want God to forgive us of all kinds of things like that man that Jesus talks about he was forgiven I don't I preached the sermon about heart trouble heart trouble over seventeen dollars 17 17 bucks remember the story Jesus telling though I'm going here but we're going there was a man went to the king he told him I hope you added it up it was in the millions of dollars millions of dollars and the king was going to take his children take everything he had and he begged for forgiveness and the King wrote it all off pardon he walks out the door of the church I mean of the of the of the castle walks outside and there was this man that owed him $17 and he took everything you had from him and throw him into prison the forgiveness that you give is the forgiveness you'll receive listen his life is a series of problems either you're in one now or you're just coming out of one or you're getting ready to go into another one but the reason for this that God is more interested in your character than your comfort hey man God is more interested in your character than your comfort God is more interested in making your life holy than he is making your life happy you can be happy here on earth but that's not the goal of life the goal is to grow in the character of Christ's likeness no matter how good things are in your life there's always something bad that needs to be worked on no matter how bad things are in your life there's always something good you can thank God for you can focus on your purpose or you can focus on your problems you can focus on your problems when you do that you're going into self-centeredness which is my problem my issues in my pain and but one of the easiest ways to get rid of the pain is to get your focus off yourself and get it back on to God and to others amen so we need to ask ourselves am I going to live for possessions or popularity am I going to be or am I gonna be driven by pressures and guilt and bitterness or materialism or am I going to be driven by God's purpose for my life so when I get up in the morning I want to sit on the side of my bed and say God if I don't get anything else done today I want to know you more and love you better see God put us on earth he didn't put us here just to fulfill it to do list because he's more interested than what I am than what I do therefore that's why he calls us human beings and not human doings so in happy moments praise God difficult moments seek God quite moments worship God painful moments trust God in every moment thank God hey man thank God I'm thinking because they called me in this out the greatest time with ever was Olivia and yes it's dark and yes it's terrible and there's a terrible oppression and all these things but I'm not looking to that I'm looking to the author and the finisher of my faith he put me here for a purpose he's the resolver of doubts mercy yo have no reason to disbelieve matter of fact it would be as they say a sin to disbelief how many times as God showed things in this church and has come to pass mercy how many miracles and things inside visions do we have to point to I think about the moment brother wrong was laying in the hospital and I'll never forget when it swept over me as he spoke about last night my dad had called me out to the bar and he came home early from a meeting because he just felt the pressure to go see brother Ron he just didn't know what was going on and she wanted to go see for herself he called me out that morning to the bar and he said he'd talk with you and he'd just flew in the Sunday night this is Monday morning and he says I got this I don't know we're getting word everything that they're putting out it sounds good he said but then brother berry coffee or somebody called him told him what was really going on and he said I got to go for myself he said I think I'm gonna do some things and I got tomorrow so I'll probably leave out Wednesday morning and it just you got to go now he said he looked at me I'll never forget he said now I said yes now now's the moment he saw what about your mom what about the chores I said dad we can take care of the chores I'll go tell the family come on out we'll take care of it and I'll run down there and tell mom to get a close-packed we're leaving a couple of minutes 3045 minute hours some wouldn't very long there was out the door and gone I'll never forget that moment but I think about that moment how many lives were impacted by that moment this church because at that moment brother Andrew wasn't where he is today God knows all things he's the dissolver of doubts this church wouldn't be where it is if that moment would had a different outcome and I'm talking about brother Ron's life we've got no reason to disbelieve we've seen it time after time enter town gods of dissolver of doubts he knows how to answer the questions in your life he knows exactly how to come to where you're living at and tell you exactly what you're going through and tell you exactly you're about to make a mistake you need to do it this way you need to go this way this is what the Lord said God knows all of me listen he knows your zip code he knows your address he knows the room he's sleeping and he's concerned about the most minut detail you know we put God somewhere way off somewhere and you know he's off in the clouds floating somewhere and you know he's left and we're here fighting it knowing he's right here among us he knows exactly what this age is like he knows exactly the pressures you're going through he knows exactly the trouble you're having on job or The Situation's you're facing there in your marriage or whatever he knows all about it down to the my new detail and listen let me tell you something this doesn't the meta the the anointing that we witness and then the Ministry of William Branham was not William Branham that was just a vessel God chose to use he could have chose somebody else but he chose William Branham but it would he said I was just there when it happened amen the anointing is still here in a fivefold ministry God knew we needed that gift he knew we needed every gift he knows this church needs you hallelujah amen listen you're not just on the sidelines anymore you're on the front lines Amen it's time to pick up your sword and go to fighting this enemy and say I'm not going to stand but some legalism I'm not going to stand for something ology or some Creed I'm not going to stand for some fool cold full of devil but some cold form of worship I am going to stand for truth and righteousness and godliness and holiness amen I've witness he is still among us he is still here he's stealing this over of doubt [Applause] Amen you're not just a teenager passing through or our man I don't know job just to fulfill a to-do list or something there's a purpose for your life this church was put here for a purpose hey man not just to take up the some acreage on the side of a hill but the purpose of Almighty God is being fulfilled well I can see it over there I can see no it's time you start looking he's he walking among us get rid of the ifs if God's if God you notice what happened to my little yes seen her last year's her her hair now is about halfway down her back sister Mariah one day God got rid of her if she knew or if God can and know he can but if he'll do it for me one morning she got up and her mama's in there making breakfast or doing something in the kitchen had a tape playing for the brand I'm singing that song I can I will I do believe got rid of her ifs she jumped up off her bed and pinned that little note down or I can I will I do believe and she nailed it to the wall and every morning she'd look at that son I can I will I do believe and she begin to believe it to where she'd walk into a prayer line and hand me some little bobby pin say bakla Timothy I'm going to wear these I'm going to wear these again amen and on Mother's Day she showed me her she took her hat off for me said look at my head he was a bald head but I can I will I do believe look at my hair it was a bald head Mother's Day and just a few weekends later on Father's Day weekend we had our family cam brother Ron was there he called her to the front probably not knowing what she was about to do and she jerked off her hat and it was a full head of hair I can I will I do believe he is the solver of doubts all he needs is one believer one person is say yes Lord I can't I will I do believe this is my promise this belongs to me Satan you alive her hallelujah is there somebody here that says that's me I can't I can't believe it he said it that's good enough for me hallelujah hallelujah I'm gonna tell you he's the same God for my sister Esther I can I will I do believe hallelujah the same God that gave a little girl hair is the same God little stone alive in a world we know it already he's already done it before he can do it again I can I will I do oh come on somebody I can't believe I will believe Satan whack whack I can I will I do believe hey there young person to say yes this message is for me this Holy Ghost is for me Satan your liar it belongs to me I can't believe it cuz he said so [Applause] glory to God is that somebody just wanna say hallelujah hallelujah what is this sound I hear I hear the Chariots of Fire at age of the fire I hear the mighty God the rest Imani win hallelujah that same one is in the barely tonight and he's lifted up the pressure and he's lifted up fear and has taken it all away and where is that going back to he belongs to hallelujah glory to God in the highest I can't believe blessed be the name of Lord yeah just a few more minutes if I can find out where I'm at for a moment he says it was Moses after being in the line of his royal seed the seed of Abraham he was sent down to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel God had give him signs and wonders to reform to smite the earth and bring forth frogs and fleas and darkness and hail and rain and fire and done all these miracles and then let him by the hand of Jehovah there came a time when he met the gate between him and the promised land there was a Red Sea a bar crossing their way they were him to one side by Pharaoh's army mountains and desert the Red Sea but Moses stepped forth to possess the gate of his enemy he crossed the Red Sea dry land as he's walking on a dusty road he was possessing why because God said so makes all the difference in the world when God says so but it was only a few years later when trials come a few days the church got all shook up said so easy for a congregation of people to do that when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be he said God makes it that way listen this this is this is going to kind of shake you maybe I don't know God brings tensions into the church every Sun that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he let's sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you to prove you to show the world that you are truly the seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disaster he permits friends to turn against you he permits all these things he turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do it all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of affliction he could turn the neighbors against you he can turn the church against you he can do almost anything it's God's will for him to do it we're taught that it's more precious to us than gold brother Danny del mundo just spoke a wonderful service on the making of a bride and he took it out of Jo Jo you read the first chapter of Job and see all the destruction and all the loss that he took but then you can go down to the end of Jo and see how it was restored double and in the middle job made the declaration though God slayed me I'm gonna trust him and he made the Decorah here he made the declaration it said amen the Lord knoweth the way I take and then I'll come as out as pure gold he said sometimes we're so concerned about what's going on in the middle of it he said but we need to start looking at the end hey man if the children of Israel would have done that God said I'm going to take you out of Egypt and I'm going to take you into a land flowing with milk and honey he never mentioned one word about the Red Sea never said nothing about the desert never didn't say anything about them maybe hungry or thirsty or drier didn't say nothing about any of that he just said I'm gonna take you out and I'm gonna take it in that should have been enough because God had it already taken care of the Red Sea was taken care of he already had a rock in the wilderness he already had plenty of food supplied he already had it taken care of but what happened they got their eyes on the middle and forgot who he was at the beginning and what he said he was going to be at the end come on somebody he said to you I'll take you out of your sins or your Creed's and your dogmas and I'm gonna take you in he don't mention on what happens in between but he's already got the answer for it God's not concerned he's not threatened he he's never had the thought of worry how is it going to happen how am I gonna get a bride without spot with her he said I'll have a bride without spot without wrinkle he says what about Abraham and Isaac on the mountain the one promise was given by his loyalty knowing his faith in Jehovah is through that and that along God looked down and said his seed shall possess the gates I swore by myself that I'll do these things there's no one greater he could swear by himself but he saw swear by so he swore by himself then he let Abraham be tested to that final place he's got to test you and me for that final moment at time of decision when everything is away from you you have to stand alone there but hallelujah he says stand alone walk out there and say though God slay me yet I'll trust him that is the seed of Abraham these the one who gave the promise no matter what the rest of themselves says what the rest of them do ask for me in my house we're gonna serve the Lord if the rest of them says there's nothing to experience it's a bunch of excitement for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord he's not like to take a word Paul right there sit in the way that's called heresy so worship I the God of our fathers though there be tattlers come in the church though there be twisters there will be all kinds of false prophets and everything come among the churches and the people of God in the neighborhood but for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and indifferent for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord though if somebody was prayed for and didn't get well has nothing to do with it as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord amen God said so men's not malleable but god is man get your you got to get your mind you get your mind on the man he'll make a mistake maybe not willfully better do it God will let him have it he'll shake your faith away from Mama premier but our faith is not in the wisdom of man but in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that was a true seed of Abraham rests their promise a man he said when the spies came back said oh you know that's foolish to go down there there's no need of going there they got great Giants they got great dish they got great walls for grasshoppers but he said it was Joshua he said he was a little bitty runt tiny fella but he see I've seen him jump up on a box and say men and brother to those two million people what more than able we're not just able we're more than able that why because God gave the promise it was their possession God gave it to him it didn't matter what the opposition was lelou you and he says there you stand today there stands the Church of the Living God I don't care what anyone says what the doctor says what anything says what the unbeliever says we are more than a match for anything that comes along whew that's a direct quote from the prophet of God we're more than a match for anything that comes along we're Abraham's seed no matter who the enemy is God gave the promised healing is your possession salvation is your possession the Holy Ghost is your possession thousands of preachers may come and say it ain't so but the seed of Abraham says it's so God said they could have it they believed it because it was a promise Joshua stood there into the little fella I don't care how big they are I don't care how bad they are I don't care what kind of spear they got I don't care how high their cities are whoa God gave it to us he dissolved Joshua's doubts Joshua had seen enough I believe mercy how much did they need to see to believe he tried in his heart their doubts plagues destroyed Egypt they don't need you've gathered up what they had left and come after he destroyed the rest of them then there's a rock that follows I mean time they needed a drink there was a rock gushers of water food in the wilderness the shoes never wore out their clothes didn't worth that wasn't a sick one among them how much did they need to see to believe and I asked you the same thing how much do you need to see to believe cedar Abraham doesn't look at anything natural they look at the promise God gave it I believe it all those men were great men down through the Bible but they died and right in the fire line but finally one day in Bethlehem of Judah the royal seed was born all the rest of them were just shadows foretelling but now here comes the fulfillment the royal sea born by a virgin with the power in his veins to conquer death and hail God made a promise an ordinary man couldn't do it but if God makes a promise he's bound to it and said how are we going to do it Joshua died Moses died all of them died God said he shall possess the gate of his enemy therefore if God said it he has to provide a way to prove it to bring it to pass the royal sea was born he was tempted in every manner like we were just as you have to be tempted the devil taking him spitting in his face ripping his beard out on a cross crucified and here he died in the middle of it all he didn't Rob back he held his peace and he died today is brother Branham said he died too the Sun got ashamed of it of itself nature got ashamed and failed to operate properly anymore the Sun went down in the middle of the day the stars wouldn't come out he died into the elements was so black and I could he said I can imagine nature said let me die with him brother than the devil sent his precious sold at the bottom pits of Hell there the gates open he came out on the third day and conquered it his seed shall possess the gate of his enemy he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the gave grave and he's more than conquerors through him who loved us oh the day of Pentecost he sent that power back to those who believe the baptism the Holy Ghost to bring them into the promise and now we have the right to conquer every sickness oh we can shout about that but he said we don't even have to conquer it it's already conquered we just have to claim the promise and go take it it's already been delivered to you yes as conquered hell is come sicknesses conquered temptation is conquered all devils is conquered the grave is conquered and we stand there with possession and we didn't have to fire a shot hallelujah he said in the Church of the Living God leads the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God leaves power to overcome all temptation in possession of the church leads to power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ what so ever you desire ask he's a dissolver of doubts have you seen enough to believe what he said in the Church of the Living God has the privilege of standing and seeing a conquering resurrected Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God standing present living in his church doing the same thing he did then we can possess every gate all do you mind me telling you what's a mungus who's among us there's no God like Jehovah there's no God like my God he's as his Horeb doubts he's the deliverer of the bound he's a healer of the sick and the afflicted he's a miracle worker he's a Promise Keeper he's a light in the darkness he's a chain breaker he's a wave maker and he's working even now even when you don't see him he's still working hallelujah even when the devil's whisper in your ear and say it ain't so he's still working even when you don't feel it he's still working even you don't see nothing going on around you he's still at work he's still healer he's still deliverer he's still setting the captive free come on somebody hallelujah hey still moving among his people he who walks among us he breaks every chain he's here tonight to break every chain can you hear those chains falling I hear the chain of depression falling I hear the chain of anxiety and fear falling I hear the chain of sickness falling at your feet tonight there's no God like my god Oh hallelujah he is here right now to deliver every captive have you seen enough to believe tonight have you seen enough in your church to know he's still a healer he's still a deliverer he's still a holy ghost filler then if I wanted the Holy Ghost right now I receive it in the name of Jesus Christ if I need a healing right now say yes Lord I can I will I do believe hello hallelujah if I needed freedom from that depression I would say right now

one but you know I was I was with our young people this past week as we were practicing songs of worship here at my house and I had all of the young people begin to go around and tell about what their expectations were for the meeting and there were several that were saying you know it feels like we're we're just on we're on the climax of something the services keep building up and building up and sister Katie Grimm's words were to that they've been building up so much that it feels like we're on the cusp of a great breakthrough I believe the breakthrough started this evening I believe it started this weekend I believe that I believe that there are Eagles that are hatching out that are flying above all of their doubts and all of their fears hallelujah what a God that we serve we are under great expectation from a Living God to come one more time we want to be praying for the upcoming meetings and the things that are in store and so we want to dismiss all of the cysts or all those other brothers at this time but sister Connie would like to meet with all of the sisters just for a few moments so as the brothers will dismiss you this evening and the brothers are dismissed so the sister will stay just for a few moments and then I'd like to speak with the musicians after that hey man god bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus
