powerful group of people what a powerful group of people to be standing here in the darkest of all the days to realize we are that people of the last age and amen amen God richly bless you tonight and and we'll just let you turn to the Bible today we'd like to look over in the Book of Revelations chapter 3 Book of Revelations chap 3 and: 14 and as you're turning there we want to just remind you that there will be a baptism tomorrow after service and uh anybody uh anybody that would like to be baptized I just see one of the deacons there at the back and I know that we have a few that are Desiring to be baptized in the name of the Lord so if there's any others um we just ask that you uh just make yourself known or just come spontaneously you know so we don't have to have plans but we got plenty of water for you so we just uh we just we're we're under great anticipation for for everything that God has in store for us in this last age we don't we don't fully get to see the complete vision of it all but we recognize that we are the people of the reality of it and we're going to live out we're going to be living out the the very final moments and I believe that we're I believe that we're right here I believe we're right here here upon the the coming of the Lord and I believe that with everything that's within us I want to push I want to push to get that last seed and it doesn't matter doesn't matter what country it comes from it doesn't matter what continent that last seed is in we want to do everything that's within our power to preach this gospel with everything that's within us and we want that last seed because when that last seed matures we will go home amen I know that's that's the desire of every every Christian is to go home because this world is not ours amen Revelations 3 and: 14 and under the angel of the Church of the Le oans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thy Work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now notice this is not the individual but this is the church so then because Thou Art lukew and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with iive that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to set with me in my throne even as as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne it's wonderful to be recognized in the Throne of the Overcomers verse 22 then he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches let's just bow our hearts just before the Lord just now Heavenly Father we approach you just now Lord we are your children and we have dedicated our life to your entire work father that everything that everything that is within us Lord we want to declare that that you are God and there is none like you and we invite you just now Lord to become Lord over our life and over every situation father the songs have been sung and Lord your your beautiful presence has came down amongst us and we invite the Lamb of God to come and to allow the blood of Jesus Christ to wash over our lives just now by the preaching of the word I pray that you would restore our heart Hearts to a place of worship to a place where we have been destined to be in Lord of anything that would be upon our old nature our sticky nature I pray that we would just release ourself to to the promises of God the things that you have laid out in this generation we want to be the Fulfillment of that father so God I pray that you would come and begin to speak to us through Thy word tonight you have dealt with me for quite some time upon this thought Lord Lord and you've allowed me to be able to begin to put this in a sermon this week and I pray that you would just help me move aside father even even I know that there are those that are sitting here tonight that have have infirmities in their body they have sicknesses that are going on even myself I need a touch from you and I pray God that you would just come amongst us by the preaching of the word and by your stripes may we declare that we are healed and we are delivered and I pray that you would cast Satan out today by the preaching of the word and may you break every spirit that would hold us back whether it be whether it be lust whether it be Pride or whether it be just a little bit of condemnation I pray that you'd move every bit of unbelief out father so that you could have your way in the service father we are asking for a supernatural meeting father and our hearts are hungering for more of you so we ask Lord that you would just come amongst us tonight as we pray these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen may God richly bless you you may be seated you may be seated in the presence of the Lord amen amen in the morning in church age brother Brandon picks up the picks up the last verse of all the all that is written in the seven Church ages it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches of each age he said in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says he said if you're a Christian you will get back you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every Messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age he said repent and come back to the word from this first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelation there is only one reason for God's dis pleasure it's the leaving it's leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor it's back to the word and out of this out of this out of this context tonight I'd like to speak to you on a fresh Revival a fresh Revival that a fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age and I believe that that there is there is a call upon the uh upon the believer's heart in this generation and is to be zealous therefore and repent I believe that it it's the Zeal of this hour and I believe that when you get when you begin to hunger and thirst for almighty God that it creates a a sense of urgency on the inside of Believers and we recognize that when elaser come to where he begin to sweat things out that he was looking for a bride for for Isaac that there he begin to pray and there he begin to pray a supernatural prayer and he begin to ask God to do something very super Supernatural and there he be to pray a certain way that that God would send out a woman that would fit the description that would fit fit the description of his prayer and no more than elaser had released had released that prayer out of his mouth there Rebeca came out and I believe that I believe it was Supernatural I believe it was Supernatural how that how that he prayed that and she came out at that very moment and William Brandon would tell us he said no more than your heart goes to hungering and thirsting for God he he said some kind of a holy ghost Revival will break out somewhere he said something will take place he said a neighbor might get healed and come and tell you about it he said but something will take place to let you see that the angel of the Lord is moving ain't that powerful as soon as you go to hungering for it as soon as you get to calling and thirsting for a for a Revival that God will release something that God will release something to let you know that the angel of the Lord is moving ain't it powerful to know know that that if you've got a hunger on the inside of you whether it be for whether it be for healing or whether it be for something Supernatural or whether it be for the word of God that God will meet you and every time that he meets you it is Supernatural when he comes to you in that kind of situation because when men get desperate and men get in a spot of emergency that's when God shows up because God is the only one that can show up in a time of emergency and gets you out of and I believe that if we're ever if we're going to say that we're an emergency that the Le Odyssey and church age could say that they are in a spot of desperation to realize that they are in need of something that is that is greater than something that is man-made they are in need of something that is more than just a church building but they are in they are in need of a Revival and when men go to Desiring and a Desiring a Revival then the spirit of God will show up and bring a Revival to meet the hour or meet the situation of the need now will brandom said in broken cister I hope you don't mind quotes tonight but he said education can never bring life he said it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just an intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible a word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and he said when it falls today and quickens you you get the same results that you did in Acts chapter 2 you see it always has and it always will be it's because the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere so we can't have an intellectual Revival when we're in need of a word Revival and you can watch it in every age that there was there's always twins there was always a word Revival and there's an intellectual Revival in every single age but how you tell the difference between a true Revival and a false Revival is a false Revival will take people away from the word of the hour but a true Revival will bring people and draw them them right back to the word of the hour and we've had man-made revivals we've had theological revivals but what we are experiencing in this hour is a manifested word of God as it's come back and and it is it has brought us into a word Revival and what this word Revival has done to the Church of the Living God it has caused us to put our life or put our bodies on verge of a body change you see that's what the word that's what the word wants to do it wants to be made flesh in our bodies and it is we recognize that what we are a part of is a manifestation of the word of the hour that you recognize that the condition that you are in is because the spirit of God has set up the atmosphere to create a word Revival what you are a part of no man did this what you are a part of no school did this what you're a part of no intellectual Revival caus this you see what is it the spirit of God conditioned the atmosphere so that we could have a word Revival you see even William brandham recognized that his own children needed a word Revival even when William brandham was standing there in certain meetings he he said now he said if you seen me come in and I winked at a little girl he said I was winking at my daughter out there he said he said it takes an atmosphere he said it takes an atmosphere to bring the supernatural he said an i he said that's the reason in the purpose purpose of this is for the atmosphere or the Supernatural and he said I'm wanting my daughter to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said it takes an atmosphere like this you see William Brandon was even though he was a prophet of the age he recognized that his children needed the same atmosphere that you have need of you see but he's only going to appear to those that are looking for him you see then when when he goes down there when when Jesus goes down there unto a woman in Samaria because the Samaritans knew he said you know they were looking for a messiah and he said anybody that's looking for a messiah he will come he said if you're here looking for him tonight he will meet you how many come here looking for him tonight he said if you're here looking for him tonight he will meet you he said but if you're not looking for him he's not looking for you either woo he said if you're not looking for him he's not looking for you either he said if you're not looking for him he will never come to you but God only ever appears to those that are elected for the hour you see there's so many of people that heard the word but he never appeared to them why because they were unbelievers from their birth but God is in this generation has elected a people that he would appear himself would come and he would show himself to I'm think thankful to be a part of a people that he's that he's elected to appear to now just indulge me just for a minute when William brandham said what we need is not a new membership he said it's the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church again old fashion Pentecostal Revival in the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost again he would say what we need is back to the Bible back to real Holiness back to back to where people can have faith again again he said what we need is the gospel from the pulpit to straighten up all the way from the pulpit to the janitor what we need the oldfashioned St Paul Revival that the Bible holy ghost days God doesn't change it all again what he said he said what we need is a Revival a Revival doesn't mean bring in new members it's revive what we already got I believe we've got some great things as a church of the Living God but I believe that you can have more I believe there's more God for you here tonight I believe there's more Deliverance here for you tonight I believe there's more of the message for you here tonight I believe there's greater understanding for you here tonight and again he would say in the absolute and he said the only thing that you want to do is dance in the spirit and speak in tongues he said that's all you know about he said that's all that seed that has been planted he said but what we need is the Full Gospel planted in a full heart with full power to bring back a full absolute you see God put you in Revival a supernatural being with Divine Healing and divine power and divine workings and so forth by miracles of god put the church the Rapture bride that's got oil in her lamp put her in Revival there is a supernatural God that maybe you have never witnessed in your life or maybe you never seen but because you have received a word Revival you recognize that there was a supernatural being that put you in Revival well I say it like this if if he put me in Revival there ain't no man going to take me out of it there's no idea going to take me out of it there's no sickness that can take me out of it there's no depression that can take me out of it if he put me in it then I ain't coming out come on somebody I didn't put myself in this message I didn't bring myself back to the word but he put me in it Hallelujah if you're not in Revival then you need a change you would say well I I we're waiting on Labor Day for a Revival that's absolutely false the bride is in a word Revival that can't be taken away from her that can't be robbed away from her what is it the word Revival Came To You by the preaching of the message you see a Revival is going on it's a sewing that has taken place and the denominations are sewing their seed but a denomination will only sow or only reap a denomination but what has been swn in this generation will reap a bride for Jesus Christ it's a word Revival that has taking place and the only thing that can water a message seed is the anointing of Malachi 4 you see you are anointed you are anointed with a you are being watered with an anointing that would only prod produces bride material you see you can take this anointing and pour it on the rest of the churches but it'll never produce on the anything anything else but what they already are because the seed was already what it was before it ever got deposited but he put something on the inside of you that you're not just Lutheran that you're not just Wesleyan that you're not just Pentecostal but bride material and only bride material can be watered by a bride anointing Hallelujah you see because every seed is going to bring forth of its kind you see that's why William Brandon would say about you that you are a word kind of people you see you're a word kind of people because as just as Jesus or or God would say there in the beginning let every let every seed bring forth after its kind and you know that you are a word kind you're a word kind that even David was a word kind that David was a man that was made after God's Own Heart you see when God creates a man he creates him of his own kind but David was the kind of man that that God would say you're a man after my own heart because David was quick to repent David would say I've hid Thy word in my heart I've hid your word in my heart that I might not sinned against you and brother Bram said this about David I found it so amazing he said the only thing that David needed was the rain you see he was a he was a kind of God he was a seed of God but the only thing that he needed he said but you see you see the Holy Ghost had not been given yet the Holy Ghost had not been given yet he said I've hid it in My Heart Lord but it won't blo out and act like it should here's a man that was made after God's kind but he said I've hid Thy word in my heart I've hid it in there he said I've constantly i' I've hung it on my dead my bed post I I studied it day in and day night I I put it on my eyelids but you see when Jesus came which was the word made manifest he took the germ of life out of it and brings it back to the word of God again and if David's cup run over if David's cup run over then how much more should your cup be running over come on somebody this is not a Revival that takes you from one meeting to the next meeting and you're still waiting for the Holy Ghost but the Hallelujah but this message has given you power to stay in Revival stay in Revival and if David was a man without the Holy Ghost and it could say that my cup runneth over how much more as Sons and Daughters of almighty God should we be saying here my cup's running over come on somebody if you are not in Revival you've missed the message I'm going to be very plain with you if you are not in Revival you have missed what is going on let me tell you this I don't need somebody to pump me up Prime me up try to press me up or press me down I am in Revival come on somebody there ain't no preacher that can Pump It Up all I simply do is preach the gospel and the gospel do what he said it would do the message came to put you in Revival Hallelujah you see the message is Christ the message is Christ and that's what the the call of the hour is is back to the word you see the reason why that you as the body of Jesus Christ or inter waps or cycle it's because you've been feeding on the unfailing body word you've been eating you've been eating this book you've been eating this book you've been you've been feeding on it you've had over 1,00 sermons you've got spiritual food in due season and if there ever was a time of famine the church the world is in famine but while they are in famine you're in Revival you've been feeding on this you've been feeding on this and what power gave ezekiel's bones to come back to life again is the same power that has put a church in its position I'll say this this word Revival this word Revival has put you in position to believe that all things are possible you remember when William Bam's out there on Lake Michigan he got to watch in that Lake how that that wake that Lake was it was jumping and it was it was breathing and all the waves were splashing around and it was it was foaming up he said I got to studying that thing out he said there wasn't no more water in that than when it when it was sitting still when it was completely glass he said but the only difference was is there was a wind behind it that created all that jumping that created all that shouting that created all that praising let me say this to you you've had the same power on the inside of you but let the wind get behind it come on somebody you've heard the message all your life but let the wind get behind it come on little stream what are you bubbling for what makes you bubble is it the deer is it the Cockroaches is it the antelopes is it the denominations is it the world absolutely not it's something on the inside of me what makes you stay hungry for the word what makes you feed on this what makes you pray what makes you stay make you stay dignitary or stay in a spot of Revival what is it you can't explain it to nobody else they don't understand how your prayer life has waned they don't understand how your prayer life has not went away but it's got stronger it's something on the inside of you come on somebody it's something on the inside of you to keep you in Revival Hallelujah now notice this leay odyssean age that God spews a church out of his mouth not individuals not any place in the Bible does it say that we are in his mouth but the Bible says that we are engraved upon the palms of his hand so the word has got to be in his mouth as it said in Matthew 4:4 but he answered and said unto him it is written man said not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you see the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know that the church is his body he said is there is it here taking his place he said what will be in in the mouth of the church the word the word you see every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word well you say brother Andrew I can't seem to live right I can't seem to overcome let me ask you what's in your mouth I can't to I seem to keep falling down and seeing what's in your mouth come on somebody I seem to I seem to always be in a spot of depression what's in your mouth you see if you want power to come into your life if you want vision to come in your life if you want demonstrations of the Holy Ghost to come into your life then you've got to get back to the word because Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if you want to know where the secret lies to Heaven power to Heaven anointing if you want to understand Hallelujah if you want to understand how to be a part of the brid's Revival get back to the word get back to the word you see you see where Samson got him s is in trouble was he let go of the word of God you see he gave God his strength he gave God his he gave God his he gave God his power but he gave to Lia his heart he gave God he gave God of his power what did he do he shared his secret he shared his secret where his power was with a woman of the night and William brandham comes and he speaks to brandom Tabernacle he said brandom Tabernacle the Philistines are on you he said where you've told your secret where your power comes from he said Pentecost he said the Philistines are on you he said but how are we going to have a Revival in our day how can we have it when the regular Revival Giver is bound by the word it's bound by the world you see because men gave themselves over to money they gave them themselves up to they gave themselves up to the world they gave themselves up to their jobs and the world kept creeping in and it bound Hallelujah it bound Jesus and it couldn't have a Revival on the inside of him but William bradam said this he said here is the only H hope that I have this morning is to wind up my message is while Samson was bound that a new suck of hair begin to grow out you may have been bound with the world but let your hair grow out Let Your Glory come out you may have got strung out and you may have started cutting your hair Hallelujah you may have been start cutting your hair and letting the world come in and letting the world rob you from this that or the other but I pray and my only hope is that this message has produce the power on the inside of you to unbind the Revival Giver unbind the Revival Giver I say it like this like the message of the hour has got the vitamin to put power back in the Church of the Living God so a real true Prophet points back to the word of the Lord a real true Prophet points back to the word of the Lord so the promise of the Lord the promise of the Lord not a declaration that a church has made but a declaration that God has made back to the word of the Lord that's what a true Prophet is going to do you see the reason why you see the reason why sent Malachi 4 was to come and unbind the Revival Giver because over Seven Ages they had bound him up by Creeds and dogmas they bound him up but here in this generation there was an eagle Prophet that pointed us right back to the word of God and came here and Loos the Seven Seals every every fundamental doctrine that men have built up and build up their ideas there was a message that struck this generation that Unbound the Revival Giver William Brandon said in the Feast of the trumpets he's been bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas he said but the church is going to be liberated again I'll say what this message did it put you in a position to have a word Revival even Jesus would say that where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered you see you see why Jesus likened you not only His prophets but he likened you to Eagles is because Eagles don't eat some dead carryon they don't eat what Luther eats they don't eat what Wesleyan eat they don't eat some dead rabbit on the side of the road like a Hulk does you can't you can't feed this Bride on some man-made idea or some man-made Revival but what it takes is a fresh kill of the word you see you can't even feed this bride Pentecostalism because she won't eat it because it's dead where is it dead at the life left the stock and went into the seed come on somebody this word puts you in position for a body change a Revival is stirring something that you already got where'd you get the power at where'd you get the anointing at you had it ever since ever since God saw you before the foundation of the world you didn't look like a son you didn't act like a son but God saw something on the inside of you that was worth redeeming every generation each generation gets a fresh chance a fresh chance an opportunity at the fresh word I'm quoting to you I'm giving you quotes tonight cuz I ain't going to let the devil beat you around on this is my idea but I'm telling you that this is a word Revival that was given by a word Prophet that was anointed for this generation and he said that every generation has its opportunity at the fresh word of God that's why I believe in preaching these youth camps that's why I believe in believe believing in preaching to these young people that they can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that it wasn't just for our oldtimers it wasn't just days gone by but I believe it's for every son every daughter of God that you can have a fresh chance of this word hallelujah the devil's tried to take every chance away from you but God said I've giv you another chance the world's tried to rob you of chances but God said I'm giving you a chance when the world discounted you and the world tried to push you aside God said I'm giving you a chance come on somebody you've heard me say it before you gave G you gave drugs a chance you gave the world a chance you gave politics a chance come on somebody you gave your God your job a chance you gave money a chance why not give God a chance he's giv you a chance where you say well I failed him one time I say get back up again because God's not just the god of first chances he's not just a god of second Second Chances he's said God of third fourth and fifth chances maybe you've been to the doctor and the doctor ain't gave you a chance but give God a chance give him an opportunity to show his power to show his demonstration to show that he still God what is it brother Ron that's held you all these years it's a fresh Revival and it ain't something that just happened years ago but it's as fresh now it's as fresh now as it was then now go study in the church age book brother random said in the Ephesian Church age he said you watch he said that God that the cycles of Revival and death never die he said when it looks like the glimmer of Hope's going out God comes in light the fire again you see in every age in every generation he's given them an opportunity because when it looks like all hope is gone God lights the fire again I'm thankful to be a part of this generation I'm thankful to be a part of this message I'm thanking to be sitting here understanding what the message is that it ain't just a new book that it ain't just a new theology but it's a person it's a person we hav't encountered a power that the world can't understand you see in every age he is raised up when when Jews when the Jews rejected him and pushed him aside God raised up a gentile bride you see in every age I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of History here but in every age he gives a thres chance the word when you look at Columba there in the th tyan Church age which means laxed and loose or hazy brother brandom said it was an illegitimate time but Columba believed the word of God he believed in the power of God and you go to study and I'm not going to take you through it all but you go to studying Out Columbus life he had some powerful Miracles that happened this man took a took a message he took a message of what he knew and he shook he shook all of is he shook all of Ireland and he shook all of Scotland and he stood right there and he cursed all the snakes I wish he'd have done that in America but he cursed all the snakes out of Ireland and in Scotland and the pillar of fire was was identified in Columbus's Ministry that men would recognize that when Columba was praying in his house that the pillar of fire would come flying and showing through his house what was it when men like when when St Parton or St Martin would stand there and he would preach the gospel he didn't just preach it from some Theologian idea he preached it in power and in demonstration and when he would walk into cities and he would preach the gospel to a city and they wouldn't show him no respect that even God when they wouldn't show this prophet of that age any respect God even burn up that King's robe and the back of him and made him rise up and salute the prophet of God that entered that City he said even his seat caught on fire what he was sitting there on the throne because God is going to give an opportunity to every every age and every time to have a chance at the word of God men like Luther raised up and nailed 95 pieces to the church door and he refused to recant and he created he started one of the greatest reformations that ever has been and it said about say it said about Luther about Marth and Luther he said it was no strange thing how that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it he said but how Luther could hold his head above the fanaticism that followed his Revival he said it's been that way in every reformation and in every age and the same way it is today there's a lot of fanaticism that's tacked on to call Divine Healing and signs and wonders he said but what does a bogus dollar represent a bogus dollar speaks that there's a real one somewhere to think that they saw Martin and they saw Luther rise up in power and they said we'll identify with that but they went on their own false Revival but just because there's false revivals does not mean that what you're a part of is false come on somebody just because people build their campfires around wrong theologies of the message does it mean that this revival is wrong come on somebody you're going to have a whole lot of fanaticism that comes in and tries to identify it it's that close to being a reality that that that in this last age that Christ would come that Christ would come and the Antichrist would come and it would be that close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible but because there's a gene SE of God fanaticism never catches the idea or never catches a soul of a true born again son and daughter of God when it come to the Welch Revival when Wesley started preaching the power of God would fall and tens of thousands would begin to faint at the presence of the Lord when you study out the Walsh Revival you see that Walsh Revival it was a jubil time for them people it started out just a bunch of illiterate people just a preaching the gospel and the power of the glory of God Begin to Fall until businessmen would go to work and sit down at their desk and weep like babies close their businesses farms in the farmers in the field farmers in the field would be sitting on their plows and plowing they'd stop their teams and get get out in the field rank Sinners would raise up their hands to God and cry out for Mercy people walking on the roads everywhere whistles started blowing and everything else what was it there was a revival going on there brother random said that that men didn't even know where to where to put the source on of where the Welch Revival even came from it just started with a bunch of illiterate people they started praying men like William Cary he raised up under that Welsh Revival and gave was gave himself to foreign missions and he translated the Bible into 42 different languages men like Evan Roberts at 12 years old gave himself over to God he looked like any other child he worked alongside of his father in the dangerous wst coal mines in the 1890s and he would spend the next 11 years working with his father until he was 23 years old for it was in those Minds he said that there though in those Minds it impacted his life more than any other time in his life because they are in their minds God begin to stir Evan Robert's heart to pray for his beloved dwells and the more he prayed the more he began to have a god-ordained vision showing whales being lift up lifted up into heaven he said those days made him a man of prayer not a man who prays but a man of prayer every day he would spend no less than one hour in prayer often much longer than that he arranged his schedule to to include that hour and if he woke up late then it was his work that had to wait and not his prayer oh my my my my my how mean y'all been late now don't go tell your boss just cuz you're late you was praying but men like Evan Robert's got a hold was a part of the W Revival and they created such a stir with the noble men from America when they went over there to the W they went over there and they was looking for it they was looking for it they come out there and their dignified collars and everything else and there was a policeman out there that was standing out there had a whistle in his mouth and had a had a had a club in his hand it was just whirling around and these noble men begin to ask that police officer said where is the Welsh Revival at he looked at them and said you're in the middle of it you're in the middle of it I am the W Revival well if you're looking for a word Revival and the brid's Revival I want to say this to you you're in the middle of it you're in the middle of it I am the brides Revival I am the brides Revival I am the brides Revival I am the bride's Revival let me say this to you if you want your children to get a hold of this Holy Ghost put them right in the middle of it don't push it off for days gone by tell them it's right here don't push it off and say well God's coming in maybe 10 or 15 years tell them he's coming today he might come for you today he might come for you tomorrow but you better be ready Hallelujah you're looking at it and there God would raise up the isua Street Revival and it's one of the most historical series of Revival meetings that's ever took place on the face of the earth when a colored man that was blinded in one eye humbled his heart with no education he was looking for a fresh Revival he grew up under Ministry that believed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when churches invited him out there to Los Angeles and they found out that he had a view on the baptism of the Holy Ghost the churches barred him from coming and preaching in their her churches but if God send you to do something you will not find any excuse not to preach come on somebody it's Satan that brings up excuses it's Satan that brings up trouble it's Satan that's trying to stop you from believing this message but William Seymour was not discouraged because churches didn't want him preaching on the Holy Ghost he started going to little he went started going to Little House meetings and he started preaching the gospel about God is go pouring out his spirit and a restoration of gifts of speaking in tongues and there he begin to preach in homes there he begin to preach in this home and that home and then he went to a little bit omission and one night while he was a preaching on April the 9th of 1906 he started preaching right there and all of a sudden one started speaking in tongues and another started speaking in tongues and before long six were speaking in tongues well the word started getting out that God was creating a Revival right there on the isua street they had to move from the building and go outside people were being healed some of the greatest healings you ever heard of when you go to studying out the isusa Revival happened right there men came from all over the world to be a part of the isua Revival but it stopped in 1915 and ever since then Pentecost the denomination has been trying to restore and go back to them days of Revival again out of that Revival men like Paul Raider would catch fire he was an instrument and sending scores of missionaries to countries all over the world in addition to influencing hundreds of young men to enter the ministry men like Charles finny would rise up there in Rochester North New York he would stand there he would preach the gospel in the street and from five miles away conviction would strike and men would drop their lunch Pals and give their heart to almighty God it was two women in finny's church at the time said finny you got a great hold on the word but what you really need is a holy ghost what you really need is a holy ghost you might have a good hold on this message but what you really need is a holy ghost you might have listened to every single tape and you may have read your Bible through three or four times but what you really need is a holy ghost He said I tell you one thing he said I've got the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost said no sir I pray that you get the Holy Ghost well this bothered Charles finny and while he was at work one day every day he get out there behind behind his office and he get down there and pray and ask God to do something for him how while he was out there day after day after day of praying he was out there in a bush a tree branch begin to break and Charles he jumped up real quick because he was ashamed that his boss would catch him out there praying and he found out it was nobody but Jesus and he started thinking there I am I'm ashamed of my boss if he'd catch me praying I'd be ashamed of my boss he'd catch me praying he said but how much greater is my Jesus over my boss and he got down and he started praying and brother bam said he got so much in the presence of God that Charles finny started screaming and shouting and going all over the city he he said he made such a fool of himself that he hid himself behind the door said God if you don't help me stop this I'm going to make a fool of you when's the last time that you got so under the anointing I'm not just talking about Pentecost I'm talking about I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power under salvation hallu it created such a stir in Charles finny that he stood there he was just testing out the Acoustics in a building one day he stood there and said repent or perish and a man that was up there in the balcony dropped over the it scared him so bad that he dropped over G he dropped over and right there what was what was it Charles finny was stirred he was stirred by a fresh Revival you think about this how precious that God entrusted these Souls of men with the true word of their age men like Moody that would read lead over five million souls to Jesus Christ men like morai ham would raise up and out of his ministry would rise a Billy Graham and William random said of anybody that's got the Mechanics for the Revival he said it's Billy Graham he said but he don't have no Dynamics to go with it you see because denominations had bound had bound the word of God from having the dynamic power what was it every single one of these revivals that ever took place it denominated within 3 to 5 years but this m message has been going on for close to 70 years now and there's not one denomination of it Hallelujah Pentecost is asking they're asking for a restoration of them days have gone by of a Revival but I've got bad news for them William brandham said the prophet of this age in 1957 he said the Pentecostal Revival is over he said it's over why they rejected the word of God you think about this in 50 years from 50 years from the very start of Pentecost how far had they fallen from their Heritage in 50 years and they were missing the Revival that was taking place and they were looking to go back you see that's the problem with so many people like Nelly Saunders they want to go back they want to go back to the days gone by they want to go back to their past they want to go back to their history I'll tell you this I appreciate brother Homer but I don't want to go back to brother Homer's day oh my don't let me hurt your feelings I don't want to go back to William brandom's day now you'll get with me I don't want to go back just to William brandom's day I want to stay right here in this revival because when William Brandon was standing there in 1965 there was even one message church as we know it today but if William brandham would stand in this Pulpit he could preach the message without fault and without failure he wouldn't have to hold himself back because he was afraid of hurting somebody's feelings this is a message church and we believe a message a message that came from the Throne of almighty God you see because even in early days in the 1950s William Brandon would stand there right in front of the Isuzu Street people and the full gospel movement and tell them that what they had was not enough he would stand there and tell the Pentecostals that you ain't went far enough and when they had him to stand there in 1956 in their Jubilee year in their anniversary meetings he stood right there in California and he preached a sermon on why Pentecost failed am woo you better know where you're standing at can you mind imagine preaching where Pentecost faed right in front of them Bishops and all them so-called so-called prophets of their generation to stand up there and tell them this is why Pentecost failed and when when you go to listen back to why Pentecost failed brother bandam takes them through the three courts from the outer courts to the inner courts he said if you win all the way in there he said you received the Mana you received the spirit he said but you didn't go on to the holies of holies he said but if you'd go on you would have you would have what Peter had you say well brother Andrew is that where we're living at absolutely not because when Christ rent The Veil when Christ rent The Veil every believer can come into the presence of the holies of holies and you're not just feeding on a dead carryon but you're feeding on the fresh man of the word of God you see when he rent The Veil when Christ rent The Veil at the day of Calvary he was showing that he was going to do a fresh work and when you start reading the book of Acts you begin to see Christianity for the very first time that God was going to fill his church not just walk with them but he was going to fill his church with his spirit because he told him in Luke 24 49 that go up there and wait in Jerusalem for I will send you power from on high he told him in Acts chapter 1 that you're going to be Witnesses unto me you see what he did God started a Revival with them 120 completely surrendered in his hands and it never ended and the fire cannot be put out you see I want you to I want you to hear me loud and clear this message did not just take us back to an isua Pentecost because isua is a denomination but Pentecost is an experience you see but true Pentecost this message took us back to a true Pentecostal experience and beyond all of that because when Peter is standing there in Acts chapter 2 the Bible said that when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with him in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven As A rushan Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting at and there appeared under them clo tongues like as as a fire and set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues you got to think where they're setting at this is a present truth that they're living in the very moment that Joel saw this was when when when Peter begins to preach Peter has to calm himself done down out of out of the anointing to begin to preach could you imagine could you imagine handing Peter a microphone on Sunday morning said okay now Pete you only got 20 minutes because we got to let this church out at 1:00 so they can go out there and see the chariot races it ain't going to work it ain't going to work because Peter had something greater than a bunch of carnal message Believers that want to get out just so they can enjoy their favorite TV show or their or their ball game names but Peter was not that kind of man I know I hurt your feelings but we're in a fresh Revival I don't care if Tim pu comes here at Labor Day and preaches 15 hours as long as it's anointed from almighty God I'll take every sentence I get sick and tired of people saying that the preacher's too loud and the preacher preaches too long and he gets too sweaty and he sweats too much and he smells too bad he preach too long he didn't preach long enough the air condition ain't right the Heat ain't right somebody took my seat get with it get with it when we fund churches over in China when we fund churches over in Africa that don't even have a chair to sit on they'd be happy to have a chair like you got but you're so [Applause] carnal but God start something on the inside of me that I don't care how long he preaches I don't care how long we worship I don't care I just want him I want him I want him I want him to think for the very first time the Church of the Living God can have an encounter with the one that wrote this word come on somebody he's not held back by Creeds he's not held back by do dogas he's not held back by superstitions he's not held back by intellectual revivals but he's here and you can encounter him the angel of the Lord is moving because somebody is hungering for it what makes you run all the way up here what makes you come all the way eight hours for what a chance at a fresh Revival what made you move what made you get out of your chair what made you get up an encounter with him an encounter with him brother Jim it's worth everything I have been so moved I have been so moved and maybe I shouldn't say it but I just I have been so moved for the the ex homage I I to see them to come all the way that they're coming now I'm not trying to get on you I'm just trying to tell you where you should be living at because let me just drop some things to you they gave up everything this ain't just like you this is this is their Community this is their this is the world that they know as soon as they identify with this message as soon as they identify with this message brother Tom they were immediately shunned that men no longer can do business with them they can't talk to them and I was talking to brother Melvin this past week he said he said if we ever in when when we was in the amus community he said if we even stopped by a by a tent meeting on the side of the road he said we was shunned right there now every one of you gave up something but to this to them it's fresh this message is everything to them because they lost family they lost friends they lost jobs they lost let me tell you they lost they lost a lot in the human life but what they lost God has gave them more and gain let me tell you God if you give something up for God God is no de to no man if he brings you out he's got a purpose in bringing you out to take you somewhere he took Abram out of his kin folks home to take him to a land to take him to a city whose Builder and maker was God he brought Noah he brought Noah out of the Wilderness to give him Victory he G he brought Moses he brought Moses out of water to make him a prophet he brought Moses out of out of the desert sitting back there with a sunburn a stick in his hand and a talking Butch let me tell you but what he got was a fresh Revival because he had got some news he got some news from the angel of the Lord that I'm getting ready to create the greatest jailbreak that's ever been recorded in history over 2 million people in one night are coming out but if God is bringing you out he's taking you somewhere let me tell you he brought you out of churches to bring you to be a part of this bride I'm just going to lay you some few things I'm gonna preach to you now I'm gonna preach to you now William Brandon would stand there he would stand there in 1963 he would stand there in the seals and said the bride has not had a Revival yet she's not had a great stirring yet he said but it'll take them seven unknown Thunders to wake up the bride again he would say it he said before a revival can come he said God has got to be the one that send it he said and it'll take some nip with it'll take some nip with and it don't even know how to write his own name just like he did on the day of Pentecost and he said he'll raise he will create a Revival right there before a revival can come God's got to send it again when he's standing there and recognizing your day and his message if you ain't listened to it for a while go and listen to it William bham is standing there he said some of my best friends Jack Moore he said they're standing out there and they they publish that great magazine and it said it's constantly fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray he said what is it he said they're awaiting a Great Awakening he said but they have not recognized that the bride has already been woke up from 1963 when the seals were being opened he said the bride had not received her Revival yet but in 1964 he stands right there and says the bride has been woke up what was it it was a sign not that six seals had been released but Seven Seals had been released I'm saying this to you that if you want the B baptism of the Holy Ghost if you want a fresh Revival if you want a fresh stirring don't wait on it you ain't got to wait 10 days for it you ain't got to wait for your deliverance you ain't got to wait for the next Revival you're in it you're in the middle of it he said if you've ever if you've ever studied the Revival of the ages he said you'll studied out he said that when God he said Revival is a signal that the power of God is being released a Revival is showing that there is a power of God that can be received he said but when that is taking place he said you see he said when when when God's in Revival he said then Satan is in one to he said because you look at the W Revival and you studied out he said not many people know this he said but the insane asylums he said they were absolutely full in the middle of the West Revival he said what it is is Satan is trying to distract from what really God is doing and you look what is taking place the message of the hour that has been released in this generation there's never been a day that we've understood like we're understanding where we understand eternal security where we understand the godhead has been released into a body form and we recognize that there is a true serpent seed but we recognize that there is an elected seed that the seals have been opened that's true water baptism and all of these things it's been restored but what is it that Satan has raised his head with men behind computers that tried to stop this revival with men of deceivers of denominations and dogmas and Creeds that tried to stop this Mighty move of God if God has sent a Revival then s had then Hil has in a Revival you saidwell I'm waiting on it I'm waiting on my opportunity I'm waiting on my opportunity well I want to tell you your opportunity is right here because because I can say this that it is a rising of the sun it is a rising of the Sun that this what you have received and not just mechanics but it's the Dynamics of almighty God I ain't had rain for a little bit brother Andrew I pray God opens up the windows of heaven and he opens up the windows of heaven and pours out upon the seed that he deposited and creates a Revival on the inside of you like never before you might be like Elijah in First Kings 18- 41 when he's standing there he ain't had no rain Israel ain't had no rain for quite some time and he standing there and he tells Ahab go back down to your kingdom and get your rain barrels out because I hear the abundance of the sound of rain a coming I want to tell you this if you're waiting to get your rain barrels out you're too late don't wait to get them out put them out right now don't wait to put them out don't wait till tomorrow morning service put them out right now the rain is here the rain is here maybe all you can see like Elijah is the size of a cloud of a man's hand but I want to say by that little moving right there that there is a Revival that is here hallelujah it's what I got to press through this and I got to press through that press past your unbelief press past your fear press press past your soal awkwardness press pass your social awkwardness I'm afraid that if I receive that it'll make me do things that I don't really want to do brother Gabriel do you mind if I scream brother Timothy do you mind if I shout Brother David do you mind if I dance I guarantee these people that are sitting here don't mind if you cry I guarantee you these people don't mind if you break through I guarantee these people ain't going to get on Facebook and say well ah they should have been down in the altar 20 30 years ago I guarantee you this there ain't going to be one person that'll make fun of you but there'll be a whole host of of Believers that will surround you and pray for you but too many times people because of social awkwardness don't release what's on the inside of him that's burning forget your social awkwardness who cares if you boohoo and wash some makeup off of your face who cares if you cry and come to this Altar and soak this carpet with [Applause] tears the only person that's holding you back is you it's you but I want to I want to stand here and I want to be the guy in your corner you can do this you can press through you can have the Holy Ghost you can have your breakthrough you can have more you can have more Revelation you can have a deeper sincerity you can roll away condemnation you can push sickness down you can be a real Overcomer you can be a real wife you can be a real husband you can be a real son but I don't know if I can let me tell you like William brandom said it he said if that plane ever pushes past that sound barrier it breaks forth into unlimited speed he said if you'll break forth past that unbelief barrier un unlimited Revival will break forth you've never experienced anything like this in all your life I'm not trying to take you back to something I'm trying to tell you it's here you see because at the day of Pentecost 10 days before 10 days before they had to go up there and wait for it but you don't have to wait for it because the times of refreshing are here and they are now well to be honest brother Andrew it's a little bit too chilly in here for me tonight so I'm I'm a little bit afraid cuz I got to put my sweater and my jacket on I preached a meeting in Belgium this past year year after year after year it's a middle winter there but young people young people that are having a fresh Revival said take me out there in that cold ocean and baptize me in the name of Jesus Christ they don't care if it's too cold our pastor's been to to Jamaica then been all over the world preach this message everywhere there's people that sit on post there's people that sit in lawn chairs just to hear set underneath a tent where are you living at where you living at the word has been restored under you come on somebody you don't have to wait for me to preach you into a Revival you're in it the reason why you're having a happening like you're in it's because you recognize that something is happened a message has came to you I'm just waiting on the angel to get in the water I'm just waiting to get he's I'm just waiting for a certain season when he comes by and when he comes by I'll step in I want to tell you step in right now step in right now there ain't nothing else that has to be released to this bride of Jesus Christ because when William Brandon when God sealed his lips in 1965 let me tell you the message had came to its fruition but now it's a time for a body to stand up in position this is your chance ain't it good to be in Revival ain't it good to be in Revival ain't it good to be a part of a stirring ain't it good to be a part of something that you don't care care you don't care what the mockers say you don't care what the critics say they don't understand why you're shouting they don't understand why you're happy well there's some people that I know that never went out there in the world I know they never went out there in the world they never did drugs they never did dope they never did alcohol musicians get up here so I can stop preaching but they shout as loud as some of you you that was ranked Sinners they've got as much right to shout because they was born in sin and they were shaped in iniquity just like anybody else and they recognize that they've got a reason to Rejoice just like anybody else has got a reason to Rejoice so I say unto you if you're not living in Revival it's time for a season change and come up here to where the message is at come on Eagles it's a fresh word for you you can't feed on denomination ISM you can't feed on your own ideas start feeding on this unfailing body work you ain't got to sing the song let Revival come you're in it you're in it come on somebody you might need a Revival but the Revival that you're needing is in this room you might need a fresh stirring but your fresh stirring is in the room you might need a miracle but your Miracle's in the room hallelujah hallelujah how many want say I'm I'm proud I'm proud I'm proud to be a part of this fresh Revival you're not lukewarm you have to deal with lukewarmness you have to deal with Le Odyssey but you ain't lukewarm by no means this bride of Jesus Christ her heart is on fire for more of God nobody's got to tell you to pray nobody's got to tell you to worship nobody's got to tell you to read your Bible you are in Revival because you and the word have become one come on somebody you're in it you're in it and one of these days because you are a part of this fresh Revival between the seventh hour the 6th and 9 hour there is going to come a change over you a sweeping of the Holy Ghost it could have never happened unless this message came that's right but you're here now you're here now so the only thing left for the Bride of Jesus Christ is the rapture what will you do with this Jesus called Christ what will you do with this word Revival you sticking on a Shelf will you let it just be your daddy's religion will you let it just be brother Homer's religion will you let it just be brother Ron's religion or will you let it be your Revival will you let it be yours because when you can get to a spot that it's not just William bram's message but it's your message there's not a devil in hell that can rob you from the revelation of that we're here we're here God bless you tonight heavenly father I come don't have much to Holy I'm humbl by home
