bomb in gilead lord we come unto you lord with our faith set in the word of god so father may may we stand here like real rugged christians tonight lord and believe the word of god like never before we ask your blessings on this service tonight in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of first kings chapter 22. first kings chapter 22 and verse 12 and then we'll be jumping down to verse 28. that's directly after ii samuel and then right before second kings first kings chapter 22 and verse 12. and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoth gilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand and the messenger that was gone to call mikaya spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them notice what they're trying to get micaiah to do is to say the same thing that they were saying and speak that which is good and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak verse 28 and mekiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the bible notice jehoshaphat dressed as a king and the king of israel ahab disguised himself and went into the battle but the king of syria commanded his 32 captains that had ruled over his chariot saying fight neither was small nor great save only with the king of israel and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out and it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him and a certain man drew a bow adventure and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariots turn thy hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariots against the syrians and died at evening and the blood ran out of a wound into the midst of the chariots god bless you this evening you may be seated in the presence of the lord if you go down to verse 38 you'll find that it you'll find that there was a prophecy that was going to be fulfilled by that of elijah that said that the dogs would definitely they would lick the blood they would lick up the blood of the king notice i would like to speak to you this evening on a thought on a disguised king and i'd i'd actually been studying this song for the last two and a half months and and looking over these things and i won't take two and a half months to preach it to you this evening but i i was just waiting on the inspiration of the lord to strike and when to speak these things and and so by the help of the lord we'd like to speak to you on this thought on a disguised king and we know we know that that satan is the very arch enemy of god and we have a real devil that we're facing even right now in the midst of all of the chaos of this world we are facing a real devil and we know that there are people that tend to think that that the devil's not real but we're facing a real enemy and we're facing an enemy that that is wanting to destroy us and to kill and he wants to come in and he wants to destroy the very plan of god but this we know that satan as has been and always has been a deceiver from the very beginning and you go back and you start studying out the bible and you begin to look back into the bible in isaiah and other places you'll find that lucifer begins to make a shift in the corridors of heaven when he was rejecting what he was even created for as the worship as the worship leader in heaven and he began to turn he began to turn the angels of god and he began to tell them lies and they began to swoo them and woo them over onto his side and the bible said that that he deceived a portion of the angels of god and notice that god was not shook up about all of these things because he knew what lucifer was created for notice that even satan himself has still he's never lost any of his tactics he's he's still a slicker he's a slew foot he's a liar he's a deceiver he's a slanderer and we know that the enemy is against the very children of god and brother branham would say in questions and answers he said he said and two-thirds of the earth is in sin and more than that with and more than that which two-thirds of the angels was kicked out and those demon spirits coming to the people and habitat their bodies see they they they they're they those demons that once they that was once existence and they come into the people and they give them a nature notice they they give them a nature and jesus cast seven of them out of mary magdalene pride boasts big people you see unclean filthy vulgarity emulation strife and all these things and to think that those come out of mary magdalene and brother branham you'll find in one place that he said that mary magdalene thought that she was more beautiful than others and i know that strikes sometimes when you begin to preach on pride and preaching events about boasting and those things it hits with it hits with young children but it's it's a it's an enemy that would come on and and would make you think that you're prettier than somebody else and dog yourself up like that it's an enemy that comes in and diseases it's an enemy that comes in with all types of different avenues and tactics and that's what the enemy is trying to always come in and maybe you don't realize it brother branham would call the devil a slicker and he'll try to pull a trick on our young girls and he'll try to move his way in real slick-like and and and then he'll try and you know if brother madam would say that if he'd come in with a pitchfork nobody would believe him but he slides in like a like a gentleman he slides in maybe and tries to look real cute and tries to look real real nice but he's trying to come in and when he comes he's not coming for you to advance in christianity he's coming to steal he's coming to kill and he's coming to destroy the very plan of god and his children when you go to studying out the bible and you look up and you can find the you can find every time that you'll see the word devil throughout the new testament and you look at it in in the greek that it is diablos that is that is what the bible would say that he is a diablos which means a false accuser a slanderer that he's prone to slander he's slanderously accusing falsely that satan is the prince of demons he is the author of evil persecuting good men estranging mankind from god and enticing them to sin afflicting them with diseases by means of demons who take possession of their bodies at his bidding and to think that tonight that that people begin to think and roll through their mind that that that they think that sickness came from god it came from a devil you know that there are some people that believe that sickness well sickness came from god god must have put this on me for some reason no sickness did not come from god it is a devil and it is a devil that is not just wanting to make you sick it's wanting to kill you and we realize that that there is an enemy that we're facing not only in the flesh but in our spirit and in their soul that is trying to trying to strip us of everything that god built us for and the bible would tell us in ephesians in ephesians chapter 6 to put on the whole arm of god that you might be able to stand against the wiles of diablos and we know that joshua parallels ephesians that they run side by side that paul was speaking to the children of this day saying that this is your possession just like joshua would lay out the possession for all the children of israel he was laying out paul was laying out a possession for the children of god and he would tell us that that we are to put on the whole armor of god it's not just something that you put on every once in a while it's something that is always there it is the baptism of the holy ghost and when you put on this armor you are putting on almighty god and you are to stand against the very wiles of diablos for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places james 4 7 tells us submit yourselves therefore to god and resist it means to oppose it means to stand against not stand for but to stand against the diabolos resist diabolos to think that you're going to come against sometime in your life you're going to come against satan himself notice he said submit yourselves therefore to god resist diablos and he will flee from you notice when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard notice jesus or james said draw an eye unto god and god will draw nigh unto you and the greatest battle ever fought brother branham said this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it far started the first battle was in heaven he said so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven and cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels become human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and began in us and he's been raging ever since you think that tonight that that was his purpose that satan come to destroy the purpose of god that's what satan was built for satan has come with a purpose to destroy you destroy your mind destroy your ability destroy your destroy your your life and everything about you but notice what the bible says in first john in three and eight that he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning but notice for this purpose for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of diablos to think that tonight that you're not fighting this battle alone that's why when moses was standing there he would tell them that the lord your god will fight your battles notice for this purpose jesus came into this world to destroy the works the very purpose the very plan of diablos do you realize that tonight that there is a plan that is set up against you by all of hell they have plans they have purposes that they are lining up for the very children of god but i want you to know that the bible said in jude chapter 1 that these fallen angels they lost their first estate but i want you to know that you as a son of god have been redeemed and been restored back to your first estate you always was a son always will be a son never will not ever be taken away from god because you are not part of the devil and satan cannot stand that you have more power than he could ever dream of having but we know that brother random would lay it out and the greatest battle ever fought that there is a chosen place of battle and brother adam would say that god chose a heart but satan chose the mind and when he come to a battle is it a test it's a test of powers it's a test of strength against it's and against opponents and it's there is a mutual meeting place and brother random will tell us that decisions are made in the mind it is the mind that accepts the word of god and that mind channels the very word of god into your spirit and into your soul and there is where it brings life into you notice where satan wars with you he wars with you in your flesh he wars with you in your spirit and he tries to get to you at nighttime when you're so vulnerable when you can't can't be on guard he comes and gives you nightmares dreams things that make you dream things that you would never dream of he slips in through your nightmares and tries to destroy your spirit and destroy your mind and he comes and he works through reasonings and he works through memory and he works through conscience and he works through emotions and through affections that's where he's battling you at is in the realm of your mind but god is working in a greater place on the wrong throne room of your heart and when the word of god the very spirit of god when it begin again to take place and you grab that very word of god jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you satan cannot get to that soul when it's sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost he's sitting there as the king of your heart now let me just let me just drop this right here you may you have always been a son you always were a son and nothing can rob that from you there were some times in my life that i did not look like a spencer i didn't act like a spencer but i always was a spencer there were some times in my life i did not look like a son of god but i always was a son of god because there was something that was greater than myself that was deposited before there ever was an atom that was created before there ever was a molecule that was created i was in god's mind hallelujah hallelujah now this word disguise it means to conceal by counterfeit i don't i doubt any i doubt any young people grew up and became somebody like myself but do you ever remember as a child going through the house and breaking something that was valuable i had to do this when i was a little bit older i won't tell everything it's under the blood ain't that right mama you ever go through the house and you break something valuable and and you finally got yourself a car and you can go out you're looking for something that looks like what you broke and you're trying to replace it but mama knows and you're trying to get what you broke and put it back what you're doing is you're buying a counterfeit and trying to put back when maybe you broke that fine time or something and you go down to the dollar general mama knows you can't get the same stuff at dollar general as you can get over at pottery barn in other places but it is you're trying to disguise something you're trying to cover up something you're trying to disguise it a disguise means to hide an identity and here we are living in an hour where men are under an identity crisis when they don't know who they are they don't know where they're going or coming they don't know which bathroom to get into and they're trying to dress himself up as something that they are not but i'm afraid that that spirit don't just stay out there in the natural but it tries to move in to the spiritual and it tries to make people profess to be christians dress like christians try to act like christians but still living like the world and ahab was just one of these kind of men that got on that side and we know well well it's it's rightfully hours for us to go down there and get ramos gilead that's what jehoshaphat and ahab were joining themselves up together was to go back to that you know this was our original property to go down there and reclaim ramos gilead but you know one thing brother branham said he said they never went and approached it by prayer first they never approached it by prayer and brother barron would say let's just give out some characteristics of ahab a brother adam would say about ahab he said he was a borderline believer he would say that he was living off the past reputations of other israelite kings and ahab he carried himself as a borderline believer he never knew where he stood out he was either on one side of the fence or the other side of the fence ahab was not stable he always went with a trend and he was famous for listening to his prostitute wife it was because of ahab listening to jezebel that they were guilty for bringing back idolatry amongst the children of israel notice ahab was unstable sure he had some good things in his history sure he had some good things that took place but you watch what happened when he married that painted face jezebel he started going out and whoring after the things of babylon brother barron will you remember when brother branham he would talk about that old that old horse they had he talked about that old horse they had he said he was famous for jumping fences he said they jumped that fence and he said they finally got to a spot that they had to put a yoke on them just like you would do a cow they put that yoke on him he said that horse would he could stand there and eat alfalfa in their field all day long he said but he jumped that fence and he said brother venom said i got to wondering why in the world was that fence why was that horse jumping that fence and he said i got to watching him he said there he was had great alfalfa to eat in he said but i watched him and he would jump that fence get himself hung up on that fence with that yolk that he was wearing he hung in to hang himself up and he was going down in a sinkhole over there just getting some orchard grass he said when he got over there he said that sinkhole had all kinds of glass and trash in it and all types of different things he said and that horse was cutting himself up cutting himself up going across that fence going over there he said he had good food to eat on right there he said but he went over in that little sinkhole got himself all cut up they had to pull him back out of there and he said he would sit there and quiver and shake and bleeding with all of those cuts that were on him just for a little grain of orchard grass he said that reminded me that the way of a transgressor is hard you'll leave all of this spiritual food and due season just to go out and go out and live with the world just for a little bit giants like the world just for a little bit dress like the world just for a little bit and brother branham said that that's what the church of the living god he said that's what the church is doing he said not the bride he said but the church is living off of their past reputations just like ahab was doing you look at the methodists they're living off the past reputations you look at the baptists they're living off their past reputations of days gone by just like the pentecost today they're living off of days gone by we used to dance in the spirit we used to shout in the spirit but the church of the living god the bride of jesus christ ain't having to live off past reputations she's living right in the shekinah glory [Applause] god never respected israel where she where she was and where she had been he said he only respected her where she was in that moment and you cannot live off of days gone by some people said in church to say like i feel with the holy ghost 30 years ago i guess that's good enough really you say well tell me about when you got the baptism of the holy ghost i'll say which time there's been many times i've been refilled by the baptism of the holy ghost there's one feeling but many refillings thank the lord for that you don't just run your car off of one tank of gas you got to run that baby it's expensive right now but you gotta go and get that thing and fill it up if you're planning to go somewhere that's the way some people do with church they can get their field off of one service a month let me get back on track here but they they called up all these 400 prophets and these 400 prophets had already declared sure you're going to go out there zedekiah he took these horns and said this is how you're going to take the battle you're going to go out there and they already had the majority but jehoshaphat knew that there wasn't something right with that backslidden king ahab he said is there just one more out there surely there's got to be one more out there that we can talk to and ahab said yeah there's one micaiah the son of him look he said but he never prophesies anything good about me he's always telling me i can't live with my wife jezebel he's always telling me things that i'm doing they're wrong he said but go up there and get him and they went up there and got micaiah and said now look here if you want your way back into the church where you can have your cards and your creeds and everything else and we'll invite you back in you've got to say the same thing that we're saying he said i will only say what god puts in my mouth they already they already had the majority them 400 prophets but mekiah had the word of god on his side he said if you go out to that battle and return back god's not even spoken unto me but there you'll find if you go back and read first kings 22 that there was a lion spirit that went before god and notice brother branham would say that he went out there to see who could persuade ahab and and zedekiah went up and slapped mikaya mikaya upside the face and said where with the spirit of god when it went out of me but this man was not willing to compromise on the word of god he was not willing to hide he was not willing to hide and he was not willing to compromise you see you cannot compromise with god you cannot camouflage your sin you cannot disguise your sin if you're a sinner here you'll be a sinner there but if you're righteous here you'll be righteous there you cannot camouflage sin just like when adam and eve were in the garden of eden when they were there and they were walking and they don't sinned away they didn't send away their day of grace and they knew that they did wrong and they covered themself up with fig leaves and they were trying to hide but you can't hide from an all-seeing god and there they were walking but god had already seen them but he didn't send them out in that way he sent them out with the blood he sent them out with the blood that was covering them you see humanity is always trying to hide from god trying to camouflage itself up us brothers know about that camo you want the best pattern you want everything just right so that you can hide in the trees so that the deer or the wildlife can't see you but i want you to know you can put the best camouflage on you that you want to in your own walk but god already sees on the other side of your camouflage you can try to hide and you can try to run but god's already found your hiding place and these false prophets were prophesying that they would come out and they would win the battle you see that's what a false prophet will do it'll prophesy you right in the tribulation but i'm standing tonight with a true prophet and a true prophet will prophesy you right into the rapture unto the coming of the lord but ahab ahab's done with this king a king of syria king been ahead of god he doesn't whooped him twice but he released him you know what happens when you let sin get out it'll come back and it'll come to destroy you again it's just like the demon you can sweep out the place and he finds it ain't filled yet he's bringing back seven more of his brothers that are worse than him own self and they ahab had done whooped him twice done captain put him in captivity ben haddad put him in captivity and let him out so that he could have his own trading in the marketplace of damascus and there he let him out just for a trade isn't that how sin does you it makes you want to trade out eternal life for laodicea sin has a way where it's pleasurable for a season where it disguises himself and makes it look good appeal looks good just for a moment a bottle looks good just for a moment but just give it to the next morning you'll wake up needing more of that but you take one pill this gospel and you'll be satisfied and filled and daily getting more and more of it it never runs out never wake up with a headache never woke up never wake up wondering where i've been and where i came from hallelujah but notice been a god he was not interested in anybody else but ahab he was not interested in any of israel he wasn't interested in the rest of jehoshaphat he was only interested in ahab because ben haddad wanted to remove the stain of captivity off of his life he wanted to remove where he'd been imprisoned by this king of israel he wanted to remove that stain of captivity off of him i tell you there's sometimes we need to take the same tactic that the enemy has and put it in our own life when we remove the stain of captivity off of our life if there's one thing that we can learn from ben haddad let's remove the stain of captivity off of our life let me tell you this church the blood is pushing you and removing the stain of captivity off of your life and they have dressed himself up just like some ordinary man tried to look like a common person try to look like just anybody else do you hear what i'm saying trying to disguise himself so that he wouldn't be noticed but there was prophecy that was laying out there and one of the captains shot an arrow this arrow was connected with prophecy that there would be dogs that would lick up the blood of ahab he disguised himself but you can't hide from god you can run but you can't hide well i'm nervous about what's going on in russia i'm not i'm worried i'm worried some people say well i'm worried about what's going on i was talking with an individual the past couple weeks and they get so shook up when you start talking about the end time claim to be christians claim to be claimed to claim to be real christians and go to church and live a life but you start talking about end time and he start talking about god coming over and making the earth new again and they get all shook up because they know they don't have a token life that will get them out of here they're living under the disguise or the cloak of religion of christianity but christianity is not a cloak it's a life it's a life that's got to be lived and only you know when you put your head on the pillow or night if you really got the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] prophecy was coming after ahab but you remember one time samuel disguised himself or saul disguised himself and he went down there went down to the witch of endor when the word of god wouldn't speak to him and the urim and thumbing wouldn't light up and all the heavens had been shut off because saul wouldn't kill off sin because he wouldn't kill off sin he had this saying samuel couldn't answer him samuel done died been dead two years hurim and thumbing wouldn't light up he god had shut up the heavens and he wouldn't hear him because he wouldn't cut off sin and when you are willingly not cutting off sin god will not hear you when you shut off the voice of warning god will not hear you go back and read proverbs chapter seven when it when it talks about the house and the warning of going by the house of the idolatrous how that the voice of warning that the father was telling don't go buy that house of the idolatrous don't go by that way but the bible said that the young men without understanding went out into the streets where that woman was lurking and the bible said that she was a loud woman she was boastful in what she was showing she was posed for and what she was selling but the bible said that that the bible said to hearken unto her hearken unto god it said don't hearken unto her but her house is a house that is a way to hell and it leads to the chambers of death you think well it's just for a moment it literally is only for a moment if you live all of your life to be 100 years old 100 years old it's only for a moment but what are you willing to give up for eternity it's amazing what people would sell their birth right out for esau sold out for a for a for uh for a bowl of quaker oat he sold out for just a little with a little bit of oatmeal a little bit of partage well it's amazing what what elvis sold his soul out for for a fleet of cadillacs it's amazing what marilyn monroe sold her soul out for but when it comes to that time when it comes to your deathbed who's going to be standing there you rejected the voice of warning and samuel had done told him what to do and so did not listen to what the voice had told him to do just like pearl harbor they turned down the voice of warning when they'd been told that the japs were coming and they were going to invade the land but that night they stayed out there drinking and carousing and having themselves a party while all along the japanese were making their way over brother branham said don't you worry about russia he said america's destroying itself from the inside my goodness but samuel went down there so went down to samuel and he calls on notice what he's calling on notice what sin will make you do it'll make you go down to the house of a medium when saul was the one that made them be kicked out of the very ban them out of the country and the witch of endure when she starts calling on samuel said i see god's rising out because samuel was still in his prophetic robe hallelujah he was still a prophet even though he'd been dead two years he was still a prophet and he said i see you you'll die in the battle tomorrow you and your son jonathan he was still in his prophetic robe let me say this you can make fun of this message all you want to but william branham's still a prophet and there's prophecy that is riding on you and i but we will not be carried away with every wind and doctrine we will be carried on on the wings of a snow white dove there's a prophet's prophecy that's got to be fulfilled that we will mortal this mortal will put on immortality [Applause] still a prophet still a prophet and they missed they missed they missed jesus satan's a slicker and satan's sneaky and he'll make you backslide and you think well i uh you know what's a ball game going to hurt what's one time going to it ain't what happens out there you backslide right here in church you see that's where you do your greatest backsliding we think well i'm okay i've been in church all my life and i've i've done all these things and you sit there man this is getting but you sit there and you get under the cloak of the message god sent a prophet i'm okay are you really brother byron would say in one place he said you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every single day of your life and go to hell i don't understand that you can have it on your flesh you can listen to the tapes every single day of your life you can sit under one of the greatest ministries and still ride your way straight to hell because you never accepted the token well you what's one time of sneaking out on my husband once one time i turn it on turning on that wrong music what did eve what did eve listen to a slicker and he's only wanting you to smoke one cigarette he's only wanting you to turn on and listen to rock and roll brother branham said and in tights and spirits he said you're our young people they can hear rock and roll one time and it catches them oh but it just soothes my soul really i've only found one thing that soothes my soul i can tell you this old gospel sometimes it may rub your fur the wrong way but i'll tell you it's doing it for the right thing we say well i don't know if i can handle this kind of preaching the reason why you're here is because you're able to handle it if god didn't think that you were able to handle it he wouldn't have you set here but they didn't receive it when jesus walked on the shores of galilee two thousand years ago and the devil invaded you the united states and worked its way through hollywood and worked its way through magazines and worked its way into our televisions and worked its way into our houses and it's robbed the very joy out of life kids can't sit at a table anymore without having a distraction in front of them what am i doing but they've got to have something their minds are so bombarded and so filled with but they turn down the very life of almighty god when the holy ghost is moving they they don't want nothing else to do with it but the mind of god is for a people and notice notice when jesus was walking on earth 2 000 years ago there he was walking in flesh walking in elements just like you and i and the bible said that god immorphy he changed his mask there he was in the pillar of fire that led to children of israel there he was that that led moses there he was that met with abraham but he changed his mask you know i went to i went to a a play a high school play the other day my brother nathan and his school they put on a play there and we we went and we watched and i was watching and brother nathan did a did a fantastic job and uh i i and i was watching i was watching behind the scenes of everything that was going on and you're watching and every person's got a part every person knows what they've got to do where they've got to fit in and where they've got to stand but i noticed that there were certain people that played different parts but it was the same person but they were changing their act they were changing their wardrobe they were changing their mask and that's what jesus did he was still the same yesterday today and forever he was still that pillar of fire he was still jehovah and when god hid himself in the humanity of jesus what did he do what did he do he was humbling he humbled himself and went in behind the veil of jesus so that the rest of the world couldn't see that it was jehovah but jehovah was standing there behind human flesh he was just changing and morphing means to be changed so that you can catch the vision what happened up there in doth in that time when the winner went on low and gaha looked out the window he looked out the window and there the assyrian army was coming up and gahesa said last master what shall we do now but elijah just simply prayed lord open his eyes those angels was always there those angels was always watching over elijah but he simply only changed the vision of gehesa let me say this to you before you ever see it he's here and he's masked himself in the robe of jesus one more time when he stood there in front of those sadducees and he said before abraham was i am it was that same pillar of fire being manifested he was saying that i am that i am and he veiled himself in jesus that humble little man to keep them from seeing to keep them from seeing that this was jehovah and again he veils himself today in earth and vessels with the shekinah glory and the outside looks like a bunch of holy rollers and the outskirt looks like a bunch of badger skins but on the inside it's a very succulent glory the same one that heir and the priest went in there in the tilde in the wilderness in the tabernacle it's that same shekinah glory that's being tabernacled one more time it's the king that's sitting on the throne room of your heart and paul would say that we have this treasure we have this treasure in earth and vessels he would say that we are troubled on every side but we have this treasure we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair why because we have this treasure we're persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed why because we have a treasure young people young girls don't let no young man or some some slicker come in and try to steal your treasure don't let some slicker come into your household and try to steal your wife hide your treasure the greatest treasure is not what you have in this earth what rob what moth and rust can corrupt but your treasure must be in heaven that's why we've got to set our affection on things above because we have this treasure we can go through hell because we have this treasure we can go through cancer because we have this treasure it's the hidden glory of almighty god ahab tried to disguise himself hide himself from sin but jehovah is hiding himself in you and to think satan is looking after that people could this be them could it really could it really be those martin kids that take the rapture could it be the breedings could it be the homes could it be the thomases but god is hiding himself well it's so simple that's where god hides himself it's over the mind of the wise of the prudent but he reveals himself to babes such as we'll learn you think about these young people that come here and our little ones that come here and god hiding himself right there that no matter what they go through they have been given the very token life of almighty god what what came down in sabinia cannon he was a king sword and the bible said that where the word of the king is there is power it can be in the littlest child it can be in the youngest adult it can be the oldest setting here it's a king sword where the king's power not a king the king don't you fear don't you fear that's just your third pool ministry what is it it's your ministry it's the ministry of the son of man making an invasion right into the united states again but they miss it notice i i'm gonna close with with these thoughts brother and said that's the way that people does today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light and having fellowship with god with his people and the holy spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop [Music] just keep pressing on and god will make a way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see god when i can't get over it when i can't get under when i can't get around it or any way god opens up a way and i go through it somehow or another his grace is sufficient to carry us through satan loves attacking you he loves attacking your mind he loves attacking your family he's been on your territory all throughout your family history but the god of power is right here the god that has baptized you into the body not by handshake not by a cloak of religionity not by the cloak of the message but by one spirit are we baptized into the body and satan cannot handle that he cannot handle the fact that this word is hidden behind badger skins again you know what i did brother andrew you know where i came from it's underneath the blood on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn the meanest of animals got a nasty nature an old badger but god wanted to hide himself right behind all of them skins because you don't take on your old man nature you take on his nature that's why when he was talking to nicodemus he said accept you'd be born again you cannot even see the kingdom of god you can't understand it well i've been i've been stepping out and i've been crossing the line i've been sitting on the fence i can tell you it's not a time to play church it's not a time to sit on the fence matter of fact there's no neutral ground it's a time to get in because satan can whip you if you're sitting on the fence he'll push you right back over on his side well i'm going to see i'm going to wait i'm going to wait and see if this message is really right i'm gonna wait and see if los angeles does what it's gonna do i'm gonna wait and see what russia does what it's gonna do it's too late it's now you don't have to conceal the holy ghost the holy ghost conceals itself in you holiness is right holiness will work its way out of you it'll push its way out you don't have to put it on it'll push its way out it's just like a fruit tree it doesn't have to manufacture it it just simply bears it you know once you actually figure it out it's pretty easy it's pretty easy to live a christian life won't you once you just let go but it's just something about that struggle of letting go it's real easy and i'll tell you what i'm closing and musicians can come but i can tell you i fought all my life to live this i tried everything within me i tried every i tried listening falling asleep to the message i tried i tried i tried everything i could but one time just letting go and let god take over it's completely yielding yourself and you just watch it ain't manufacturing it the devil knows if you're manufacturing it the devil knows if you're disguising yourself behind it but he knows when that king is sitting on the throne room of your heart and it just starts pushing out love and starts pushing out joy and it starts pushing out faithfulness it starts pushing out all the works of the holy ghost it ain't you it's him working and he may only use you one time one time but one time is enough all i need is one time with him i don't care i don't care what happens i don't care what goes if he uses me one time to save one soul it's enough [Music] mothers you raise your children because that's what god told you to do it's enough it's everything let him hide himself on the inside of you would you stand there with us to see [Music] me draw me to your side oh [Music] [Music] and [Music] holy ghost oh holy ghost oh let
