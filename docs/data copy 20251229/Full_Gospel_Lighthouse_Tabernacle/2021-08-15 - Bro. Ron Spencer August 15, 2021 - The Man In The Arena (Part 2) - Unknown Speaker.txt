dealing with me and and i just i just never got back to it but i want to i want to preach on the man in the arena part two part one was last year about 12 months ago and and i was very weak when i started it so i want to i want to share some scriptures with you and maybe have a need on your heart you just like say brother ron i'd like for you to remember me personally in prayer i'd like for you to do something for me today i'd like for you to draw a circle around yourself draw a circle around yourself go ahead and do it i got a person i got a reason for doing that buddy robinson drawed a circle around himself and he said lord if you don't send me a revival you're going to find my bones laying here so today's a good day to draw a circle and if everybody does it he's more than willing to come to it so amen so this the scripture that i'm about to read to you is more than just words this is a passion of one of the mightiest generals that ever lived joshua and he's going to preach his last sermon now you can imagine knowing this is my last sermon i pray it's not mine but knowing this is his last sermon he's going to deliver his heart and i'm going to only read the positive portion of it he's going to tell people that that go back what they can expect i'm not going to read that part i'm going to preach to the rapturing group now those are not going to be raptured get ready for tribulation period build a bomb shelter get gold get whatever you got to get put food up but for the rest of us let's get ready to go up joshua chapter 23 in verse 1. i'll read a couple scriptures and then you can be seated but i want you to follow along with me and it came to pass for a long time that after the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and was stricken in age and joshua called for all the children and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i'm old and stricken in age and ye have seen all the lord your god hath done unto all of these nations before you for the lord your god is is he that hath fought for you i like that behold i have divided unto you for a lot except by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even the great sea westward for the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess the air land i like that word air land as the lord your god hath promised unto you be you therefore very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of moses and and ye turn not aside they're from to the right hand or to the left i don't want to look left i don't want to look right i want to keep going on you may be seated and keep your work your scriptures handy just now that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the lord your god as ye have done until this day for the lord had driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you until this day one man shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he is it that fighteth for you as the lord hath promised take heed take good heed therefore unto yourselves that you love the lord your god as a reminder you know who you are you know where you're standing god is with you one man shall chase a thousand and let me just make mention of it three men we went got david a drink of water one man killed 800. samson shamgar one man listen a sermon is more than a sermon when it's put into action joshua 24 and verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve you the lord anything that comes between you and god get it out of your circle and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which were your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but it's for me in my house i want you to say it with me as for me and my house we will serve the lord and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage which did these great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the lord drave out from before us all the people and the amorites which dwelt in the lands therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god and joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the lord for he is and holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done good you good and the people said unto joshua nay we will serve the lord and joshua said unto the people your witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses jesus praised one of his last prayers when he was with his disciples and it's incredibly profound because you're a part of this in john chapter 17 and verse 1 and these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee and and as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god jesus christ whom thou hast sent notice these words this is a conversation between jesus and god and he said i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou has gave us me to do now notice now he's going to pray for you and now i am verse 11 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i have come to them holy father keep through thine own name those who thou has given me he's praying for god to keep you that they may be one even as we are one while i was with them in the world i kept them in the name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them has lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled i love that part because god don't lose you and now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hateth them because they are not of the world even as i'm not of the world i pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should has keep them from evil you still got a job to do god don't need to take you home at this point you still got a purpose in your life they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth that thy word is truth as i have sent them into the world even so have i also sent them into the world for their sakes i sanctify myself that they might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word jesus personally prayed for you that they may be one even as thou father art in me and i indeed that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gaveth me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou are in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has lavished them and thou hast lovest me paul would say it like this brethren i count not myself philippians 3 and 13. brethren i count not myself too apprehended but this one thing that i do forgetting those things which are behind that's an incredible thing for you to do is your past is your past your past is your past quit letting your past beat you around you're not even that man anymore the blood of jesus christ sanctified you from all of those things and he washed you he purged you it's not even in your book anymore forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth to those things which are before i press towards the mark of the of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus hallelujah give the lord a good hand right now [Applause] [Music] i need to [Applause] brother branham says it like this he says then adam had to race up and he said will i do as my wife said do or shall i do what god said do and he walked out with his eyes open and he had to take responsibility sometimes you just got to take responsibility and if you need a theme this morning i'm going to preach to you on man up yes hallelujah he says he had to take responsibility that throwed the whole human race unto death he said then there cometh that other adam which was christ never one like him somebody could say that he wasn't god his uniqueness proved he was god there never was a creature like him lived like him he lived in the world to himself he was born outside of the realm of natural a sinful man he was the creator himself made flesh who could ever stood stand where he stood whoever talked like him whoever say the things that he could say who could ever do things that he done his uniqueness proved he was god what about your uniqueness what about your uniqueness today you live in the world but you're not of the world this message has washed you it's cleansed you not patched you up it made you anew you're a new creature in jesus christ your uniqueness tells you you came from god and you're going back to god [Applause] there wasn't a prophet or nothing else could do what he had done who could call the dead back from the grave who could stop the skies and do anything that he was to do who could do that only god could do that only god could do that that could calm the sea tell a storm to go back who could ever stand in this place who what could he be but that perfect immortal god made flesh and dwelt among us nothing ever compared to him he lived in a world to himself no one one no man ever spake like him when he just opened his mouth there was something about it that was different than anybody else are you hearing these statements back to back right here and you find that you're you're relating to this are you finding you're relating to this this world is not our home i'm not comfortable with what i see in the headlines of fox news and cnn news i'm not comfortable with what's going on in this world so it tells me i'm from another place but while i'm here i'm going to conduct myself as a son of god i'm going to stand i'm going to man up i'm going to man up and i'm going to take my position nothing ever compared to him he lived in a world to himself no man ever spake like him when he opened his mouth there was something about it it was different than anybody else somebody said he was just an ordinary man he said i defied that he was god and that what he was for no man ever spake like him no man ever could speak like him because he was the living word itself made flesh the manifestation of the fullness of god when brethren comes to the rapture which you and i are preparing to step into if you can't see it coming you got your head in the sand and he read this scripture and i want to read it for you again and i wanted to charge your humanity the lord is my light and my salvation psalms 27 and 1 whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident under pressure a man is what he is under pressure if you run into battle that tells you what you are if things become convenient and you run and forsake it tells you what you are but there's going to be somebody [Applause] come on there's going to be somebody that'll stand in the midst of the storms of life and stand like jesus stood [Applause] one thing that i have desired of the lord that will i see kept her that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock and not shall my head be lifted up about my enemies round about and therefore will i offer in these tabernacles sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord nobody sings like you sing because you are who you are you are a son and daughter of god so he hears your individual voice coming through the blood of jesus christ and heavy heaven is a it's a noisy place but he hears your voice your voice of praise in the midst of your scorns he still hears your worship hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou say to seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek how not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger for that has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my mother and my father forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies deliver me not over to the will of my enemies for false witnesses or risen up against me and shall breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord jesus is preaching in luke chapter 17 it will be luke 17 but jesus is preaching verse 34 now he's describing the rapture the con the circumstances the conditions of the rapture he says i tell you in that night there shall be two in one bed two men in one bed don't take that the wrong way and one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinded together the one shall be taken and the other left two men in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said in him a word lord and he said whether so ever the body is feather with the eagles be gathered together i just want to remind you at this point this is a personal rapture this is a personal rapture it's you and god it's going to be universal rapture but it's going to be you and god in your community in your homes middle doubt a lot of places want to be taken don't get your eyes on nobody but jesus [Music] don't let nothing get between you and god you heard me say the other day about drama and petty things those things that are causing you drama and petty drop it [Music] people that are always [Music] draining your energies they've never lived like a right a day in their life but conviction hits them and they'll they'll pull on you and pull on you for a rescue jesus is the only one that can rescue you the answer is not getting in a preacher's office and getting a thousand questions answered the answer is you having a personal revival in your life [Applause] this is not a coattail religion every man must be born again this message gives you everything that you need to get you in a rapture spend some time with it eat the book now if you was in hot let me just give it to you if you was in hollywood and you had a role in a movie and you would go to the to the stage to do your part and you walked in and said well i don't know my lines i don't know my lines i look the part but i don't know my lines they would get somebody else to do the job i hope that sees through there's a lot of people come to church they dress the part but they ain't static [Applause] they're always wanting an answer but they gotta study you gotta put some time in you gotta be committed to this word [Applause] don't tell me you're not you don't have time don't tell me you don't have time when you can write a thousand word blog on your silly idea and fight on that internet don't worry you ain't gonna get me fighting with you cause i ain't wasting my time with you republican democrat it will not matter let me say it clearly it will not matter in the rapture you put every sign you want to in your yard i'm not against you doing that but it won't matter [Applause] you put all that kind of incredible energy into politics and you know they're lying to you [Applause] well brother ron don't you know covets going on and we've got a fight over get a vaccine or put a mask on in a right trick ain't going to matter and let me just say this if you're not studying the message of the hour you're going to be left here don't get cool on me it ain't a good time if you're not laying in the message of the hour to prepare yourself for rapture this is more than a church this is more than a building on a hill this is a bride chamber getting us ready to move into another dimension i want to say to you buckle up give your warning you got false teeth back down it's about to get right in here there will be no sports flags hanging in the new city you may chew tobacco here and you may smoke here but you'll have to put them out in hell [Music] don't watch nothing that you wouldn't have jesus himself to sit down beside you and watch somebody ought to be helping me preach here [Applause] joshua was saying commit yourself as for me and my house we will serve the lord man brother on you preach like that people leave jesus said these words except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me brother branham said that he did that to send the unbeliever away commitment takes the lazy people out of the equation you can play this sometime in a motivational speech if you want to there's a lot of people that's talented but they're not committed jobs sports a lot of people are talented but they ain't committed you don't see them till the lights come on they haven't lifted weights they have an eight right they don't know the playbook but they want to play [Applause] a lot of people want to be in the rapture [Applause] brother homer stood here one time and he said i wonder if ten people will leave this building in a rapture and he told me he said i meant to say it that way for those ten i'm encouraging you this morning for the rest of you i want you to get a circle and find a revival i want to encourage you like never before quit your man be pounding around come on i know i got a lot of people watching this morning let me just say it clear and true quit being a pastor's nightmare [Applause] get on fire serve god with all your heart the potential's in you it's laying there god deposited that though well i'll just walk away i'll turn back i'll leave we'll take a picture i told a group to take a picture a few years ago look where they're at brother on you're just way out of line am i really god told gideon to get an army ready thousands of people came out said we're willing to fight and gideon god just told him said there's too many of them too many of them tell them that those that want to go back home that really don't want to fight just going back home do you know that most of the congregation left he told him again there's too many of you so he took them down by a brook and he asked them to drink water drink water from the brook and those that drank it in a certain way god would use those people don't you tell me god don't need 52 000 people to fight he needs one man in his head and god sent a one-man invasion he sent a one-man invasion into egypt and turned it upside down [Applause] a lot of people are associated but they're not willing to pay the price associated and not willing to pay the price what do you mean brother ron well i'll come when i want to you know if i ain't got something going on i'll be at church now as long as i get my name call yeah you know i'd like to have my name go and i'd like to sing i'd like to sing and i you know now you know i you know now i i want to dress like i want to on monday but i want to identify with you now when the rapture happens you know when the flood happens i want to be real close to the boat man running from presence of god brother brown spent some time on shirking your responsibility and it's really easy to shirt things it's difficult there's parts of the word that's got gall in it it makes you sick but you still got to eat it so what you do is you come from different denominations and come into the bride and you got to be washed wash of those creeds and those dogmas you got to be watched maybe you come from the charismatic realm and they had incredible worship but our worship is different than their worship they can worship eating a hot dog they can worship having a coffee they can worship looking like jezebel the man ain't really the man of the house or he'd tell her dress rot sometimes you just got to man up and say that won't work [Applause] people get mad at pastors for preaching clothesline religion but it ought to be more than a pastor daddy's look at your daughters and say that doesn't represent christ cover up even muhammad ali told his daughters don't show them their treasures for your husband to see don't let the world if muhammad ali could say that you should not be offended [Applause] jesus carried the cross and carried us as far as he could but the load was too heavy because he was too weak and a man named simon serene stepped under it and stepped and helped carry the cross i would imagine those moments never left his life we have been asked to carry the cross as well and it's the moments that we have with his presence that never listen the presence of god sometimes will leave you and you'll stand alone and you'll have to make decisions alone but you have been trained for the battle there's a statement it's a good statement the road to hell is paved with good intentions [Music] uh did you get are you getting it so far you getting this so far my chest is hurting really bad so i'm getting it too so i invited him to church he's whipped sometimes we say well it's my family and reason i'm taking my time right here because here's an excuse that we make but it's my family if you miss the rapture if you miss the rapture because of your family you're going to find it wasn't a good excuse i just want to send shock to you this is your family and a lot of your families watching and they love you and know your names and know where you sit i get i was in louisiana last week they know where some of you sit they know your names uh they they they tune in they're all they're here with you every week they they want to know how you personally are they know if gabe comes and he's sitting in his police outfit uh was he working this weekend what what happened to that family they haven't been in church for a few weeks but brother ron it'll hurt my family's feelings you've got to make a stand of where you are you have to make a stand and you don't have to be mean and splash water in people's face but just ask them have you looked at it this way what your what your pastor is preaching what is it producing in the pews what what what is it producing an abuse what's it doing to the young people what's it doing to the young people what what is it doing is it changing them are they all gamers are they or do they have pornographic addictions hey listen then the word is not pure enough to cleanse their lives by the way girls don't fall in love with a gamer don't fall in love with a gamer somebody that's got their head in a screen all the time and i don't care if they win the national olympics and damon it won't buy you coffee that is you need to look at your daughter and say hey listen if that boy is a gamer leave him i don't care if he sits in church what you need to do young men and young women take those games and burn them [Applause] burn them well i'm the national champion i could care less that won't mean anything in hell [Applause] well that's all i got to do go back to school i don't care if you're 32 years old go back to school if you ain't doing nothing but sitting on a couch doing nothing go back to school get yourself a degree and go do society some good [Applause] man up man [Applause] brother ron but i'm too old my grandmother was 62 years old when she retired she went back to school and become a registered nurse listen i do more than just preach it i'll live it brother nathaniel this is okay i'm gonna i'm gonna use you i hurt his feelings a whole lot in life when i first met him he couldn't hardly read he was a sheetrock hanger he was broke but i knew that god was going to use him and have a family an incredible family and i kept in his ear yeah he got mad at me i told him you got to go back to school first of all you got to get your ged this is part of it get your ged because he couldn't read i didn't shame him i encouraged him i'm not shaming you in this sermon i'm encouraging you [Applause] come on i'm encouraging you i'm encouraging you [Applause] did he fail did he fall down yeah it took a lot of odd jobs to get himself through school one day i was one day we were going on a trip and for the first hour of that trip i was in his ear i've been his pastor a long time because i could see potential in him i'm using him i'm using you i could see potential listen god's got potentials laying on the inside of you but you can't be lazy with it man up before long he was in college before long he was he was struggling then he was working then he was still going to school i've been in his ear lately to go back to more school i'm driven i'm driven that's what's keeping me alive right now i'm driven there's mornings i get out of bed and i hurl and i hurl in a hurl and i just tell the voice give me about five more minutes and i'll get your truck with you i'm driven and we listen to tapes and we preach don't be jealous of me just go to work don't be jealous of what other people's got go to work i'm going to tell you how to get where i got just put god first in your life and go to work [Applause] amen brother ron i've had troubles have you been hit by lightning have you had heart attacks have you been burnt and laid in a coma and given up for dead and and uh gonna take your organs have you fought stage four cancer now you're welcome to lay your excuse down anytime you want to and say well this is excuse i can't serve god first you're welcome to tell me your excuse but god put an example in front of you that is driving you and let me just say this to preachers it's good to fish it's good to hunt and it's even good to work a lot of men will have never fell with women if they'd have been busy doing what god told them to do but they didn't man up a long time ago so now they got a scarred past and can't do the job but let me just say this put god first in your life and never look was back part okay i don't know did i get my point driven well let me don't tell your children to live right if you ain't just be honest with them be honest with them you can do better than i can do because i'm only half surrendered but i want you as my children to do absolutely one 100 percent just be honest parents if you can't live right tell your parents tell your kids to live right and just be honest with them i'm sorry i haven't fully committed myself to god but i want you to [Music] lord you got me into this and you're right it's tight let's start let's start here's what i want you to do i want you to get ready to leave [Music] there's people in kabul right now in this very minute that there's army soldiers standing guarding them because the enemy is coming probably this evening or tonight is going to take over their homes don't matter their offices don't matter you just got to get your shirt and your very necessary things you've got to leave because things tomorrow is not going to be what they are today and that's just the bare facts people with good jobs have just lost their jobs today and they lost everything that they had their little knick-knacks that are treasures that they had in afghanistan they they've got to leave them to live now you think i'm way out right here just now but i want to tell you this it's these kind of sermons that are telling you the rapture's happening are you with me and it's more than just one morning you're gonna wake up it's already in progress the bride around the world has been listening to these messages for years and it's preparing her one step at a time the script has been placed on the inside of her and she's living the life brother man said we are invited to shape our character to his character and you're going to leave everything of this world behind all your collectibles all your money all your iras it's going to do you no good but we don't need it where we're going [Applause] lord there's another way i can drive that point fire starts happening at your house you can't get all your collectibles and run you got to run for your life this world's on fire this world's shaken apart and i want to ask you at this point what's really important to you teddy roosevelt gave a speech the man in the arena and he said it's not the critic that counts i want to elaborate on that point just for just a little bit here if you're paying attention to your critic you forgot what's important to you because remember you and your critic are headed in two different directions brother on i'm not getting it well this cancer devil that i have been fighting for a year and a half we're headed in two different directions he's headed back to hell and i'm headed to heaven [Applause] this might be disappointing to you but people that send me nonsense tell me all different kind of things that i paid literally this much attention to them because they're headed where that cancer devil's headed make a movie about me don't bother me make a blog about me don't bother me so if you are paying attention to your critic do what brother ron does turn them off [Applause] can i give you a few quotes here the holy spirit is deity god tabernacled in a man think about that god tabernacled in a man god's not going to tabernacle in this pulpit or in these lights he wants to live in you sister ruthie wants to live in you he wants to live in you he wants to look out that window that you've got sister gabrielle that you saw jesus standing there looking out he wants to use your body to look out and in case you're wondering i'm watching that little fella and i'm going to break church order one of these nights and when he runs out i'm going with him i'm funny if you get to know me it's more than a sensation it's more than speaking to tongues it's more than shouting in the spirit it's more than weeping it's more than joining a church it's god living in a man deity god himself tabernacled in that person when he can speak it's just the same as god speaking that's the church of jesus christ that's the way that first apostolic church went forth another quote they deny the deity of jesus christ in this day that when people try to make jesus just a man why he was more than a man if he was just a man we're all lost he was god and nothing less than god he was god manifested in flesh jehovah the father dwelling in his son reconciling the world to himself are you with me now brother bam says there you are christ the mystery of god revealed there you are the body of christ living standing redeemed amen justified in his sight wow are we justified we are his victory the other day when sister karen's funeral took place many of you watched it but now henry's watched it by now her memorial service she was a queen on this earth and i felt commissioned to send her away as a queen and i felt commissioned to tell her well done you see she preached more sermons than brother tim preached her life her dress sisters whether you realize this or not you preach sermons from this pulpit uh are in walmart or on your jobs your atmosphere without saying a word you're working as a nurse people go something different about her may never say nothing to you but to go away if i was a christian i'd want to be like that working in a bank i'd like to be like her wherever you are when you conduct yourself as a lady these sermons live in your life come on church justified in his sight can i elaborate just a second here justification is as though you never did it in the first place in your memory you remember a lot of your faults and failures but when you're justified and god looks at it it's as though you never did it what a tremendous victory that it is that you can stand there and all of that be on satan's records and god can't even see it you know sister rachel sitting back there in the back maybe you on the internet's never met her but she was one of the roughest human beings you would not want to meet that little 120 pound woman in a dark alley if she was after your hide she was meaner brother kenny you're welcome to say amen at any point in this [Laughter] when you hear her scream when you hear her shout she's got a reason she got a license hallelujah brother ron i'd like for your church to be a little quieter well you got the wrong group we know what jesus has done in our lives [Applause] and we are the man in the arena we are the man in the arena jesus has come and met us in our circle [Applause] and we've been saved we've been filled we've been healed [Applause] and we got something to shout about i don't have to wait like this there i can start shouting right down here hallelujah i am committed i'm not going back i got nothing to go back to we're marching to zion [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i can't do your job for you but you've been built to do it you can't take nobody else's place but god designed you specifically to do it you're going to be the bible that most people read let it live as your musicians come just go ahead and put the dress on don't be ashamed of it where's carly carly the other day we got pictures of her twirling in her dress and she's just twirling the greatest day of her life she's just twirling in her in her dress and little miss ally she had a dress like her now she didn't have to wait till she got oh i feel like shouting right here she didn't have to wait till she got grown to twirl in her grace so she just started twirling [Applause] you may be young and you may be old you don't have to get to heaven to start twirling in your dress [Applause] coming to the church is the greatest thing in the world for a little part of this sermon we had to wash and scrub we got up under the possible and impossible and we scrubbed and we scrubbed we went down into our will of our humanity and we scrubbed and we scrubbed and we got to telling ourselves you're gonna have to do better and we're scrubbed and we're scrubbed and we're scrubbed and then we start putting on the dress cause if you live in a hog pin you better get washed up that's why your house ought to be clean because jesus could show up any day if your house ain't clean go home wash the dishes your bed ain't made make you better you need to vacuum the floor back in the floor jesus may just show up oh you thought i was talking about where you live i was talking about here i talked about here some of you was already getting offended brother honor you come to my house this afternoon where's allie you wait come here allie come here come up here paw paw isaac's done it a lot come on up here you ain't shy there's a lot of things you are but you ain't come here hold papa's hand i got a date with her this afternoon she said paul i want you to go eat with me so i got a date and i'm taking all the granddaughters grandsons and and i'm going to even take my wife i love you baby what did that have to do with the service i got a date i got a date with jesus now he may come to get me a little early but that's all right i've run a good race but i'm going to get that i hope to stay here until i get to go with all of you and brother vernon me and you look over at each other we the same age [Music] [Applause] and my knees are going to really work [Music] i'm sorry i didn't get done today but give me something for next week because we can say this i'm one of them i want you to tell your neighbor with a solid assurance i'm one of them and i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them it's not no accidental rapture i know for sure it's not happening without me can i just share one more story with you when i was a little boy we lived in a mobile home it was a long mobile home it was about 70 foot long and mom and dad's bedroom was on that end and mine was on the complete opposite end not saying anything here he's going to be watching in a little bit and mom's across the room but you know sometimes their snores would get quiet and i couldn't hear them 70 feet away and so i'd slip up that hall because i believed the rapture so much i didn't want to miss it and i didn't turn on the light and i'd slip through and i would get close enough i could hear him you won't believe it but that was the greatest sound as a little boy it's great to hear your mama and daddy go cause the rapture hadn't happened yet [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah but one of these mornings you're gonna call me gone cause i'm gonna be leaving [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and we don't want to leave one hoof behind grab your baby and say i'm going to do what i got to do but we're going to make it i'd like for you to say like joshua said as for me and my house i just want to remind you there's a burn ban that's on so if you decide to burn all
