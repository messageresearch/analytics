But Lord, before the foundation of the world, you said that you're my son and my daughter, and I'm going to do everything to make sure that you're in the kingdom of heaven with me, Lord, for all eternity.

Look at your neighbor and say, "I'm going to rise on that resurrection morning. I'm not I'm not somebody that's made up. I'm somebody that I was built to rise.

Sickness and stigmas and complexes. I was born to rise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you just love the Lord with all your heart? Are you ready for the word of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It won't be long. Then we'll be leaving here. [Music] It won't be long and we'll be going home. Oh, it won't be long and then we'll be leaving here. Oh, it won't be long and we'll be going home. Oh, count the years as months. Oh, and count the months as weeks. And count the weeks as days. A windy day now. And we'll be going home. It won't be long. Oh, it won't be long. Oh, [Music] we go home. [Music] Well, if I had Andrew's voice, I would continue to worship. But we have a Chihuahua voice this morning. So, we're happy to be here with you. We're honored to be among God's chosen for this hour. And it's not just Full Gospel Lighthouse, but it's the bride worldwide. &gt;&gt; You know, this message produces some of the most quality people that there is. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a people that share the same life, the same characteristics, the same passion, the same love that our father has as was in his son. And we we we're so thankful that God sent us a message. You know, as the older I get, the longer that I I stay here on earth and to dig into the things of God, the word, and then the message itself makes me have a greater appreciation for not only William Brandom and not only this message, but God's positionally placing a body and the understanding that we have and who we are. Because without that understanding, you'll just drift through life. You'll be up one minute and down the next. But God had anchored us in this word. And as I tried to preach to you last night, we have a hiding place. And when you're ever sheltered in that hiding place, no matter what buffets you, what storms rage against you, you have an anchor. You have a tie post. And this message, the further I go, Brother Ron, the deeper that anchor digs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we've had tough battles and tough times, but God has ever remained faithful to us. And this morning I just want to take some time and you know my pastor and you know the testimony of his lengthy services but you know I've been privileged for 20some years to s under a great ministry &gt;&gt; a great pastor a great friend and I'm not going to hold you two hours so you can breathe. But I'm very grateful that God has positioned us under great leaders and great men of God to to bring the word to us to give us understanding in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what an understanding we have. But I want to speak just for a little bit this morning if I could on the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; If you can catch the revelation of the mystery of his will. Not not brother Ron's will, brother Andrews will, brother Matt's, myself, any great man you want to put there, but the mystery of God's will. If you can take a little bit more of the highs out and maybe give me a little bit more lows, that'd be wonderful. Up here, um, we're going to look in Ephesians, and we understand that through the book of Ephesians, brother Brandon would tell us that the book of Ephesians is the book of Joshua. It parallels that. So, what did Joshua do? He placed the people in the land. And that's what Ephesians does for the bride. It places her in her original position in the body of Christ. And we start here in Ephesians 1 and verse three. It says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in Christ." Notice verse four here. according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. So you being here this morning had nothing to do with man. &gt;&gt; You being here this morning had nothing to do with any great preacher. It had nothing to do with mama and daddy. that he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated predetermined our destiny unto us the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will that word will there means purpose and plan so God has a purpose for each and every one of you that's here this morning young person he has purpose. He has a plan for your life. Grandmother, wife, husband, God has a purpose for you. And he has a purpose for the stage and the phase of the journey that you're in. And you know what? Don't get disgruntled with where you are in the journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep following God's path, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glory, of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted. That word accepted there means to make an object of favor. &gt;&gt; When you look at yourself and you see mistakes, but brother Chris, he sees an object of favor. my that he wants to bestow his favor upon you in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, which are on earth, even in in whom we've have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after his counsel of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory. The first who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted that after you have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and whom also after you have believed, you were sealed with the Holy Gh spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. God bless you. You can have your seats this evening. Like I said, I just want to take a little bit of time this this morning here and speak on the mystery of his will. And we find that a mystery in the Greek, it's mysterion, and it doesn't mean something that's spooky or hidden or unknowable, but it means a truth that is previously hidden. Thank you, brother Matt. But now being revealed by God. So a mystery is the divine purpose that was not fully understood in in the past but now we find that it's being made known unto us. And Paul will begin to explain remember before Paul came on the scene that the gospel or the ministry at that time was solely focused on the Jews. It was solely focused on the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And we find that one of the greatest mysteries is that God will turn from the Jewish dispensation. And now he would begin to turn his efforts through a vindicated prophet by the name of Paul and he would begin to establish the church on the revelation of who she is. Now remember Paul went on the back side of the desert. He wasn't taught by man but he spoke to God. Though he was taught under Galia, he had to take everything that he ever learned. He had to count it as dung and he got on the backside of the desert and he began to have the understanding of God. God would begin to reveal to Paul the great mystery that laid down through the ages. And yet Paul when he began to establish the church, he began to reveal to her the hidden mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Before the Gentiles had no inclusion in the plan of God, or so it seemed, they had no inclusion. It was all the Jews. And and we find here in Ephesians 3 and in verse one, for this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given to me to you, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a foreign words, whereby when you read, you may understand by knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, has now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs. &gt;&gt; I say thank God for Paul coming that God can take a vessel and to begin to reveal his plan of redemption and that not only was the Gentiles who once was outside but now through the revelation and the making known of the mystery now God was bringing in a gentile people. See, God had purpose in his heart. God had purpose in his mind that he wanted to take somebody, not just forced to love him, not just forced to worship him, but a people that would love God for who he is and for what he's done for them. And God would call out a Gentile bride &gt;&gt; and begin to establish her on the revelation of the word &gt;&gt; that the Gentiles should be fellows and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. So Paul didn't keep this mystery, brother Ron, hidden. No, he received a message from the angel on the back side of that desert and God be just to flow into Paul and reveal into Paul and you know Paul's group was ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Paul's group had everything they needed for the rapture. But there was Why could not Paul group take the rapture? Because of you right here tonight or this morning. See, Paul couldn't take a rapture because Paul wasn't aware that there was going to be six more church ages. But there was going to be a people in the final age in Satan's Eden that God was going to culminate. Matter of fact, here in this hour, this bride is the crescendo of everything that God had manifested and thought in his mind. You are that very manifestation here this morning. The very heart purpose of God is you. Full gospel lighthouse. I don't care what kind of day you're having. I don't care what kind of year you're having. I want you to come to the understanding and the revelation that no matter what you go through in life, you are the very heart purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Every preacher that he's ever sent, every prophet that he ever sent, every messenger that he ever sent, he sent him for one purpose. Get me a bride. Come on, somebody. Can I tell you this morning? You are that gentile bride. You are that elect lady. You are that predestinated son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But Paul would begin to reveal the mystery. Though Paul didn't have it all because Paul wasn't aware that there was going to be seven total church ages with seven total messengers. But he began to reveal the mystery that the Gentiles were included in the purpose of God, in the will of God, in the plan of God. And the mystery, as we said, is a hidden thing. You know, we tell secrets sometimes. It's a secret thing. It's a hidden thing. It's a mystery. And what brother Brandham taught us that God would begin to reveal the secret things to his bride. He said, "Not to these flatterers, but to her." &gt;&gt; Can you see your position? You that's received this revelation. And it not just be, as I said last night, well, God sent a prophet. It's more than that. It's a revelation of a mystery. Not of who the messenger is, but who he was sent to. &gt;&gt; So that's the thing that we got to understand. We, you know, and I don't mean to, you know, in this day and age and our client and our culture and where we are within the message. I believe we should be mature enough now to recognize that yes, God sent us an Eleazar, but our affection should not be to Eleazar. So we reverenced that office. We appreciate him coming to get Isaac a bride. But notice he came and he would tell Isaac, he would tell uh Rebecca everything about Isaac. How he walked, how he talked, what pleased him, how he moved, what kind of gentle nature he had, what kind of man he was. And he revealed to Rebecca all the characteristics of Isaac, his master. And what do you think this messenger done in this age? He came to this end time bride and he be to reveal to her what makes God tick. He went back into the back part of God's mind and to begin to show that everything that God has ever done, every purpose and intention that God has ever had been with a gentile, a gentile bride in mind. And you are that bride this morning. He began to reveal the things of God, the nature of Christ to a bride. Oh my. Don't sit here and just shut this off. Recognize who you are. We would find here in the the scripture 1 Timothy 3:16, it says that without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. So, we're going to find, we're going to look here just a few minutes on this, the mystery of godliness that God was manifested in the flesh. The logos now manifested in humanity. We have struggle with that. That how could the log go in my failures? How could that logos dwell in my humanity in my weaknesses in my shortcomings? And we allow the enemy to beat us and beat us and beat us around the stump on our failures, on our weaknesses, on our humanity. Look, I want you to understand this morning. Maybe you know we understand that by the scriptures and by the word and by the ministry of this hour that that soul of yours has been converted but this flesh still has weaknesses. &gt;&gt; You got to bring this thing under subjection. But don't let that ever steal away what God has done in your spirit what God has done in your soul. Your soul has been redeemed. &gt;&gt; And yet God manifesting in the flesh and he was justified in the spirit and he was seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on into the world and received up into glory. Notice what is the mystery of godliness. That great Jehovah God can come and be a man. that he can walk the same shores, go through the same pain, deal with the same afflictions, and still come out victorious. &gt;&gt; It was a mystery that almighty God can come. And let me tell you, the greater mystery is that he's still here this morning. &gt;&gt; And his deity tabernacling your humanity. &gt;&gt; God is still doing the same thing that God has always done. It's a mystery of godliness that God was manifested in the flesh. This proves that he's God, the eternal word, that the word was made flesh. First John 1 or John 1:1, that in the beginning was the word, the word was God and the word was with God. And in verse 14, the word was made flesh. So if it did it in that day, cannot the word do the same thing today? Cannot the word have the same impact today. &gt;&gt; See, he is justified. He was justified in the spirit. Whereas he was reproached as a sinner and put to death as a malifactor. He raised again by the spirit of God and was so justified from all the the the the calamities and whatever else which was loaded upon him. He was seen of angels. He was preached unto the Gentiles. Notice the Gentiles gladly received the message. And he was believed on into the world and preached and he was received up into glory in his ascension. His crowning exaltation &gt;&gt; that God didn't leave him in hell. God didn't leave him in a grave. And if God didn't leave him in a grave, if God didn't leave him in hell, what do you think he's going to leave you there for? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as he ascended, there's going to be a bride making an ascension &gt;&gt; because it's still the same. He's still God. And brother Brand will tell us in spiritual signs of the time without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh, seen of angels, handled into the world, received up into glory. So we find in this now that he was God made flesh. He tabernacled with us. &gt;&gt; I thank God that he can come in this hour in this humanity. &gt;&gt; So God reconciling the world to himself. And we find so all that God was, he pours it into Christ. &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he pours into the church, the bride. So we've seen it's not three offices or maybe say it like this three persons of the trinity but it's we got as three offices of one God and yet father son and holy spirit but we understand that everything that God was he's one but he pours every ounce of himself into a bride body &gt;&gt; but that bride body must recognize who she is. You're not just a churchgoer. You're not just a message believer. You don't believe just that God just sent a prophet, but you must believe that that message that that prophet preached. It was fit to me to change my life. And we talked about somebody taking a rapture, somebody oh being changed, stepping out of mortal into immortality. Let me tell you, that's got to be a revelation. If nobody makes it in Virginia, I'm going to make it. I've been called for it. Why? because it's a mystery is being made known to me in this hour that I'm part of the plan of God. I'm part of the will of God &gt;&gt; and the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; But notice in Revelations 10:7. So we start with Paul and Paul begins to preach to the Gentiles. He begins to reveal these things. The mystery that's been hid now revealed. See, that was the starting of the revelation. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, we're not starting the revelation any longer. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; That which was hidden is now going to be finished as he has declared to his servants to prophesy. So we see here that the angel of the Lord, never before was this angel or any angel permitted to say the things which this angel would share with this elect of this last day. So they had we've had great men of God, great messengers come through each and every age and call out a bride for their age and their dispensation. But there's something different about this one. &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay to say that this message, he will take all the loose ends of the previous ages and tie them all up. &gt;&gt; See, none of the others. They were reformers. Great men, but reformers. But this is not a reformer. This is a prophet. And not just a prophet, but a vindicated Messiah prophet. One sign to the generation. What was it doing? It was going to culminate in a wordborn bride. God wrapping it all up tied all the loose ends from the six previous ages. The beginning of the revelation is now going to be the finishing of the revelation. &gt;&gt; God making known his plan, his will. And brother Ram tells us here in the breach at the sounding of the seventh church age, the last church age, all the loose sins that through these church ages had been progged at or they've been wound together. But at the end of the Pentecostal age, we're supposed to receive according to the word. As God, help me tonight to show you through here that we're to be see, we're receive a messenger that will take all the loose sins out there. Reveal the whole secret of God. What? For the rapturing of the church, the mystery of his will. He's going to rapture a church. never before been done collectively a body. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about drinking Kool-Aid and everybody dying, but we talking about everybody rising. &gt;&gt; I know you can't comprehend that, &gt;&gt; right? Cuz you're in this thing called flesh. &gt;&gt; You're finite. He's infinite. All we can think about is where are we going to eat after service? &gt;&gt; All we can think about is work that's on the schedule for next week or we're thinking about the trial that we're in or going into or just coming out of. See, that's all that we can think about. But God doesn't dwell around those things. God is here to lift you up. He knows what's laying in his mind and he knows how to bring a ministry. He knows how to bring set you into a church. And one day this old mortal humanity is going to drop away from us. And we're going to take up on a new robe. It's going to be a robe of righteousness. It's going to be a body called a theophony body, a word body. And we're going to step out of this pest house into a new body. Never to sin, never toe, never to get cancer, never to have a bad day, never to shed a tear, a new body that he's going to give us, church. But it's the beginning of the mystery. But God sent a seventh angel to finish the revelation of the mystery. &gt;&gt; To finish the revelation. Oh hallelujah. Take the loose ends cuz this one probed here. This one probed there. This one probed. They probing by the intellect of man. And yet we understand God used man. There was a dispensation that man was his voice or his instrument. But the days of men are over. God sent a vindicated angel, a messenger to culminate. I want you to think of this service as a rapture service. Quit worrying about next week. Quit worrying about whatever you're worrying about. Put your focus on a body change. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not where you need to be. Like that old color lady. That old color sister said, "I ain't what I ought to be. I ain't what I want to be, but praise God, I ain't what I used to be." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Look at what you used to be and say, "Thank God. I'm not that anymore. I'm not a drunk. I'm not a a prostitute. I'm not that. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I've been born by the word of God. Quit looking at your failures. When you look in the mirror, tell the mirror it's a liar. &gt;&gt; That if it don't break. That mirror lies to you. It's saying, "Oh, you're getting old." Well, Chris, you're getting wrinkled up. You look at that mirror like, "You liar. I ain't getting old. I'm 18 to 20. &gt;&gt; You're lying to me. &gt;&gt; That mirror you look at it and said, "Oh, you look like an upside down melted ice cream cone." Boy, them ain't love handles, them are love rails. You looking at me and say, "You're a liar." Said, "There's a theophony that I'm going back to. There's a word body that I'm going back to. That's what I'm seeing. Look yourself in the mirror of God's word that I come from God. I'm going back to God. I've been changed by the word of God. God is making known the mystery of his will, the mystery of his purpose. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he will send you a messenger to tie all of it up. &gt;&gt; That's why I so appreciate this message. Let me tell you, I was out in denominations. They didn't preach these kind of truths. &gt;&gt; Oh, they take a smoke break. Look, I had friends I grew up with, Brother Andrew. I'd go out on Friday night, man, we'd have an all night drunk. Now, I'm not praising that, so get that out of your mind. Saturday night, we'd go out and get drunk. Sunday morning, they'd be in the house of God. You should have saw yourself last night. Sunday morning. You ain't no cherub. They say, "Oh, once saved, always saved." &gt;&gt; Look, I was a newborn babe in Christ. And I said, "Let me tell you, I believe once saved, always saved." But let me tell you, he's got to save you from something because you still going back to that same pest house. You going back to that slot that you've been eating. But I tell you what, when God got a hold of me, brother, when God got a hold of me, he took the desires out well before I came to the message. And if he can do that before, what can he do in I say, "Oh, glory to God." What can God do when the revelation of the mystery has been made known to her? When God got a hold of me, let me tell you, there was no going back, &gt;&gt; man. My buddies dropped me like I was a bad habit and I was glad. &gt;&gt; But would tell us though then in the last age all these mysteries are to be solved and handed out. See the prophet didn't just take these mysteries as a collective bunch of intellectual understanding and keep it to himself. No. But when he ripped the seals, the lamb used him to tear the seals off the book, he was only fulfilling the word of God. But he had to hand that book to somebody. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you, there's got to be a somebody. There's got to be a people in this hour that will take the book from his hands. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what use is it to tear the seals off of it if nobody's going to be there to receive it? But let me tell you, John was a type of the bride. And he had to take the book from the angel's hand. Not only did he take the book, but he had to devour the book. He had to to digest the contents of that book and prophesy again. &gt;&gt; So, you got a responsibility, bride. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe in a private. Well, big deal. &gt;&gt; Eat the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; See where you fit in the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; In the message adoption number four, &gt;&gt; I just find these things unique. So, forgive me if I take my time here and dwell on little aspects of a quote, but he says the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament, then back over into the New Testament and tied something together. see the mystery of his coming, the mystery of his will, and the mystery of us sitting together. &gt;&gt; So the spirit took them to the Old Testament, then brought them to the New Testament and begin to tie all these things together. My man, don't take for granted this message that we have. See, remember, it cannot be taught in a seminary. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. You cannot know it or you cannot know it by education, by theology. It's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. And brother B will tell us now he's talking about the book of Revelations. This is in uh the church age. She said, "Now, you recall I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book that we're studying as an is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages." Then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we failed to get it. See, bringing these two thoughts together, you will see that it won't take just an ordinary study, thinking to an ordinary study and a thinking to make this book real. When I first came to this message, that's what I thought, brother Chris, I was going to do. Great big theologian at the Baptist church. Only been saved two years. Yeah. Chihuahua coming out. Thought I was somebody. Yeah. I was rudely awakened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we find when I got hold of the tapes, I'm like, I'm gonna find out. All they want to talk about is William Brandon. William Brandon. William Brandon. William Brandon. I went to Eden Light Tabernac. It was more William Brandon than it was Jesus Christ. Early on. Everybody, they wouldn't tell me about Jesus. They told me about William Brandon. William Brand, I'm like, "Man, where's Jesus fit in this equation?" &gt;&gt; So, I got me some tapes and I took them back and I was living on my own over Mississippi. Yeah, that's the root of all my problems. I'm from Mississippi. So, don't blame it on Louisiana. Don't look at us in disgust. I moved away from there. We're good now. But I sat down, brother Ron, in my in my bedroom and I began to play the tapes and I like I want to hear this man for himself. &gt;&gt; And I but I took it with the aspect of trying to prove him wrong. Now, how am I to prove an angel wrong? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But some of you are still trying to do that today. &gt;&gt; Still trying to figure out where it's wrong, where he's off, where's this, where is that. But let me tell you, I've been in this message for 25, 26 years now, and I've not found one error. I've not found one fault. I started there in my bedroom trying to look for a fault. And God called me to preach this mystery to you today. There is no error. There is no fault. It's the vindicated word of the living God down to an elect. &gt;&gt; But I got a hold of the story of the ancient mama woman there in Memphis, Tennessee. how her faith grounded the plane cuz I was just a few hours south of Memphis and I know where Bill Street was. I used to party on Bill Street. That's probably walking in my steps. Oh, but something just began to ring out. And when he begin to pray for that boy, mama is getting light in the room. What is it? Revelation be to break forth. You know, it wasn't the revelation that we have today for that young man. But the revelation that he didn't have to die a sinner. He didn't have to die in that condition cuz all ain't your mama wanted wanted was to see her son saved. She didn't care if he died. Let me tell you, you got to get to that same place. I don't care if they die. I just want to see him saved. I just want to see him born again. I just want to see him filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's all I want is that assurance in this hour. And when brother Brandham came back to Memphis a little later and he jumped on that little trolley cart. Parson Brandom. Parsons Brandon. Remember me? No, I don't remember you. Are you that boy? I'm that boy. I'm not only healed, but I'm saved. Now, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, it turned my heart, Brother Ron. It wasn't great preachers from Ron Spencer and Tim Puit and Donnie Reagan at the time. It wasn't their ministry. It was the simple faith of a colored sister to have enough faith to trust in a man to trust in the word, to trust in a message that she never heard of before. &gt;&gt; And that prayer of faith over that boy and his life changed and it had a connection. And I've never I tell you, I've never been the same. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And when this mystery is ever made fully known to you, when it drops from here down to here, let me tell you, there ain't no going back. There ain't no giving up. There ain't no surrender. There's nothing to go back to. Why? Because you're focused. Something has happened. Your heart has been turned. &gt;&gt; But the mystery, brother Bam says, requires the teaching of the spirit. We got great teachers in this message, but we got to have the spirit to anoint not only the great teachers, but the ears of the hearer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice now he says now that means that the book it's going to notice he says it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost. That means that the book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. Now, I know some of you have always wanted to be special. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got one body in here that's going to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; You ever went to an airport? How many of y'all y'all go have airports in Virginia? &gt;&gt; Man, they get on you walk and they calling somebody's name and you just walking to your terminal, walking getting your food, walking getting your drink. You ain't thinking about a so and so. We need you here. We need you here. We need you here. Let them call your name one time. &gt;&gt; Stop, drop, and roll. I'm going. They can call my name. And that's what I'm telling you. It's a special class of people. You look out in the world, there's millions in the world. &gt;&gt; Come on, Virginia. Look around Virginia. Y'all got more than 10 people. But you're sitting here hearing the vindicated word of the hour been received the mystery of the will of God. It shows that you are the elect of God, a special class of people. Because only that special class can receive the revelation of the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; That shows who you are. Oh, Satan tried to cover it up. Try to put sin on it. Try to put a family lifestyle on it. traditions. A man's over to keep that seed from coming forth. But let me tell you, all that the Father has given me will come to me. I don't care if that little seed's got concrete pouring over. It's going to find itself up. It'll break that concrete. It's going to come to life. I mean, I was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come from a home that didn't serve God. But yet, God had a seed on the inside. And I went a long time, brother, sister. But God's promised that a son of God, he can go a long time before he ever recognizes that he's a son. But God planted a seed and that seed will germinate. It will manifest everything that God desired it to. There ain't enough affliction. There ain't enough hardships to keep that seed down. So, you're a special class of people. Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Man, &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell on myself briefly. No, I'm not. I'm going to keep preaching. Let's just move on. I just felt checked. I'm like, "All right." See, but the mystery, Brother Bram says, the mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it will never become clear. the mystery, how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear him and to know. 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 6, how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor the princes of this world that come to not, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. &gt;&gt; This is Paul. Even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. God ordained before the world unto our glory. That's why you're here. That's why you couldn't stay in the Amish community because God ordained before the world for your glory. That you could hear the mystery of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, I have not seen, nor ear has heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him. But as is notice, but but God had revealed them unto us by his spirit. &gt;&gt; This understanding that we have did not come by some great seventh grade educated Kuckian. I marvel at the books that that man would read &gt;&gt; and not just read but comprehend &gt;&gt; because it would take a spirit, the spirit to come and anoint him to pull out the things that we had need of &gt;&gt; out of those great theological books. &gt;&gt; A seventh grade. Look, we got a Kuckian in here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would have him stand up, but he'll probably reject me as his father-in-law, so we're not going to do that. &gt;&gt; Now, we want to throw off on Kentucky, but KY's a beautiful state. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm fond of Kentucky. I got a beautiful daughter living over there. &gt;&gt; But they're not a bunch of idiots. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we think, well, he's a seventh grade educated Kentucky. We off, you know, people in the world just offcast. He come from a broken home. home. He come from not a broken as far as marriage, but a broken home of alcohol and Catholicism and all those type of things. And yet God would take a man like that and begin to mold him through hardships, shape him so that he can deliver a message to an end time people. &gt;&gt; And we find here God has revealed them unto us by his spirit. And so God would use that mouthpiece and he would break the revelation open and begin to share things that have never been shared. Oh my I think it's marvelous after the seals come open how the book changed. How the ministry begin to change. How the focus begin to change. Christ the mystery, the invisible union, you know, Melzd, all these wonderful titles, but got to go beyond the title and look and see what God is doing. Every sermon, brother Ron, after the opening of the seals, the prophet is revealing the mystery. &gt;&gt; Revealing the mystery that it was never about him, &gt;&gt; but it was about them. &gt;&gt; It's all been about you. Let me keep going now. For what man knoweth the things of man? Say, the spirit of man which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. And we, and he goes, now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God. Then we go to Colossians 1 and verse 25. Wherefore am I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you. Notice the dispensation given to me Paul for you bride. &gt;&gt; I want you to see the placing church. Paul's not placing it on himself. &gt;&gt; Paul knew the office which he held. Paul was very aware that he held the office of setting the church in order. That gentile bride, getting her ready, calling her out of that Pharisee lifestyle, out of that life of sin. But he says now God did it through me but it's for you. And let me tell you the same thought or the same thought and the same message that the apostle Paul preached William Brandham preached it. It never was about William Marryiam Brandom. It's always been about the revelation of the mystery of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And when the seals come open he begins to reveal more and more and more the invisible union. And it begins to real more Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And what is the mystery of Christ, it's the mystery of the bride in this hour. &gt;&gt; God begins to pour it out. So it's no longer a mystery or a loose end, &gt;&gt; but the mystery of God at the sounding of that seventh angel, it's finished. Then he says in verse 27, to whom God will make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; See, Paul had that revelation. &gt;&gt; And Paul was sharing that revelation back in the Ephesian age. And I'm afraid sometimes we miss the revelation in this age. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got generations that grew up in the church. Look, I see a bunch of young people, generations that all they've ever heard is the message, the message, the messes, the message. All they've ever heard is great message preachers. But it's got to be more than just hearing the message. As I said last night, we didn't come to talk about the message. We come to get in the message. And the message is Christ. Don't just settle for sitting on a pew. Don't just settle for going to Full Gospel Lighthouse. Don't just settle for Evening Tabernacle. Don't you settle for just sitting under some man, but make sure you get into the message which is Jesus Christ and let him get into you. &gt;&gt; So when I begin to think about the thought that I preached last night and the thought that I'm preaching to you today, thou art my hiding place. And if I can give this a subtitle today, I can see Jesus, brother Ron, telling David, that thou art my hiding place. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That you little bride are hiding Elohim. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; El Shadai, Yahweh, Adonai, &gt;&gt; in this in this. &gt;&gt; Thou art. He's telling you little bride, thou art my hiding place in your humanity, in your weaknesses. You're hiding Jehovah God. The mystery &gt;&gt; of the revelation of the will of God being made known to an end time people. He's not out there telling TNN different channels about who he is, but he's telling you, bride, brother B would take this and he would make a statement here. He says, "Now, in Christ and mystery, we're going to come out of here for a little bit this morning. I don't know what time I started, so y'all just tell me when to stop." He says, "When this great revelation revealed mystery is made known to you, then you denounce all the things of the world." &gt;&gt; So young person, if you got one foot in the world and one foot in the church, then the mystery ain't been made known. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I believe God sent a prophet till you blew in the face." But you just playing the life of a hypocrite. You got to be all the way in because when this great mystery, this revelation mystery is revealed to you, you denounce all the other things of the world. So when God in this message, so when you see God in this message, you can't see anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's all I can see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I wake up talking to God. I go to bed talking to God. Now, I got a beautiful wife, but I don't wake up talking to her. &gt;&gt; Not saying that wrong, honey. &gt;&gt; When she rolls over in the sleep, I'm over there talking to the Lord. I mean, I just love it. It's my life. &gt;&gt; And I go to bed talking. I wake up talking to him, planning the day. Then I go in and have devotion with him and you know and get before him you know before I start my day you know it's all everything he consumes everything about me and once you receive the revelation and it's not just who God is but it's who you are you start seeing not only who God is but you see your place notice now in the Bible we hear a story have a story Abraham and Sarah Abraham had the revelation he had it known to him he was going to bring forth this done. He was willing, brother Ron, to wait however long it took to wait. But Sarah struggled with the revelation. &gt;&gt; Sarah struggled for 25 years. Oh, take my handmmaid Hagar. Take her and you can do this. And you know, and then after that was done, that was at the will of Sarah. She despised Hagar and despised that that bond child. Well, let me tell you, Sarah had to get to a place that she could judge God faithful. that God that gave the promise is more than able to fulfill the promise. And I'm here to tell you tonight or this morning rather when you judge God faithful that he is the same yesterday, today and forever, then you will see yourself in the plan of redemption. You will see yourself in the mystery of God &gt;&gt; that it's not just for Abraham. It's not just for the preachers. It's just not for moms and dads. It's not just for deacons and great men. It's for whosoever will. If you judge God faithful this morning, God will fill you with the Holy Ghost and make known the revelation of his will, his purpose, and his plan for your life. And he's got to be everything that you desire, everything that you think about. And you denounce all the other things of the world. Brother Abraham would take Colossians 1:15-29 and he would preach Christ the mystery of God revealed. And if you've not listened to that in some time or better yet, go study it. Don't leave it all on the ministry. You go study it. So he's picking up, brother Ronnie, picks up Paul's inspiration, the mystery that includes Gentiles. The mystery that means we come from God. We're going back to God. See, he not only preaches the mystery of godliness and who God is, but he begins to show who the bride is and why all this was sent for. Malachi 4. A lot of us for many years, we focus Malachi 4 only on the the messenger of Malachi 4. And we miss that little three-letter word. We miss that most important word in that entire scripture. Behold, I send you. &gt;&gt; I send you. It's got to be personal to you this morning that he's sending you a messenger that turns your heart from unbelief to believing, from not trusting to trusting. And and this revelation has to be the mo utmost importance. It's got to be the most important thing. And it's not taught by intellectual knowledge. It's not taught by being able to, you know, put quote on top of quote or verse on top of verse. But it's going to take revelation to understand the mystery of God. And then the bride must see who she is. And brother B, I'm going to tell us in Christ a mystery as I keep going here just for a little bit more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mercy Tim Puit spirit got all over me this morning. &gt;&gt; And I did study good. Ah mercy. I'm going to get in trouble for this. He said, "God's secret mystery." I got to figure out how in the time frame here I'm going to wrap all this up. What time did I start? Okay, it don't matter. We're good. We're in Virginia. We're going to have church. &gt;&gt; See, now God's secret mystery that he had before the world began. Clue in here. This is after the opening of the seals. It's a new book. Now his ministry begins to shift. Now he's focused on this mystery revelation of who you are. He knows who he is. He knows he's the Elijah. He knows his position. He knows his responsibility. He's got to get you ready. So listen what he says here now. back in the back part of God's mind, there was something that he was trying that he was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed. &gt;&gt; So in the back part of God's mind, he had thoughts. He had attributes. But let me tell you, never has it been before that God will send a man on earth that will reach into the very back part of God's mind and bring his thoughts to the forefront and reveal them to a people. But God in this generation, in this dispensation, in the finality of all the Gentile dispensation, he's in a vindicated prophet that would go into the very back part of God's mind and begin to reveal that that little bride, she was a thought in God's mind before the foundation of the world. That's where you were before the first sin ever came. Before the first atom and molecules ever blew off his hand, you were in God's thinking then. no other age. So God's greatest desire, how many wants to know God's greatest desire? &gt;&gt; Keep your hand up. It's you. &gt;&gt; God's greatest desire. I didn't tell you put your hands down. Simon says and I'm Simon under the alias of Joe. You can put your hands down, very well-trained students. But notice God's God's greatest. You know, we we read about great men, brother Ron, in the Bible, men like Shamgar. I think he and I are twins. Me, him, and Andrew. Anyway, don't get the two of us together. If we done done that, we got stories to tell, but we ain't tell them in church. Better not. But God's great desire, his predominant or prevailing thought is you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I tell on myself? I'm going to tell them myself now. &gt;&gt; First time I walked in the Evening Light Tabernacle, it's like, "Oh, yeah." I thought I I'll be honest. I thought I was better than everybody there. Shame on me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I thought a bunch of old Backwoods country hick church. I come a long way, guys. A long way. And I come in there and then all of a sudden some little young lady. I ain't going to point right there. She is. She took a liking. She liked what she saw. &gt;&gt; Hey girl, I don't blame you. [Applause] And I like what I saw. &gt;&gt; So we begin. I remember the first time I asked her, "You want to ride with me?" I remember that. You want to ride? I had to. She said, "You got to get the door." Weston, good job. So I got the door and from that point, that's all I could think about. I had to make her my bride. I mean, she looked good. She sang good. Amen. &gt;&gt; She smelt good. Hey, she had everything going in her favor. &gt;&gt; See, why are you saying this, brother? Cuz all I could think about was Jessica Shaw. I laid down thinking about her. I can't wait to talk to her again. I can't wait to church. Okay, I wanted to go to the house of God, but I had an ulterior motive in going, "Don't Hey, don't look at me like I'm dumb. Some of y'all been in the same spot, and some y'all drove three hours just to see her." But it was all I could think about. Now, if that's in the natural, and yet &gt;&gt; in the back part of God's mind, there laid the mystery of bride, &gt;&gt; an end time elect. She's perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She looks good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She dressed right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She smells right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. All he can think about is the manifestation of that bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His most predominant thought is you. &gt;&gt; It's not a Ron Spencer and Andrew or Matt or Joe or any great preacher. We're just subjects. &gt;&gt; We're part of that bride body. And like William Brandom is part of that bride body. But his most predominant thought, his crowning achievement is you. So much so that a prophet would preach the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't about him, &gt;&gt; but it was about them. &gt;&gt; You are the masterpiece of God. God making known the mystery of his will. And I agree that we need a prophet. I'm not going to ever say we don't. I'm thankful for this prophet. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for this prophet, we wouldn't know who we are. &gt;&gt; But church, you got to put your eyes also on who you are. &gt;&gt; And don't take for granted that God has called you in this hour. young person, you can't take for granted that you were born into the family in which you were born into. God predestinated that seed to come through that lineage so that you could hear this message in this hour. &gt;&gt; Because notice, he's preparing a people for a change, for a rapture. That's the purpose of the message. &gt;&gt; It's not to elevate man. It's not to elevate ministries. It's not to elevate gifts. is to elevate Christ. And by elevating Christ, he's going to elevate and ascend a bride. &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. Now, in his great mind, can I keep going? Yes, I can. Thank you. In his great mind, he wanted these attributes to be expressed. In him was love. In him was a father. In him was a son. In him was a savior. In him was to be a healer. All these great attributes that we see already expressed, they were in God. In another place, he would say these attributes are the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; So you were the very thought of God. And so notice he but in him was love. He needed somebody to love him. He was not even God at this time. He was only an object of worship. And so the first thing that he did, he created angels. And angels begin to worship God. and holy, holy, holy. But even with the angels, God was not pleased. There was still something missing. Brother Ron, in the heart of God, God wanted to be more than just worship. God wanted to be loved. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, father, husband, whoever you are, I appreciate that your wife adores you and maybe she worships you, but it's got to be more than just worship. I want my wife to love me. &gt;&gt; And God wants his wife to love him &gt;&gt; to reciprocate that love that he has for her. He wants it in return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was not God. And so he created the angels and here they are. They come and worship him. And but he wanted a bride. And he would tell us in Genesis that, "Oh, it's good that man shall not dwell alone." &gt;&gt; Cuz see, God knew what it meant, brother Matt, to dwell with his thoughts, &gt;&gt; to not be loved, to not be worshiped. So he created Adam and he looked at Adam and Adam being an offspring of God, he had the same genetic strain. And inside of Adam, he looked at all the other human or not humanity, but all the other animal life. And all of them had a mate. But Adam didn't have a mate. He didn't have anyone to share his love with in his life with. So God put Adam to sleep. And from his rib, he made a helpmate. And see, that's what God is looking for is a helpmate. And he began to reveal it in every type of the Bible. And brother Bam said, "Therefore, the whole Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ. The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had." &gt;&gt; One goal. One goal. one goal, one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. If you go read the Old Testament and he begin to show you Moses and Zapora, Joseph and a gentile bride, Boaz and a Moabitete, Ruth, Rahab the harlot marrying Salmon the general, Hosea taking a wife or the whoredom, Abraham and Sarah being translated back to young with a promise to bring forth the promised son. Every type in the Bible, God's showing, I'm going to take a gentile wife. &gt;&gt; One goal, brother Ron, &gt;&gt; one purpose. That word, remember the mystery of his will. That word will is purpose. And it's been a mystery, &gt;&gt; but he's typed it out down through the scriptures. But in this final age, through a vindicated prophet, a messenger, he be to tie all the loose sins. Hey, I'm up here. Everybody get back in check. Preaching's going on up here. Crying's going on over there. It's different. &gt;&gt; But we find everything that God has done. He's typed it out. And in this final age, in this final day, in Satan's Eden, he's going to call out a gentile wife. &gt;&gt; And he said that before the foundation of the world, he slipped on your finger. &gt;&gt; It wasn't when you came to the altar. It wasn't when you joined Full Gospel Lighthouse. It wasn't when you came to Even Light Tabernacle. It's not when you went to Jeffersonville. It's not when you came in contact with the message, but before the foundation of the world, he put that wedding ban of predestinated unmarited favor on your finger. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he says, "I'm going to marry you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Placed it on you. He and he's going to bring that bride, those thoughts, brother Andrew, to the forefront. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not ashamed to call you bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In so much so, brother Matt, that he would tell a prophet, "I no longer call you church, but I'm calling you bride. &gt;&gt; You're part of me. You came from me. You were in my thoughts. And no time has it ever been before in any other previous ages has a prophet risen up and gone into the back part of God's mind." &gt;&gt; Amen. But he did it for you. Can I keep going? &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27. To whom God will make known what is the riches of his glory, which is the mystery of the Gentiles, which is Christ in you. See, here's the mystery. Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor. Man, that's a mystery, ain't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't say yeah. Get yourself in trouble on Sunday morning. Not as a Now, I know some of y'all took that wrong. You thought I was saying your neighbor was ugly, but I never said that. But it's a mystery how that God can be hidden behind that vessel, &gt;&gt; behind that veil. Cuz see Jeremy, do you know Amy? Amy, you know Jeremy? That's a yes. Y'all are married, right? April. I had him with the wrong wife. That bro wasn't going to say amen to nothing. I don't know who Amy is. That ain't no spirit of discernment up here. I can tell you that. Sorry, Sister A. April. Let me start that over. Jeremy, you know April. April, you know Jeremy. See, you know him better than anybody else in this room. And you know her better than anybody else in this room. You know what makes her tick. And she knows what button. Because you sisters have a way of pushing the button and it's not the eject button. It's a get mad quick button. I don't know how y'all figured that one out. But you know, and but yet behind that is a mystery is Christ. It's a mystery is Christ is behind that vessel and all their weaknesses and all their shortcomings and all their imperfections. Yet Christ, I'm so thankful, brother Ron, that Christ lives in our humanity. &gt;&gt; That deity, he would choose deity would come and tabernacle our humanity. We were all headed to a sinner's hell, our grave, and a devil's hell. But yet God, rich in mercy, had already saw you, predetermined you, placed his wedding band of unmmerited favor on your finger and he's keeping you from that. So we go on, as I said, what a perfect, brother says, what a perfect type of Christ, his deity, his love. He came forth into the world and laid himself over humanity, his church, his believers. Moses had them partly. David had them partly, but now he's talking about Jesus. But here, deity himself standing on earth, God in the fullness to die for the sin of the people. So God wouldn't let you continue down that road. He came. And sometimes we even and I please help me then understand the way I'm going to mean this. But even Jesus's appearing and him coming and paying that sacrificial sacrifice, it wasn't all about him. It wasn't about God proving that he can transcend and God can come and create a body and live in a body. It was more than just God coming from the great eternities and manufacturing or creating a body to step into and live in. But God created that body for one purpose is so that he could pay the sin debt that you couldn't pay. &gt;&gt; Everything, church, that God has ever done, even sending forth Jesus Christ to pay for the sin that you couldn't pay. It was so that God could take a wife, so that God could take a bride, so that God could share his love with somebody. &gt;&gt; It's always been about you. Even in Jesus's coming, he had thoughts of being a healer. There had to be somebody to heal. Thoughts of being a deliverer, there had to be somebody to deliver. Thoughts of being a father, there had to be somebody that would, excuse me, accept him as his father and be sons of God. God didn't manifest himself in Jesus just to prove that he can become a man. I know that's a strong statement. I know many people may click that out and say, "Oh, brother Joe, don't even believe in Jesus Christ that he's a predominant one." I absolutely believe it. &gt;&gt; But I believe he had a purpose and I believe he had a plan and I believe he had a will. And you are the heart purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, why would he come? &gt;&gt; Why would he die? See, he became Jesus because of you. you mystery bride was what he was thinking of when he wanted sons and daughters of God. He came to heal you. He came to deliver you. He came to restore you. Came to reveal himself to you. He came to not only reveal himself, but he came to reveal who you are. He came to positionally place you as sons and daughters of God. I'm going to caveat just for a minute and I'm going to come back and we're going to start parachuting down. You know how they do in them 747s. They pull back a little bit and you feel a plane slow down a little bit. We're going to slow down a little bit because we coming to a landing. Now, don't get on the ground before I do. Don't open up the emergency doors and bail out on me. We're not done yet. &gt;&gt; I said we coming to Atlanta. Notice he came to positionally place Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, apostolic, different ones in the body. Said, "No longer give you a spirit of fear, but I give you a spirit of adoption." What is adoption, Brother Joe? It's the placing of a son. See, as a parent, there's a term out there. You can go look it up. It's called disownment. &gt;&gt; And as a parent, you can have a snotty little kid grows up into a wretched individual and you can disown that son or that daughter. You can disown them. Write them out. Sever ties with them never to do anything else with them ever again. like they never existed, never was a part of your family. But an adopted child, see, there's legalities to adopt a child. There's paperwork, there's time, there's things that has to go through, guys. It has to go through the legal system. But once that adoption has been made, and this is in the natural, and once that adoption has been clear, then you get all the rights as if you were the natural parent of that adopted child. And notice that adoption was to be permanent, never severed, never never broken. &gt;&gt; So why are you saying this, brother? Because I'm telling you that in the legalities of adopted children that an adopted child can never be unadopted. &gt;&gt; There's no legal process to unadopt a child once there's been adopted. What am I telling you? I'm telling you, if that's in the natural, then what about the spiritual? If God came in this hour and placed you as adopted sons and daughters of God, then God cannot unadopt you. But God's positioned you. He's placed you as his son, as his daughter, as his bridal this last day. &gt;&gt; He's not going to give up on you. He's not going to disown you and throw you away. But he quickens you with the Holy Spirit and places you in the family of God. My what a great revelation. But he said he had one purpose and I'm going to speed up through the rest of this. And through that purpose, let me back up. He said, "What was Jesus manifested for? To show God that he was God." And through that purpose, he achieved the church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in the last days. when he gets the preeminence now the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for I go unto my father see that was his purpose there was a manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can that can see it that they can let the word otherwise let the word flow out in their life so the church becomes the word he says Now, he sanctified his spirit and the blood and the church that he might make every promise in the last days revealed. But he had a three-fold purpose, brother Ron. See, first he wanted God wanted to reveal himself to the people. He can only do that through Jesus Christ. Secondly, he wanted a premise in a body of believers, that is the bride, that he might live in a people. And third, to restore Eden, bring her back which was lost. That was the only thing that was out of order. So God came and manifested in the form of Jesus Christ and to have preeminence in the body of believers so that the bride and groom can go back to glory again back into the back part of God's mind. And that's what God has done. That's why he has sent you a message &gt;&gt; and so that you can see where you came from. And if you can ever see where you came from, all the trials of this life will be nothing. Because why? Because I come from God. I'm going back to God. No cancer, no sickness, no trial, nothing can destroy that. I come from the very recesses of God's great thinking. I'm going back there, church. And Satan don't have enough. Hell don't have enough. Leodysia don't have enough. Oh, Virginia don't have enough. Louisiana don't have enough. This world don't have enough to keep us bound. We're going back to God because the mystery of God has been made known to a people. the anointed man. Now, &gt;&gt; the anointed people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me bring this down. God, he says, "And why cross feet?" God has got a purpose of you being here. &gt;&gt; You be like, I wish he'd tell me. He goes, "If you can only be get to the place, how much trouble would you save God and yourself?" &gt;&gt; What is my purpose? This would be the manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; All heaven, all creation is groaning, &gt;&gt; groaning in pains for what? For the manifestation of the sons of God. Do you realize every tree, every animal, botney life, animal life is waiting on you? Some of you need to get your stuff together. &gt;&gt; Waiting on you to come into the manifestation of what God has called you to be. &gt;&gt; Never let this word be secondary. Never let it just be some byproduct. It has to be a priority. &gt;&gt; And priority number one, &gt;&gt; the word of the hour. Hey, there may be times, wife, you may have to pull, kick, scream, kick, prod, whatever to get that man to church, but you get him there. Husband, it may be the same. You going to have to kick. Or maybe we don't kick. What we do is we promise. I take you shopping. I love shopping. I don't know how we get kicked. They go shopping. &gt;&gt; Yeah. April looked at you then. I caught that. Yeah. I didn't get your name wrong that time. We do everything. And I look, we we we're humans, right? &gt;&gt; We struggle sometimes. We're walking through those doors. &gt;&gt; Don't say that too loud. Your pastor's right here. &gt;&gt; But it's true. This humanity gets in the way. But if you can ever catch the revelation that the life that we now live, as Paul would say, I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave him his life to me. We're not living this just because some favorite preacher or some, you know, whatever it may be. We're living this because Christ has come and tabernacled our humanity. So, not only did God have a purpose for Christ coming, but he has a purpose for your coming. Somebody's going to prove to devil that in Leodysia, he's going to have a church. Now, I know your your assistant pastor, he and I preached together, and he took a thought that I'd said, and I'm not going to go with it, but Satan borrowed a body. But God's also borrowing a body. And let me ask you, who's got a stronger body? &gt;&gt; Who's got a greater body? He had one. God's got many. And if he with one can cause the fall, what can God do with many? &gt;&gt; He can cause a rapture. &gt;&gt; He can call a rapture. &gt;&gt; Who you think's going to call this rapture? Brother Brandham ain't coming back to call the rapture. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; No, you're going to call that rapture. &gt;&gt; You're going to Your longing to be there is going to be so intense and so great, you're going to call that body change down. One minute you will be, the next minute you will not be anymore. &gt;&gt; Let me bring this down. Musicians, you can make your way back. Told you I was slowing that plane down. Brother tell us the law of the kinsman redeemer required or the law required a kinsman redeemer. The law of God required a kinsman redeemer. And he said grace met God's requirement in the person of Jesus Christ. See the law required it and grace met the requirement. And he said the kinsman redeemer first must be born of the human race and the virgin birth produce our kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; and he come as the lamb of god. God's law brother says required a kinsman redeemer. And the lamb come out holding it. He says I am their kinsman. I am their redeemer. I have made intercession for them and now I have come to claim their rights for them. Notice church, there's only one. I've come to claim their rights and that that I have a right to everything that lost in the fall. I paid the price. God has come to claim you in this hour. That's why you can receive a message. That's why your heart can be open to the mystery of God. Brother Bam said he died to res to resurrect his bride. Some of you may be questioned. How many you've ever had a question you didn't have an answer to? [Music] You felt embarrassed. Man, I should know that. I should know the answer. But there's times that we find ourselves without the answer. And we find generations that's gone before us didn't have the answer. But God sent a prophet and he said we now now we have the answer to the devil's question cuz down through six previous ages down into this leis and age he has questioned the validity of this bride. &gt;&gt; He's questioned your coming. He's questioned your integrity. He's in question your dedication to the word. But the prophet of God said, "Now, now we have the devil, the answer to the devil's question, that the headship has come and there's been an invisible union with the bride. That we're not going to stay here, church, but we're going to transcend and go back to our heavenly home, back where we came from. Now we have the answer. Now, this day, this moment, the revelation of the mystery of God's purpose and God's plan has been made known to a bride, to a predestinated, a lake seat of God. The marriage is at hand, church. God's three-fold revelation, God in Christ, God in his church, and we're going back to a kingdom. Oh, we have the answer to the devil's question. Not me that liveth, but Christ. That's why it's paramount that you young people get the Holy Ghost. Don't settle for a shout. Don't settle for a tear. Don't settle for a goosebump. You make sure you get the Holy Ghost. You make sure mom and dad, you get the Holy Ghost. And you preach Jesus Christ in that home and create an atmosphere for the presence of the angel, the Lord can come into your home and begin to move. One of the greatest compliments my family ever gave me, Brother Ron, and all my years of preaching. They said, "We want a home just like this." Just like this. [Music] There's laughter in that home. There's joy in that home. There's boundaries in that home. Why is that? Because there's Christ in the marriage. There's Christ in the home. Greatest compliment, Brother Chris, my kids gave me in all my years of ministry. I've cast out devils, Brother Ron. I've seen sick healed. I've done I've been uh been in great wonderful meetings. But that's the greatest compliment that's ever been given. [Music] What about Christ? What about his bride? As I begin to close this out, what Bible said, we stand justified in Christ. He said, justified in his sight. We are justified. We are his victory. The church is his victory. We come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose and we are the proof of his victory. Oh, I love that. When we see him coming down and living among the church, that's the victory. Shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can he keep us in the grave. Oh, so the same word that moves from the head as a day comes to a close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one. Oh, here it is, church. He said, "There's been churches, churches, brides, brides, but there has to come one." Oh, come on, full gospel. I said, "There's been churches, churches, and brides, brides, but there must come one. There must come a bride of this last day who's the fulfillment of all that's been wrote up concerning the bride." And can I tell you, you are that bride. You are that manifestation of the bride of Jesus Christ. He's not coming for another. He's coming for you. Let's worship him this morning. Little bride, this is your moment. This is your hour. This is your time to give God praise. Let me tell you, she's bone of his bone, life of his life. She is him. &gt;&gt; I said she is him. She is the revealing of the mystery of God. He's hid it. But now it's in plain view. [Music] I said, "Now it's in plain view. He's not hiding you anymore. Now he's pushing you out. I'm going to have an elect. Do what you can, Satan. She won't fall like that first Eve fell, but she's going to stand the test. She is him." And he said, "Oh, how the bride loves to hold that promise." Honey, after 23 years, I hope you still love to be married to me. Right answer. And after 6,000 years and some 2,000 years of a gentile dispensation, I wonder, little bride, what is your answer? Lord, you made known to me the mystery. Everything's been about me, and now I'm in fulfillment. I'm here not just to be a churchgoer, not just to be a message believer, not just to agree that God sent a prophet, but to be the mer manifestation of the mystery, the very manifestation. Thou art my hiding place. He's here. I just felt it. Brother Andrew, you are hiding Elohim. with every head bowed and every eye closed just as we bring this to a close this morning. [Music] Thou are my Let these words come to your ears as if it's Jesus Christ himself speaking to you. Everything I ever done, every message I ever preached, every trial ever sent you away was for a purpose to call you, to form you, to fashion you, to shape you, to be my bride. Have I've come in this last day. And I'm making known to you, little bride. I'm whispering in your ear this secret mystery that I had before the foundation of the world. That you always were with me. And if you were ever with me, you always will be with me. I'm coming. I'm coming. Just a few more days, a few more sunsets, and I'm going to come and I'm going to change your body. I'm going to come and I'm going to transform you. That pest house that you're living in, you're not meant to live in that permanently. That cancer that's ravishing your body, one day it's going to leave behind and we're going to trans. We're going to take a step out of it and we're going to enter into a new body. Cuz where I am, there you may be also. The father in me, I and the father, you and me, and I in you, is the fulfillment of all the mystery of God. Father, we just come today, Lord. Want to say thank you for the time you've given us in your house, in your presence, Lord, I can just hear you say, "Thou thou art my hiding place. 5' 5 and 1/2 little vessel, Lord, but yet hiding the holiest of holies, God Almighty, manifesting the very mystery of the will of God." So, Father, we thank you this morning that you chose humanity to dwell in. You chose a bride, Lord God, from every aspect of life, every race, every creed, every tongue, every color. Lord, it has no uh implications upon your choice, God. You chose us all, Lord, to manifest an end time bride, Lord. and you showed us through the scriptures, Father, your purpose in your plan, choosing that Gentile, placing us in the family of God, placing us in the lineage of Christ.
