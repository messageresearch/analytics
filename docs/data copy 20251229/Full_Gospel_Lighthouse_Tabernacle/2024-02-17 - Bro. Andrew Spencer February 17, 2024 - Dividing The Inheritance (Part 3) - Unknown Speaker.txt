Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord Jesus Lord underr expectation father for the things that are stored up Lord Jesus knowing god that Lord that you said in your word where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them Father we've gathered here Lord Jesus time and time again Lord many years Lord of worship and spending time in your presence of reading the words of God but tonight we are standing at the same spot that we've stood before but we are in a different time and Lord we're in a Time Time Lord like a never before Lord that we need to see you father Lord when the world wants to deny that you're real when the world wants to try to quench the very spirit of God lord we want our hearts we want our words we want our actions everything that we are Lord to be pleasing unto you father Lord we want to be salty father so that the rest of the world would thirst for you Lord Jesus I pray that all of our actions our attitude our speech Lord would perfectly line up with the word of God for this hour the things Lord Jesus that you have for us here in lsy Lord even Lord even though we understand who we are in our position as the Church of the Living God I pray father that we would open the door Lord Jesus let you come in Lord and break the bread of life father Lord we never want to get to a spot in our life where we think that we've gone too far we've we've grown so much in God that we've we've known it all we understand it all Lord but I believe Lord that even maybe those that would be sitting here message Scholars Lord that we would say that our heart hungers father to know you in a deeper and a greater way father Lord we we take our shoes off Lord we humble ourself Lord in your presence Lord and we want to see you face to face father we want to see you Lord and to know that that you are the one that picked up the pen that you are the one that led us us down through life's journey Lord and you took control of us Lord when we thought other things were leading us Lord but it was you there all the time lord and we want you to have your way in our life tonight that we would stand back and say that that was the Holy Spirit that was speaking to us and we invite you Lord now both speaker and hearer father Lord to come and take control of this service that it'll be a benefit to thy kingdom Lord that's why we're here Lord that's why we come to the house of God is to receive correction Lord Jesus and the greatest correction that there is is love father and Lord we humble ourselves before you and Lord we want to be ready Lord for your your coming you're soon approaching Lord and you see every hand that was lifted up Lord I pray that you would be God to them today Lord we're your children and we love you and we humble ourselves before you this weekend and ask God you'd speak to us lip to ear in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over into a few portions of scripture into Joshua chapter 1 and verse three now to Ephesians chapter 1 and Hebrews chapter 6 as well amen Joshua chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 and then Hebrews chapter 6 and I'll I'll give you the verses as we turn there that way you don't have to Fumble through there and try to find it all at one time I know that I know that us ministers sometime can put a whole lot on your plate just all at one time but I'll give I'll give you space so amen do you love the Lord tonight amen amen isn't he so good to us to let us come back and to enter in like David would say I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord I'd say that's me that's me amen Joshua chapter 1 and verse three and the Bible said that every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses it's a powerful thing when somebody gives you a gift but it's even more powerful in the one that has given it to him it really matters who's giv it to you and God is saying that I have given it unto you as I said un Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even under the Great River of the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites under the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast so God has given Joshua a map he's given him a map of all of his inheritance said there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three and we understand that Ephesians and Joshua parallel one another you can run them side by side and you can see perfectly the alignment of how the inheritance is lined out here and notice what Paul says in verse three blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will also Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 16 amen Paul writes here to the letter to the Hebrews in verse 16 says for men verely swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife that's when you got two parties that are are at a complete variance against one one another and when they when they bring an oath together they bind themselves or adhere themselves to the terms of the contract or the agreement so so this an oath is a confirmation is to them it's the end of all Strife that is laying right there in the confirmation of that oath that is made wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the hirs of Promise the ubility of his counsel confirmed it by an oath there that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us may God bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord by the help of the Lord we'd like to continue our thought that we've been speaking to you the last few weekends on dividing dividing The Inheritance just to just kind of review just a little bit where we've been the last few weekends we remember that all the way back there in Genesis chapter 15 that God had spoke a word to Abram that his seed was going to go in there and they were going to inherit a land that God had promised this before Abraham even had a seed that was in his natural flesh and God God told him that that your seed is going to go in there and they're going to possess that land and there we found out that that God had a predestinated people that was placed there by the very inspiration of their birth that their mother that even in their birth their mother mother what by calling their name would place them right there in their position in the kingdom of God or in the in the very Land Of The Inheritance and that no one could take their inheritance there was nobody that could rightfully lay claim upon what they had that God had said that was rightfully theirs and that's why naboth knew that when when Ahab came to come and to take his Vineyard he came in there and he wanted it and even though Ahab outranked nabbo in position or in position in the land naboth rightfully knew that it was his because it had passed down by The Inheritance that it was rightfully his and there naboth could stand there and say it's not for you Ahab this is my inheritance so naboth could stand there even though a king could threaten him and and and Jezebel would come in and later on take his life but yet naboth had every right to stand there and say that this is my rightful inheritance and it doesn't matter who outranks you or what status is in this life it doesn't matter what they come or who says that you can't have it you know that by a seed of God that God has given you these things therefore you can perfectly align Yourself by the word of God and you can say that I have every right to stay here and I believe that's the same thing that the Holy Ghost is doing today is that he's hunting out honest hearts that are wanting to believe the message that's that's that's within them everything that's within them that's what the Holy Ghost is doing he's hunting out somebody that's that's willing to lay it all down there on the line and say I believe this with all of my heart and you go back and you begin to study out the message and you begin to look at Abraham's life that the prophet would say that God had been testing Abraham or the patriarch he had be he had been testing the patriarch because he gave him a promise and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said that he was going to do or what he promises so he wants to make sure that the person is worthy enough for the promise before he goes in there so God was testing the patriarch Abraham to see whether he really believed him or not that's the way brother Brandon would tell us about the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's a sign unto you that God has accepted your faith that God has accepted your faith so he gives you the very baptism or the very Zo life that God accept your faith and I think it's amazing thing tonight that you can identify that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God has accepted your faith now if God has accepted your faith for the baptism of the Holy Ghost how much more will he accept your faith for deliverance or for your breakthrough or for your healing or for or for the things that you need in your natural life so if God accepted your faith Hallelujah if God accepted your faith and he give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a seal upon your life that you are mine and I am yours it's the same way with Mary when God found a Virgin Mary that perfectly aligned herself with what Isaiah had said about her she was perfectly in line see God had found somebody that was worthy that was worthy to be able to accept what God had already said in there so you could see that there was going to be a virgin son after the fact but God had a virgin in a woman that was going to match the very promise that God already had laid out there and that's the same way with the body of Jesus Christ you are the perfect match piece of the promises of God so therefore God can say that I have found somebody that is worthy enough to carry my name somebody that's worthy enough to operate in my name Hallelujah so therefore holy trust you with his promises yeah now brother random comes in in 1962 and he preaches a very powerful message on confirmation and evidence and in there brother Brandon would tell us about a man or he would talk talk to us there and he said now when a man buys a car when a man buys a car he he's got to have a deed to that car and he said even though he doesn't have that car sitting out there in his garage he know that he's got he knows that he's got a car it's because he's got a DE to that car is that right because he's got that deed it's just like if you would go out and you'd buy yourself a piece of property you know whether you see that property or not you know that you've got that property because you have a title deed in your hand even though you've never seen the land you got an abstract title deed to that land and maybe maybe it's several hundred miles I know that I've got it I've not walked out upon it yet but I know that it's rightfully mine why do I know it it's because I have the abstract title deed right here in my hand so I can say I have this property now there might be somebody out there on that property and the only way that you can rightfully kick them off of that property is to take them back to the abstract and say this is rightfully mine and you can say that it personally belongs to you you see that's what the abstract is it tells us that that is our property that's what the Holy Ghost is to you it's to you that that's that's filled with the Holy Ghost that abstract in your life perfectly lines everything up in your life and say that's for you that's for me that's why you can stand there say I can have more of God it's because it's in the abstract you can stand there and say I can have Miracles because it's in the abstract I can have deliverances because it's in the abstract I don't believe that we ought to operate outside of our abstract but if it's right there laying in our inheritance then we ought to operate at full capacity is that right you see even though the children of Israel even though they were down there in Egypt and they were living in a land that wasn't their own they could still say that I am the Seed of Abraham that's why Joseph and Jacob would spend all of those years telling them don't you leave my bones down here I know who I am I'm not living in my rightful land but I know who I am I know where I'm living at and the land to the Israelites to think about it just to put it into play for you just for a moment that the land to the Israelites was completely invisible to them it was completely invisible to them while they were living down there in Egypt and even though they were down there in Egypt and they were living in a land that wasn't their own they could simply say that's my land out there right they never saw that Land one time while they was down there in Egypt but they had a promise out there that was saying that it was for them but they only had it by word right and there is a lot of times where Satan will beat you up is because you only have it in word form it's just like when they when the when Moses would prophesy in Deuteronomy 8 and5 that the Lord Our God would raise up a prophet like un to myself they had it in word form but when Jesus stood there when he stood there it was no longer what was in Prophecy but the reality was standing there now let me say it like this what promises don't really scare Satan but the reality is what scares Satan you can talk about a bride coming and it don't scare Satan but the reality of it the manifestation of it that's what scar Satan that's what scar Satan you see they only had it in word form they were looking at it by promise you see there's a lot of things that you can align your faith with and you could say that it's a promise of God you can sit there and you can line it up and say I believe that I believe that and you can confess it until you're bleue in the face but until it becomes a living reality to you it's doing you absolutely no maybe we would say no good in that aspect but when you possess it when you and the promise become one you see they could sit there and guess that John the Baptist was the Messiah they could look at it but when Jesus stood there and the Bible said in John 1:4 that the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us you could say that they looked back there in the land of Egypt and they said they had a Promised Land but when the word was made flesh at them when they looked over Jordan and they begin to see all of the promises that was laying out there they could no longer deny Satan could no longer deny that they were looking at that reality you see life only comes by the word of God is that right life only comes by the word of God but as long as it's in this book then it can be questioned it can still be questioned as long as it's laying right there in that book but when it's made manifest but when it's made manifest you see somebody could speak a word over top of of you and it could just simply be a word but when it becomes a reality when your life matches up with what the word says then it's no longer just a promise that's why Satan has a real problem with the bride of Jesus Christ it's because she's not just word only but she's [Applause] spirit is that right is that right so then you're no longer looking at just the promise but you're looking at the physical manifestation or the product of what was spoken back there in the beginning now Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:18 that while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen let's say that together the things that are not seen the things that are not seen are Eternal the things that you don't see let me say this to you out there in front of you is healing out there in front of you is manifestation out there tonight in front of you is a breakthrough that you can't comprehend but right now you don't see it but when it shows up who's going to argue out argue you out of it who could tell Mary that she wasn't pregnant it when she's felt the baby on the inside of her she received it as an eternal word and she took it in her temporal life and she brought forth the greatest [Applause] Masterpiece that's why you're a virgin bride you have received the spoken word The Original Seed been deposited and Satan does not know what to do with a people that put the their name behind the word I'm built for this thing I'm sorry I tried but Satan don't know what to do with somebody that fully understands who they are you see somebody can back you off back you off when you don't really understand who you are but when you know who you are when you understand who you are then Satan does not know what to do with somebody that looks at things even though they don't see it Satan does not know what to do with somebody that looks out there in the Eternal and they don't see it yet but they believe it with all that's within them and you remember when they're back there when they're back there and they're on the backside of that desert and they're walking around and they got to murmuring and complaining about themselves they got to murmuring well things was better back there I wish we'd go back there and eat the Gard of cloes and everything else we had back there do you understand that as bad as things were down there in Egypt that the known was better to the than the unknown to them that lack Faith so you see people that are constantly leaning on leaning on things that they see it's better for them because they're lacking Faith so they'll trust more in things that they see than the things that they cannot see but we we are a people that do not walk after the flesh though we war after it we don't walk after it that's why you you don't see it yet but it's right here in the room so let me put it to you like this you are fighting for a land that you do not see you are fighting for a promise that you do not see but as long as it's a promise Satan can War you over it but when you possess it when you make yourself War W with that that it's not just for William brandham that it's not just for Paul it's not just for the preachers That's what Satan has a problem with let me say this to you that the only thing that was stopping the children of Israel from going in there was the Jordan it was the only thing that was laying between them and their promises it was the only thing that was physically between the children of Israel and the Promised Land but all they had to do was cross over it but you know that God brought them to a showdown he brought them to a paradox that at the worst of times that God was going to take them over that Jordan River when it was in a time in the springtime when the waters had crested over the banks of the Jordan but God does things in ways that we don't simply understand sometimes so Satan would like to put optical illusions out there to make you feel like the that you can't get over there into your promises but God still got some joshuas and says we're more than able to go over there and take that is which was rightfully mine let me say this to you I know that you can see the Giants over there I know you can see Jericho's walls over there but there's more than just Giants over there there's more than just walls over there there's more than just rivers to cross there's more than just natural things to conquer but there's a resurrection in that land there's a promised seed in that land there's a future home in that land there's a restoration of the brid tree in that land there's modern events made clear in that land and somebody is going to ascend up and receive it and lay claim on their god-given rights Joshua wasn't looking at the walls he knew how to build them he was looking he was looking at somebody that was bigger than him I'm getting ahead of myself I'm about I'm about three parts ahead of myself just now but I want you to know that when Joshua is standing there in Joshua chapter 5 I want you to know when he catches a glimps of the Lord of hosts the Lord is not looking at Jericho the Lord is looking at Joshua let me say the mighty Angel does not have his eyes on leosia the mighty Angel has his eyes on on you let Russia do what they're going to do let Biden say what he's going to say let Trump make a fo of himself but God has his eyes on you little [Applause] bride well if he's got his eyes on me then I got to have my eyes on him oh come on now got the Bible tells us in Genesis that every seed is going to bring forth of its kind is that right it's going to bring forth of its kind so so the Bible when he would say let the Earth bring forth of its kind let the horse and every every animal bring forth of its kind so every seed has got to bring forth of its kind and when brother Brandon would preach the spoken word is the Original Seed he said he was The Germ word of God he said the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water and he goes down there and says his sheep his fold he said they're going to get that word and stay right with it now notice what he says he said the seed it'll produce Miracles the seed it'll produce the power of God it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred spirit or a kindred seed with that original seed so you cannot accept the word of God and then turn around and deny the word of God and prot tend to be a part of God so you've got to align yourself as the genan seed of God you've got to align Yourself by the word of God and if you are that Jean seed then you will perfectly align everything in there because you're Kindred to it is that right that's why William Brandon would call you brother seed he call you brother seed it's because he looked out there and he saw the same thing that was planted in the original brother Ram said that everything that Adam lost Jesus was so he looked out there and he saw the same thing in Jesus that he saw in the body of Jesus Christ oh my so let me put it to you like this that over in that inheritance there's blessings there over in that land there's Miracles there over in that land for the very first time there's going to be an Israelite black baby that will be born outside of the economy of Egypt and it's no longer going to live under the citizenship citizenship of Egypt but it's going to live under the citizenship as the kingdom of almighty God they're going to be a citizens of Visions they're going to be a citizens of reality they're going to be citizens of the promise citizens of the fellowship from above that's why you must be born again because this citizenship that you have in the natural it denies everything that you are in the spiritual you see that's why you must be born again because you see the new birth is about you recognizing that God is your father and God Alone is your father you see because under your first birth there's fornication laying there you said well I never did that but it's laying there there's uncleanliness laying there there's inordinate affection that's laying there there's evil concupisent that's laying there there's covet this that which is idolatry that is laying there you to well brother Andrew I'm not guilty of all those things it's laying in your first birth that's why Paul would tell us that you've got to mortify the Deeds of your flesh that's why you've got to attach yourself as the Jean seed of God to the Papa God because in your first birth it's death laying there but in your new birth in your new birth there's a power to live a Sanctified life the power of God is laying under your new birth blessings are laying under your new birth shoutings of Grace Grace is in your new birth Divine health is in your new birth all the RS of the father is laying there in your new birth but the only thing that is keeping you from that is Jordan but you don't need some bridge builder to get you over Jordan just stand back and watch what God's getting ready to do what is it brother Andrew just wait just wait and watch don't you try to figure out how God's going to get you across all these things just stand back take God at his word let the word step into the water first and watch the miraculous get ready to take place the only thing that is keeping you from a Rapture is death well Glory that's why God has selected of people in this generation to bypass death you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood set aside for service and you're the only people on the face of the Earth that's getting ready to experience come on somebody death can't harm you because you have got a hold of it because the god that died on the cross on Friday Rose up on Sunday morning and he made himself and showed himself a public testimony that you are not identified in death you can go listen to you can go listen to The Prophet on the first part or the on the front side of the seals you can hear him even say it in the breach that there was a Chasm and the chasm was too great but you get on the backside of the seals and brother brandom said that God did away with that Gap that God did away with that do you understand what the blood of Jesus Christ to you is to you as a Church of the Living God it did away with your first nature that's why there is an invisible Union with the bride and the bridegroom you don't see what's happening it's unseen but the seed the seed on the inside of you Jesus looked out there and he saw a matching piece I don't know what any of other way to put it like this but like this is that everything that the seven Church ages had hoped for is right here within the grasp of the Church of the Living God what Paul hoped for what what all of those great men throughout the ages had hoped for is right here on your fingertips come on let me tell you eternal security has been restored the serpent seed has been restored godhead rightfully has been restored the body change what men thought has been perfectly restored now notice brother mandam takes a I just want to maybe labor on this thought just for a minute brother Brandon preaches a message Paradox he said Joshua here is a book actually it's a book of redemption of the Old Testament he said Joshua he said we could have we would have to consider it to be that the book book of redemption because its Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that is out of and into he said it takes two parts to make Redemption out of and into he said so Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and whereas Joshua represented Grace that took them into the promised land he said another way was that the law and Grace were two different aspects of God's command he said the law brought them out but Moses under Moses and Joshua took them in now I want you to notice what brother Ram said he said it also represents something for our day now I love I love listening to what Paul had in his day and I enjoy reading about David and Daniel and all of them but I want to know what's for me when I read the Bible I don't try to see other brothers in there I try to find what's laying there so when the prophet said that it represents something for our day then it ought to click our Attention our is up and we ought to be listening to it he said therefore the law brought them out and Joshua took them in he said it also represent something for our day he said it represents as they were in their Journey coming from Egypt into a promised land so have we come out of a world of Egypt Chaos on on a road to the promised land notice what he does remember there's a place by me there's a position for you that the prophet ties it to John chapter 14 that in my father's house are many mansions he said if it wasn't so then I would have told you he said so it is it's coming out of and going into so that's why there's got to be another Ephesians there's got to be a coming out of to be able to go into you say well brother Andrew I don't come out of denominations well you got to come out of your message you got to come out of your message Theology of saying well I'm just okay because I'm under the message you got to come out of that I'm trying I'm not trying to be offensive but I'm trying to I'm trying to make some points here I don't want I'm talking to anybody here but You' got to people got to come out of that the that thought or that Theology of thinking well I'm under the message I believe you God s a prophet you've got to come out of that to be able to go into Heavenly places you got to come out of church tradition to be able to go into the Supernatural is that right you've got to come out of your past to be able to go into your future future because your future as a son and daughter of God is laying right here in your inheritance so go ahead go ahead and make a claim on your future go ahead and make a claim on it is that right I believe that you're in position for it I believe that you're in a season to lay claim on what's rightfully yours I believe that you're perfectly in season for it you know you if you'd see me come out here and start start carrying a surfboard you know where I'm going I ain't going to the hills I'm going to the beach so you'd know what season that I'm in if I started carrying a surfboard somewhere you'd also think I lost my mind but if I come out here and I started carrying skis and snowboards you'd say hey that dude's headed to the mountains he's going to go skiing so you see me in my season that I'm looking at so if I walk out here and I'm carrying the head of Goliath you know what season I'm in it's devil Killing Season let me say this to you it is open season on every devil in hell and it's time we fill our tickets it's time we feel every single one of those tags the demon of anxiety let's feel that tag the demon of depression let's feel that tag let's feel the tag that Satan constantly War in your family and causing distractions let's feel a [Applause] tag so you know what season I'm in when I walk out as a fully manifested Son of God wrapped up in my adoption robes fully baptized by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know that I'm living in Revelations 10 I'm going to preach some things to you tonight that I know that you believe but you cannot walk out here thinking that you're in the days of Luther and try to manifest as a son and daughter of God because it'll never work under Luther's message is that right so you know what season that we're in we're in the season of the coming of the Lord you see you see if you got a man you got a man out there that's swimming in water and he's drowning out there in water what do you do you got to get the man out of the water before you can get the water out of the man and that's why God knew that he had to get them out of Egypt before he could get Egypt out of them because they knew that as long as they were living in that condition they would have that kind of mentality that's why God would say to you in Philippians 2 and5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus you've got to change your language you no longer can think the thoughts I know it takes some people a little bit longer in time or they they get maybe a little bit more delay but either way it's a presence of the Lord that makes them change it changes them but you watch you got ladies and brothers that are sitting here that were one way and you can never identify them as that anymore why because God implanted a part of himself on the inside of them and it came to full quickening power I know you might get upset and you might see things in people's lives that maybe don't perfectly line up with the message but you give them a little bit of time under the message of the hour don't you try to clean them up you let the word do that come on somebody it ain't your job it ain't my job it's the word's job because if I clean them up and you clean them up they only go so far but before we get the river out of them we got to get them out the River come on somebody that's why you no longer talk leoty and talk it's because you have been brought out of leosia come on somebody I no longer talk the talk of a drug addict or a dopehead or somebody that was walking away from God I talk the language of a Son of God blessed be the name name of the Lord that's why Joshua could stand out there because he was fully operating under his message he knew he had every right to walk in there and kicking jebus Heights out now look the Bible said in Deuteronomy 2:24 rise up and take your journey and pass over the river of Arab behold I've given unto the thine hand sign and the Amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess bless it and contend with him in battle verse 31 and the Lord said unto me behold I have begun to give you Zion in the land before thee begin to possess it that thou mayest inherit this land so God gave you a gift God was physically giv them a gift but they had to go in there and fight for it they had to go in I've begun to give it you got to begin to possess it we said brother Andrew I just really ain't into that fighting mode you know that's really that's your job that's that's the preacher's job let somebody say something about your child say something about Bee's children that's Brenda Klein back here if y'all don't know it you say something about her children you watch she'll get to fighting you see some people they they usually well I I really you know we ought to have the spirit of Love brother Andrew I believe that but not that kind of love not the kind of love that we decide that it's okay to coexist with the devil because you find a lot of times that it's easier to it's easier to coexist with the devil than to contend with the devil it's easier to stand out there and deal with the little problems and say well I've dealt with that for so long I know how to overcome that instead of really getting rid of it it's easy it's easy to let that Devil stay right there on your property and let him do his own thing and you watch every single time that the that the tribes of Israel let and let the enemy stay on their land you watch they begin to corrupt themselves with idol worship I don't know where we get here but you've got to dispossess do you know that is a part of the word inherit that was spoke to Abraham before Moses ever showed up before Joshua ever showed up said you've got to inherit and when you break down the word inherit in the Hebrew language it means to dispossess to be an a of to go in there possess it it means you got to go in there and you got to kick that devil out now this ain't I ain't talking about going there taking taking a shotgun and blowing your TV up if it's caused you that much problem you don't need to get rid of the TV you need a new birth because you can have an iPhone you can have an iPad you can get rid of all them things you can get rid of all them things you can have your grid searched up and have it locked down but that little devil on the inside of you will find its way how to find that certain spot the only way to fix it is a new birth so to rightly divide the inheritance you got to kick the devil off of your property well come on somebody I watched all them guys back in the 80s when the message was brand new they blew out the shotgun took a shot guns and blue TVs everywhere they still went out and committed adultery lied and stealed and they're nowhere near the message what it do what good did it do well we had a quote for it brother Andrew but they didn't have the life behind the quote come on somebody come on somebody you can have all those things I never let them be a problem to you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost well now they're going to clip out and say at brother Andrew he's a TV preacher let me tell you co all made us TV preachers I was a televangelist overnight do you feel like reaching out there and touching something wow but once you move that's funny man wow help me Jesus you sure he didn't want to take tonight but once you move into this land once you move into it once you move into the Holy Ghost once you move into your rful inheritance you got to rule that land you got to rule that land it's not just to get ready for the Harvest not just to go out there and plow and make ready for the Harvest and plant seeds you got to stand out there like shamgar he plowed he planted but there come a time when he had to dispossess what the devil was taking from him and that's a part of dividing The Inheritance you got to fight for every one of your god-given privileges you've got benefits that are laying there that the devil's robbing from you that he stealing away from you but the only way to fully conquer the land is kick that devil [Applause] out I want you to noce this you simply being on that land makes the devil aggravated agitated enough that he simply wants to just come over there because you're on the land I mean how many fights it right here you didn't think one thing about getting in the spirit when you wasn't in the spirit but when the spirit of the Lord started moving on you and you begin to get under it and you begin to get under the anointing and you begin to amen the word of God all of a sudden that critical devil stands out there and say no no no no no no no no no no no don't go no further don't don't don't don't don't raise your hand don't don't lift your voice don't amen that you was living one way and that devil wasn't bothering you one bit but as soon as you moved into your were full inheritance that devil showed up and said hey don't do that that's my land and he started trying to creep in he tried to creep in that's what brother Brandon would talk about a creeper that that creeper would try to come in there and it would wrap itself around that weat and it would draw the very life out of that true genuine seed it can be the real thing but the creeper comes in there and he starts pulling the very life out of your experience as a a son and daughter of God you can be filled with the Holy Ghost but that devil could creep right in there but the Bible said in in numbers 33 and 53 that you shall to dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families so God gave Joshua a map he gave gave him a physical map of where they were to go in there and go in there and conquer the land ain't it a shame when you go all the way back you go to reading Genesis or Joshua 17 and 18 they've been this long with Joshua they've been this long under the commission you got two and a half tribes on the other side of Jordan they've already got their land and you get over in Genesis 18 and it says that seven tribes had not even began to possess their land how long have they been there and watch the supernatural they'd watch Joshua 2 they watch Joshua 5 they watch Joshua 6 they watch Joshua 10 but that shows you that carnal people will never be able to live in a supernatural realm but Supernatural people can be in a carnal spot and still go in there possess that land they will refuse to live in the place that Satan's trying to make them live at that's why you raise up and say I don't have to live here I don't have to live in this condition I don't have to live under this turmoil you don't have to live in fear you don't have to live in anxiety you don't have to live in a house that's always boiling up and brawling at one another and constantly bickering back and forth if you're a supernatural being I believe that you are you have every right to create an atmosphere said not here you can change where you're living at by the power of your confession he got a map to him and you got a map you got a map more greater than what Joshua had and brother Brandon would come to us and he preached the greatest battle ever fought he would tell us that there is where Satan battles us at is in the realm of our flesh in the realm of our spirit and he's Waring after your soul but you do not have carnal weapons you have a mighty weapon it's pulling down the strongholds of Satan you have every right to go in there and said this is mine brother man said well he in the testimony of a raising a dead boy he said well anything that said that Satan's put upon you in the way of sickness he said whatever it is every Born Again person has an abstract warrant has a warrant from God and the Holy Spirit is here to put any devil out no matter if he's a cancer if he's a cataract or whatever it is the holy spirit will put him out the holy spirit will put him out the holy spirit will put him out if you'll serve notice on him if you'll serve notice on him in the name of Jesus Christ cuz he has no legal rights I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases he was wounded for my transgressions and with his stripes we are healed but you've got to go over and take it let me say it like this it's time to dismiss the devil it's time to dismiss the devil you ever went into a school office you kids walked up in there and you was teacher said you did something and you really think you didn't do it and they and and the principal says you're dismissed and you're TR still trying to plead your case that's the way that the devil's trying to that's the way you got to do the devil even though he keeps blabbering his mouth dismiss that thing dismiss him say you're not welcome here you're out of the room get out of here get out of my mind get out of my spirit get out of my soul get out of my family dismiss that devil but don't you fail to go in there and possess your inheritance all these things I begun to give it to you you begin to possess it so you got a job to do when you go to read in John chap 11 when Lazarus is dead he's dead and they they look at him but when they're looking on Jesus they ain't wanting just lazarus's they ain't just wanting his inheritance they ain't just wanting him back just because of memory sake they just they there was something laying on the inside of them that they long for it was not just so that they could have the key to where he' left everything in his will and put it over in the safe box and all these things they were wanting the life of him is that right they were literally wanting the life of him to be honest to be honest what are you asking for when you ask for your prodal it's a dangerous thing sometimes when you put God when you hand them over to almighty God and you put them in the hands of God you better know what you're asking for because when God goes to doing business if God is after them he might kill them to save them from tribulation but what are you really after really what are we after are we just after the natural things if I want them back so that I could so that I could spend time than them that I could roll back the time but are you really wanting the Eternal thing when they ask for Lazarus life they were asking for the person of him what did they get back they got Lazarus back what are you asking for tonight what are you believing for it's got to be bigger than what you're thinking the Unseen things are worth fighting for the things that you don't see the things that you don't understand those things are worth fighting for you know that in the US right now there's over $49 billion dollar that is unclaimed I'd say you can put my name right there I know what I do with it I pay my ti on it there's $49 billion unclaimed in America right now most of it most of it is in bank accounts that people forgot that'd be something bad to forget and then it's in tax refunds that people didn't claim or that maybe didn't get to the right address and then there's the untold case of when somebody dies and that they didn't give it to the right person or the person they didn't find out exactly right and then the state takes it over so the state takes those assets and they put it in there $49 billion is laying there and most of those times in those cases it's because of the inheritance or The Heirs didn't even know that they had something coming that's why the prophet would say you're living below your god-given privileges now I don't know too many fully Holy Ghost filled people that are living below their god-given privileges but I do know that there are people that can go higher and there are there are things that are laying out there on the table if there's $49 billion that's laying in the natural what's laying out in spiritual realm I'd say that there's healings that are right here that you have every right to tap into i' say that's rightfully minded so basically The Inheritance is hanging in limbo and the only way the only way that this inheritance gets unlocked the only way it gets unlocked is the right identity it's the only way that it can be unlocked is by the right identity and if you brought them a picture of yourself as a baby they're not going to let you pass that's not going to be it's not going to fly because it's not matching what you are right now so when God snapped a picture of you as a Son of God he snapped a picture of you not as a baby he snapped you a picture of you as a fully identified Son of God and when you walk in there you've got to have the right inheritance to say this is mine Uncle Joe left this to me and it's rightfully mine that's the way you can go in there to God I have Ephesians 4:30 over top of my life and I pull down my rightful inheritance that's the only way you're going to get this but you notice what Satan does he likes to steal identity he likes to match up you notice that that we don't know the only way that we know him by is Legion he's the only way that we know that wasn't his real name but Satan had stolen his identity that when he comes before Jesus in Mark chapter 5 he couldn't even remember his own name he couldn't even remember who he rightfully was and brother Ram said he he was a right man in one spot he was living a Godly life in one spot he said he got to playing cards and running over here and started taking a little social drink had a nice wife and two children back home but Satan had so stolen his identity that he could not remember who he was but notice what Jesus did Jesus reversed the curse he reversed the curse so that he could remember who he was he went back to his home and immediately brother Thomas immediately what did he do he's sitting at the feet of Jesus when Satan had stripped him of his clothes had stripped him of his identity but immediately brother Randy he's sitting right there at the feet of Jesus what is it when the word comes by your way it reverses the curse that's upon your life you've got every right to go in there and dispossess what Satan has robbed from you and go in there say this is right mind and you may not feel like you're strong enough but there is somebody that is standing up for you that is standing up on your behalf you can look in Daniel chapter 12 and you can see one who is like God Michael standing up for the children of Israel in the time of trouble what does the Bible say it says that in that time he will bring Deliverance to the people now the Book of Daniel is to the Jews as the Book of Revelation is to us gentiles and it perfectly lines up with Revelations chap 10 then I saw another Mighty Angel Christ standing up what was he standing up in in a time of conflict but when do you see him in Revelations chapter 10 and 5 he's standing there and he's got his right hand pointed towards heaven what is he doing he's making an affidavit he's swearing by himself that the same one that was there in he Hebrews chapter 6 is the same one that is standing there in Revelations chap 10 and he swore by himself that the time of holding back the Mysteries would be no longer what did he said what does this voice say to him go and take the book go and take the book John eat the book become the book so if you can only realize what the church has in their possession it's the deed to eternal life it was in Luther's day it wasn't in Wesley's day but it was in this day it was in this hour that the Covenant Angel he swore by himself that the time of holding back all the Mysteries would be no longer that it would be in the days of the voice that this time would come that it would be the releas of all things and before you can ever go into a court of law and you can sign an affidavit and put your name on it you got to confirm it by an oath that everything that is stated here on this is perfectly the truth that's why God is standing there in Revelations chapter 10 and the lamb stood up in this day and confirmed it by an oath and said that the seals have been released to the body of Jesus Christ that it's no longer a thunder but we've received the voice that Jesus has signed our pardon and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and a according to the promise so if you have everything that's rightfully yours you have an abstract title D to it that if you go home tonight and somebody's sitting on your front porch and slipping sipping your sweet tea you got every right by the abstract title deed to call the law on them and say get out of here get out of your mind get out of my mind get out of my family get out of my body you've got an abstract title Deed by you Believing on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost accepts you it's the Assurance of the abstract when brother Ram when brother brandom is dealing with a child that's got a problem got a problem with it waste he tells him said look he prays for him he said now come back in three days tie tie tie a string around your waist and bring it back in 3 days and show me the progress when he came back it had the the condition had completely had completely gone away the very next person in that line was a hunchback boy brother brandham said and he said I simply looked at him and said now you go and do the same thing that I told him wrap a ring wrap a string around it and go back and come back and the boy said now notice this the boy said brother brandom we're on our last dollar being here I can't come back in three days I got to have this right now so brother bham turns brother bham turns to him and praise the prayer of faith over him and as brother Brenham has his hand on his back brother Brenham said he felt that hunch completely go in that boy had enough faith that I can't wait another day that's why Peter when he's standing out there he's out there in the boat and the storm is going on around him said Lord if that's you bid me to come that's why you got to be that desperate in a church service like this that you got to say I can't wait no longer I can't wait I can't put up with this no longer that boy didn't have another dollar to spend he didn't have another moment but he got so desperate brother Bon said what did he do he did exactly what Jude chapter 1 and3 tells us to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and brother brandom said that that faith that that little boy had was the faith it was the faith that they contended for so it's worth fighting for you know what happened directly after that little boy it caused such a stir what if you tonight would cause such a stir that there would be a whirl of faith in this building there'd be a world of faith in this building that somebody would receive something because you denied the devil I don't have another moment to put up with this I'm on my last string some of you are there some of you are there and that's why Satan has fought so hard to keep you keep you out of this because of this moment because this boy created such a whirl of faith that the very next person in line is a blind woman she couldn't even see to get in the line people had to line her and get her up there sister Gabrielle brother Brandon said that she had the faith that they had earnestly contended for brother brandom said when the prayer of faith was prayed over top of her he said he said we didn't have to get the testimony from her he said she typed out her own testimony and gave it to us don't let somebody else tell your story you watch what Satan has done over the past few weeks we have been living in the land of testimony and hell has been causing disruption after disruption after disruption trying to get you distracted right I know what I'm talking about I don't even know what I'm doing but I know exactly where I'm living at and Satan is trying to get you scared away don't you let somebody else tell your story this is your story you got every right to testify about it don't you let some devil try to steal away your joy I can't tell you everything but I ain't going I ain't going to tell you every detail but I want you to know when I stood here 3 four weeks ago and I said that God will do a test will do a miracle this week I can't tell you everything but trust me there was Miracle after Miracle after Miracle after miracle that took place well I'm going to need some proof of it look look there's a man standing in this room that's in this church that they had Bel dealt with things in their in their natural family there was some money that had been held back from them that was there rightfully theirs but when God spoke a word that there was going to be a miracle a miracle released something that they had been fighting for years and released a potential a blessing upon the an entire family don't tell me that when God speaks something that God isn't going to back it up you can argue with the promise but when it's a possession there's no devil sister Whitney that can rob it away from you let the distractions come but don't you get bombarded and get your mind off of what God's doing what is he trying to do what's Satan trying to do if I was a devil if I was a devil I'd try to keep you off this land I'd tried to keep you from being positive I tried to keep you under that depression I tried to keep that keep you thinking that you're not good enough to go in there that's that's what I'd do if I was devil I'd try to keep you at arm length try to put you a Derrick Henry stiff arm on you and keep your way out there say no you ain't coming in here that's exactly what I'd do if I was a devil but if I was God I would say to you brother Chris everything that you have need of I give it to thee in the name of Jesus Christ so I know what side I'm going to stand on I'm not fighting against a God that's trying to keep me away from all the blessings what is it it's a gift and it matters who's giving it dismiss the the devil you have every right to leave just now get out of here get out of this place get out of my mind get out of my family get out of my joy get out of my possessions get out of my business get out of here dismiss the devil that's what Abraham had to do he had to dismiss the fact that it couldn't be on the Hagar that it had to come forth through Sarah bye bye go on leave it's mine that's my joy if a devil would come in here and tell you not to praise the Lord you know it's a devil because God will never stop you from praising him if a devil come in here and told you to be silent and not to a amen the word You' know it was a devil I'm done I'm sick and tired of the devil staying on my property when I know it's mine go on go on if you don't want to see me living here if you don't want to see me living over here in my land don't come around brother bandam would sit there and said now devil said if you want to watch me Worship the Lord you just stick around here a little while he said I kept on praising the Lord and the devil got so mad that he had to leave so if the devil wants to sit around and say that he's going to watch me move in my inheritance and claim what's rightfully mine as the Rapture as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all of these beneficial beneficial blessings then he's going to have to stand back and watch me praise the Lord now some people get praised confused and they think it's just a sound but it's wrong do you know I'm way you forgive me when I get to it there in in part 44 I can't even get out of Joshua 1 but when they were walking around there 6 days they were still praising the Lord and it didn't even make a sound well what is praise brother Andrew it's perfectly lining yourself up with the word of God and turning around and thanking him for what he's about to do sometimes you just got to lift your hand sometimes you just got to whisper a prayer sometimes you just got to you just got got to believe it from your heart some people think it's just the moving of the spirit when the voices people begin to raise their voice then all of a sudden God releases himself when everybody raises his voice that's not it it's the spirit that's already came that's made you lift your voice don't you understand this is his love to you that he comes sweeping down through your life why could you not lift your voice why could you not praise him why could you not when he would choose to come down and line it out said look here look here on this day on this day on March the 5th I'm going to give you a son and he's going to be a son and he's going to be a protector and Satan is going to battle him and he's going to fight against him and try to destroy him he's going to try to corrupt his eyes he's going to try to corrupt his corrupt his his life but this is yours this is yours and it was a mama I said that's my son she identified that that's my Matthew and when Satan came in to steal her inheritance there was a mama that had a token I said that's mine how many are sitting here because of a mama that refused to give up how many are sitting here because of a daddy but you're all sitting here because God when he stretched out his arms when he stretched out his arm said oh no you can't keep me from getting to them you can't keep keep me you can't keep my hands down you can't stop me from doing this yes so he reached out and he allowed them to tack his hands and his arms and his feet to make sure that his hands would not go down in De feat but they would stay up in Victory God has lined out your life you're predestinated not to fall you're anointed by accepting what Eve turned down he stood up and lifted his hands towards heaven and swore by himself I'm not going to hold these things back no more that's why Satan is trying to distract you from what really is happening let's stand you're already standing oh Lord father we're your children Lord and we've moved into our promises oh God we recognize who we are as Sons and Daughters of God that what we have rightfully been placed in our hands is everything that we have need of to go in and possess our inheritance father there's there's lost loved ones out there that we're claiming there's beneficial blessings out there that are laying over top of our family that we are claiming there's there's things there father in our future that we don't even maybe don't even understand how it's going to come but Lord we're laying a caim name on that Lord we're predestinated for this a prophet said the move is on for the bride that there's coming a time and I see her out there on the road that there will be a Church of the Living God that'll raise and stand up to its feet and rise to its full position when the church knows who she is then the Rapture will go Lord I believe with everything that's within us that that bride is on Earth right now but Lord while we're here may we apply the token like Rahab may we get our loved one in may we get our father may we get our brother may we may we do everything that we can under the Fulfillment of this message and say that's rightfully mine now God I commit this service to you and everything that's been done and said For Your Glory may you begin to watch your children rise and possess their inheritance in Jesus name amen and amen
