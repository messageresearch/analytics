redeemer he lives oh let all creation testify or let [Music] aren't you thankful to know that he lives he lives he lives within our hearts hallelujah if you have your bibles this evening i'd like to look over in the book of john chapter 14 and verse 16. and then down to first peter chapter 1 and verse 3 john the book of john chapter 14 and verse 16. we read this scripture to you last weekend and and while we were while we were actually reading the scripture the lord dropped this sermon in my heart and begin to deal with me on this thought and has dealt with me every morning before i i have awoken on this thought and i'd like to speak to you on after the trial after the hurt after the trial after the hurt john chapter 14 and verse 16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him aren't you thankful that you know him you know that your redeemer lives you know the author of life but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and let's say that together shall be in you and i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you first peter chapter 1 and verse 3. so look at that that john chapter 14 we see that the disciples were in a moment of crisis they were in a moment of perplexity because they're seeing him but they're getting ready to not see him and here he is saying to them you see me but you won't see me but i will not leave you comfortless if i don't go away i can't come to you again but he says i will come to you and what an assurance that is in our heart to know that he will come to you in the trial he'll come to you in your pain he will come to you in the hurt he will come to you first peter chapter 1 and verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in this last time wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it betrayed with fire might be found unto praise honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory when you're going through a test your faith is on trial how many has a need that you like to take before the lord this evening heavenly father we come before you tonight and most humbly and graciously we bow our heads towards the dust of the earth from which we came up came out of lord you brought us and breathed the breath of life in our lungs lord jesus that we might be living oracles unto the the the god of heaven and father you have implanted and imprinted your seal of the holy spirit upon our lives and we can never be the same never act the same walk the same or even do and handle things the same as we used to because you came to us now father we pray that you would begin to speak to your children on every level that they are going through in every situation that they're facing father i pray that that you administer to every little child every mature adult here tonight we pray that the blessings of the lord be upon their household and that the healing virtues of jesus christ would would flow over their bodies lord those that are seeking in body we pray that you would just come and touch them just now lord we pray for those that are streaming by the way of the internet we pray that you administer them and abundantly way lord i know it's not the same as being in service but may you make yourself so real to them tonight that they could feel the presence of elohim himself in the room with them may you speak lip to ear to us hear our speaker and all in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you can be seated tonight in the presence of the lord we we we won't hold you long tonight but we just want to say so say a few things that's on our heart that god's dealt with us on but we we know as as human beings we we are apt to go through things and we're apt to have troubles we're apt to have trials and and you can you can relax just for a moment i'm going to take you on the other side of that trial and you don't have to get get all scared and think i'm going to call your name and say you're getting ready to go through a trial but i want to preach to you on after the trial and but as human beings we we go through things and so many times we we we go through things and wonder why we go through things and we know that that how god developed humanity and as he stood there in creation as we begin to read over in the book of genesis chapter 1 and we begin to look over the things of god we begin to watch as he begins to as he begins to evolve humanity and begin to work through humanity that god he began to reflect himself that in god were all of these attributes and it attributes to be a creator attributes to be a speaker attributes to be to be a healer attributes to be a god and that we realize that when god began to create he created and he began to reflect himself in in botany life in the tree life and then even in the animal life we can look at the animal life and we can see god in those things we can look at botany life and we can see god in those things and then we we look as as god when he came to his highest creation he came and he he developed a human being and he first made that man in the image of christ and then in the image of himself and then he made man out of the dust of the earth and he brought him from the 16 elements just like you were brought out of this world and have made of the same 16 elements of potash and calcium and all of those details of your life and and there's certain a certain amount of each and every one of you that that the ground that you're born in those things that you carry with you and there's there's certain dna markers even in your even in your lineage and that that link you to the things in your past that that you can look back to and you can see that this is where my family came from that this is what this one per this person said that that even that even now science is so developed that they can even tell you what kind of sickness that you're going to deal with even in your future because of dna markers that are there that are laying in your genealogy they can look at those things but when god is building man and developing man and creating man and we look at those things that that god was reflecting himself and it couldn't get no higher than the creation of man but when god created man we are taught by the prophet that that he created in man he put in him five a five inmates to the flesh that we could touch this natural world that we see the seed taste feel smell and hear and that's how we touch the outside world and and we we're so amazed when you watch a when you watch a child as they're so amazed when they they begin to touch things and taste things and see things and hear things for the very first times that their reactions that they make and then on the inside of that inner man there is that spirit realm of of conscience and reasoning and imaginations and and love and all of those things that are built up but on the inside of that is the real you that soul that's where you live that and that's where god wants to dwell at but we look at humanity and we see that humanity is so affected is so affected by the the five inlets of the flesh and so affected by the five inlets of of the spirit and as human beings we begin to build up emotions we begin to build up certain things in our spirit you watch people as they go on in time they'll they'll hear something or they'll do something they'll build up a complex about a certain thing or they'll build up reasonings in their spirit and it's an amazing thing to if you if you just watch human life and you begin to watch one another and you become friends with one another and you watch as people go through certain things and it's it's it's it's amazing thing the the things that humanity can go through and people that you know that may be sitting on the pulpit tonight go through everything imaginable and people that you know personally they live with scars they live with hurts they live with pain they they live with pains of the past they live with they live with such deep scars that are there that that that that that has been left there because of somebody did something to them and and it's created a stigma or created a complex on the inside of them that they carry with them and it's an amazing thing what a person can actually go through in life and even live through but we know that that that's life is not offered us a flower bit of ease but we know that he has told us that no matter what we go through no matter the trials we face no matter the the pain that we go through that his grace would be sufficient for us in that hour of need that that when we're weak then he is be made strong and we as humanity we go we fight sickness we fight afflictions we we fight diseases we fight turmoil but he said that many are the afflictions of the righteous but it's after those afflictions that the lord delivers out of all of them and it's amazing thing to watch when somebody goes through so many things and there's some things that are even worse than death that people have to live in a vegetable state for so many times and you maybe you've had to deal with that as in a family member that they've had to go through that state and paralysis and being a vegetable in their mind being a vegetable in their body and it leaves a deep scar on your humanity that you actually carry with you and you perceive things in ways and you look at things because of the scar or the hurt and the trial that somebody went through and you were a part of there are certain things that you go through as a as a church member that i carry with myself because you went through it or your pastor brother on he carries those things because what it did what a person does when they when a man of god if he before he can do anything for you he's got to intercede he's got to get into a place where he can feel for you he's got to put himself in a place that he can he can pray like it's like it's you like he's going through that when brother branham said now he said i can't do anything for that person unless i feel something for that person now notice in the sermon i know he said why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble and puts bits in his mouth and makes oh makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there's been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah pressed in i want you to key on those words after tonight but after noah pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in the storm and the little ark pitching up and down and in the water it was after the flood was over that they saw the rainbow for its first time the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise he said that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through tribulation you see maybe that's what he's doing to you tonight may he might have gave you cancer he might have given you this he might give you that he might give you a broke up home he may give you a tour apart he may give you worries he might give you headaches i don't know what he will do but there's one thing i do know that he still got his eye on you that no matter what you go through that he's still got his eye on you so i know if he's watching over the sparrow i know that he's watching over over me but you see it so many times of people that go through things and go through hurts that they that they carry those things and they're not able to move on from that hurt and you find a person and you find a person that's holding on to things and people that hold on to hurt and hold on to pain they often relive that pain every day over and over again in their mind they're constantly batting these things and sometimes a person gets stuck in that in that thought or in that pain or in that hurt and in that blame and they blame this one for that one or they blame that one for this one and they blame they blame their daddy for for just taking a drink and now that way my daddy got it and now i got to do that or i blame i blame my granddaddy he had cancer and now it's passed down through our genealogies and and they're constantly carrying a pain and they can't move on from that pain and it's constantly in their conversation and it's constantly in their mind and they're holding on to those things and they just can't let it go and what they do is they become a victim of circumstance that they that they enjoy actually being the victim of circumstance because when you go through circumstances you watch people that they're always going through something that they enjoy being that victim because what it what a victim does it allows them to be be in a basically on the winning side it's you against the rest of the world and they enjoy the emotions because they said well the reason why i'm going through this is because i went through that or the reason why i'm this way is because of that happened in my life and they enjoy being a part of being the victim of their circumstance or being a victim of the things of their past and it allows them to it allows them basically a great excuse for this is the way that i am that i am but i don't want i don't want you to get this in your mind tonight that i'm telling you these things that that you stay in that condition but but christianity does not allow you to conform to the world or conform to your excuses but christianity the power of christ wants to get rid of your excuses it wants to get rid of that attitude of being a victim he wants to get rid of that pain it wants to get rid of that hurt he wants to get rid of those things that you carry in your dna but you watch a person that's dealing with that with a mentality that i'm the victim they actually feel they they enjoy being that because it's them against the world but i don't want i don't want to say this to you and make you feel like i don't care but the rest of the world really don't care what you're going through the rest of the world really don't care what what your feelings are or i was hurt by this or by the hurt i want you to know the world's still revolving even though you're going through pain and i'm not trying to say i don't care about your pain and i'm not trying to say that i don't care about your feelings but your feet yes your feelings matter yes you're special to god yes you mean something to god but you can never allow your feelings to override your faith you can never allow your feelings to override everything else around you and you can never allow your feelings to get so bottled up that everybody else's feelings don't matter and you're the only one that actually has a case and you're the only one that your feelings are the only things that matter you see that's what a victim of circumstance will go through that that their faith is built there or their feelings are built upon circumstances could you imagine if mary strictly based her faith upon or was strictly living off of her feelings we would not have had a mary that brought forth jesus we might have had somebody else now jesus would have came through somebody else but before the foundation of the world god had seen mary that she was willing to go through the pain that this was an earthen vessel that he had predestinated before the foundation of the world that that bidding ground could handle the seed that would come through that wound are you with me tonight he has looked on you and he's seen you not because of your choice but strictly because of his election and predestination he chose you he looked at you and seen that you could handle the seed you could go through the pain you could go through the herd you could go through the child for the trial and you still come out on the other side still believing the promise and you wouldn't be affected by everything else around you mary was not affected because anybody else doubted her circumstance or vowing to value devalued her testimony she was not bothered by how she felt before she felt anything in her belly she began to testify she didn't testify from her feelings she was testify because an angel of god had stood there and said you shall bring for the child and she pondered these things in her heart she said be it unto me according to thy word and there has been an angel that has stood in this hour that has seen you that you were predestined to carry that seed of the gene word of god that everything else around you would not affect you laodicea wouldn't affect you trials wouldn't affect you sickness wouldn't affect you but you wouldn't go off your feelings but you would strictly go off the promises of god are you with me as a christian you better get used to hurt as a christian you better get used to trials because the devil's going to hurt you the devil's going to try to steal he's going to try to kill you he's going to try to rob you he's going to try to hurt your feelings he's going to try to work up your emotions he's going to try to kill your family he's going to try to steal your wealth he's going to try to take your health but i want you to know there's one thing that the devil can't hurt and that's that soul that's that faith are you with me he can't hurt that he can hurt your emotions he can hurt your daddy he can hurt your mama he can take your mama from his world but he cannot touch that gene seed of god are you with me [Applause] is or it's an awesome thing when a person when a person goes through something and they don't become defined by that something i have refused in my life that i will be defined by the circumstances that i am under and i will i have refused in my life to be to be defined by the circumstances of life of somebody else if i'm not going to do it for myself i'm definitely not going to put myself in a place of somebody else and go through that and let that person's life and that personal circumstance define me as a human being you see the things of your life if they define who you are you are going to be a miserable creature although throughout your life you have an old crabbit spirit and you'll walk around and say wowzy wowzy woo it happened to me it should have happened to you but rahab was not defined by her past she was defined by her faith she was not defined by her job description she was defined by the lineage that she would carry out hallelujah she was defined by the lay of grace that she was placed in before the foundation of the world it was not the men in her life that had defined her it was one man that had got a hold of her life and that man was jesus hallelujah hallelujah you can't undo your past but you can let it go are you with me let it go i want you to say those words and let it go let it go i would be a bad gardener if all i did was keep planting thorns and keep planting fissiles and keep planting weeds in my garden and i would be a very bad farmer if i tilled everybody else's ground except for mine it's a whole lot easier to look at everybody else's hurts and take care of their hurts but it's when it comes down to you and dealing with your hurts and dealing with your pain you're the man that's on the chopping block tonight and paul could tell you paul could tell you that that he could stand there and he said oh grave where is thy victory oh death where is thy sting it was nobody else but powell in the picture are you with me there's nobody else in the picture tonight but you and you are being told let it go let it go you can't do one thing about the hurt in your past but you can do something about your future are you with me there's a lot of things if we go back and check out your your past and we'd have a record of your past we could have all those things i do not want you to be defined by the things of your past you may have drunk alcohol you may have been in drugs you may have been in prostitution you may have went through all kinds of things that is not where i'm wanting you to look at are you with me i'm wanting you to look at a book that's been completely cleared are you with me i want you to look at a book that's been cleansed your record your past has been cleansed by the blood of the lamb oh you're with me you've got to learn to live a life of letting the people in your life that hurt you let them go abraham and lot when there was a division amongst them and the herdsmen it was time for abraham to let lot walk are you with me you see because before lord ever set his eyes on sodom his heart was already there and when somebody's heart ain't in it are you with me and when somebody's heart ain't in a marriage you better let them go when somebody's heart ain't in a business you better let them go are you with me when somebody's heart is somewhere else you better let them go because if their heart is not in it they can do all the talking they want to but it will never produce what they have said but i want you to know that abraham's destiny was not attached to lot yeah lord was with him yet lord lord was his nephew he was there he was his friend he was his brother's boy he helped him out but his destiny was not attached to lot walking away his destiny hallelujah laid in a land that was before him he was seeking a place a land whose builder and maker was god your predestination is not attached to the person that hurts you your predestination is not attached to the devil that attacked you your predestination is not attached to your sickness to your pain to your hurt are you with me your destiny is tied to a seed your identity is not identified with the agenda of satan your identity is not attached to the circumstances of life through the disappointments through the complexes of life your identity is attached to a seed and this message can i say that to you this message this message pushes past your past this message this message erases your past are you with me sure luther he had judged the just shall live by faith but in this end time message you heard a voice saying that you're justified it's as if you've never done it in the first place those people that hurt you those scars that you had those pains of your past that you had it's as if it never happened to you maybe it's there in your memory maybe it's there in your conscience but in god's mind it's not even there and if god don't remember it sister heather why and the thunder should i remember it [Applause] hallelujah he purged us by the blood of the lamb brother branham said in the great warrior david he said your name is indelibly written by the blood of jesus christ you're placed there in that position as a son of god ruth was known as a moabitess until hallelujah orpah didn't want to go let her walk church wall didn't want to go let him walk hallelujah there's a lot of people that's got out of line but there's some people that heard that voice say get back in line and you got back in line there's some people that got out of line and stayed out of line but there is an elect group of people that have got back in line with the word of god when every devil in hell has tried to hurt her tried to stop her tried to afflict her she got in line with the word you see people who are constantly dragging you down or hurting you are putting holes in your faith ruth couldn't go all the way as long as orpah was hanging on are you with me i'm gonna give you a real key right here and when you're going through some war and you're going through some pain whether you're whether you are being attacked by an enemy being attacked by a cancer being attacked by a disease you must keep your spirit clean you cannot allow yourself to be infected by the spirit of the devil you must keep your spirit clean because the bible said that in proverbs 18 and 14 that the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear you know when you're dealing with a hurt dog he's the most dangerous is when he's hurt and when you have been around somebody that has been wounded man they will growl at you you think they got the mange frothing at the mouth and everything else they mad at you i'm mad at the world mad at everything else because they are a wounded spirit you can't stand to be in the house with that type of person when they're so mad everything else around them you try to create an atmosphere and the best thing for you to create an atmosphere to do is get out the house because a wounded spirit who can bear it but you cannot allow your pain your hurt your trial to get in the boat with you are you with me you see that boat is built to float over the water and go down the ripples and go down the go down through the trials of life and the troubles of life but as soon as the water that it was built to float over gets in the water that boat begins to look like the water and when you begin to fall entrapped to sin and you allow sin in your life and you allow troubles in your life or you allow the afflictions or the pain that you went through to become more than who you are to override you you have now allowed sickness you've allowed pain you've allowed cancer you've allowed troubles to get into your life and destroy the purpose that you were built to do but the bible said that we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal and the things which are not seen are eternal and you cannot allow you cannot allow your hurt to degrade who you are you cannot allow your pain to degrade who you are are you with me they're sure you may have been abused in life sure you may have been attacked in life sure you may have been done wrong by men in your life or been done wrong by women in your life but don't allow that to degrade who you are because the bible said that there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit of god oh hallelujah hallelujah first john 3 9 said that whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of god job said in job 23-10 that he knoweth the way that i take that when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold i have it's always been one of my scriptures that even though one of my favorites that even though that maybe i don't know the way that i'm going he knows the way that i'm going he knows the way that i'm walking he knows the way i'm talking and he knows the way that i take and when i am brought forth i shall be brought forth as gold mother baron was dealing with a patient one time and he said now now here's what happens she gets real nervous spells but it's a it's a mental a psychic condition and you feel like you're going to lose your mind isn't that right the way you've been feeling now what is that now it's not normal if there's a doctor sitting close you know it's not normal for a human being to to act like now what is it it's not exactly a disease of the body but how i feel like around her is a gloomy feeling he said did you ever get into a dark place in an alley or something and be scared all at once or walking in the streets or anywhere how many ever had that experience of being scared there's something there to scare you is that right there's something there to make you fret there's something that is haunting this lady that makes her feel that way but now it's lifted it's gone now the lady can go home and be normal and you watch when you watch when you see somebody that that has dealt with a certain pain in their past and if you've ever identified or what the source of that pain is and you watch when somebody else is going through the same thing you watch those two spirits as they begin to intermingle and they begin to try to draw strength from one another i see it often quite often in suicide spirits that you'll watch somebody that's dealt with depression or dealt with suicide that they will attach himself maybe they don't even know anybody else in the room but you can watch those two people because of the spirit that's in their life and the hurt that's in their life it immediately identifies with somebody else that's dealt with the same exact thing it is not you it is a gloomy spirit that's hanging over top of you and you see what that thing is trying to do it's trying to control you and make you feel like you are a part of that but that gloomy spirit does not predestinate who you are and it does not change who you are oh hallelujah you see saul the king saw all his life he was saved by the random set but it came down to the end of life he came down to the end of his life and the evil spirit came and it attached itself because of the sin in his life he was still saved he said but god allows things to happen in your life to mold your character to make you what you are to be you see abraham had waited for 25 years because god had told him that you're going to bring forth a son he weighed it for 25 years he went through everything he prayed for 25 years he waited for 25 years he longed for 25 years and you can either get discouraged every 28 days at a cycle or you can be encouraged in your heart are you with me because the bible said that abraham did not get weak he grew stronger are you with me that even though the promise seemed like it was never coming he was still holding on you can either get hurt you can either get hurt you can have pain you can be you can either become bitter by your trial or you can become better by your trial are you with me you can ever let you can either let your sickness define you i have made up my mind when cancer come knocking on the spencer's door i was not going to allow pity i was not going to allow cancer to degrade the spencer family i was not going to allow it to attach itself to my spirit and condemn my spirit and try to take me off onto some road of giving up or trying to give in to to the doubts of cancer sure cancer's a bad devil sure cancer's like a crab sure it's got a spirit that wants to hurt you but i realized something a long time ago in life that there is a god that is greater than cancer that's greater than pain that's greater than sickness and i would not allow that cancer spirit to walk into my spirit and take control of my life but abraham received the promise and sarah brought forth isaac but the bible said in genesis chapter 22 that after these things that god did test abraham and said get ye up on the mountain of moriah go all this journey and take your son your only son there was not another son identified in the picture as far as god was concerned only isaac was in the picture he said you take your son your only son and you take him up there and you offer him up as a sacrifice unto me now god did not test abraham to trip him up or to make him fall he strictly tested abraham to see the obedience that abraham had in his life whether he would bow to the pressures or bow to himself or bow to his feelings who but obedience is greater than sacrifice and sometimes god's asking for you to obey him and sometimes i want you to know as you're a real son and daughter of god now you will obey him as a son and daughter of god but sometimes it may take a little bit longer for the whole journey to play out for you but abraham abraham knew this that if god was good enough to give me a son even though i was dead that even though he changed my body even though i watched him change my sweetheart's body back to a young lady again surely if he can do that he can raise him from the dead again i don't know how he would do it but i know this that if he's putting me through the test that on the other side of the test there's going to come a greater testimony oh hallelujah abraham is not known in the bible as a man that let down on god he was known as a man of faith a man that believed god a man that obeyed god hallelujah hallelujah but after the test the angel lord came to him again after he had provided a ram for him in the thicket and he spoke these words after the trial that in blessing i bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sand which is upon the seashore thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seat shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice nobody wants to go through the process nobody wants to go through the trial nobody wants to get through the go through the hurt but before you can get to the blessing you've got to go through the trial nobody wants to die after themself but before you can get the holy ghost you gotta die come on somebody before you get the holy ghost you gotta repent that's your job there's a lot of people that want this old-fashioned pentecostal experience but they don't want to go through the trial before you can get the blessing baby you gotta go through the test there's a lot of people that want to stand like brother on in this day but they don't want to go through the child through the trials like brother ron's went through i heard people say and i stood back and think man they don't know what they're talking about hey hey you're talking from a spot that you are crazy oh i wish i had a testimony like you brother ron no you don't no you don't i want what god wants me to have i know i know what causes patience i know i know that when you go through the trial that that causes patience and if you realize what you were asking for when you were asking for a testimony the test calls the moani the moani in your life and you can either complain and be a moany gripey or you can have a testimony that'll shake the devil right back down to hell are you with me you can either be encouraged or you can be discouraged psalm 66 says verse 10 for the how oh god has proved us thou hast tried us as silver as trod that was brought us into the net thou laid his affliction upon our loins thou has caused men to ride over our heads we went through the fire and through water but thou brought us out into a wealthy place what this scripture is going to say to you as the musicians come you're going to go through some stuff you're going to go through some stuff but afterwards are you with me you're going to go through some message you're going to go through some trials but afterwards i'm bringing you to a place of wealth a place of health a place of joy hallelujah hallelujah the three hebrew children they went through the trial of their life brother burnham said and i know he said that they went through that trial and after the trial they produced the son of god that waved the heat away from them daniel was a man that had purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself for the king's drink and king's mate but it was not till after the trial that he seen the angel abraham had went through some stuff he went through some things of life he went through some turmoil and lot but it was after the trial that he met elohim hallelujah it was after jesus's death that we got the resurrection are you with me it was after cancer you get complete victory it was after laodicea you get a rapture it was after it was after the rapture of the wedding supper comes it's after the wedding supper we go to a millennium and it's after the honeymoon that we go to a city that he has prepared for us it was after the trial that the victory comes let's stand i will not be defined by my trial but after my trial maybe saying that maybe we try to sing that song brother out in the same couple weeks ago our god is greater as they as they play that as they're begun to play yet tonight brother josh jones had sent me a sent me a note maybe a year ago now [Music] and there was a lady that was there was a lady who was dying if i remember the story correct she was dying and she'd ask her pastor to come in she was a young lady she asked her pastor to come in and just kind of pray over her and just kind of lay out the the things of her life uh the things that she wanted in her funeral things she wanted done songs she wanted saying because she knew she was at the end of the road she said but what i want you to do is i want you to make sure that when i'm in the casket i want you to put a fork in my hand and this kind of stumbled the pastor a little bit so what in the world why would you want to fork my hand she said well as i was growing up as a little child i said i was always told we'd be sitting down at my grandma's or wherever we would go people would lean over and say save your fork save you for it so because i they tell me that and it taught me that when i would go when i go through this that they would clear the dishes off the table and they'd take everything away that there was coming a deep dish fried apple pie or there was coming a velvety chocolate cake that was coming you see it was after the course that that came the best came at the end and immediately as soon as the as the pastor began to hear this lady she said he said i know that this young woman even in a dying state realizes more about heaven than even some of us old folks do sometimes she wanted people to come when she was there in her casket and see her holding that fort so the day of her funeral came and they were everybody was passing by and they stomached what's up with the fork what's up with the ford so as the pastor took her funeral he said she told me these things and he said save your fork the best is yet to come [Music] you see we ask for comfort we ask for peace but brother branham says he gives us the best thing he could give us is trials and tribulations he said our comfort comes on the other side of the river save your fork you think what we're enjoying here in this realm save you for it i always knew same as this young lady i always knew i look forward more to the dessert i look more forward to the ice cream afterwards brother vernon you're not alone on that ice cream deal i know the best is yet to come after that steak i turned down a steak for that ice cream cause i know the best is yet to come and so i know that all the things that i go through that after i go through this there's a place that's been prepared for me that no matter if i go by the way of the grave there has been a place prepared for me brother branham said in who is this melchizedek he said you had to bypass your theophany to come to this earthly tabernacle to be tempted by sin but if this earthly house be dissolved we have a body that is prepared for us that is not made with hands whoa i'm going to a place where there is no more sin no more hurt no more pain you're gonna go through some stuff down here but after you go through the hurt after you go through the pain heaven awaits you little bride [Music] i've heard a voice i said whatever you do don't miss it if

over the promised land and he can't go in prophet said i seen him he said i was sitting there watching him tears flowing down his cheeks taking his sleeves and wiping them he said but god didn't let him down he said there appeared to rock and he stood up and he took a step out on that rock he said and god didn't let him down he said because 800 years later he was seen standing there with elijah and jesus and he didn't let moses down and the bible tells us in the book of jude that the devil was disputing over moses's body and the devil is disputing where this son of man is at and he's right
