wonderful to see each and every one of you in the presence of the lord this evening i sure enjoy preaching to have a crowd better than the no crowd and uh we certainly want to express to you how much we love you and have been praying for each and every one of you during this time and i know that this is a very difficult time we've had three funerals here or we'll have three funerals here in the last couple weeks and it's a time in which you can't necessarily express or as a church family we can't go to the funerals as we as we would and pack it out and show our love and our appreciation but i believe that every family that has gone through this understands and and know that you love them and i know that the kelly family knows that and have certainly appreciated all the prayers that's went up and so just in a way of mentioning that that the funeral tomorrow will have limited seating and uh there at the funeral home they've they will be streaming that service be live streamed on the uh johnson's funeral home website there in grotto so you can write those things down and just be remembering us as we go to that have service here tomorrow morning and then we'll go right on into the funeral tomorrow evening so we just want to continue to lift up brother larry sister linda and uh in the upcoming days not just tomorrow but on the upcoming weeks when when things get difficult maybe the cards ain't coming in or the flowers ain't coming in just continue to pray for them and lift them up amen i i can't tell you how much i appreciate every one of you being here in the house of the lord and we thank you for coming and i pray that god will bless you richly this evening amen how many has a need that you like to take before the lord this evening amen amen we just don't want to look around and see each other hands but also we want to be remembering also our our other side of our church family that'll be coming here tomorrow morning we want to we want to be remembering them and we're a church body and we need each other like never before especially in these perplexing times and and a very distressing time but yet we we have a hope in our lord amen let's just lift our hands into the lord tonight father we come to you tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ lord there's none like you lord when we begin to worship lord the god of ages and begin to feel the anointing of the lord as you begin to just slip in the room and begin to touch lives lord we we know that when we're lifting our hands father that we're not lifting our hands to a man we're not lifting our our thoughts before others that they might see it but we're lifting it up to a god that cares the god that sees the god that understands a god that is that is never changing but is always the same and is more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think according to the power that works in us now father you see lord every person that is sitting here under the sound of our voice lord our half of our congregation can't be here tonight lord due to the circumstances of life but lord i pray that you would be god to them right where they are where they stream at where they're listening to this service i pray that you would pour out a supernatural blessing upon them lord you see the hands and you see the heart father we pray that you would come down in such a way and make yourself god to them to the kelly family we pray god that you would just show forth your compassion and let them know that you are the comforter of comforters now fathers we get ready to delve into the word of god we pray that you would anoint us like never before i've been studying on these things for quite some time lord and you finally allowed us to be able to to look at these things but father i know that that even the prophet would say that when he would get before the people that that he would think it would go a certain way and then it would go completely different because of the people's form now father you know what they are pulling for and what they need in their life lord that's something i do not but i do know this that the word of god is quick it's alive it's a sharp twitched sword and i pray that you would discern the very hearts lord even our pastor sitting here had a rough week this week dealing with the the the treatments of life and and the treatments of chemo and then dealing with his own blood sugar father i know tonight without a shadow of a doubt that you're a healer of that and i pray that you would be ever mindful of the need of the body lord our pastor lord we need him we need his strength we need his encouragement lord that he gives an endlessly lord and his so selfless father and he stands before us and he gives out even when he don't feel good father even when he's sick father he stands behind this pulpit and i just pray that you be mindful of him tonight lord i pray that you just come down in a special way tonight and speak to us from your living word we pray these things and the bride of jesus christ says amen amen god bless you if you have your bibles we'll turn over in the book of first samuel chapter 17 and verse 56 i'd like to uh just welcome brother nate and sister caitlin green here with us i know that uh this is little charlie's first time being in the house of the lord here full gospel lighthouse and i know he won't remember this but i will and so so which we're just happy to have our extended family with us and we certainly love them and and uh covet has sure messed up some some good things and uh so at some point of life we will uh we'll have brother joe and sister rexan here maybe and have a baby dedication we'll work out the details but we're just happy to have brother charlie green here and if you haven't seen a miracle take a look at him tonight and uh he's he's a real miracle first samuel chapter 17 and verse 56 and i'd like to speak to you tonight on on attached to the king attached to the king first samuel chapter 17 and verse 56 and we'll go right into first samuel chapter 18. that's right after chapter 17. and the king said inquire thou whose son the stripping is and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite and i i like this i like this portion of reading because here we see as as as david is identifying himself here he's also got the head of his enemy right in his hand chapter 18 and it came to pass that that when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul and saul took him that day and would let him go no more to his father's house then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul notice the the connection and the attachment that these two have made and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle and david went out with us whoever saw sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul's servants may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord at last scripture reading in verse 5 is a very very astounding scripture as you look at it that david as saul set david over over the men of war and david was accepted in the sight of all the people and in the sight of all of saul's servants now if you you you know that if you being in the lineup of servants that that servant sometime they they work their way up as they go but david is immediately moved to a place of position in which he has placed over the men of war that that he being he being a leader in that day just from this one this one deal that that has just went down when he's holding the head of goliath in his hand and so we see that we we look at that attachment that jonathan and david have there and so we want to focus just on that for a moment but look with me at matthew chapter 27 and verse 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet that they they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews and here they they paid to him what they thought was a dishonor but this was the greatest compliment that they could set over jesus's head as they set this accusation above him here was our king here was here was the one that was the the giver of life and the the author of life and who the whole christian faith was in and here is set up that this is the king of the jews now in spiritual amnesia as the brothers have this quote he said now now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to figure forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice he is in me and i and in him notice then every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i've got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy i was with him when he called abraham at the age of 75 years old and his wife being 65 and told him that they were going to have a baby i was with him when he took his stand upon thus saith the lord and i'm going to have the baby i stood with him every other christian stood with him i was with him when when he when his temptations come i was with him when he was up on the mountain to offer up isaac i was with him when the ram appeared i was with joseph when he rejected when he was rejected of his brothers because of he was a spiritual and the rest of them was carnal i was with him when he know the reproach that he had to stand by his own brothers what he was i am what i am he was for we are all one in christ jesus i was with joseph in the cave and the grave i was with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh you had to be identified with him i was with jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel i wrestled myself i know what he went through with so i wrestled with jacob the same time he did for i am his brother i was with moses when he went down into egypt i was with moses at that burning bush if you're a christian you're identified with him with the bible characters don't forget it i was with moses when all the people turned against him i was with moses when they crossed the red sea when he raised his hand and walked forward and the red sea opened i was identified in christ right then i was with moses at that hour what every christian has been what every believer has been every believer now is identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified and don't forget that when you do you've got spiritual amnesia and you've forgotten who you are now identified with him with moses when he crossed the red sea i was with elijah in the days of ahab when they had to make a choice who they would serve god or balaam when he was with him on mount carmel when he had to make this choice for for we are identified in the body of the same god that he was identified in so if we're identified in that body then we must remember that we were with we were there with him that's right now i was with david when he was rejected by his own brethren i was with david and you were too if you're a christian you have to be identified in his rejection i was with the hebrew children in a fiery furnace when the fire couldn't burn them because the presence of the fourth man i was with daniel in the lines then i was identified there when elijah uh when the angel of the lord identified him in there and i was most surely with him at calvary i must be identified with him at calvary i must be there to a place that where not also was i identified with him at calvary i died with him at calvary every christian must die with him at calvary and if you don't die with him at calvary you can't be none of his i was there when he died i died with him and then i was with him when he raised up from the dead i came upon easter morning with him in the resurrection that whatever he did i was right there with him every believer was the same and now i am seated with him heavenly places in christ jesus with all powers of hell conquered through him every christian believer was seated the same way because you have to be identified are you identified with him it shows that there is an attachment when you can identify yourself with the king of kings and the lord of lords and when you go to thinking about all the connections of life that that have that have happened to every individual that is sitting here tonight you know every one of us have an attachment with somebody else that is sitting here and if it was not for the ministry in this last day we wouldn't be sitting here i would have never met my wife if it wasn't for the ministry of malachi 4. i would have never met brother nate green if it wasn't for the ministry of malachi 4. and you go to thinking about the attachments that are done and the connections that are made just because of this message and and you begin to identify yourself and begin to get in that channel of thinking that that you would not be a part of the the powerful ministry if it was not for the ministry of this last day when you go to thinking about the ministry of brother nathanael's grandfather brother henry and brother joe and you think about the connection that we as a church body has had with the green family it's all done because of an attachment with a message when you go to thinking about brother brady down there in jamaica and you begin to think about all the testimonies that we've shared throughout time it's all because of an attachment with a message in this day and thinking about great men like brother bisco and brother jackson and brother lawson and brother pruitt brother reagan and these great men you see we are all drawn according to this last day's message and we are attached by that message of the hour but you see we didn't attach ourselves to that we didn't we didn't make ourselves come to love one another or make us some group that we just identify ourself with but there is a gene seed of god that has attached us to this ministry in this day and if it was not for that gene seed of god you remember when brother branham was going through the trial of his life and and he was going there and sharon rose was dying and his wife had just died he said if it had not been for that new birth he said i would not know you and i would not be standing here but because the new birth held him in that hour when satan said when satan said god don't love you and and god surely can't be with you when he's taken all of these things away from him but you see that new birth held him in the moment of his trial you see that was the attachment that held him was that new birth and it is the only way that you will stand throughout laodicea is through the attachment to that new birth you see i am identified with the spencer family because of a birth i didn't join the spencer family i didn't join or i didn't shake their hands and say you know what brother ron i want to be your son i didn't shake his hand and get that but because of a betting ground and through the pressing out of a seed there was an attachment that every one of you have with your mother and your father you see it's it's it's a natural attachment that we have in life but when you go to looking at at that expression of that seed that comes forth you begin to look at the power of that seed now maybe you're just quiet because you're astounded by what i've just said okay but when you go to thinking about that seed and you begin to think about the connections of life and you think about david and jonathan and the friendship that they had built up and the bond that they had the bible says that their souls were knit together there was an attachment there and you look at jonathan's character as it's shown in the generous love of king david and the admiration that that jonathan had just because of this one deed i'd say that there's a lot of people that we've come in contact in life with that we have become attached by one deed by one word you can look at some of your friends and you can look at maybe a testimony that that while you're here and i think about sister mary vance that is here just because of one event just because a man of god walked into a long john silvers one time that whole family the vance family is setting here because of one deed that was done and we think sometimes that we're just going through the motions of life and you realize that god's got a greater purpose in all things that god's attaching his body with the headship in this hour and you think about that that because of the slaying of a giant brought about this connection between between jonathan and david what's going to happen when you slay your giant what a tonight what attachment what connection is going to happen when you look at the thing that has cursed all of the children at full gospel lighthouse and you go out there and say i am not going to allow you to allow you to condemn our army i'm not going to allow you to stand against our army what will the attachment and the connections of life be when you stand up to the giants in your life and you realize that the anointing that you have that he is your shield and he is your buckler that he has given you a weapon to take down your giants and watch the connections that are made in your life we're not looking there's there's some people that won't get anything i say but one word tonight and if all you get is one eternal word you have came and attached yourself to the word of god not to a man but to a word that will never fail when heaven and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away when there is no more cancer when there is no more death when there is no more covet you have attached yourself to a word of god that satan cannot defeat that satan cannot destroy because you attached yourself but look when you look at jonathan here jonathan was a king's son he was the son of a king but jonathan is attaching himself to the anointed king even when king saul swore that he would kill david when he throws the javelin at him when he when he when he does everything within his power and milka hides david in the bed and puts goat hair over the pillow to make them think that david's laying in the bed so that they can slay him but jonathan still attaches himself to the anointed king even though his own flesh and blood hate this man but you see there was something that was laying there that jonathan was attaching himself to you know there's some people i don't know if you know this or not but there's some people that think you're crazy because you have attached yourself to a ministry you they they think well them people down there full gospel lighthouse they think there's something well why shouldn't we i heard a voice from another world that has told me that this world is not my home and i'm just a passing through i'm not staying here for the tribulation i ought to know exactly where i'm going because a word showed me so you see before david ever stepped into the role when he looked like a shepherd yea he was a shepherd when he dressed like a shepherd because he was a shepherd though he though he was identified as a shepherd dressed like a shepherd smelt like a shepherd he was still god's anointed king before the world began when everybody else was standing in front of david and they looked more like a king david was still king when the church world looked a whole lot better when esau looked a whole lot better there was a promise that was already spoken jacob i have loved and esau i have hated and when samuel went to anoint the next king of israel that he goes before him and the spirit of the lord tells him not to look upon the countenance of the man you see seven other brothers stand in front of samuel but there was one thing that couldn't happen that oil that was in that jar could not be poured out there was a lot of people that look more like the real thing there was some more people that maybe had to dress right maybe they had everything just in order and it looked like you know what they are the real deal i want to tell you do not look at what you see because i can tell you there are some books that will they will mess you up by just looking at the outside of it i don't know about you i've bought some books because i thought they were picture books but when i got there they wasn't one picture in there and there's a lot of people that dress themself up like a picture book but when you open it it ain't nothing in there to look at hallelujah but seven other brothers stand before him stand before the anointed prophet and samuel noticed samuel would have been willing to pour the oil out if it wasn't for a voice there's a lot of times that that people get fooled by the way that you look or by the way that other people dress or at themself but god knew that the oil couldn't be poured out upon one person and samuel said is there not anybody else here he said i got a son but he's back there on the backside of a mountain hurting my sheep what was he doing he was doing everything that god had ordained him to be him hurting those sheep was teaching him how to sing songs on the backside of a desert him sitting back there as a shepherd watching those sheep as they would grow as they would graze in those green pastures it would bring out things of the eternal that we will still read even today you see god was molding david into the man that he had destined him to be samuel said i will not pour the oil i will not set down until the black until the lad comes here comes this ruddy looking fella didn't look like nobody but yet in whose mind would have thought that this would be the next king of israel but god so let me let me just attach you with this salt just for a moment who would have thought that you would have been the bride of jesus christ but god when the church world when your friends denied you from being a real believer but god thought something of you when satan thought there's no way that they could ever be what god has qualified or selected to be in this day but god but god when you was trumped down and apart but god it's not the life that you once lived but the life that i now live there you're not attached to the old man you're attached to the new man [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah maybe jonathan couldn't understand why he was attaching himself to this this man that his own daddy wanted to kill maybe he couldn't understand why he was what's drawn to this man but yet he he felt this attachment he felt this pull to to to knit himself in his own soul that they knit themselves together because of an eternal quality that was laying there you know there's some times in life that you don't even you don't even realize you know you ever been around somebody that you don't know why you're attracted to them or you don't know why you're attaching yourself to them but you just know that by yourself attaching let me let me make it personal by myself attaching myself to brother shannon or attaching myself to brother danny or any of these other brothers and sisters when i attach myself to them i know it's going to be a benefit for me let me give it to some of you business-minded people that that there's some re there's sometimes that you you'll just look at you'll look in an account and you'll say i'm not going to attach myself to that because they're either going to drag me down or put me in a hole but then there's sometimes that you'll look at an account or you'll look at a business and say now i'm going to attach myself to this because they're going to be a benefit to me in business you're hoping that they make your wallet just a little bit thicker and when when a business is not when it's not gaining you anything it's time to release that thing now i've got your attention i have talked to your heartbeat but when you go to attaching yourself to people that are nobodies to people that'll never be good enough you're attaching yourself to somebody that'll never make it but if you go to attaching yourself to somebody like jonathan was attaching himself to he was not attaching himself to a mistake he was not attaching himself to a wannabe he was not attaching himself to a phony he was attaching himself because he's seen the benefit of who david was hallelujah when you go to reading in first samuel 19 and 20 and you look at the hatred and the jealousy that was in saul's heart towards david it would make you wonder if brother adam attached himself to me and brother out and hated me it would make you wonder why why would flesh and blood be so perplexing and be so opposite in the matter and here jonathan he'd watch saul when he was anointed king he watched him as he was there in his glory as a king but then he watched that anointing leave saul and saul become tormented and evil spirits come and evil spirits would would drive him insane and they had to have a little bitty boy that nobody would have picked that this would be the man that would that would calm the troubled waters that were around saul and drive away those evil spirits but jonathan watched as the anointing left his father and the anointing was upon this man david young people you must watch who you attach yourself to if you're attaching yourself to phonies if you're attaching yourself to carnal impersonators you better watch who you're attaching yourself to because it's going to lead you down some wrong wrong long wrong long roads trust me you see if you're attaching yourself to people that are always causing you trouble if you're attaching yourself to people that are always that is always bringing your spirit down if you're attaching yourself to somebody that that you can't feed on their spirit or you can't you can't get anything supernatural from their spirit you need to detach yourself from that person if they're not bringing you closer to christ they are not your friends they are not being a benefit to you but if you can attach yourself to somebody and and attach yourself to an anointing that is upon a body it'll lead you into green pastures it'll lead you to a relationship that will grow in christian love if you're attaching yourself to a bunch of chickens instead of eagles you need to watch your anointing are you with me because if you're attaching yourself to those kind of people that are bringing you down drawing the life out of you i know y'all don't know anybody like that they just man they sap your energy they take away your atmosphere you sing all day and all of a sudden you get around that person one good time lord have mercy you in a bad mood for two weeks you need to detach yourself from that person are you with me if they are driving your spirit to the ground you need to watch you have attached yourself maybe with a false anointed one instead of the true anointed one i can tell you this i've been places in the ministry been around the world places throughout the nation and every time you meet a real son and daughter of god they have that spirit like you've known them all of your life but you meet some people and you're thinking my lord have they been a child of the devil all their life what happened to them better not ask they might give you a full story hello now notice when brother branham is there in wisdom versus faith he he begins to make some some comments and dealing with two wires and as soon as i go into these things you'll remember if you're very familiar and a student of the message but but he'll make these statements about two wires that they they can look just they can look just alike but one of them's got the dynamo and one ain't and you know that we have got to connect ourself to the word of god we've got to attach ourselves to it because everything else is it's fleeting and failing and life is just but a vapor and if we don't attach ourselves to something eternal what have you done in your life but notice when the random would said that jesus that when satan hit jesus he hit that hundred billion vote that hundred billion vote wire right there and he would go on to say that as soon as he hit him he flew off a lot faster than when he flew on he said now remember satan had a wire too but no matter how nice that copper the wire is it hasn't got no life in it it's dead she won't act that same wire one has got energized from the dynamo and the other one has no connection at all that's the reason that's the reason it'll work in a predestinated vessel that's the reason the word will work where it's connected connected where with the denomination no sir that's a dead socket having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof but connected with the word which shall never pass away and can produce the same power that he had that's where it at if you just realize the power of that one statement that here brother adam has said that that when he hit jesus he hit a hundred billion vote wire but when there is a connection it'll produce the same power when you connect yourself to jesus he's not going to drag you down he's going to lift you up when you connect yourself to jesus he's not going to make you sick he's going to make you whole when you attach yourself to jesus he's going to produce on the inside of you the same power same life same works same wonders because of a connection and it will only work in a predestinated vessel deuteronomy 7 and 6 for thou art and holy people under the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers half the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt deuteronomy 10 and 15 only the lord had delighted my fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us say it through your mass to your neighbor having predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace to his grace now it says that he hath chosen us in him jesus before the foundation of the world that means that that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal equal eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that now notice he says now let me inject a thought in here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that at a certain time and a certain egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to that egg while others that could have just easily attached himself or had a better opportunity to do so did not do so in paris there is an intelligence behind all of this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or a girl blonde or brunette light or dark type of eyes etc i'd say that if i could have had my choice that i would made sure that none of the girls carried any of my characteristics but i didn't have a choice in the matter you see there is a dna attachment that even though i heard stories all of my life about how andrew was that mental child syndrome that that red head deal just a little bit of extra fire on top of it all but there were things that i thought that i could stop by being a good parent by being a real man but i passed it right on down to two little girls now they may be female in type but you watch that little girl right there ali and you'll see me 30 some years ago well 9 30 ain't that old 29 some years ago get this baby right katie told me when i turned 30 that i had to grow up i keep pushing it back but if you watch how that there are things in qualities in ally's life because of that dna code and the dna markers that are passed down that she's attached to me in this temporal life she could jump off a bus and land on her feet hurt herself every day and think what happened where was my parenting skills at i thought that i'd read all those books on parents for dummies learn all about it fix all the problems get it out the system i thought i got it all out the system 29 years ago but it passed down and you're going to watching that little girl and you're watching little reagan you watch little alley and they'll carry those characteristics because of the attachment of life and you go to thinking about those things and you see that that there is something that is that is that is testifying of a different world that there is an attachment between father and his children that that though he he tried though though satan tried his worth to try to push it all out and tried to stop it he still couldn't stop you brother nathanael from producing christ he tried his very best to offer you cigarettes or offer you life or offer you this out here but you still are connected through a birth and you can only push out what you are oh hallelujah you see when you go to looking at when they started putting a crown of thorns on jesus's head when they begin to mock him and they begin to strip his clothes off of him and put on put on that scarlet robe around him and mock him and say hell king of the jews satan never would have allowed that to happen if he knew that your sins were connected to this man he would have never allowed this to happen if he knew that your healing was connected to this king he would have never beat him if he knew that your joy was connected to this king he would have never put him on a cross if he knew that eternal life was attached to that king oh but satan's so stupid he thinks he thinks he stopped it but he never has stopped it and he never will stop it you can hang him on a cross you can put him in a grave you can seal it with a roman seal but you can't stop the life of god because of an attachment that was passed down through seed before time began that gene seed of god would come forth and we as parents we try to think about all the things that we could keep our children from is that true parents again you must be astounded by what i've said we try to keep our children from these things because that's what we are how about father when he knows that if you do this don't touch that wet paint you're going to get pain on your finger how many times has he tried his very best to try to stop you from going this direction and you find out i thought i felt a little nudged to go the other way but because of my own selfish will it pushed me down the road that made me look back to him you try your very best to keep them from doing the same things that you did you try your very best i'm not making a way for sin right here at all and i'm not saying and trust me and i don't want you going down that avenue or thinking well well i've got to sow my wild oats or i've got to do these things so that i can have a testimony wherever you hear those things that came from the pit of hell i believe that you can have an overcoming life and never go out on the devil's territory you ain't gotta have you ain't gotta smoke one one cigarette you ain't gotta take one drink of alcohol you ain't gotta dabble in drugs just to have a testimony you can have a testimony setting right here in the house of god though you never got tempted by the things of the by the world and went out there and danced and went out there and parted in those things if you overcame your unbelief you have a testimony that'll shake hell to its core that there is a power that has attached itself to you but god is trying to keep you from delving into those things so many times i look at the things that that i went through and i try to relate to these young people and try to tell them about these things just so they know that they can point to somebody that got attached by a birth to a kingship that they can attach to that there is overcoming power in the name of jesus christ that even though they might have walked into a valley they can come out of that valley that even though that they got entrapped by sin they can get out of that there's a blood hallelujah that's greater than all the sin of the world you see if there was not an attachment between esther and king of hazaresse she would have died to death when she walked into his courts uninvited but because the king loved her and there was an attachment there the king extended his scepter oh hallelujah that even though you may have walked in here and you may have felt like you was uninvited there is a blood that has caused an attraction and an attachment to this headship hallelujah there is a waymaker and he is a god that if you just connect yourself to in this life that he will be he will be your god in life he'll take you down roads only that lead to him we go to thinking about you go to thinking about all our lost loved ones and we go to thinking about everyone that's went across the chasm of time and you go to thinking about when you go to thinking about great men of pillars like brother homer and brother harold blair and sister virginia wilson brother john kelly and you go to thinking about those men you begin to think about their legacy and you begin to think about who they were there's got to be somebody that steps up because god has got to have a testimony that there is a body on earth that is attached to a headship that will only express his mind stand with me god knows your future some people are always haunted about their past they're always haunted about what they did surely if he's god and he knows about your past what about your future what's your future going to be like what's your life going to be like surely he knows your future he knew all about david before david was ever birthed there in here on the earth but he knew that david would be king and out of david's loins would come the son of david the royal seed what are you carrying in your life what expression is going to be made what's attached what testimony is attached to your life let's sing that song i searched all [Music] and i over all over i couldn't find nobody i looked like you know i still couldn't find nobody nobody greater [Music] nobody greater jesus or nobody greater [Music] [Applause] i couldn't find nobody [Music] nobody greater jesus oh nobody greater than you oh i climbed upon the highest [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] went down into the deepest [Music] i couldn't find nobody i looked high and low i

greater nobody greater jesus or nobody greater than you oh don't you love the lord don't you love him for all his mighty acts and his wonderful things that he's done for us just be remembering tomorrow morning service brother ron will be speaking lord willing in the morning to the other half of the congregation but we invite you to watch by the way of streaming and just join with us as
