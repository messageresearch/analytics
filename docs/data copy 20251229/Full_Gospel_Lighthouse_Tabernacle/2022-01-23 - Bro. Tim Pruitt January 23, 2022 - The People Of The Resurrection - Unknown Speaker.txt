river stones but what the philistine couldn't see is what i had was more than me see on my own i'm weak but my god fights for me i was servant to the king interpreting his crazy dreams i won't worship mortal men so they threw me in the lines then vicious teeth were all i saw until something came and shut their jaws you couldn't find a scratch on me in fact that night i fell asleep when morning came it shocked them more cause my god fights for me oh yes it does [Music] i poured my oil upon his feet i didn't care who saw me weave i gave him all i had that day and he should have sent me on my way but instead he lifted up my head cause my god fights for me he's my shield he's my sword the victory is [Music] is so what's your story here today and what's a giant in your way are you trapped and can't get out or are you staring down a lion's mouth can you stand before the lord or do you need to hit the floor it don't matter what you've done cause the battle is already war so lift your voice with me and say that my god fights for me so lift your voice in victory cause my dives for me yes he does he's my shield he's my sword [Applause] [Applause] he's so what's your story here today and what's a giant in your way are you trapped and can't get out or are you staring down a lion's mouth can you stand before the lord or do you need to hit the floor it don't matter what you've done cause the battle's already worn so leave your voice with me and sing and my god [Music] cause my god fights for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah are you serving a god that fights your battles it's not your battle the battle is the lord's and it's one it's already won it's already defeated every enemies underneath the feet of our lord jesus christ and you are his body our god is fighting for us and he ain't never let us down and he ain't never lost to battle he don't plan on giving up now hallelujah give him praise in the house of god give him praise that is due honor due to his name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the most high god it is our honor this weekend to be able to be in the house of the lord [Applause] it's our honor to come to magnify the name of the most high god hallelujah [Applause] i gotta warn satan we ain't been in church for two weeks and we've come to have church we've come to declare war and so we decided to bring a general in for this time we got bad news for the enemy we brought the pruitt's all the way from louisiana and they come with their swords unsheathed ready to win and ready to fight we have brother tim pruitt that'll be speaking for us this morning but brother timothy pruitt is here and we would like for him to come and sing and say a few words this morning and we just certainly love brother timothy with all our heart he's a real general and i'm glad to stand by his side give him a hand as he comes this morning [Applause] hallelujah how many can say praise the lord this morning hallelujah hallelujah amen our god fights for us i'm so thankful for that you know we're not walking this battle along and fighting this battle along but he's with us every step of the way you know it was just a few months ago i was standing in this pulpit and the lord really done something for me and personally i know he was beneficiaries of that as well but god showed me very clearly that he fights for me and he came down in the fire for me and you know we've been through some very difficult times some very dark times but he's still with us he showed us he would be amen and and i'm thankful for that you know i think about the miracles that god has done in this generation and what he's still doing you know people want to come today and say that you know he can't do it anymore or he doesn't do that anymore that's all gone and passed i don't believe it for a moment because i've witnessed him to be a god of miracles amen you know i i love this the way brother brown would put it he said the days of miracles has not passed as it says the theologians if the days of miracles has passed the day of god has passed because he is a miracle amen doubters say you don't see any miracles no more they say there's so many that's been waiting for their answer to come and many are getting weary and get wanting to give up but there's great news god is still god and he still fights for us amen he's still in the valleys he's still on the mountaintops he's still no matter where you're at amen as he would he would speak to me very clearly this past wednesday he's a healer and he hasn't lost his touch hallelujah what he did then he does now he's still the almighty he's still the same yesterday today and for uh forever his power is still showing up and showing out his power is still healing his power is still delivering amen just a few weeks ago we had a young girl that had fell and broke her arm and the doctors was going to do some intensive surgery on her and she was going to have rods in her arms for about a year and she was brought forth amen that morning actually i would get up and brother tim had instructed the church to to listen to a couple of sermons that brother brother brown would preach on the rejected king and i was listening to it that morning brother branham had brought brought out about david and the uh and the little sling of faith that he had and he said he said and he called the prayer line he called preachers to pray and and he began to he said lord i come in this little sling of faith slingshot of faith and he would drive cancer out with this little slingshot and he just spoke to me we're about to have a prayer line and i'd actually text my father and i said you planning on having a prayer line this morning and he said well it actually crossed my mind well in that prayer line this little girl comes up and we pray for her she goes to the doctor the next day they said no surgery needed amen and bones are back together the way they should be in that moment god healed taste amen nerves were healed pain was healed listen there's healing in the body it doesn't matter how many dies or how many goes on or whatever god is still the healer he's still the liver i know what he can do and i know that he will do it amen so i know i felt it i witnessed it i found him faithful and he's never lost a battle amen as we said this morning there's a one word in his that's not in his vocabulary and that's fail amen he's never failed us he still restores he still heals he still redeems and no matter how many doubters rise how many doubters says it ain't so i still believe amen i believe he's the same god that would walk down in the valley with david and take god's head off i believe this morning he's going to do it again how many davids are in the building this morning i believe he's here to take david that glides head off and put it up as david did there as we found as we as in israel david would take that head he would drag it all over the kingdom showing what my god did amen and he would actually place it in the place they call the the the mountain of the skull amen and he would place it there because it was an intersection of great travel and he'd put a spear there and he put that head on top of that spear showing god had dominion over this amen it would be the same place that god would come two thousand or a thousand or so years later amen and the little man named jesus and he would come to that same place and be hung between the high the air and the in in the air between the ground and the sky amen and it would show i still have power over this i'm still the same yesterday today and forever i'm here to declare he hasn't lost his touch he's still a healer that blood still has power it's still an effect he's still here to move in the midst amen i'm here to see if john's hair be raised up again and say my god is the same god my god is my god and he fights for me brother ron you're not in this battle alone sister connie you're not in this battle alone church you're not in this battle along you don't just have a pruitt fighting for you you got jesus christ himself that has assigned himself to your battle and your need and your situation how can we lose oh blessed be the name of the lord he's a miracle worker amen do y'all sing that song we shall see miracles as a congregation dude amen i don't know i don't even know if i could sing it myself but let's just come back brother matt let's sing that what you did he's a waymaker he's a waymaker i'm telling you he's the guide he knows how to get you through the wilderness he knows how to get you through your sickness amen the spirit of the lord just really moved in that song a while ago i believe that's what he's wanting to show us this morning he's a waymaker when we can't see away in the darkest time there's ever been as we talked about last wednesday of the dark time chaos all around these two men walking down the road of emmaus wondering what's going on what's happening but it was the day of the resurrection we're also in that day it's in a dark time in a dark place darkness all around us amen we're in darkness but we're not of darkness and there can be someone i believe this morning is going to step out of the bushes begin to tell you what's going on and what's happening and begin to reveal the things all the way down and show you where we're at you know and i thought it was so awesome how that he would come in that place and they had invited him said come here come into this little place brother branham said it must have been just a little mud hut didn't look like much but they invited him in and he said if you invite him in he'll do things for you like you've never witnessed before in your life said he would actually take the bread and the breaking of the bread if their eyes were open amen i believe it was the same one he was showing again i still have the touch he would tear off that piece of bread and another place another piece would take his place and i he i believe this morning he's got a piece of bread for you how many wants to say lord feed me today in this resurrection time amen it seems like chaos all around we've been out of service for weeks and and we're all alone but lord revealed to me you're still among us amen let's sing that as brother tim would come amen i believe he's still working when you don't even see him working he's still moving when you don't see him moving even while you've been in the darkness he's still there [Music] this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] we're not alone lord [Music] i was sure [Music] i call you [Music] is forever [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] let him touch your heart this morning [Music] let it be prophecy this morning [Music] god [Music] me [Music] oh is [Music] is [Music] even when i don't see [Music] [Music] my way [Music] jesus [Music] my god that [Music] oh is healer oh yes you are lonely oh my god oh that is who you are [Music] oh yes you are [Music] just lift your hands and worship him right now just give him praise lord we love you today we thank you for your divine mercy and your grace and your mercies are new every morning and today we're recipients of that divine mercy in that mercy of salvation heal and deliverance your god and your god above every situation we thank you lord that you are the delivering god lord that you're the one who moves in our midst lord in commission to church in my name you will cast out devils oh god as a as a church of jesus christ we do that lord in salvation and deliverance lord seeing people

amen praise the lord amen it's good to be in the house of the lord good to be together with you today and in the presence of the great king of glory amen what a wonderful savior we have and what a mighty god that we serve amen if you'll turn with me to revelation chapter 1 and verse 9 i'm going to read this so you can be seated and no you can be seated after i read it i'm going to read this so you can be seated okay so we'll just stand in honor to the word or remain standing there uh revelation 1 and 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia and just ephesus and the smyrna and the pergamos and under thy tara and under sardis and unto philadelphia and under laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the pabst with a golden girdle and his hand and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet likened to fine brass as if they burned it in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the keys of hell and of death amen now you can have your seats i want to say it's a real privilege to be here this morning i have this opportunity to speak to you once more and share the good news that our god's not dead he's a living god and he's present among his people today and we want to thank him for his presence here among us and what he's doing of us and i wanted to take a moment here just to especially and specifically thank you for your your prayers and your support and the time of my wife's passing just in a few days it'll be six months ago now time flies doesn't it and um i receive more cards and encouragement from this church than any other place in the world and although we received a lot of encouragement from everywhere and we i just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for those expressions of love and um we we love you as a group of people and um we're just believing the lord will just speak to us today you know um you know as um as we're looking at this today um you know we we are we are in um in a great time a great hour where god is doing great things among us and um you know we we have seen him do great work today actually i um we're doing a really great work as we're hearing the end time process where the bible said that travel would be vastly increased and so you know not only am i able to come across the united states and in a matter of uh less than a day and be over here well yet at the same time to this moment i'm speaking to an international audience and so you know the word is going forth into places that would have been impossible to do just a few years ago even and so just as soon as i as we speak they're hearing it over uh we have those listening in from india those from south africa today and it's not about me actually it's about this church um if you remember the lord spoke to your pastor brother ron if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and you know we would think in carnal minds oh my that means that god's going to just really heal him right quick and give him a deliverance in a miraculous way and that's the way that god will really get glory to his name well you know god's got bigger plans in what we do and he's allowed him to minister across the world and encourage believers everywhere you can't listen to ron spencer without getting up kicking yourself in the rear and say getting going you know you're not a allowed just to sit in your pew and just feel sorry for yourself and then when you see a man that is fighting what he has fought and and um dealing with what he's dealing with you know so um and then it just encourages all to go forward and we are encouraged in louisiana by the services from this church and around the world the saints are encouraged and um you know to as i as i said that we're we have an international audience way late at night right now um as it's almost midnight there's there's little groups of people down in india that are listening in one of them just wrote me that a few weeks ago saying my son-in-law um mauritius was suffering badly by the back pain and in the past for one past week he's unable to sit for more than 10 minutes or and cannot walk and today i get a report in after prayer that god is healed as her son-in-law the doctor certified he does not need surgery and said this is thanksgiving to our healer who still does miracles amen as brother timothy preached and i wish he would have just preached a while ago but the healer has not lost his touch amen but you know sometimes god heals in in different ways i mean in our camp meeting that we just had and brother ron was there in the services and other ministers ministering but in the prayer lines there we had a little sister come up with very two serious autoimmune diseases and this is by no means the only healing that took place or deliverance there but this is just one of the great testimonies from that she had rheumatoid uh rheumatoid arthritis which was crippling her and she could not even this was a young woman and she couldn't even put her hands together and then she also had a a a killer autoimmune disease which was scleroderma and she just reported that god has healed her of both she needs no medicine no nothing amen she's totally deliberate the healer has not lost his touch but you know sometimes god heals in other ways you know we've had um great reports come out as a men and women that have been healed by the power of god as we prayed and deliverance has been even in overseas countries like south africa um those were you know healed of third stage rectal cancer a little sister there that we sent prayer close to her husband hadn't had a job in uh three years and god granted him a job that had just been waiting for him and it was an absolute miracle and this was actually the same service that sister lana butts was healed of cancer and um we sent a prayer cloth at that same time as we were praying in that service and seeing god come on the scene and uh but sometimes god doesn't heal in in the same way you know there are other ways that god heals and um i recently i i got a request from a little family in in south africa their name this is an afrikaans name i'm not sure i know how to say it your sami family they're listening in today you know they just reported to me that their mother who we prayed for has has passed away and from cancer and of course our hearts go out to them for their loss and we pray that god will give them comfort but you know as a believing child of god sister mabus is not dead i mean she just changed dwelling places leaving behind the coat of her old body that could no longer sustain life what is dead is the cancer and it was defeated in death because remember this god heals all diseases all diseases and even in death god heals and so you know sister mabus is just is very much alive and as she ever was in fact she's more alive than she ever was because your senses are greater and and uh than those of this earthly realm and even the scripture supports that they can even see into this dimension with the eyes of the the eyesight that they have they can see here just as well as they can there and i'll tell you she would cry out today don't mourn for me you know my theophany body never hurts never grows weary it never gets tired and the place i'm have is filled with divine love and everything's wonderful and she has joined the the chorus of those who are crying out you know saying press the battle you just don't know what lies at the end of the road now five years ago this month i was here and we were here for the um the funeral of sister christine spencer brother ron's mother and um if you remember god had spoke to brother ron and told him there i showed him in a in a supernatural experience of brother timothy preaching on the resurrection and the life and and me preaching on all thou suffer stand and be healed and you know there at that moment in time brother davey went through his very difficult trial that he went through and god brought him not just a healing and a deliverance but gave to him children and but for sister christine he would heal her by taking her out of this dimension into and put her in a young body again and yesterday we were here with brother ron and his family and and um you know at his dad's funeral there and and um you know i'll tell you as we thought about you know what i'm what a soldier the cross that he was and and everything that that god has used him for and raised up the spencer family to be such a blessing to the bride of christ and we have been so blessed and by this ministry and by what god has done and used them for and i couldn't help but think back as i came here last time that i ministered on heaven and right after sister christine's funeral i came here and i ministered on heaven and you know we spoke about that today i'm going to be speaking on the people of the resurrection as we follow up the funeral of brother charlie that god had used that great man and and whatever but now he awaits for the resurrection and of course you know they they are blessed ahead of us because they raise first the dead in christ shall rise first and then they will appear to us and then we will get our change after we see them now so we are a people who are on our way back to eden and make no mistake about it although we have received and one of the greatest signposts that by this message that we have that we are nearing that land we have not arrived yet amen we still got a little ways to go the sign poi post will point to the city but the sign is never the city there's a sign of noah and certainly we can see as we look back in time and we we see as it was in the days of noah we see the signposts of sodom and we know that the world is in a sodomite condition we see this and we see other signposts like the we are here where the jewish church was when they were blinded and in their blindness they crucified the lord the messiah it was such a dark age and we're right now here at a time as they were at a time of the resurrection there would be the resurrection of all the old testament saints and now we are here on the very cusp of the resurrection of all the new testament saints but the bride of christ herself is a sign in fact we are the last sign where the last sign before the coming groom a bride that is prepared to meet the bridegroom as brother branham said in the identification of christ in all ages is god manifested in the flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign god identifying himself the word in the church so here with the word in the church the bride of christ is the last sign to this generation even as jesus would be the last sign to the jewish dispensation which would be the word made flesh and now the word is being made flesh in a bright body in the last sign before the rapture of the church now there's been prophecies and scriptures and promises that have been made you know to many people down to the ages but we have arrived at the place where all the fullness of the word is being made manifest in a bride people so all of them in the ages past though you may look at them as history or the story of the jewish people it is more than that it is a prophecy that is prophesying of the day and the hour that we're living in and you are they were the they were prophesying and you are the interpretation now as brother branham told us there has been churches and churches and brides brides but there's got to come one there's got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it that makes that church live and move in the power of the resurrection now these end times signs that that we see it shows us that we're about to be snatched out of here amen for it is the eagle age and we'll be caught up the bible uses that word caught up it means to be snatched up it literally means to to be just be caught up like in the nick of time and so the the eagle is the miracle it comes out of the heavens it snatches its prey uh totally unexpected even unnoticed and but yet it'll come down in just one moment snatch what it has and take it away and this is exactly the way that jesus described the end time and the end time you know again is a is a time of the miraculous it is and if you don't believe in miracles you know while the resurrection the body change the rapture it'll be nothing short of miraculous and then this brother brandon would say if i can't get the church to even believe for divine healing how am i going to get them to believe for a rapture or for the great resurrection of the dead or the translation of the saints so again there's got to be a people that believe in this hour now you see but where is it the bible teaches us he's going to take us out in such a way where he'll snatch us out as he said um there in thessalonians well the the bible speaks that we should pray always that we would escape the things that are coming upon the earth amen so he tells us that the end time will come like a trap which just snaps real quick quickly and and it will catch many unawares but at the same time in that moment he warns us to don't be overcome with society and the drunkenness and the cares of this life and he warns you don't get bogged down with this life amen you know and it's easy to do you get glued to every kind of news out there and you don't even know what to believe but what they're saying and so many people turn to conspiracy theories and you don't know what to believe what they're saying but you know don't get caught up don't get bogged down with everything keep your mind when you see all these things he said come to pass look up for your redemption draw it now so he tells you where to look there's no need to look at the news there's no need to look at conspiracies there is no need for any of this look up your redemption draws nigh in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he'll swoop down take a people out of here and rapture a people in the glory and i want you to know today we are that people of the resurrection it is resurrection out it is translating time this is the seventh age where the enochs come forth are you with me church now where is he going to take us he's going to take us into heaven where we'll have a married supper for glorified saints amen we'll have bodies that'll travel like a thought and pass through walls and appear and disappear unconfined by physical restraints but the same time be physical enough to eat fish and honeycomb amen but now when you think about going away to heaven we're not going to be in there very long amen we're not staying in heaven very long just three and a half years while the earth is you know while on the earth is the time of the the kinsman avenger and he pours out his wrath and tribulation and plagues are poured out upon the earth are you with me amen this is exactly this is exactly right we're we're here in the hour the seventh seal where the silence has been broken and the prayers of the saints that have prayed for his coming is now being poured had been poured out before god and they come up mixed with the fire and come into his nostril and he's and he begins his coming by sending a prophet restoring the word calling the word bride so there be somebody to rapture and we are in the very process of the ending up of everything as the seventh seal begins to unfold and it just one thing happens and another and another like a roman candle going on you know it's just one explosion after another until it's all fulfilled we're living in a tremendous hour don't get your eyes off of what god's doing don't listen to the fake news out there fake news will tell you that god isn't god and he's not real and the emotion that you feel isn't real why you're bumping into angels that's why you're screaming that's why you're showering those dimensions are coming so close [Applause] now in the great tribulation of head ahead the the vials of judgment are emptied that stored up wrath where god could not punish the horse she still had a part he could not obliviate her she still had a part to play there was still word to be fulfilled are you with me she has a part in the end time the great the harlots the whole system and so they could curse that enemy down to the ages i'm sure columba did luther wesley all of them cried out against that and spoke judgments against the false system amen against the beast are you with me against the false prophet but god could not obliviate him so he stored it up as wrath in vials waiting for the tribulation but he's got to get a bride of the earth first because you are not going to be here while he pours out his rats upon the earth you're not a part of the wrath your part of his coming amen so there we'll spend three and a half years while the world is going through tribulation we're enjoying the marriage supper of the lamb this is not fiction this is real amen and then it'll all conclude with christ coming back with his bride at armageddon taking the world over for a thousand year honeymoon amen we'll come right back to this earth again and there you know for that thousand year honeymoon and after that he'll have a great white throne judgment and their death and hell and satan will be thrown into the lake of fire and then eden will come upon the earth as the new jerusalem comes down from god out of heaven what am i telling you i'm even telling you that the intermediate heaven that brother charlie just went to that my wife is at that is an intermediate place it's only a waiting place that heaven one day will come down to earth and i as we as we said satan will be thrown into the lake of fire and and so will death and hell and the grave will all be thrown into the lake of fire so i want to remind the devil this morning satan you're only temporary you are not eternal amen sin is temporary it will have an end amen evil one day evil you're going to come to an end but there is no end to a child of god amen we came from god and we're going back to god originally we were eternal in his thoughts and we are eternal now amen we are not temporary beings now the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't make you a son or daughter of god it only quickens the eternal seed gene of god within you and reveals to you your eternity your eternal qualities so it's not a time not going to be a fun time for those that are left behind do everything you can to be in the rapture make that your goal your ambition the desire of your heart to live today as if he was coming today now and although we can we can feel the hot winds of tribulation coming what do you think is happening pre-tribulation plagues with more and more plagues and viruses coming seems like it's endless economies are falling conflicts with russia and with china are rising every kind of vileness in our nation even uh children of rebellion rising up as the bible said you know children of rebellion where they what they they hate everything that is god or that's called god there's no respect for law and order amen there's no respect for common decency insanity rings a man can a man can decide to declare himself a female and you don't dare tell him he's not you know again it's insanity we have to we have to pander to their to their insanity and pretend pretend that it's right and we dare not call him her or her him when when they want to be called the other thing you see but let me tell you the bride is not going through the tribulation the blood of jesus christ perfects you tribulation hey if tribulation would perfect you don't you know that the dark ages would have perfected the people and they went in a rapture a long time ago tribulation is not and persecution is not going to be what perfects you what perfects you is the blood of jesus christ it is our perfection amen so a man that chooses a wife he didn't put her through a lot of punishment she she's already found grace with him amen or his favor is on her he engages to her he loves if anything he'll keep her from every kind of trouble amen because his grace is so great upon them and as brother branham said so will the bride and so is it on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it hallelujah just think about how many people were lost when he come by your way think about how many sinners there were in the world the hour you got saved but god saves you for a purpose amen and we ought to be determined by his will to do that purpose don't care what we have to go through we want to do it now originally mankind lived in eden and he got separated by sin because sin and sinners cannot live in eden and eden was then closed off to man with cherubim's a guarding the way back nobody could come back in you see eden was heaven on earth that's the way the world began with eden heaven came down to earth the way the world will end this present kingdom the way it will end will be heaven come back and down to earth again so it was there it was a paradise it was a time where god came down and fellowshipped with man but when sin entered man became separated in other words he got he died he was separated from god and that separated him from eden sin made him where he could no longer live in in eden's paradise but god has never given up for given up for human beings to live here upon the earth and earth again will some glorious day will be in eden again the climax of history will be the creation of a new heavens and a new earth this is when he will make all things new amen now not being a creation in the sense of we think of creation out of nothing but god will take and remake and remold this world or this earth and the old will pass away and become a new creation by the power of the word it'll be a resurrected universe inhabited by resurrected people living with the resurrected jesus amen now to do so god's got to have a resurrected people now not just the resurrection of bleached bones and decayed bodies but a resurrected people quickened and made alive and upon this earth will be people who make up his bride and who will be with him in the new jerusalem and there'll be millions of others outside the city you talk about grace when the fifth seal is open there are souls under the altar and it revealed things in there you couldn't imagine you see who had ever thought that those under the seal those were jews who had been killed down to the ages but more specifically by you know through hitler and eichmann and stalin and that killed six million jews and there they were is martyrs under the altar and they were crying out how long o lord how long and they were crying for vengeance they were not christians they had been martyred but not for the cause of christ but for the testimony which they held amen because they they were jews they held onto the faith of abraham that was given to him and his seed so who would ever thought that there could be people there given white robes who were blinded because they had not known their messiah and because of the blindness of this condition god in his grace and his mercy saved them anyhow and what about in revelation 7 between the 6th and the 7th seal there's a multitude without number we think about greats i wonder sometimes do we even know grace it's a lot larger than you can imagine his love is greater than you can imagine his mercy is greater than than you could ever dream of this is a god a god that loves a god that cares a god that don't want anybody lost amen he said he was not willing that any should perish this was the kind of god that we serve amen he's one that loves his people oh you know a lot of times we think no always just grace on the bride you know we're the predestinated we're the ones that was in his mind that's not all he had in his mind amen he had there were there are people in the lamb's book of life and there's people in the book of life and there's a bride and there's a church that is called out in revelation 7 a multitude without number these never received the holy ghost here they never drank of the fountains of living water but here in revelation 7 it says that they came through great tribulation and he wipe the tears from their eyes and he will lead them to life to life-giving waters amen that's how we know him he's a thirst quencher amen he's the one that that quenches the thirst of every thirsty sinner amen he still does that i think of a of a man there that just stumbled into our church here recently and never been in church one of those unchurched and i drank liquor since he was a boy an alcoholic in his in nearly 50 years old and every day was dr was drinking drugs and he comes into this service there and comes down to an altar in one moment's time is transformed by the power of god no longer drinks or dopes anymore amen why because god still got the the the remedy to sin you see a man smokes because he's thirsty he drinks because he's thirsty he there goes out in pornography and sex sins and everything else because he's thirsty amen they're thirsty for something that sin cannot quench amen but let me tell you friends you see sometimes you think you know grace you think grace is all about you but remember god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son what for his love for humanity for all amen a multitude without number think of that you think you're the only one that's going to have eternal life no you're not i mean you're you think you're the only one who's going to be on the that's going to be on the new earth no you're not you think you're the only one that that's going to be there no brother rather said there were millions there brother branham told us that he said there would be people there you never even thought would make it some people there you didn't realize your testimony or even the testimony of your life touched them [Applause] and in that moment there was a change there'd be people there that you didn't even know the testimony of your life turn them around in their worst moment now rather than thinking it's just us for no more we ought to be a little more embracing and say oh god save them i don't care if they just barely make it in they're not bride but they're that multitude without number i don't care how you do it but just save them god amen i don't want to see anybody lost whether it's my kids your kids whether it's a sinner that's so far away from god don't never let me get so hard that i don't want anybody else in heaven but me there's going to be a bride and she'll be entitled to the new jerusalem and there'll be those outside the city that'll bring their gifts into the city they don't get to live in the city but they get to live amen so don't give up on them so well my grandma she didn't believe the message she did the best they knew don't give up on her put her in the hands of god surrender to jesus amen you know whatever you would say about them one way or the other even at their funeral wouldn't change their destiny amen so why not just put them in the hands of a loving god who cares why do you have to make the decision this is not the time of judgment this is a time of mercy amen why not put them in the hands of a god that's got more mercy than you could ever imagine that's the kind of god i serve a god whose love is so great i'm telling you a god whose love is so great yes there definitely is a bride and she is a set apart people and if you're part of her by the baptism of the holy ghost which is the only way you can be bright you are a blessed person really blessed but upon this earth there will be people that who will make up his bride who will be with him in the new jerusalem there will be millions on the outside of the city and earth will be so enlarged that there be no more sea but he'll accommodate them all amen there'll be room for them all and i just want to say you don't want to miss it heaven is a real place it's a place for the people of the resurrection it's a amen and you don't want to miss it brother branham said i can't even describe what heaven is really like i don't have it in the human language sublime wouldn't do it nothing i can think of can in my vocabulary could even accurately describe what it's like but he said after being there i can't be the same william branham anymore amen heaven's a real place and brother bradham talked about that in the sermon things that are to be he said i don't think heaven is a place my mother used to tell me about i believe the church has grown from that to think 100 years ago or so the old-timers used to think that everyone went to heaven had a harp and sat down up there on the clouds and played a harp and they knew there was a place called heaven and it but if that be so all the musicians would have it on us in other words you better learn to play something amen but you see that was a conception he said before the fullness of the word came into existence or the opening of the seven seals that's promised to us in this age that we then understand but he said i believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place for god started us in our spiritual growth in this place and i believe heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't just sit up for eternity and sit up there on the cloud and we don't just strum our heart from all over here ever we're going to a real place where we're going to do things we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to life to real eternal life we're going to heaven a paradise like adam and eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed in the garden of eden before sin came in and we're right back on our road there again right on our way back the first adam through sin taking us out the second adam through righteousness brings us back in again and justifies us bringing us back in now let me tell you you don't want to miss it heaven is a real place you think of it a real place where we will live we will enjoy we will work just like adam and eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed in the garden of eden now so this present earth or you know this present earth that we're now living in the one we're in right now is an in-between world touched by both heaven and hell and earth leads directly into heaven or directly into hell you get to heaven here or you get from earth to hell here and this life here affords a choice between the two for the believer this wretched life is the closest you will ever come to hell and for the sinner this is the closest you'll ever be in heaven so the think of that the best of this life center is the only taste of heaven you'll ever have so this present earth before it was before it's renewed and the new jerusalem comes down upon it it's an in-between world it is touched by both heaven and hell in this dimension in this realm demons come and inhabit people demons come and torment people that's what sickness is it's satan tormenting amen you know in jesus jail father brought his son to jesus and and the demon said it often throws him into the fire and i'll tell you it does the same way even today fires a divorce fires a suicide fires of alcohol fires of drugs that's what demons do they throw you into the fire amen but in this realm the angels come amen that's right angels have been seen in this realm amen not just now but through the bible they abandoned even now angels have been seen here they can live they can walk they can experience things in this dimension come on amen you see they're spirits but there's one particular spirit that comes to live in us it's called the holy spirit it's the spirit of jesus so again this world is an in-between world that is touched by both heaven and hell amen so earth leads directly to heaven or directly to hell and it affords us a choice between the two now you say what we were chosen before the foundation of the world well that's true but you also have a choice you must choose what he chose and the truth of it being a pre-you know truth of it is being a predestinated seed you can only manifest what you are but the best of this earth is a glimpse of heaven the worst of this life is a glimpse of hell and for the christian this present life is it's the closest you'll ever come to hell think about it you're right now the closest you'll ever be to hell but for unbelievers it's the closest they'll ever be to heaven now you cannot go on pretending that the world we know is the only world you'll ever live in one breath away is another world and never forget you're that close to the next realm you might think as a young person i got a long life to live how do you know that your life can be snapped out in just one second you don't even have a promise of tomorrow and i'll tell you you know you you never forget how close it is you say well i can't see it well it's beyond your seat smell filling here but i want you to understand it's not that far away it's one breath this mortal life is only temporary it's a temporary life so don't so so don't just go through life putting on the dog pretending that this is all it is you know like you're somebody here you're nothing but dust as brother brethren said there's too many people putting on the dog we call it in the street expression but what are you anyhow but six foot of dirt god have mercy upon you i i don't i don't care how you can dress how you can act or what kind of home you can live in what kind of car you drive if you're not born of the power and the spirit of the resurrected jesus christ you're lost and will go to hell just as sure as a martin will go to his box but just your choice choose life or choose death now it's not popular today to preach about hell we're not supposed to just preach about hell well you know you know oh my you know well god's a loving god but let me tell you this loving god has created a place called hell and it has a beginning and it has an end now there's a fire that won't quench because god's a consuming fire and there's a worm that won't die because that's the destroyer and and because the soul that is the sinner will die the destroyer god will not die but there is no such thing as immortal life in hell you will come to an end now maybe a million years later but you'll come to an end and it's your choice you can either choose heaven or hell and i just say choose life you know brother branham said about the door to the heart and the painter pain painting the picture you know and they painted where there was no handle on the outside for jesus to turn and the critics looked at it and said you left off the door handle he said no i didn't i did that on purpose because the handle's on the inside only you can open it up to christ and brother braden said he cannot open from the outside he cannot save you against your will he cannot heal you against your will he cannot send a revival against your will you've got to be willing and open the door and invite him in you say well i need healing well i'll tell you you can sit right there unbelieving if you want to and say it's for others but he can never heal until you open that door you can say well i want a revival i i tell you but i ain't going to act like that no i i'm not going to shout i'm not going to get inspired like that i'm not going to get drunk on the stimulation of revelation you know people call themselves having revelation today and has no stimulation with it your wines are dead amen it don't have any fears no spirit in it it's done went bad true revelation produces stimulation it causes the hallelujahs to thank you jesus the glory to god it causes tears to come down your face it causes your hands to go up and worship amen and then it translates into a life that you live [Applause] but don't talk to me about revelation you have no stimulation that's education not stimulation education is dark and dreary words and formulas and ideas and hypotheses and you know psychiatrists or psychology trying to fix a spiritual problem revelation is quickening power amen and you want revival you got to open your heart to it you sit around and see somebody else being blessed and you don't open up you're not going to be blessed you want salvation you got to open the door to it amen but you see i want you to know heaven is not an eternal church service where we just sing and sing and sing and sing and say sing and absent-mindedly shout praises to god that's not heaven now that may be the job of some cherubims but that's not our job heaven is a place of wonderment a place of joy a place of peace and love and it has hills and mountains and valleys and rivers and crystal streams and open fields and wooded veils that's heaven when brother branham saw the pristine mountains of canada he told brother biscuit that heaven looks a whole lot like that with rolling hills and lofty mountains with beautiful fields like bluegrass with indescribable colors more vivid than anything you could ever imagine it's a land that is full of animals and wildlife except they're not wild there where nothing will hurt or destroy in all this holy mountain for there the lion will lay down by the lamb and the wolf will be tame and the bear will be cuddly and gentle it's a place where things that you love will be there too you know it has houses it has lands it's a city do you ever think of that it's a city it says also it's a country it is it has real foundations it has streets trees real houses with real furniture to resemble things we enjoyed here upon the earth and i'm not just talking about the millennium either i'm talking about the present heaven that brother charlie just went to it's a home as brother branham went there you remember can i just take just a minute and do this just remember when he there after hope had died and he was grieving so hard that god had to take him let him see how things were so he so he could realize he was better off there than here and there he there he he thought he was walking down he said i went into a trance and he said i was walking down this road i was out west somewhere and he said i had a cowboy hat on western clothes and he said i was whistling a song and singing it the wheel of the wagon is broken the sign on the ranch is for sale the wheel of the wagon is broken it must be the end of the trail it's no cowboy ballad and it's about the end of life it ends up you know in the course i think it says goodbye old paint it's a cowboy saying this goodbyes brother branham's out west and he says you know he said as i walked down this path he said i saw over there an old broken prairie schooner said it represented my broken family it was laying on his side and and there the wheel was broken off of it and and he just uh just um later in the vision he would see himself going west and he said he as he as was in an old cupboard wagon he was clicking the reins as he did with his wife and family in this prairie schooner i clicked the reins like this and i was holding the steering wheel in my station wagon a modern-day prairie scooter a wagon and he said as i passed the wreck you know how brother branham died as i passed the wreck and i got just past that a little bit there was a young girl standing there and she said hello daddy he said hello miss and she said hello daddy and you said daddy i'm not your daddy why you're just as old as i am how could i be your daddy because you don't know where you're at well on earth i was your little sharon rose but you know daddy the way you preached immortality which he wasn't preaching that then because this is fast forward in his life he said the way you preach more immortality there's no babies here we're all one age and then he says he says well sherry you really grew up and to be a beautiful girl and standing there looking at her blond hair and blue eyes and seeing her such a beautiful young ladies and he's trying to catch the reality of this because he's vincent as a mortal and he walks he says well then where's your mother because he knew he'd recognize her so he she said he's up there in your home waiting for you up there a home he said where branham's i've never had a home in my life you got to remember he rented his little place had outdoor toilets no running water they were poor impoverishes we've never had a homestead with daddy you got one here and mama's just waiting up there and said i saw a great light and i started walking toward that light and as i did hope came running out to meet me said she was emaciated and so sick when she died with that horrible diseases that she had of meningitis and tubercular and and there in her condition she was so bony and and and sick and drawn and there she was beautiful and young and and vibrant with health and i want you to think of this she she welcomed him home said come on in billy you've come home said you must be tired and weary after praying for all those sick people and brother branham's trying to understand all this he said well i wasn't even praying for the sick then and he says you know that's why i believe that one day i'll die right here in this pulpit he said i come close to dying like that the other day right here in the pulpit but he says so he says he walked in and he looked over there and he saw a chair that resembled the morris chair that he had bought their own time and couldn't pay for it and they come and got it a little stuffed chair that he could sit down and rest and read his bible prepare for sermons and i looked over there and i saw the morris chair and said she said to me i know what you're thinking but this will never be taken away are you with me you see it was a home it was a place it had familiar things it was real it was tangible it could be touched and man it was it was something it was something that uh the the senses could declare now so you see we're going to come we will live up on a resurrected earth in a resurrected universe inhabited by resurrected people with a resurrected jesus amen so that's why i scream out today choose life don't choose death choose life and the death i'm talking about is being separated forever from god and spinning it forever in hell for just as heaven is a real place hell is not offensive eviction it's real also and brother brandon said i went there too and he said to get there i was sinking in an endless eternity many of you heard me tell me sinking into an endless eternity i was going down through the clouds and through darkness and sinking on down and i'm getting to the regions of the lost and i screamed there was no foundation to it i could never stop falling for eternity it looked like i was going to fall there was no stopping nowhere let me tell you something that's exactly what happens to people when they turn their back on the message they start a downward fall oh i would never drink or i would never do this and i would never live that way and i would never and they keep falling they step off the truth and just keep falling and falling and falling and first thing you know every kind of sin and evil and awful wicked things begin to attach to them they begin to cut themselves and mark themselves with tattoos and everything else to identify with a culture of hell first thing you know they they get down or first they first the thing you know they don't believe the message the next thing they they do they they discredit the prophet the next thing they discredit the one who's sinning jesus christ amen then the next thing you know they don't believe the bible no more and then the next thing you know they don't even believe there's a god you see it has no foundation they just keep falling and falling and falling and falling and brother branham said i was falling and he was crying out and screaming somebody catch me mama catch me and said there was no mother there said i screamed you know to to to to um to my daddy catch me somebody anyway there was no daddy there and he said i i was screamed out to god and there was no god there and after a while i began to hear the most mournful sounds i'd ever heard an awful feelings and said a literal burning hell would be a pleasure to decide of what this was and so it was just one of the most harmless feelings and he said i saw them there their painted faces looked like cats and like the women paint their eyes today and the green junk under their eyes and and hood they were going oh oh they were insane and he said creamed out like god have mercy upon me you know oh god if you only let me go back and live i promise to be a good boy that's the only thing i could say and he said you know lord i promise i'll be a good boy he said i told lies i've done all kinds of things that can be done but i i had been blowed almost halfway in true with the with the um with the shotgun blast and as a as a friend you know shot him there and he and he says but only thing i could say to god is i'll be a good boy you know i never committed adultery god and you know i but if you let me go back he said i never accepted his pardon now remember that's important to accept his pardon to think about that you can be the wretched most worst indebted sinner in the world but he offers a pardon he is able to pay your debt in fall and he said i was just a new arrival there in the most hideous horrible ungodly feeling that you could have and and it was a sinking and sinking you know i i tell you i've i've i've read a lot of near-death experiences in our day that we're living in there are doctors now that have even written books cardiologists um that have written upon near-death experiences because in our modern day we've been able to bring people back to life after death you know within so many sometimes sometimes miraculously it can be an hour or so after they've been declared dead but they come back sometimes only minutes but in that brief moments there they experience things and i'll just tell you you know there was a there was a brother there was a brother in south africa who who actually had an operation of surgery and he said he gave a testimony i listened to his testimony where that where that when he died there after the operation he couldn't breathe and he died he said i raised up out of my body i was just alive as ever and i was looking back at my body and then working over trying to resuscitate me and he said i i watched them called the doctor and i watched them the doctor come running down the the hall and i watched him wheel me down to the operating room he said i was in complete control i wasn't i wasn't hurting i wasn't sick i had good feelings everything else i had i had he had tremendous eyesight all my senses was there this is a believer but there was a man by the name of howard storm that i read about that he was an art professor and was an atheist big college professor was over at france he had a condition in his stomach and within five hours he was to have to have an operation because he couldn't live longer than that and they neglected him to let him they let him die and he said in that moment after i died he said i told my wife goodbye and she was sweeping and all of that and and i told her goodbye and he said i just wanted to get some relief and i was scared of dying because that was the end i didn't believe there was any god whatsoever and i just knew and i was terrified that it would just be him that's it but the next moment i raised up out of my body and i look down at my body and i'm i'm i see my body there but i'm just as well as ever i feel fine i'm not in pain i'm not sick i'm not hurting and i look down there and see there i see my i see my wife over there and she got her hands uh her head and her hands and she's crying and i i try to say something to her and she don't hear me i begin to scream at her she can't hear me i i try to shake her and i i can't arouse her and i begin to just use profanity and everything else trying to trying to get her to notice me and she can't she can't see me and so there's a patient in the next bed and he'd been nice to us and i went over to him i got right in his face and i'm screaming at him and yelling obscenities and everything else you know you don't recognize me i'm right here i'm not dead they didn't know where i they never knew it and he said i still stepped out i was at the doorway and i heard voices calling me howard howard and i went out and i thought they were coming to take me to a surgery i need a doctor he said and he said they started taking me down a long dark corridor and it got darker and darker and darker as we went down down down and that you know we had went miles and miles and miles and miles seemed like and he says i i i was saying where are you taking me to and and you know i i needed a doctor and i need help and and and they began to laugh at him and use profanity and they began to mock him and and they and and they they're going down together and and then they began to kick him and beat him and slap him and you know he said i was a had been a football player and i i i knew i knew how to defend myself so i was jabbing back and i was kicking and i was slapping and i was trying to defend myself but there were there were hundreds of them tormented spirits that began pulling at me he said they they they began to tear me to pieces where they gouged out my eyes and pulled off my ears and they took pieces i can't even describe all the things it was so horrible he said i had never been able to tell anybody the horrible things that they did to me and i was collapsed there finally laid on the floor collapsed a piece he said just a piece like in a septic tank like my life was just a piece of garbage and he said something didn't begin to say within me pray and he said i don't know how to pray i don't pray i don't believe in god and he said come from my chest and said pray and he said i don't know even how to pray i don't know what to pray and say pray anyway and he began to pray you know he began to begin to try to remember some prayers from when he was a little boy in sunday school that he'd been taught you know and began to you know to to to say you know things like our father or god or you know our father uh you know our country trinity sweet land of liberty god you know the the mountains blew and he's trying to say anything you know he could remember that had god in it and as he would begin to speak of god he noticed that that as he called out on the names of god and spoke of him he saw them demons move back from him and he said they they began to scream even more and whatever but they began to draw back as he began to call on god and and there and i just i just took from that sometimes you don't realize the power of a believer's prayer [Music] for he said in my name i'll cast out devils in my name you'll cast out devils are you with me that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and as he began to just remember just little fragments of prayers and little things about god you know and finally you know they left him alone and he said there i was and he thought here i am i'm going to spend an endless eternity in this mess and i'm at a collapsed broken piece here and he said all of a sudden it welled up within me jesus jesus loves me and he said i i didn't believe in jesus but all of a sudden i wanted him to love me more than ever i wanted to be loved and i said jesus jesus have mercy on me and he said when i called on his name i saw a light it was a little light and as it come it got greater and greater and he he come down and he picked me up in his arms and he loved me like a mother with his child and i sobbed and i wept up on his shoulders and he said he began to take me from that place into the light and we began to pass through this like the speed of light and he said we were traveling fast because i could see light and and places and things that were just going back like blimps and all of a sudden i saw the most beautiful city let me tell you friends that was a man who was an atheist this man would then become a preacher in a secular denomination because that's what he knew but he became a christian he gave up his lifestyle the way that he lived he was changed from that moment let me tell you let me tell you if we understood even the slightest bit there was none of us would ever say go to hell it's far too easy to go to hell it requires no change of course you know we listen we were we were born with an autopilot set on hell and it's nothing to take lightly hell is the single greatest tragedy in the universe and god loves us enough to tell us in the bible the truth that there are two destinations not just one and we must choose the right path if we're going to go to heaven all roads don't lead to heaven only one does and that's jesus christ for he said no man can come to the father except by me all other roads lead to hell let me just tell you god and satan are not equal opposites neither are heaven and hell equal opposites god has no equal as a person and heaven has no equal as a place hell is not going to be a wonderful place it's going to be amazingly dull close and insignificant without company without help without god without purpose without accomplishment it won't have its it won't have its own story you won't be laughing and drinking beer and sipping wine and listening to rock music there will be no bands playing rap and rock and roll or country elvis won't be there to serenade you he'll be too wrapped up in his own awful decision of selling his birthright for popularity to comfort you yeah amen there won't be anyone to commiserate with you and to comfort you everybody will be alone in their own grief knowing they rejected life and hell is worse than the terriblest nightmare because you never wake up but i want you to consider this god determined that he would rather go to hell on our behalf than to live in heaven without you [Applause] i think that went over your head amen i want you to consider the wonderment of this god determined he would rather go to hell on our behalf than to live in heaven without you he wants oh hallelujah he wants so much for you not to go to hell he paid a horrible price on the cross that you wouldn't have to go to hell he left all of heaven the throne it's beauty it's tranquility it's peace it's wonder man it's beautiful vivid colors it's wonderful mountains it's eden he left it all to come to earth not only to redeem man but to redeem the earth and being that your body is the first of the earth he took cursed earth i want you to get this the earth had been cursed in eden because of sin is that right amen and the earth had been cursed and god took on cursed earth and came and wrapped himself in cursed earth amen oh yeah it started from a spoken word it started from from a seed but then he took that life and began to wrap little sails around it from his mother and and and things like that we talk about mary his mother but mary was an incubator amen and and he built around that seed of life from the spoken word and wrapped dust around it what kind of dust cursed earth amen one that could die on a cross one that can be tempted by sin one that could are you with me that could endure every kind of temptation known to man so he could be a faithful high priest that he can say i know what you're going through i know what your trouble is i've been there i have felt the pain i have felt your horrors i i know i know you're the to be real what it is to be rejected i know what it is to be refused and unloved i know what it is to be an outcast i know what it is to hurt [Music] i know what it is to have every kind of pain until i die with that i know what it is to go to hell and be torn to pieces like the scapegoat that would find its way in the wilderness left alone i know what it is to be left alone and without god i know what it is to be torn to pardon torn to pieces that the bible typed him as a scapegoat and in israel they would take the sins of the people and they would place it upon the goat and then they would lay take this little kid this little little baby goat and take it out into the wilderness and leave it by itself slip away from it one would one of the priests would take it out into the wilderness leave it there let it there be in the wilderness alone and all of a sudden the little kid you know looks around and he's terrified where where did he go where did he go he slipped away where is he at i'm lost i don't know my way back i can't get out of here and when he gets to scream and when he begins to scream it brings it brings the chair of predators that will come and tear him apart for sins he didn't commit and i want you to know that's what jesus did he went to hell on your behalf to be torn out to be pulled out amen are you with me amen he bore your sorrows and he bore your sin he went to hell so you don't have to go to hell amen he was rejected by god so you don't have to be rejected by god are you with me amen but all coming about that third day friend he moved from that into another he moved from that lamb to a mighty conqueror and when he rose there he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered cancer he came both hallelujah he conquered every disease known to man every temptation no demand ever sinned and he rose up on the third day the mighty congo i say hallelujah and he went there because he don't want heaven heaven would not be heaven without you [Applause] he left all of that [Applause] so that you could enjoy paradise with him he took your place as brother branham would say he took that cursed earth down to the jordan river made it obey the word and baptized it in water rose up and got filled with the holy ghost the first of a new creation so that there could be others that would be of the same resurrection he was a part of so there's a real people who will be in this real heaven with the real jesus oh well brother tim heaven is i just imagine it's just it's just a place of spirits you know um where people are just disembodied spirits yeah brother branham thought that once he thought you know their bodies can't be felt her touch but he went there he found out i can touch them they're real people and and their bodies can be felt and touch well brother tim i i don't know i think they're just spirits i mean how can people in in in real bodies like you're talking about being a real place and real mountains and we can't see it and we're not a part of it and it's up there somewhere you know just one breath away how can it be brother tim well let me tell you by the bible i know of one man in particular that's there he was raised from the dead amen the man jesus christ ascended into heaven a man in a in a physical body with a physical resurrection and is there as a physical person in a physical place he's not a spirit floating around and neither will you be you'll be in a body when stephen was departing he saw him there said i see jesus he didn't see a spirit he saw the man i see jesus standing at the father's right hand you know i i see him as the only visible manifestation of the almighty god who became tangible so there'll be real people who will be in this real heaven with jesus a real jesus a bride who'll be united with her groom strolling together with all the other saints amen of the is sharing their story hallelujah heaven won't be alone hallelujah amen but you'll be sharing your story with others how god loves you yes how special he was to you i mean sharing the memories of life together hallelujah and there is a real hell the torment of your missed opportunities will be worse than the torments of any flame you might can imagine and just as heaven is a real place hell is no fiction it's a real place i hope you never find out how real it is i hope you find out the reality of heaven but i'm telling you it depends on the choice you make that moment in his presence where you receive his life because you cannot live this sinful life there now as a sinner you have no foundation nothing to really stabilize you you say well i'll be this i'll be that i have resolved and it crumbles beneath you it's like brother branham saw his son billy paul he'd taken a shot of penicillin and was admitted to the hospital was on the verge of death dying and brother branham was away and this angel of god comes to him and says go get to billy because said what about billy what's going on he said billy is in the hospital he's dying he's on the verge of the death he goes to the hospital and the doctor says billy i didn't know he was allergic to penicillin and he's dying i've killed your boy billy and brother branham saw his boy in that condition a prophet's son you may be a preacher's daughter a deacon's daughter deacon's son preacher's daughter a preacher's granddaughter but let me tell you without christ you're tumbling down down down and sin will always take you farther than what you want to go so i i don't even want to hear about this brother to him i want to hear about heaven well let me tell you just as heaven is real hell is real also and we're not in this life to play games this earth is an intermediate place and only here can you make decisions there it'll be too late there may be cases like howard storm that that have a near-death experience but remember it was only near death and god allowed him to see where he was going and allowed him to see there was a way of escape you say i wish god would do that for me he's doing it for you this morning he does it with every gospel preacher amen for even from the verses you learned on your mother's knee he's been doing it trying to let you know god so loves you he don't want you to go there this is only the place you can make decisions there will be too late and one breath away your decisions are sealed forever too late to make a change but brother branham envisioned heaven after being there he began to talk about it in the message adoption it was right after that experience and he said i think of heaven now like this we put on this glorious body this celestial body has been made glorified and this must be in the new heavens and the new earth and he said i i can go walk over and say brother neville i you know or to one of the other brothers let's cook the papa god this morning he's god we know him now he's a savior he's a healer and he says and he said i walked up he said you know brother humes and and you unless from you and i and brother beeler some of the brothers brother neville we'll we'll go up to papa god and say we're going to take a little journey said you boys you like the mountains when you were mortal oh yeah we did well there's a couple of million miles of them out yonder and that new world just go ahead and roam over them and so it's out there roaming on the mountains god is that present because he said while they are yet speaking i'll hear that's isaiah 66 you see there's no distance you can walk slowly or you and enjoy all the sights along the way and stroll over this heaven or you can travel like a thought and so he said you know we walking along we've been walking along as brothers now 500 years or so maybe just a little journey maybe a million don't make any difference he said now that sounds crazy but it's the truth there's no time it's all eternity and as we're walking along we we meet somebody out there and we see it's sister georgie bruce and say well sister george had been a long time since i've seen you but she looks just like she did always she's timeless she might maybe it's 10 million years old but just as young as she ever was and she'd be scratching somebody on the back and i'd look there and there's sheet of the line and i said how are you this morning sheeta my meow's like a kitten sister bruce says well i've been down there talking to some those sisters down there around them big flowers down there we've been down there probably 500 years looking around now that's the way he's envisioned in heaven so what bless your heart sister georgie no harm can come nothing knowledge and in the evening time we'll go on top of the mountain and we'll say oh papa god i once was lost i was once in the month of sin papa god and you saved me hallelujah amen you said you talk about worship the angels don't even know how to worship like that i was lost and you left all of heaven for me he never did that for one angel but he did it for you god so loved you he left all of heaven so you wouldn't have to go to hell and he went and took on hell so you wouldn't have to go there amen what a mighty god this is brother brandon said you ever think of hell he said it's like the old colgate dump just smoked stinkiest place i ever smelled laying there look at that old smoke so sick in your stomach turning inside out like after taking casserole sick as you can be and rats running all over you and trying to eat on you he said and that's the best of this life think of that like an old call colgate dump smelly stinky a dump rats running all over vermin of all kinds you sick as you can be those rats are diseases cancers coveted viruses flu tuberculosis measles whooping cough diabetes they they attack you they pull at your body until it can't hold life any longer you look at brother charlie you know he fought and he fought and thought he'd get healed and get better and get healed and get better and then and finally he gets to a place his body can't sustain life any longer and god's got a better healing for him just one breath into a new body where none of these rats come where they're out of the reach of devils old age infirmities all perfection you see god took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and he put it in his album he took a picture of you at your best hey that wasn't here in this life because the best of his life is a colgate dump amen we're all falling apart i read brother adam saying the other day he said if you're past 25 you're dying said you live until then you get stronger and better better by about 25 you start dying you start on your way down some of them was was born with imperfections and and and and problems and infirmities we were born that way we we've never had one little smack of perfection but just think of that in this moment god took a picture of you before the foundation of the world at your best not what you are now what was in his mind what he saw you in the future amen totally well healed delivered beautiful perfect no start human beings no messed up emotions no trauma from people abandoning you and and the wrong things done to you and and the scars on your memory none of that gone at your best and god has determined that through death to develop the picture where you will be back what he had in his mind of you before sam ever come on the world hallelujah and he put you in his family album and i'm going to tell you you're going to be everything he thought of you hallelujah without sickness without sin without trouble without hurt without pain without a wounded spirit without mental conditions whooping cough diseases rats cancers pull at your body till it can't hold life any longer you get real old and you can't help yourself i marvel i watch strong men with such athletes be pulled down to the dust feeble need somebody to help them across the room tottering in their steps and you think about that in that condition and somebody reached down and turned you back to an 18 year old boy and set you on top of the mountain a bloom of health and and with a good breath of fresh air and a good cold drink of water would you ever want to go back to that dump anymore charlie wants no part of this earth that we're living in he don't want no part of this stinky dirty rat infested horrible place [Music] one breath all of that went away young beautiful he got ushered to the other side the bible said angels come and carry them there i go to prepare a place for you and it's almost finished i'm telling you it's almost finished the last one to go there before they come back here is just about made it over you hear what i'm saying the last one can you imagine can you imagine that last one i think about the man on the cross who went and asked jesus for for pardon and he said this day you'll be with me in paradise right amen and there he recognized who he was the son of god and said have mercy on me when you come into your kingdom and he said this day i'll be with you in paradise amen and i can imagine now he is the last one of the old testament to enter into paradise before the messiah comes are you with me a thief an unworthy man but pardoned in the last moment that's why i say never give up because god is the god rich in mercy and the last one comes in the last one you say the last one of the old testament saints go there i can almost see him in my mind running down the corners screaming knocking on the doors and say brothers he's coming i just saw him on the cross paying for your sins and my sin and he's about to empty this place and take us into the presence of god hallelujah one day the last one will cross over and when they do they'll come right back up and appear to the saints and we which are alive and remain will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i go to prepare a place for you and i will come again and receive you to myself that where i am there you may be also because heaven won't be heaven to me unless you're there let the musicians come this is the last warning there will never be another brother branham says the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramids he stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared or watched breathlessly as for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells the story of amazing grace and jesus love she's a city prepared for prepared people she awaits only her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over amelia would you bow your head for a moment if this is the last message from jesus himself to the laodicean messenger don't turn your heart and if don't turn your heart there nothing else come in that will if this message don't turn your heart back to believing there's nothing that we all god has said jesus said i will meet you in a designated place he told them then i have a designated place for you because i'm fixing to come again in the form of the holy ghost it's the upper room i want you to be there but there's a designated place for this age i'll meet you in the air i'm glad to be a part of a church that still believes that the real true church of the living god we're waiting for that change to come we've been changed on the inside one glorious day will be changed on the outside our bodies will match what happened in our soul when he resurrected us from death to life the resurrected people being with jesus in resurrected bodies on a resurrected earth i want you to look at your own life today and you judge within yourself are you ready for that do you know him are you just going through life a little bit frivolously foolishly surprising and drunkiness and cares in this life it'll come on you like a trap you don't know what hour it could be upon you [Music] just one second your life can change you'll be faced with eternity are you ready to meet him do you know him has he changed your life as he resurrected you from dead works to serve the living god have you died to sin and resurrected anew in him become a new creation has that change been in you let him change you today in his presence oh brother tim you all preached about heaven for years yeah you preached about the rapture for years and he ain't come yet well he came from my wife about six months ago and our last conversation that i had with her she's laying the hospital about to go in icu as darkness was beginning to cover over her brain coming over her she would enter into where the blood would come through her body through her brain there we would have our last conversation i'd say karen i don't know i said you know a year ago we were at this very same spot in the month of june same way right in the same hospital doctors said you were gonna die they didn't give you any hope two o'clock in the morning at the ambulance and whisk you away i sit in my living room my son timothy our son timothy and i

45 years of marriage i said we've had 45 years of marriage no regrets she said i have no regrets i've had a good life as a karen i know i remember that day when you was a young girl 17 years old and god filled you with the holy ghost i was preaching in that sermon the holy spirit moved and god filled you with his presence and i know i know the answer but i want to hear you say it you would just help me are you ready to meet the lord she looked at me without fear without worry without fretting without questioning without quibbling she said yes tim i'm ready to meet him just a few weeks later

washington down to louisiana six o'clock in the morning a man came walking in my room i was awake he'd come walk in my room holding a paper it was a an official document he held it out for me to take
