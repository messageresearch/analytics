to put it back on so amen god bless you if you'll turn with me in your scriptures again this morning i'd like to turn with genesis chapter 22 and i'd like to continue where we are we're we're at part three now and uh destined to fulfill and we are destined to fulfill i i understand in every age they were destined to fulfill a part but we're destined to fulfill if you remember brother branham said if a man was allowed to pick and i'm just going to paraphrase here to pick what age that he would want to live in prophet if he would pick what age that he would have liked to have been a part of they would have picked this age and so the seat that you're sitting in is a very coveted seat because the saints that are waiting on us on the other side they they went through different things and they lived out their parts and they lived out their lives but they would have loved to lived in this age because it's in this age we'll see the resurrection and it's in this age that we'll see the rapture and one of our devotions this morning said don't be discouraged about everything that you see around you there's good news he's coming hallelujah so i got good news to announce to you he's coming everything you see here is temporary he's coming amen genesis 22 and verse 8 and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of the heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fierce god sin thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beho and behold and beheld a ram caught in the thicket by his thorns and abraham went and took the lamb and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the place jehovah jireh and as it was said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself i have sworn saith the lord for because thou has not has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice verse 17 i'd like to of you to put your finger on it i want you to read it with me again that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand that which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy it's talking about you and i want you to remember who's talking god he had you in his mind when abraham was on that mountain amen let's just pray lord jesus you see the needs that are among us even now father lord i ask you that you would touch our hearts lord anoint this vessel as we speak the word of life i pray that you bring us strength father you know that i need strength in my body this morning and lord you're the sustainer you're preserver of my life and lord i ask you that you would touch them the many needs that have came in brother robert douglas that said very sick this morning and lord the many that are out here i remember brother kahn that caught that that that writes me every week and his sister her name i believe is grace lord that she has a brain tumor and lord i just asked you that you'd send your word and lord lord send your word and heal do a work for it in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen amen i i love how our prophet puts this and i just want to read it and i just want you just to absorb it and he's speaking he says it and he showed him on a hillside where those pieces represented now any bible scholar here knows that each one of those was a clean animal that represented the sacrifice of jesus christ he was a ram he was a heifer that was made made the waters of separation when you had waters of separations through now we have a washing by the water of the word of the separation from sin and he said through the word through believing he said the pigeon and the eternal love was the divine healing and all was in christ and there god showed abram what he was doing going to do that through the seed of isaac he would bring forth his only begotten son christ was slain yonder between heavens and earth and when the sun went down in the blackness over the earth and there he tore him apart he said pulled his soul out of him and he rode a covenant with the families of the earth here's a man with a with a very low education but he's speaking eternal poetic justice if we could i want to just read it he said christ was slaying yonder between heavens and earth when the sun went down the blackness over the earth and there he tore him apart and god pulled his soul out of him and wrote a covenant with the families of the earth i'm one of them i identify myself as one of them brother mike when that precious unadulterated blood of almighty god dripping from emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out of him and he says my my he said why thou why hast thou forsaken me he says forgive me he says my god my god why hast thou forsaken me his face was full of mockery and spit a crown of cruelty mockery pulled down over his brow and his nails drove in the roman spikes his back riven until his ribs showed through swinging on a cross screaming dying a sinner's death the sin of the world was upon him and there was god riven his side tore his soul out of him and when he said into my hands i commit my spirit and he dropped his head and the and the whole earth shook and belched out its rocks think about those statements the whole earth shock there it is there's god's fulfillment there's god's fulfilling of it all he quotes the quote mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bled his bowed his head and died the opening veiled the way to heaven's joys and endless days oh calvary old calvary jesus bled and died for me then he tore his soul out of his own son and separated a covenant throwed the body into the ground and it laid there for three days and nights rose up for it was not possible that my holy one should seek eruption are you with me that it might be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled are you with me now that even our lives might be fulfilled in him are you with me we were the reason we were the reason never let it get past you we were the reason that he went to calvary's cross we were the reason that he went to be beat like no other man was ever beat all hell taken its vengeance out on him but remember by his stripes we are healed today we have a covenant with god not a covenant with man not a covenant with a president but a covenant with god by his stripes every devil in hell is defeated every sickness is defeated by his stripes that's greater than any union contract that's greater than any government between peace treaties in geneva that's a covenant with god a covenant between heaven and hell and it's for his children hallelujah god was fulfilling his own word are you with me now he was a kind of god that he would fulfill his own word he's not just expecting you to fulfill it but he fulfilled his own word in a prepared body in a prepared vessel now you are also that kind of prepared body a prepared temple that god wants to live in and he so prepares you until he he begins to deal with your life and you repent of your sins no i'm not turning up over a new leaf or changing a changing of the way that you do things like you do your diet but you get washed by the blood of jesus christ you truly repent to never go back again now let me just say this you many people are sorry but they keep going back but if you truly repent you never return back to that ever again many people say well i can't get rid of this habit or that habit it's because you're still in love with it you'll never get rid of something that you're still in love but if you ever come to a spot in your life that you realize that's your enemy [Applause] that's your enemy and it's destroying you you get rid of it the scripture says in hebrews chapter 11 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report every one of them were destined to fulfill their part and listen many times they they absolutely had to walk by the revelation of faith they didn't have a book about themselves but they had to trust god now watch this through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which were seen were not made of things which do appear understand there's a principle to it time intercepts intercepts with prophecy the word circles the earth for hundreds of years and then there comes a day to where that prophecy has to be fulfilled now think about for 2000 years people have been looking for the coming of the lord but because your name was in the book because your name was in the book and you had to be displayed on the earth and expressed martin luther would have loved to sing the rapture john wesley would have loved to sing the rapture but because your name was in the book god would not close the door and say a lot and i have no more but god allowed time to evolve let me just say the rapture rapture's absolutely on time it'll absolutely be on time oh i'm looking for the expectation of the rapture that should be in our heart wherefore comfort one another with these words but there will come a day when time and prophecy will intercept the word becomes reality we just spoke it a couple of days ago or it just seemed like a couple days ago here what a service it'll be when our loved ones are standing in this building witnesses from the other side standing here with us we won't have to preach we'll rejoice can you imagine the stage being filled with the musicians that have went on before can you imagine this stage with brother homer in a new body time will intercept with prophecy it's not just some illusion of hollywood or some or somewhere another that is going to be an hour that's going to happen we must press forward regardless of who's president regardless of the economic conditions regardless of what's going on in the world we must keep our focus on the fulfillment of the word of the hour that's our focus today brother man said these who are the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated the foreknown of god we're in the mind of god and his thoughts and very plain language in the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until they came forth in a designed designated decreed season as each member came forth it's expressed and it took its place in the body that's the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride now i i the reason i read that quote because it's so powerful we get so excited about squirrels being spoken we get so excited about squirrels coming into existence when there was no squirrels we get so excited about storms being held back but do you know that just as much as squirrels earth storms sun moon and stars god has watched over you in your designated season are you now you're expressed in this body you couldn't gather yourself here he gathered you it was like a great magnet that gathered you to the word and when you heard it it was like nothing you ever heard before hallelujah and it was life it was just life maybe someone sitting beside if you heard it didn't mean anything to him absolutely didn't mean anything to him but it meant something to you because god placed something in you what's the difference predestination it's not a dirty word it's not a dirty word it's predestination that doesn't mean fatalism that predestinations god thought of you before the foundation of the world and if you ever were in his mind you still are i just speak to a lady the other day in a service in ohio and she was sitting there and her husband was speaking to brother branham on the phone and he says brother brother branham would you like to tell her tell her happy birthday he said i sure would so brother branham got on the phone with her and he said he called her by name and i'm not going to do that today but he called her by name and he says i think i could give you a really nice birthday present he said i saw you there [Music] that makes the rest of your trials in life very very uh seem a whole lot easier kind of puts a little air under your wings doing it hallelujah you know i i've had several to to to write me and tell me that they had dreams and it would be dreams of seeing others from that other side and and they would send a message to me brother ron you're well thought of there that makes the storm a little be a little bit better hallelujah hallelujah don't you understand just now where you say well that's just a little far-fetched brother ron but i'm just telling you i'm i'm i'm destined this journey is from point a to point b are you with me and my focus there may be a lot of curves along the road but my focus is on the in journey and i'm trying to tell you you're there too when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time are they all branhams he said no they're your converts and he says well i preached what paul preached i preached what peter preached and we screamed we're resting on that [Music] hallelujah i i just read to you about abraham abraham literally is mentioned in almost every chapter of the bible every book in the bible let me say it like that so i don't go too far but there are other people that live an entire life and maybe one out of a million their name gets called in the scriptures let me just share a couple with you in genesis chapter 3 and verse 31 and after him was shamgar the son of aid which slew of the fist philistines 600 men with an ox goat which is a six foot and he also delivered israel of all the bible his name is mentioned in there in revelations chapter 2 and verse 13. and i know thy works what a horrible age this was and where thou dwellest even where satan's seed is and thou hold us fast my name and has not denied the faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where's satan dwelleth i'd like for hell to listen to that today right in the middle of hell's sink in the stronghold god had a believer in that age that was faithful and would not deny it hallelujah let me just say i i felt supercharged this morning as i begin to think about i'm standing and preaching to the most powerful people on the earth [Music] living in the darkest age that there's ever been brother branham himself could not look past 77 because it was so dark we've become accustomed with sodom's conditions and sodom's age and the world falling apart but in the midst of all of it there's a bride around the world that refuses to give up refuses to turn back she is identified with this message and she's not ashamed of it numbers chapter 14 and verse 24. but my faithful servant caleb i'd like for my name to be mentioned there i'd like for god to say ron spencer was faithful not only doing this by example i'm not puffing myself up or i'm not trying to get you to look at me i'm trying to get you to look at him but i want you to put your name there my faithful servant put your name right there my faithful servant oh you are to be louder than that my faithful servant because he hath another spirit with him when everybody else is saying the giants are too big we can't go he was standing there said we're more than able we're possessors of the land he was reaching back to abraham's seat abraham isaac jacob the children of israel i'm one of them i identify myself as one of them listen if a gentile can identify himself as one of them we ought to be able to stand and say i'm one of them like never before romans paul says it like this i beseech you therefore brethren romans 12 and 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is a reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god god will have people in every generation that will be the banner of what his expectation is now let me just be real clear we are the final voice to the final age and when we get that in our heart our job becomes even greater we're the final representatives the final witnesses to the final age and if you can't see that america has fallen apart you're not looking you're not the only one watching they are fulfilling scripture they're fulfilling the prophecy they are proving brother branham's message to be right are you with me listen you say well brother ron i don't know if brother brown's message is right just watch the news every day they are proven this message is right they have no moral conduct about themselves men's minds insanity every day children is murdered every day there's just incredible phenomenal sins that are abundant among us our politics is rotten to the core and i'm talking about all of them 2024 is not going to be the answer for america jesus is the only answer for america [Applause] we are at the end of the gentile dispensation it's going to switch to the jews and they are under expectation to get two prophets let me just drop back here for a minute i'm not going to get done today probably four or five and six is going to come but let me just say this to you in this age it had to be developed to where those two prophets could be seen around the world and preach the message that you have been listening to for decades they're going to preach the same message that was sent to the gentiles is going to be sent to the jews it was seals to the gentiles it's trumpets to the jews [Applause] are you with me now they are going to see the messiah signs moses and elijah will stand on the scene and preach the jesus christ of 2000 years ago and to testify to them that they were he was crucified the lamb of god he will show them their ignorance down through the ages and open their eyes just as much as this message is hated by the gentiles they will be hated because of the message of the hour not because of who they are but they will be hated for the message of the hour in so much so until they will be slain in the street you live in an age to where the world can see it on their iphone there was not another age that could see it like this but god allowed the tree of knowledge to open itself hell opened it and enlarged itself to where two prophets could stand and preach and just as much oh there's millions of jews but there's some select seed there there's some select seed there that are destined to fulfill that 144 000 and the seed that is on the inside of them respond to the message of their hour like it has responded to you [Applause] hallelujah we are not under expectation to fulfill and build an ark that's not our expectation we're not building carts to carry the ark of the covenant on that's not our expectation we are not going to be hung on a cross nailed with hands and thorns put in our heads that's not our part of our fulfillment are you with me but we are in the age to where a message came forth [Applause] and something on the inside of us responded some of us were called to be preachers some of us be called to be be this and that in your life but god anoints every one of us to be believers brother brown said there's three kind of believers in every church make believer unbeliever and real believers but i want you to understand that don't seal you into exactly where you are some of you were make believers but you became real believers some of you were unbelievers at one stage of your life but you became real believers thank god for his mercy thank god for his grace or if i could just get a glimpse of heaven i think our messenger has did that for us last night we got a little glimpse of hell it's a place where everybody's naked everybody's in their old bodies that they see and then everybody has stood the judgment let me just say this you i do not want to stand before an angry god where there's no negotiator there for me or no lawyer no perpetuation for me because of choices that i've made in my life and turned my back and walked over the blood of jesus christ for 40 50 70 years come on church everybody's destined to go somewhere we talked about marilyn monroe last night we talked about the rich young ruler we talked about even elvis presley we talked about other people patsy cline and other people that we could that we can name sold the birthright so the birthright brother branham talks about preachers that were around him that would sell their birth life one named demon shakarian and he would sell pentecostal into the charismatic and to the catholic church and blend them together it produced seed the kardashians are the grandchildren of fallen children are you with me to show you how bad that got until one of them her husband of another race that wants to become a preacher and she don't want nothing to do with him then he wants to become a president she don't want nothing to do with him she don't want to do anything to do with god can you imagine that's only a couple of generations are you with me now i know you get quiet here for a minute but just stay with me listen it's the same as when wesley was here those modern methodists those methodists when the revival hit they danced they shouted they were anointed of the holy ghost they were slain in the spirit for hours and that move went around the world but men denominated that system [Music] men denominated that system and jesus dead and dry as she can be and today she's one of the leaders of sodom and gomorrah in pulpits john wesley if he could raise up he would be put out of their church you might as well preach with me it's gonna get good here in just a minute the modern pentecost of azusa street that burning flames that was in in in california that rose up and it went around the world and god allowed speaking in tongues and the flowing of the spirit of god you talk about a mighty revival god's not going to turn us back to azusa street he's turning us back to acts 2. and as a matter of fact it's not a turning back it's a going forward because god's not regressing he's going progressing all right catching my breath i'm in a fight with a bad boy i'm going to win but men denominated men denominated that system brother management used a statement he said how can we preserve what we got they tried to preserve yesterday's manna listen and there's churches set all over the world trying to feed on yesterday's manna and it produces death listen i'm not being judgmental here but by their fruits you'll know them by your fruits your no i know there's a redeemed that'll come out of all of that but let me just say this to you they denominated and death got among them now their churches is full of cross-dressers if if wigglesworth could come back and preach to them let me just pick one if wigglesworth let me get two if charles feeney could walk back into his church and see what has been produced for all of these years i'm going somewhere now if they could see what they have done with all of their boards and all of their economical movements they could not identify with what was there charles spurgeon who was one of the greatest preachers ever lived his own church don't want nothing to do with him his own school said we do not want to be identified with charles spurgeon one of the greatest preachers that ever lived his own school that he worked so hard to produce the cathedral that he worked so hard to build collected money for decades to build that cathedral that would seat six thousand and every service he preached 12 000 people would show up and then they would fill the outside of the building and he would stand and preach and now they don't want nothing to do with him they don't want nothing to do with him i say this to you what a shame if i could talk to the president of that school let me just say i'm not bothered by people who they are i'm not a tim intimidated by offices i'm not intimidated by men i serve a living god i worked at a company 4 800 employees when i was a young man i was younger than you and i said lord i want to witness to every person that i can in this bill in this in this arsenal and one day i prayed god help me to be able to get to a spot to where that i can witness to the president of this company 4 800 employees no way could i just walk into his office do you know god worked it out to where i was able to walk into his office and satan speak we became friends and i introduced the message of the hour to him let me just say this you the witness and the power of the candle of light cannot be put out in our lives we are focused we've had men even in the message and i'm just gonna i don't never do this but i'm just going to do this that don't want music being played you know where they brought that from their old dead lutheranism they didn't get that from the message they brought that from their dead lutheranism they don't want a pair of drums in their church you know where they brought that from their old dad lutheranism listen drums were played in the in the house of god in david's day they played on drums and high sounding symbols we are only fulfilling the word of god the reason churches are dead is because they've got an ice maker for a pastor ice makers produce ice cubes i do not want ice cubes sitting all over this building dead it's zero 40 below zero i want people from fire for god but we'll come here to worship god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] well we don't speak in tongues no more we don't want any of that we're we've grown up we've matured we don't want prayer lines we don't want all of those things we don't want all those emotions the reason men preach like that is because they don't have the holy ghost themselves [Music] and if you don't believe in the product you can't sell it come on church but it's in the bible it is the fulfillment of the word of god this bride will be born of his own life of his life power of his power if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bribe [Music] if there was miracles in his day there'll be miracles in our day if he could live it in his day we can live it in our day hallelujah hallelujah i'm talking about it it's for you it's for you it's your inoculation [Applause] i could care less whether you get the covered shot or not that's up to you i don't want to hear your arguments that's up to you but there is an inoculation that i do want you to get it's an acts 2 experience where god repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children as many as are far off as many as the lord our god shall call okay you got an inoculation okay here we go it will prevent you from being dead in laodicea it'll prevent you from being cold it'll prevent you from worryism it'll give you a thirst a thirst for the word of god it'll give you a hunger for the word of god you hear brother branham say oh how we need in jeffersonville tonight thousands of lived voices that's the kind that shakes the devil let me just say they needed it in jeffersonville they really need it now but we need it in grottos in elkton you need it across the mountain in madison god sent you to be a light you may be one in a hundred thousand people but god put you in the midst of darkness brother donnie satan offered you a whole lot of things and tried to mar your life but he put you in the midst of darkness that little white light shining out that little gray-headed man shining out he could have been this and he could have been that he could have been there but there was a seed on the inside of him that kept pulling him it was more than mom and daddy it was more than another day's revival he needed his own revival [Music] can you imagine how many sermons you preach you sisters preach walking down the aisles of food line more than your dress there's a lot of people dressed like you more than your dress but your atmosphere there's one thing that you can't put on this atmosphere and god will not stay on a contaminated vessel god won't live in a hypocrite's life and i'll tell you what a real believer's got the real atmosphere and they got an incredible attitude they're they're full of joy they're full regardless of what you're going through in your life let me just say if the experience of difficulties of your life has robbed you of your joy hey god dealt with me to stop right here just for a minute let me just stop here just for a moment this may be somebody on the internet if you have been robbed of your joy and your life because of the circumstances of life has has bound you whether it's physical or financial or whatever situation it is if you have become backslidden in your spirit to where your prayer life is gone come on i feel like the hounds of hell wanting to run at me right now bring it on i know where i'm standing now but too many people sat in church pews backslidden got no joy got no praise listen your difficulties ought to cause you to praise him more than ever before if you can't do nothing but move your finger move your finger if all you're doing is thinking about negative things turn the bottle upside down get yourself full of faith [Applause] well that was page one jesus knows what it is like to have a headache because his head was crowned with thorns jesus knows what it's like to be hungry he went without food for 40 days jesus knows what it's like to be slandered or abandoned because on the cross he screams my god my god why hast thou forsaken me jesus willingly experienced this kind of desolation jesus knows what it's like to be a refugee to have to flee his own homeland to live under oppression of a government he sure did they had to flee egypt to say flee to egypt to save jesus his life he lived under roman empire under a an oppressive government let me just say this right here these refugees that are coming they're coming to a place that they believe is a better place than where they were at and whether you remember this or not you were one at one day we were all refugees at one time i'm not talking about necessarily you i'm talking about your forefathers so don't get yourself so tied up in the news until you become anti all of this different kind of stuff you too were a refugee you too jesus was a refugee i'm honestly one now i don't feel comfortable here no more and i really want to go but i really want you to go with me connie'll grabbed me some night she said you're not going you're not going tonight i uh you're staying here till i go with you hallelujah hallelujah jesus knows what it's like to suffer in fact he suffered many more than any of us ever will jesus know what it's like to weep and mourn he wept over jerusalem his own country let me just say this don't you get yourself so discouraged when you get rejected turned down you feel that little funny feeling they just don't want me here they didn't want jesus they did not want jesus i'm going somewhere here in just a minute jesus knows the pain of grief when he come to the tomb of his friend lazarus he wept remember what brother brahm said he wept because of their unbelief that's what he would have really wept he knew he had the power to raise him back up but they didn't believe he had the power he had preached to them all this time and their faith was arisen to a spot that they could believe in jesus that could raise their their friend lazarus up what about the jesus that can change our bodies what about that jesus that'll change our bodies jesus knows jesus knows what hurt hands are feet or burned or have your flesh torn or your heart broken look at what jesus went through and the agony of the garden the carrying of the cross being mocked being spat upon having nails driven through his hands and his feet then scourged terribly the lord suffered more than the lord suffered more than any of us could ever imagine christ took our place on the cross that it might be fulfilled did he not fulfill that i'm not going to get done so i just want to share some words that just mean a lot to me i thought about this this morning if spurgeon couldn't go back to his own school and to his own church imagine how rejected he would feel if john wesley wouldn't be welcomed at the modern methodist church that would be called a relic your grandfather sister cassie i sat on the bed with him not long before he left and he looked in my eyes and he said what you have is truth and he's very sincere with that he said but i'm the last of the flickering flame where i'm at and his words were this and i've never shared this he said i feel like a relic my own church all of that just kept coming to me this morning as i was preparing i thought about brother hormer if he would come back on resurrection morning i believe if he could look across the realm and see andrew dancing andrew with that one finger out shuffling his feet behind the pulpit just like he did holding on just like he did watching matthew watching you worship this building many are gone because of sickness and then because of a meeting but this building full the dancing of the the spirit of the lord is still welcome here brother brown's message is still welcome here i believe he could stand here and be extremely proud of what he sees i'd say there's a lot of places brother branham wouldn't be welcome i'd say there's a lot of places that he wouldn't be welcome but i want you to know he would be welcome here [Applause] i literally feel like two realms is coming together this morning i feel like i'm standing in a very very special place i really feel that way i feel like i'm standing in a very special place i close with these words when god spoke out of heaven over jesus he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell i'd like for that to be fulfilled in our lives that god would testify this is my beloved son daughters that i'm well pleased to dwell in let's stare god bless you god bless you god bless you hallelujah i want you to turn to your neighbors it's been good to be in the house of the lord it's been really good it's been really good hallelujah what a day that will be could i sing out with you before brother matthews [Music] i'm not i'm not andrew maybe we should have connie saying that's where he must have got it from amen oh what a day that will be [Music] me by his grace [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] let's just worship him a moment [Music] is the space [Music] oh [Music] shall [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] hallelujah won't you just take your wife by the hand and sing it now [Music] is [Music] me by his grace [Music] glorious [Music] that we day just take a course again one more time before brother matt takes [Music] i shall see [Music] takes me [Music] oh [Music] that we'll be listening
