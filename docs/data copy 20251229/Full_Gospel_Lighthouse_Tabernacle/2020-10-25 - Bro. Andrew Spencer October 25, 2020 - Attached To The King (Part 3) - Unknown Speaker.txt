four hundred yards to get around with bushes and things getting up and said we'd have prayer meeting up there and said i thought i was really a christian he said i know all the bible i studied all the hebrew i studied all the right pronunciations of the words and said anybody walk up to me i could talk to him like that about the bible i know what i was talking about he said one night i was going up

good thing you just wait a little while it says as i walked up the hill and i come up a man came up the hill and said he had a bundle on his back that was way bigger than a man and said he was just a

would cover them with your wings i pray that the peace that passes all understanding would cover them father lord the kelly family the kreger family father lord you see all the people lord jesus lord i think about the the closing hours of your ministry here on earth when your disciples were getting ready to go through something that they had never went through they were going to have to walk alone without you but you give them these words that i will be your comforter now where i am i am making a place for you to come father we we see lord jesus at this hour that you have prepared for us to bring forth the word in this hour lord we look forward to these moments lord because we realize that something special is at work lord we we sense the nearness of the presence of the lord just now lord i believe that you're very pleased lord to feel that anointing father to come and overshadow us lord it's worth more than life just to hear one word from you to feel that touch lord i pray that you'd move us past our thinking move us past ourselves today lord i pray that you come in a very special way lord i i ask that you just take me for a moment kind of set me down in a corner lord and use my body lord one more time i yield my members to you in order to do service for the king one word from you this morning one in word name we pray amen amen we have your bibles this morning let's turn over to the book of first john chapter four and verse one praise the lord everybody i'd like to speak to you again on attach to the king now satan has done his absolute worst to keep us from being attached to this king but we didn't start this so we can't finish it he didn't start it so he can't finish it but our lord jesus started this attachment and he is the one that will finish it and accomplish his work first john 4 and 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come even now already is it in the world year of god little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world do you believe that this morning the greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god and he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error may god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the lord amen i read over this just a few days ago and i'd like to share it with you if there ever was a time now the bible says in no number 16-48 that he that he stood between those who had died and those who were still alive and the plague stopped now was the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country so wrote charles weller in 1867 as a simple exercise in warming up his fingers for using his new feigned angled invention called the typewriter little could he have known how perpetually relevant his spontaneous and unadorned sentence would be through the decades if ever there was a time for we who profess faith in christ who are by his own pronouncement the salt of the earth the light of the world a city set on the hill it is now if there ever was a time to let our light so shine before men that they might see our good works and glorify our father in heaven it is now if there ever was a time to do all things without murmuring and disputing so that we might be blameless harmless or sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a wicked and perverse generation it is now if there ever was a time for the redeemed of the lord to do to say so it is now if there ever was a time to stir up the gift that is in us no longer ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor drawing back for fear of rejection and ridicule it is now if there ever was a time to hold fast the prophet the the pattern of sound words standing in the grace of christ and enduring hardship as a good soldier it is now if there ever was a time to shun profane and vain babblings to flee the youthful lust it is now and if there ever was a time for diligence in presenting our case for christ with dignity it is now if there ever was a time for private piety to become a public virtue it is now now is the time for all good men and women all good boys and girls to come to the forefront of faith and show the power of christ's gospel through lives marked with love and faithfulness will you be among those who stand up in this day when so many bow down to lesser gods will you show up speak up pray up stay up step up so these in your sphere of influence can hear see know and understand and believe that jesus christ is the son of the living god if there ever was a time it is now if there ever was a time for the bride to shine it is now if there ever was a time for miracles it's now if there ever was a time for healings it's now if there ever was a time to be refilled with the holy ghost it is now if there ever was a time if you've been going through life and you've been holding out a little bit now's the time not to hold back right now in the world of sports there is a there is a series that is going on it's called the world series and they're playing a game of seven the best of seven games and right now they're in a deadlock and they're looking to see who's the best in the world in the mlb and what they're doing now they may have held back some things in the first two games or the third game but in the oncoming games they've got to play out every game to find out who's the best in the world now that's how they set up how they're going to find out who's the best in the world but they are no longer holding back if they were holding back a good picture they're no longer holding him back no more if they're holding back or if they're holding back a certain batter they're no longer holding him back no more they're letting him loose because this is the time for them and if there ever was a time for you to show up in this hour it's now the time if there ever was a time for you as sons and daughters of god to show on what side you're attached to whether you're attached to the king of chaos or you're attached to the king of peace it's now the time for you to show up you can sit back there and you can think well i'm all alone and i don't see nobody else i don't go out but once a week what's it gonna matter what the world sees of me i only go out to church one time a week i go to the grocery store one time a week there is a king that's got his eye on his children and see where that attachment's at and he sees when you're standing he sees when you're sitting he knows what side you're taking on you ain't gotta cast your vote at a ballot box jesus knows what side you're on jesus knows what you're going through jesus understands hallelujah the bible says in romans 8 and 5 for they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god is that right but ye are not in the flesh look at your neighbor say i see you but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you hallelujah the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you if there's anything that happens here today it's because the spirit of him if there's healings that happen here today it's because the spirit of him if there's deliverance that happens here today it's because the spirit of him are you with me if you get a body change today it's because the spirit of him if you start seeing your loved one sister charlie you start seeing your daddy walk down the street it's because the spirit of him if you are seen as an overcomer of laodicea it's because the spirit of him whoo somebody give the lord a hand clapper praise hey amen amen amen amen amen i remember one time a story of a little cockney in england he was just an ordinary man and they said that the king one of the kings in the early days was going into his palace and this he had no one he had a message that he had to get forth an urgent message because of the enemy and so he had said to this little fella standing there he said here take this message take this message and hurry to a certain place and command this to be done and he said here take my scepter in your hand that'll vindicate you you're sent from me and he stuck it under his robe and he went and the guards everywhere stopping him and everybody else yelling get away i have a message of the king i'm the king's messenger a vindicated word and i thought satan get out of my way i have the king's message and i must go and one time when they killed the prince of peace and put him in the grave and sealed up the tomb and death held him for three days and nights but on easter morning he had that scepter in his hand and he hollered get away death get away grave open up i am the king's message i must come forth to prove this resurrection i am the resurrection and i am the life hallelujah if that don't make you feel good i don't know what will but if you are a part of him and the spirit of him dwells in you you are packing the king's message and that word that is in your mouth is the king's word and where the word of a king is there is power this is not your message this is the king's message and the king's message will vindicate you you can take this message you can run with this message you can live with this message you can live by this message you can die by this message you can separate from me and you can separate from your pastor but if you separate from this message you have separated yourself from the king of life you can walk away from me you can walk away from my friends you can walk away from this ministry but you walk away from this message you have walked away from eternal life i know that there's some people that don't like that kind of thinking but without this message there is no rapture this message will put you into a body change [Applause] you remember that story brother bannon would tell about that chief engineer that that that that man was having trouble with his car and he took it into a little mechanic he took it in there and that mechanic tried putting it on every different test he put it on a generator he put plugs in he did everything just to see if he could get that car going you remember the story he tried his very best but then there came in a fine dress man and he told him he said sir why don't you try to doing this and the mechanic turned around to him and he said who are you he said i'm the chief engineer i'm the one that designed it i'm the one that designed it you see he knew that it would work because he had designed it that way oh hallelujah brother branham said our there was a well-dressed man one day that knew who this body was he designed it in such a way that he knows it's going to work he knows what it takes to make you rapture ready he's well dressed in his promises he's well dressed in resurrection he's well dressed in power surely he knows how to get you over there oh bless the lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits whoo hallelujah you can say satan get out my way satan get out of my way i have a message from the king whoa they couldn't stop life 2 000 years ago and if he ain't dead now how's he going to stop him again you can line up every devil in hell you want to and the vision has already been spoken you can't stop us i know satan loves hearing that from you why don't you tell him satan you can't stop us hallelujah brother nathan when you go out you could go and maybe tell your football team and say hey the other teams they're gonna they're gonna battle against us but they can't stop us now they might look you in the natural and you think they'll think man we have a losing record i don't know what the record will be this coming spring whatever you play but you could say they could say well we've got a losing record but you could say i'm not talking about this team i'm talking about team jesus that ain't never lost to battle he's never lost and he don't know what the word defeat is jesus now now now jesus told us in john 14 and 12 and we're very familiar with this scripture that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also in greater works than these shall he do because i go into my father but i want to read this to you from the passion translation just to give you a view of it it says i tell you this timeless truth that the person who follows me in faith believing in me will do the same mighty miracles that i do even greater miracles than miracles than these because i go to be with my father that the person that follows me in faith will do the same mighty miracles that i do in your community you will do great miracles are you with me you're going to do some spectacular things there is a vision of you in this hour where you are going to take a body change now jesus said you do as i do and the most incredible part about that command is that it comes with an a with a power and an authority to live it out jesus doesn't just say to you and that you can just he doesn't ask you just to try to live like the son out of your own strength but his resurrection gave you an access to his strength he gave you an access to his strength and if you have had a pentecostal experience where you have died out to yourself and you have been birthed into the kingdom of god you see the holy ghost is more than a thought the holy ghost is more than something well i believe he's here and he's floating around this room i believe that he's able to maybe come and and fill me up like a tea jar pouring into my glass of sweet tea god is more than a thought he's a reality he's alive he's alive he is is still hebrews 13 and 8. it isn't just trained in our mind that god's the same he's the same he's a reality and we're not sitting here this morning i'm not trying to work you up or trying to keep some kind of momentum going you see we're not like a bunch of pentecostals that are sitting by a painted fire trying to work up a revival of 1906 that happened on azusa street no we're not doing that we're setting here where the real fire is we're not sitting by some painted fire like like somebody that's sitting there trying to get warm i know there's a fire here well how do you know brother angel he said it in his word that where you are i will be there it's who i gathered in my name i'll be there that tells me there's a fire here this morning and satan has done his worst to try to put that fire out but he can't stop it you remember i told you about that roll over fire that when a firefighter goes into a room they're looking they're looking at all types of different fire how that they're moving through a room and they're watching that fire and they call one type of fire roll over fire and they're watching that if that fire is rolling across that ceiling there that they know they've got to cool that room down in the next room so that they that that fire doesn't roll over to the next room that's what satan is trying to do is trying to cool you down with lukewarmness of laodicea and try to cool your experience down i'll throw covet on them they won't be able to come to church like they used to i'll cool them off how many is here today [Music] how many is here today you did not stop the fire from getting us to church this morning he's going to try to stop it this coming week but it is a rollover fire that cannot be put out hallelujah this is a reality it's not a declaration of words this is the truth you see if you've just got the word that's all you got but when the token is applied then christ is a reality to you is that right how many is a witness that christ is a reality to you see god's not looking for some robots you spit out all kinds of quotes and all kinds of different things he's not looking for computers he's not looking for your iphone he's looking for human beings that's been redeemed by the blood of the lamb that's been called by his name been attached to his name that can produce the same life and produce the same living reality in this hour i was listening to the prophet this week and he said you know i heard him say he said he said there's all kinds of fine sisters out there in in the congregation he said he said but there's there's not but one mrs branham he said now i said i know that some of you you sisters out there he said you're you're a sister to somebody or a daughter to somebody you're a wife to somebody i said but there's one that i take home with me there's one that i take home with me you see and there's a lot of churches out there today there's a lot of people that there's a lot of fine churches in the world but there's only one business jesus christ that's bringing forth the real true born again creatures of god her name's not methodist her name's not baptist her name is jesus mistress jesus and she's bringing for people not members of the methodist church she's not bringing forth baptist church or presbyterian or catholic she's bringing forth them born again rooted and grounded in christ jesus there's nobody that can operate like his wife are you with me there's nobody that can operate it you can put her in the most insane conditions but she does it well are you with me there there are there are some sisters that have went had to go through some stages of life when they had to live in shacks they had to live in some very uh ugly spots of life that maybe they knew that that wasn't where they wanted to be at but the husband was doing the absolute best that he could and that husband watches that wife how she handles herself in that little shack and how she how she handles herself and she makes that shack a home and she does it real well she's operating a white as a wife no matter what the conditions are no matter how bad it looks around her there may be holes in the roof there might be holes in the windows there might be some shot out pains in the windows but she is doing the best that she can do with what she's been given i want to say to the bride of jesus christ here and around the world you are doing a very fine job leoducia has done its worst but the bride is right on time she's moving according to the promises of god it shows that there is a relationship between the bride and the groom you remember when brother branham was in the church age book he said notice that harmony that existed between the father and the son he said that harmony is now to exist between the bride and the bridegroom and i heard these words just kept resonating in my spirit this week that she receives that word she accepts that word she never doubts it she receives it she accepts it she never doubts it she receives it she never doubts i don't begin to think about the masses of people that heard this word they heard this word but many did not receive this word and because they did not receive this word they doubted this word but you are not a part of that group you are a part of a group that has heard this word you receive this word and you've never doubted this word and if you've never doubted this word it will take you places it will take you into a sphere when i hear a prophet saying who is this melchizedek that you bypassed your theophany to come down here on earth to be tempted by sin when i think about that theophany and i hear that song i don't just hear and think about sister craighead that wrote that song years ago i don't think about isaiah brooks and sister angela senior that sings that song i think about my theophany you can think about your theophany but i'm thinking about mine and i hear it calling me this is a message of a king who is this melchizedek who is this one that does and performs these great things when abraham was sitting there and he heard this voice he followed this voice he watched that voice how that everything that voice said everything came to pass and abraham lined himself up with that word you remember when he went down there and the king of salem cain the king of peace he came down there and he began to speak to him and he began to pay tithes to him are you with me this morning that abraham began to line himself up with the word of a king and one day there came three men walking down a dusty road had dirt on them had dirt on their shoes looked like a real king dressed in robes like all easterns would wear but there was something different and abraham had watched that there was something different sure the world is mixed up on how many lords there is but abraham knew that he when he looked at him he said my lord he knew that the one that he was looking at was the one that had made him a promise and even though sarah woke up bitter that morning she woke up upset that morning because mrs lot down there has all of the fine things of life and i don't have anything but this whole garb that i'm wearing and she woke up bitter she woke up upset as i heard i heard i heard a fine preacher say that abraham did what every smart husband did he went and said outside the tent [Laughter] brother adam listen but here sarah is upset bitter upset tore up everything else going on while i'm going through this and here comes and now cassidy sat at the tent abraham i am going to visit you according to the time of life you see there was a an issue of time there was a portion of time that was allotted for isaac to come forth and here sarah heard these words and she laughed in her heart hear me of being an old grandma how am i going to have pleasure with my lord in this state and notice the secrets of the heart begin to be revealed why did sarah laugh in her heart and sarah lied i didn't laugh you think about that there's some people that watch this i'll be i'm gonna i want to warn you don't laugh at this don't laugh at this one of these days you won't be laughing because the one that's sitting outside the tent has the ability to take away your bitterness has the ability to take away that old grumpy spirit that you've been dealing with the one on the outside of the tent has the ability to change you from a grandma to a teenager the one on the outside of the tent has the ability to give you out of the lure out of your womb and bring forth life adam said that god would have had a right to kill sarah because she called god a liar how many people have laughed at this and called this a lie have called this sarah revelation have called it a lie and laughed at it and they will say i didn't laugh but they have turned down their day of repentance are you with me lots wife turn back but sarah's why sarah turned to door jesus there's a lot of people that are turning away from this there's a lot of people that walk down the sodom and they walk down to gomorrah and you see what it's producing it has produced a bunch of illegitimate children it's produced a bunch of rotten eggs that have never been with a male so they cannot produce the dna of jesus but the one that was sitting outside of the tent had the ability to change all of the cells of abraham's body and turn him from a hundred-year-old grandpa into a fully statured man so that he can produce that line that royal seed of abraham oh hallelujah you see if it would not been for an attachment with the king there would have been no body change of abraham and sarah if there would not been of an attachment of the king if the blood didn't stand up for you you would be killed because you were unworthy but the blood of jesus christ makes you worthy the blood of jesus christ makes you whole brother madam said that god has himself sowed up as it were he can't kill you because there's somebody that's standing up for you there is an attachment from a king and paul said wherefore he is not a call ashamed to call you brethren you remember when when jesus is standing there in mark chapter 9 he's done send out his disciples give him power over unclean spirits give them power to tread on serpents and all those things and the disciples had been with jesus and there was a father that came to jesus and he brought to him his son in this condition of dealing with an epileptic demon that often times it would throw him in the fire it would tear him apart but you remember that as soon as soon as that man's son began to look on jesus that that demon began to thrash and tear him apart you remember and you wonder sometimes what happens to people when they come into church and the preaching of the word goes forth and you'll think my goodness they must have got themselves jacked up on some mountain dew before they came into church because they're moving every which way and they're all over the place what is it it's a demon of hell that's getting nervous because that demons then got his eyes caught on jesus and it'll begin to thrash and throw them around you want to know something this is the best place to get a manicure at yeah you just clean this church up one time you'll find all kinds of fingernails people get nervous in church don't call me out but you watch as that demon begin oh bless the lord i'm gonna put spars out of business just come to church you get the finest ones they don't even bite them down here they so nervous ain't catching clipping them with other fingernails oh lord hallelujah anyhow but here they watch this demon thrashing because he caught jesus he's got his eyes on jesus and you wonder i'd say that satan sometimes gets a look looks at john it said how did that god get inside of that boy and all of hell begins to get nervous and shake how did all of heaven get in donny nicholson do you realize this morning that there is a great portion of heaven that is setting on the inside of your soul are you with me now they tell me they tell me that that if a if a meteor or one of those rocks come flying down from earth from from the sky and it hits the earth that if you would take that rock and you have the ability to throw it back into the sun where it came from that it would go back and would be a part of that sun again and if there is a portion of heaven that is sitting in your soul i am going to a land and satan wonders how in the world did that god get inside of them 16 elements called stephen byers i want to tell you house hayden by one spirit are we baptized into one body but notice the disciples they came to him and they said why could not we cast him out what was it notice jesus never said i'm taking my power back from you and you think sometimes and especially during this you think because you don't see a loved one a loved one completely get healed or or you don't see you don't see the miracle right before your eyes and you think has god taken his power away from me absolutely not the power was still given but jesus said that it's because of your faith it's because of your faith that has hindered you from this demon being cast out but be of good cheer he has overcome the world he's given you all the faith that when you receive the holy ghost that's everything that you have need of in this life journey but notice who was standing real close at that time judas a man that carried the bag he'd watched the mighty miracles he'd seen the healings he watched the woman with the blood issue he watched as the 5 000 were fed he watched when jesus walked to the woman and spoke to the woman at the well and he discerned the very secrets of her heart and he began to speak to her but judas was instructed from the outside he could go all the way with jesus except for when it came to pentecost and he showed his colors when it came to that pentecostal experience and it'll always show you can have a child grow up with you you can have be a foster parent you can adopt a child and maybe you can have a a cousin come and stay with you and they want to be with your family where throughout the summer and play with your children but you know that they're not your child at the end of the day if you're a foster parent or if you adopted a child you can love them like your own you can treat them like your own you can feed them like your own but the end of the day at the end of the facts it's still not a part of the dna you can treat them like a child you can raise them like a child you can dress them like a child but just because it grows in the house doesn't make it yours it can have it can even you can watch that child how that it's made up in different ways but it becomes under the influence of that household that it begins to carry on the characteristics and the mannerisms of that parent you watch a child as they they they grow up and you watch a child that they'll follow with that husband what the husband the head of the house does but it still doesn't make them a part of it because it comes down to a birth just stating the facts maybe you're in that condition and you've had you've been a foster parent or you adopted somebody but you know at the end of the day they're not yours because there is a blood cell that is not attached and here judas was he was not attached he had walked so close he'd been that close he'd been to the author of life stood right there but because there was no birth there was no attachment are you with me this morning so no matter how hard you try you can't make them your child and no matter how hard you try you can't make a sin or a christian you can walk with your friends through life you can try to show them the straight narrow path but unless they've been with jesus they can never produce that life of jesus are you with me this morning that that that just to be around it is not enough i've watched in business that we have become great personal friends with people in the business world that we have been identified with watch their lives change watch them become christians but just because they are around us is not enough it's not enough you've got to get into this it's got to become a reality it's got to be born in you hallelujah when i look out across this congregation and i see people that were walking one way that all of a sudden that there was a birth that happened that there was a transformation that took place you couldn't have done that would have made josh jones the man that he is today but god who would have made brother donnie nicholson the man that he is today but god sure brother sam wanted him to be in this condition maybe 20 or 30 years ago but god hallelujah had a destination of a dob on brother donny he's got a dob on every single one of you he knows where you came from and he knows where you're going there is a reality in this message that will change your mind this ain't makeup we ain't playing church the days of playing church are past jesus jesus's first doctrine he must be born again if there is no birth there is no attachment my little five-year-old and my little nine-year-old they have an amazing imagination amazing they you know it's amazing to watch them step into a role i think every girl goes through this they're in a stage of horses right now and they just love to play horses it's amazing the influence that they're under i never would have thought that their aunt stephanie by now could be considered could be considered my sister basically would have that much influence on my girls but my girls you watch them they can go out and they can go out in my garage and they can grab themself a metal stool put bungee cords on that stool and you would think that they were riding through the okay corral and they are crossing their crossing montana crossing wyoming and they're just going and they're just riding and if you could just get a glimpse of their imagination you would see that the mane of that horse is coming back and it's brushing writing their face as they're riding into the sunset it's amazing but when they're done they put that stool back put that bungee cord back you know what those girls know that they're riding a stool and they're not riding a horse but i'm afraid that too many people have confessed to be christians and they have never come to the reality of this message and what the riding on is just a metal stool and they'll stay right there and they've never had a reality of riding on this holy ghost and the holy ghost taken them by the reins of their heart and riding them through laodicea without without without wavering that she's going to overcome that god would bless her going in and coming out but you see there is a power there is a message that will put you right into a body change you can be that close you can profess all you want to but if you don't have this so is this is this a reality or is this imaginary are you setting on a pew or here are you in the word are you attached or are you detached are you in this thing to win this thing are you in it to give up are you in it no matter what you go through as my granddaddy homer would say i'm shooting for the stars when i hit a stump every time or not i'm going to keep pressing on no matter what i go through god is bigger than my problems i told the boys this morning they asked me i said what you're preaching today i said i'm gonna get up and i'm gonna play part two i'm gonna just replay last night god is bigger than my problems there is an attachment that makes you realize that makes you realize that you're not from this world you're just passing through where are you standing at where you're living at what you're going through what life are you living is it just emotions or is it a reality is it truth or is it false where are you standing at i read a book a few days ago you'll laugh at it but on who moved my cheese who moved my cheese and the the moral of the story is basically being able to adapt to change little mice getting upset because somebody moved their cheese it's kind of weird an adult reading something about mice moving cheese but walt disney sugar was made out pretty good but in that in that book it said this statement what would you do if you weren't afraid what would you do if you weren't afraid what a resignating statement what would you do this morning if you weren't afraid i wonder what some of you do would do if you wasn't afraid of coven i wonder what you would do if you weren't afraid that you could just break into a spear a sphere of an atmosphere of praising him i wonder what you would do if you weren't afraid this morning i wonder what you would do this morning if you weren't afraid that i would call you out for setting on me i wonder what you would do if you really got into the things of life if you really pass press past what you are seeing and you begin to break into that channel of the atmosphere of the word i wonder if you would really be riding on a horse or would you be sitting on a stool what would you do if you weren't afraid i'm afraid that if i get in the spirit that somebody will call me out i'm afraid that if i get emotion that somebody will say that was just me i'm afraid that if i step out and take a leap of faith that god will leave me hanging what would you do if you weren't afraid i'm afraid that if i believe god will let me down like you did before god has never let you down and god will never back up on his promises what would you do if you weren't afraid you've got a god that you can trust he said i am the lord that healeth all of thy diseases i am the lord thy god that forgiveth the all thy iniquities what would you do this morning if you weren't afraid would you praise him to the walls came down if you had a loved one that was sick and body would you tear the roof off of this place just to get them in the presence of jesus somebody wasn't afraid to do it legion wasn't afraid to press pass press past whatever he was thinking of all those chains and all those demons that were holding him down brother branham said that if legion wouldn't have pushed his way out there those demons never would have came out to jesus what would you do this morning if you weren't afraid jesus would say fear not fear not what life are we living in what spot are we sitting at in our christian walk are we going backwards or are we going forward where is the attachment that seed if it's a predestinated seed it will not predestination does not pull you back and draw you back into a shall pray destination will thrust you forward well i'm gonna be in the rapture if god predestinated me before the foundation of the world i'm gonna be there i'm afraid you won't if you've got that kind of mentality i will just sit back and i will do as i want to if god's going to get me there god's going to get me there if god's going to give me this god will give it to me and i won't have to believe for it you've got the wrong mentality yes he said he'd heal you yes he said he'd deliver you yes he said he'd give you the promise yes he said he'd give you the holy ghost but you got something to do too you got to fight past your fear you got to fight past what you're seeing you know so many people get that close they get that close and they give up what is laying on the inside of you is it a predestinated seed that says no matter what i'm not backing up i'm not giving up i'm not turning around i'm setting my feet on solid ground let's stand this morning what would you do if you weren't afraid because if the life of beethoven's in me i'll do the works of beethoven if the life of a great mechanic is in me you would expect me to be oily and have rags and have mechanic coveralls on and i would do the works i'm a mechanic but if i told you i was a great mechanic i didn't i didn't have a single tool i didn't have no grease under my fingernails you'd question my ability as a mechanic but if you say you got the spirit of christ and you ain't got the love of christ under your fingernails if your knees haven't hit the ground in a while it would make you question what life am i living where am i sitting there i got good news for you that believe the rapture is at hand but i got bad news for y'all that don't believe i'm not saying any of you here i'm just preaching but for people that don't believe there's a rapture coming whether you believe it or whether you don't there's a rapture coming whether you want to go whether you don't there's a rapture coming whether you want to go through the tribulation or not the tribulation's coming but the bride is not going through the [Music] tribulation i got good news god has given me the revelation of when he's coming i know that scares some people because the bible said that no man knows the hour nor the day when he cometh but i know it in a moment in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he's coming it may not be this moment but he's coming in a moment hallelujah it may not be today and may not be tomorrow but he's coming in the morning it may not be when i see it it may not be when i feel it but i know that it's coming in a moment i can tell you i'm gonna come by your house i'm gonna eat some of your apple pie and i may never get there because you never invited me for that apple pie but there's one thing for sure that if jesus said he's coming he's coming in a moment what would you do this morning if you wasn't afraid i'm not talking about in the natural just going out and licking doorknobs i'm not afraid of covet what kind of insane person are you i'm not talking about that i'm talking about in the spirit realm what would you do has given us talents god's given us abilities but what would you do whose servants you yield yourself where your members lie i wonder this morning are you sitting on a store with a bungee cord or are you really in the tune of this message are you marching right in the keys you going on with jesus no matter what you see we're going into a very dark realm here shortly october 31st there's a lot of people that come out on a wicked day and they produce all kinds of evilness and there's a lot of people that attach themselves to them they love that thrill of getting scared as davey breeden told me he said i hunt too much to get scared stuff like that i walk out in the dark i said i ain't no way i'm going around that stuff but it shows when people begin to attach themselves to oh i just love that thrill of getting scared or i i just oh i just want to go and be a part of those things it shows where your attachment's land it really does half of you dressed up for halloween anyway got your mask on little joke for you but some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you never get it most of you but it shows where your attachment's laying if you are drawing from this world more than you're drawing from that world it shows where you're coming from and it shows where you're going but you can change where your allegiance lie and it only takes one moment it's amazing the power of forgiveness that god in one moment completely forgives everything that you've done wrong and if there is just one part of an attachment i say god i didn't mean to do that it shows where you're coming from it shows that there's something laying there do you love the lord this morning give the lord a handclap of praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] my thirsty soul come and fall afresh on me and fill my cup again and make me home [Music] i need you [Music] now [Music] [Applause] me and fall just like the rain [Music] or saturate oh my thirsty [Music] will come and fall afresh on me [Music] and fill my cup together who heal my heart and make me home i need you now pour your spirit out lord i seek you who help me find you first [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord forgive me if i've wondered oh far away from you [Music] oh just pour your spirit out [Applause] [Music] my thirsty soul can come and fall afresh on me and fill my cup again [Music] heal my heart and make me new i need you now pour your spirit out i bless you today as we go in the fear of the lord we want to be remembered in the meadow's family brother meadows we just want to extend our love to you tell you how much we appreciate you and thank you for being so faithful thank you god bless you to everyone of the meadows family we are we are connected in so many ways and i think about this congregation you're so blessed to be able to stand with pillars like sister irene young people sister irene was a real pillar she was a real lady of grace to watch her how she carried herself she was a model citizen of the kingdom of god young people you don't want to point out to the things of the world and look at the stars out there that's the kind of lady of grace that you want to point your life to and you can have that kind of a life i know that without a shadow of a doubt where sister irene is and i'm going to see her i'm going to see her are you going to see your loved one on that side our churches went through some war zones we went through some real wars here in the past past couple months this coming saturday we will have married four but god is the author of life that if one seed goes down you watch and three comes up god's that kind of a god he's doing everything to get us ready don't you love him he's so wonderful god bless you each and every one of you today as we sing your song pour your spirit out on me go in the fear of the lord as the brothers dismiss you today amen pour your spirit out on me and fall just like
