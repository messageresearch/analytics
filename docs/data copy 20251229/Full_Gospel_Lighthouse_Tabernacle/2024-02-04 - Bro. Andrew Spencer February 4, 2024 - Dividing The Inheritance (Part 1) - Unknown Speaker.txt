Heavenly Father we approach you father Lord knowing father there could have been a many different chapters in our story father Lord but you decided Lord to take up the pen and begin to write out the story Lord how the song would sing it of Amazing Grace a predestination father Lord we recognize that we're in a moment in time Lord that we we're here as we're gathered as the children of God lord we can sing these songs that Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine been through many a trials and many troubles but Lord through it all you've been right there holding our hand you promised us that you never leave us and you never forsake us Lord we look back and we see the footprints on the sands of time seen that it was in those moments that you were carrying us father we just want to be mindful today Lord as we enter into your presence Lord the atmosphere that has been said Lord the songs that have been sung we are standing father Lord just like you stood up in this generation we're standing now as a bride body we are standing under the fullness of our revelation of who we are and I pray today Lord that you would just come amongst us as a church body today you'd begin to to minister unto us according to thy promises that are rich in grace and mercy father Lord there's a certain allotment for this day Lord and I pray that you would begin to release the things that you have on your heart for this moment in time to give us give us Faith to go through the Journey I pray you be at the needs of your body today we commit them unto you in Jesus name amen amen amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis chapter 15 also down to Joshua chapter 1 and I know that you've had a wonderful week amen I know that uh I know that many of you that are have been a part or seen some of these testimonies that has came out this week of people just sharing what the Lord has done with them just at the end of service last week we just felt a commission to just a commission to testify and we've seen the the benefits of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done amongst his bride body and and I just thank the Lord for it all and what we're seeing it's it's stirring up the the spirit of faith on the inside of a body of Believers to believe that all things are possible we know those things but to see a God In Action that's what this message is it's a God in action and to see that displayed in front of us and I believe great things will come out of this but I want you to know as well it's stirring up the spirit of Faith but it's also stir stirring up the spirit of hell as well so you just stand firm on your testimony you're the one that said it you're the one that was there that God met you there you you put a mark down and God met you there I think it's a wonderful thing I think we should never grow tired of testifying of the power of our Lord Jesus Christ amen Genesis CH 15 and verse 4 and the Bible said here and behold the word of the Lord came unto him this speaking to Abram said this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and He accounted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of her of the ches and to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it also Joshua chap 1 and verse one if you go reading the rest of Genesis chapter 15 you'll find that there Abraham prepares a a sacrifice and an altar and he begins to lay things out before the Lord just to see how shall I know that I shall inherit these things brother brandham said something very profound about that he said that God put Abraham to sleep to show him to show Abraham you don't have nothing to do with this and I believe that that that is the key in a lot of Our Lives if we can just allow allow the Lord to take control instead of us we don't have nothing to do with this it's his job he will get us where he needs to get us to Joshua chap 1 and verse one and the Bible said here now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Moses Minister saying notice we're watching a transition here in the ministry and Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people under the land which I do give unto them even to the children of Israel and notice Moses was dead but his message was not dead every place verse three every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I have given unto you let's say that together that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even under the great river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and that gives us great courage right there doesn't it to think that we can tie that together with Romans with the book of Romans of chapter 8 and said what shall what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us not any man's going to be able to stand before you all the days of your life verse six be strong and of a good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and not thou mayest observe that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord as we stated to you last weekend that we we were dealt with by by the Lord in in in our in our sleep a few few weeks ago on on this thought and I know it's a very vast subject so I I intend uh by the help of the the Lord to take maybe a few services on this thought today on dividing The Inheritance dividing The Inheritance and we recognize that that is a very very vast subject that we could spend the rest of our Christian Life talking about dividing The Inheritance but I believe that it's it's we are in a very special season as the body of Jesus Christ we recognize what commission that we are under here we are not under a Moses commission but we are under a Joshua commission we understand what Joshua's Commission was it was to go in there not to re not to recreate a new message but it was simply to take the same message and go in there and possess the to go in there and possess the land and we recognize as we just jump into this today that as the children of Israel and the Seed of Abraham that the elect of God that they had been given a certain of of a allotment of inheritance as their portion all the way back all the way back from their forefather Abraham it had been promised under to them that they were going to have an inheritance that they were going to go in there and they were going to have a portion they were going to have a portion that was a lot it specifically unto them and that word divide it means to separate into portions and and to give each man according to to what is rightfully his and there we recognize that Abraham Abraham has given a word of the Lord to him that is he's telling him that your seed is going to go in there and they're going to inherit it but we recognize that when when God is speaking to Abraham he's not just necessarily speaking to him about where he's at in his current life he is speaking to him a message that is out there in his future so we recognize that the promise was to Abraham's seed and to his seed after him so we recognize that that when when God is speaking to Abraham when he speaks those word it means inherit it means something that you've got to go in and you've got to dispossess that and you see notice that word it is a future word inheritance is something that has already happened and it's been left behind but here God is speaking to Abraham and he's telling him you are going to go in there and you're going to inherit this land and when God speaks those words to Abraham it immediately Clicks in Abraham's mind there's something out there for me that maybe I don't see just yet but there's something there that I've got a job to do I've got to go out there I've got to follow the leadership of the Lord and you know maybe Abraham himself s NE never stepped full in the full Properties or the full manifestations of the promise of God but he did step in that in his seed in that is that right so we recognize that it was something that was in the future for Abraham as God was saying that if you look into that word in the Hebrew word it means to dispossess that there there were men that were in that land you know that if you go to studying out those histories that at that time there were men that wasn't even on that land but Satan was standing really close when God was speaking to Abraham and as soon as the promise begin to go out of Abraham's mouth that men begin to go in there and go to inhabit that land isn't that exactly how Satan does you that God will give you a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there the squatter will begin to go in there and go move in on your property that's what the word inherit means it means to dispossess so Abraham has showing God is showing to Abraham that you're going to receive an inheritance and if you're going to ever receive something as an inheritance as as somebody that is that is something that has been left behind you have to be an heir you have to be an heir of of of of The Inheritance or you're not going to be able to grab of what was laying there in the wheel in Testament and you know you know that be before maybe a mother or a father if they leave behind certain possessions in the whe you see that executive he's got a a job to do he's got to go in there and show points that this is what the the father's will was this is what the mother wanted or maybe it was some rich uncle that that that that left you something you've got to identify yourself in The Inheritance before you can never receive anything you know there there's actually websites that you can go on and search out your name and find if somebody's left you some lost long inheritance out there I I personally don't have anybody out there that's decided to do that to me yeah there's a website out there for it but the Bible said in Romans 8:14 that as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God I may not have an inheritance in the natural of somebody that was rich in the natural that left me anything but I do have a heavenly father that owns the cattle on a thousand hills he owns the gold on the inside of the mountains and he's able to leave us in inheritance but we don't just want Natural Things from God do we we don't want just Health just here we don't want just benefits of driving a nice car and having a nice house there's something there that God's got for us and I I believe that if God's left us something then we ought to jump right into it the Bible goes on to say for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hirs and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I think it's a very powerful thing to recognize yourself as a son and daughter of God you know before you can ever go in and fully possess your inheritance whether it be from your mother your father your grandfather you've got to show your identity you've got to show who you are you've got to have some you've got to have some certificates you've got to have an identity that allows you to go into the lawyer's office and put put a claim down that I am a part of this Kinsman I'm a part of this one and when you have the right identity to it that's why Jesus would tell Nicodemus that's why you must be born again because without this identity there's a lot of people that are coming out with their hands open they're got their hands out trying to grab the inheritance but they don't have an identity to attach thems to The Inheritance now come on somebody I'm preaching to you the message because the reason why that you have the ability to grab a hold of this inheritance of Malachi 4's Ministry is because you've been birthed under it you didn't come out under Moses's Ministry you wern't baptized under Moses's Ministry but you have been baptized you have been baptized under the ministry of Malachi 4 and you can identify yourself you can identify yourself with this message and when you have the right identity you can go into the lawyer you can go before the judge and said I have every right to go in there and possess my god-given privileges you've got every right to go in there if your life lines up with the promises that are there if it says it's for John Smith and your name is in John Smith on come on somebody let me preach to you a little bit if your name doesn't line up with it then something is wrong with what you're trying to attach yourself to but if your name is in the book if your name is in the book your identity is there that's why you can't see anything else but Malachi 4 that's why you can't see anything else but William Bram and Malachi 4 it's because you're there as well behold I will send you my name is there I can't see anything else brother hoopin my name is there Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you see his presence is vindicating truth that he is here to make sure that you receive of this will and testament so we recognize we recognize that there is an authority here to make you align yourself with this inheritance now notice that when God is up there on the mountain in Genesis chap 22 when he's spending time with the patriarch Abraham because Abraham trusts God he's put his full trust in him he takes his son up there and he and he he goes all the way up there I believe it's very powerful that you go all the way with the word of the Lord is that right notice what he does God begins to have a conversation with him him and he he stops him in the part of the process when he's getting ready to kill his own son and said no I've already provided a way for you and he begins to talk to him what is he doing he first shows himself as Jehovah Gyra to Abraham but he doesn't just leave it to Abraham he shows it to all of the seed you see it wasn't just William branham's message it wasn't just Abraham's message it was his seed's message and he begins to tell them I am Jehovah dyra I provided this lamb I provided this way you couldn't done this without me Abraham you would have lost your son today but because I provided something for you he begins to turn the diamond so that all of Abraham see could say that I am a part of Moses's I am a part of Abraham's message what are you saying brother Andrew that the same God that spoke to Abraham turned around and said watch this Abraham I'm not just going to be Jehovah Gyra to you but I'm going to be Jehovah Gyra to all thy seed and what is he give them brother Chris he said your seed shall possess the gates of its enemies that's why you've got every bit of confidence to know that you're not under some man Ministry you're under the ministry of Jehovah Gyra you just fast forward just a minute you go all the way to the time of Moses in Exodus chapter 6 and 7 after Moses has got his commission he's up there and meets a pillar of fire for himself and the pillar of fire comes off of the Bush and comes into Moses he said I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will bring you into the land concerning the which I did swear to give to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will give it you for inheritage I am the Lord you got to think where they're living at you got to think about the spot that these that these people that were listening to the message of the day where they were living at they were living in a much chaotic time like you're living in they were living in a time when when there when there were people that was trying to move them out they were trying to bruise them they were trying to put them under slave mentality they were doing everything within them to crush out the very idea that God was going to raise up a deliverer but notice that God begins to speak directly to them he sends a prophet messenger by their way and he begins to deliver the message when Moses is up there and said who am I going to tell him send me what did William brandham say who am I going to say did this who am I going to tell don't you worry I'll be with you I'll be even in you to the end of the world I am that I am notice what he does he begins to talk to them notice where they are they are living in a land that that's not theirs they're living in an area they're living in a a a demographic and the climate of the age that they were living in it was getting really hot it's been over 400 years since Joseph was around that Pharaoh don't even know anything about Joseph no more he just simply knows that those men are out there they're his slaves you think about this you think about this how this how this whole picture got started I think it's amazing thing Joseph was the one that was led down there that got Israel out of the out of the problems that they were in surely if God got them into Egypt he could get them out of Egypt come on somebody if it was a prophet's dream that brought them down there it'll be a prophet's Vision that'll get them out of [Applause] there living in a land that ain't their own they're not the let me say this to you you will never Prosper trying to live out somebody else's Vision come on somebody you will never Prosper trying to take my position you never Prosper trying to live out Moses's message when it ain't your message you will never live out you will never live to your full potential trying to live out somebody else's Vision that's just like the gifts of the Spirit and the and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never live out to your full success trying to live out somebody else's Ministry I simply want to be come on somebody come on somebody we don't want just gifts we want The Giver of them you'll never live out to your full success do you realize that Joshua whole his whole entire Ministry Is hinging On Believing the message you meditate on this you eat this you see oh he didn't have to change the message of Moses he simply had to preach the message of Moses you ain't got to do anything little bride just believe the message will you ain't got to work anything up you ain't got to see No Visions you ain't got to have no dreams you ain't got to speak in tongues all you got to do is believe the message well glory be to God that's all you got to do you ain't got to work up some emotion you ain't got to work up some false fire just believe the message it'll produce The Works come on Joshua you got land to conquer come on Israel come out of Egypt stop hiding back [Applause] there you're never going to prosper out there trying to believe somebody else's message that ain't your land to live in Ruth that ain't your moabite land it's time you come out of that land I ain't been in a message for 20 years come out of that land that ain't your land you were born to live in the field of this message and the stay right here in this message that's where your power's at come on somebody that's where your power's at right here in this message don't try to go out there and live under Luther's message don't try to go out there and F your thirst up with the things of the world they can't satisfy you they can't let me tell you everything that Satan will offer he will simply numb your conscience but there is no power down there in Egypt come on Israel you're never going to be blessed down there every time Israel ever backslid is when she got out of her land and every time you get out of this message or get out of the word of your day you're going beginning to backslide yeah I'm living in a land brother Andrew that I don't know I'm living in a land where I don't necessarily understand everything but let me tell you something there's a message coming by your way little children there's a message coming by your way and the slave masters that have whipped you the message is preparing a way out for you that's what the message did brother bandam said it prepared for healing it prepared for salvation it prepared for deliverance it prepared for victory if you're ever going to do anything in life you got to prepare for it you ever got a new piece of furniture and you're waiting for the furniture company to come and bring it you got to prepare for it you got to make room for it let me tell you something them inhabitants over there in Canaan didn't know what was getting ready to come but there was a hornet that was on their way that was going to drive them out and the angel of the Lord was going to make room for them what am I saying to you Full Gospel Lighthouse make room for your blessings make room for your blessings it's just like getting ready to have a new baby you got to make some preparations for that thing you got to get the car seat in the car you got to get the crib in this room you got to make room for it let me tell you baby Jesus is on his way and he's being birthed right here in the midst of the Church of the Living God oh blessed be the name of the Lord you got to make room for it well brother brandom brother brandom talk about brother Neville while he was preaching one time that brother nabal said he said it's like a great big arcade that you got everything in that arcade you can see it all laying out there but brother Neville said what you got to do that's where brother brandom got it from he said what you got to do is you got to get on that ladder if something's a little too high for you maybe your joy just seems a little bit Out Of Reach for you why don't you get on the ladder of the Holy Ghost and climb up there and get your joy why don't you climb up there and get your children why don't you climb up there and get your blessing let's make a clown today let's not stay down here the the Holy Ghost is our ladder the Holy Ghost is making a way for us to inherit all these things that's what the Bible said in Revelations chapter 27 21 excuse me not 27 you won't find that one Revelations 21 and seven that he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son give me verse eight please but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers and the whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death let me tell you something that is not my part that is not my inheritance my portion is the portion of the Overcomer come on somebody I am not identified my identity is not going out there and going to the lawyer's room and saying I am a Monker I am an idolator I am a liar but my identity is showing and proving I am an overcomer I am Blood Washed I am Blood Bought I am a virtuous son and daughter of God my identity lines up with my [Applause] inheritance what brother random would say in things that are to be he said that's where we are we've come we' become from Mortal beings from time beings to Eternal beings when the word of God lit our souls and we become Sons and Daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God to be Sons and Daughters of God in heaven crying ABA father you see what your identity is is the very genos of God think that's that's where it all came from that's where it all came from the very Gene of God what happened to you you what happened to you how'd you get where you are how'd you get where you are I got so many people that come I think it's amazing to sit around sit around these testimonies like this week and you hear the people that once know him said how did you get where you are how'd you get what happened the word of God lit your soul what was it it was something that you could not explain but the gene of God on the inside of you when the word crossed it it lit your soul you got something out there in front of you I absolutely loved this last weekend I'm just going to make a point and go on I don't want to spend too much time here but I absolutely loved this last weekend when brother Ron was preaching he started singing that song you don't know like I know and the spirit of God began to move out here forgive me sis I thought it was very powerful but sister with sister Devon she stepped out there to the end of that aisle I thought it was amazing she was giving the Lord [Music] opportunity used to go in used to go in dances back in the day and everybody was so scared everybody so scared they stand back up against the wall just waiting on somebody to come across the room she looking at me I thought it was amazing sis she got out there there and gave her dancing partner an opportunity to come and when Jesus stepped out said I'll be a dancing partner let me tell you what you got to do in your promises if giv God an opportunity to be everything that he said he would be come on somebody we ain't over there in the wall trying to figure out if he wants us or not we're right here in the arena of God's company he's here he's not coming he's here he's here why shouldn't we praise him why shouldn't we love him why shouldn't we give our all to him I know who I am I'm identified as the body of Jesus Christ well blessed be the name of the Lord I got a lot a land to cover but I'm not going to cover it all one day I'm going to get to a part I'm going to divide that inheritance for the day and y'all can to have it go home and eat on the land of it we got 60 Mi across and we got 75 miles that we've got to conquer we got some land to go out you may not see all of it just yet but there's some land out there ain't very big is it brother you can go 75 miles in a day 60 miles that way but that's your land and I'll tell you this if it's got my name on it I got every right to go out there and lay my claim on it that land does not represent Heaven that land had Wars in it it had killings in it but brother brandom said what it did identify identified that it was a type of the Holy Spirit but notice what the Bible said in Ephesians 1:11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance let's say that together obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that word obtain it literally means to acquire by lot or then to receive in whom we have also obtained an inheritance brother brand goes in the message of adoption if you ain't listened to it for for a while go in there and listen to those things but brother bandam it's very powerful he said we have obtained an inheritance he said somebody has to leave you something is that right somebody's got to leave you something he said so God before the foundation of the world left you something you want to know what he left you brother Chris a name written on a book that when the lamb had been slain you'd be recognized with him what's my inheritance my name wasn't written down 15 years ago it was written down before heaven was ever created I got myself some kind of inheritance I got an inheritance that ain't no slewfoot and ain't no squatter ever going to take away from me because if he put my name there brother brandham said it like this that eroded with indelible R ink that means it's unable to be erased that's quite the inheritance he said how do we get this inheritance he said because we walk upright how do we get this inheritance it's because we're predestinated you you want hear what the prophet said [Applause] wo how'd you get where you are I didn't put myself here he predestinated me to this well glory be to God the land was The Inheritance the promised land is your Holy Ghost that's a burden off you ain't got to go out and try to figure out what it is the prophet said your inheritance is the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Ghost now notice notice that when God got out there in Numbers Chapter 13 that you watch that Moses I know I'm jumping just a bit but I'm trying to paint this picture to you that that Caleb and Joshua was a part of the 10 other spies and they're sent out there and they're sent out there to look at it they're going to be a a a vision of what's getting ready to come to pass and God sends out 12 Spies to go out there what does 12 represent it represents the Patriarchs it represents worship there's 12 tribes of Israel so God chose one of every tribe to go out there and look at their portion now what if your representative came back and said you can't have it what if somebody came back and it's been told to Abraham you can have div healing you can have Miracles you can have promises but then somebody comes back and says no wait a minute that's not for us well I'd say it for me in my house it's time to jump ship and get in this tribe I don't identify with somebody that says I can't have the Holy Ghost I can't have blessings but that's exactly what was happening 10 of them came back and brought up an evil report I said man you ought to seen them things big old grasshoppers over there it's amazing what your imagination would do to you we look like his big old Giants over there no doubt there was Giants over there they was the sons of anic they was Giants over there but if you could only recognize that Jean seed of God I know your problems seem all so big but if you can recognize that it ain't you it's the promise that it ain't what you got to do you work yourself up to notice but two of them come back two of them come back that's the tribe that I identify with I identify with a dog Hallelujah I don't know about that brother Andrew that's what Caleb's name means a dog but Lord even the dogs get the crumbs from the master's table come on somebody maybe the rest of the world don't want it but for me but for me I'm identified with a tribe you can call me what you want to but I'm going in let me tell you there's more Holy Ghost for you there's more miracles for you there's a Rapture out there for you don't you let some 10 tribe stand up and try to stop you from it you stand right there on your god-given privileges said it was promised to Abraham it was promised to Jacob it was promised to Joseph and I'm going in hallelujah hallelujah it's my message it's my inheritance let me have it [Applause] so that's why brother Adam said don't you ever live below your god-given privileges that's what brother brandom said about the the pilgrim Holiness he said look he said they got right up there to the border line he said they got so close that they could taste the grapes but they wouldn't go in I don't identify there let me tell you where I identify with this is a good land I identify with Caleb and Joshua I put it in the words of the prophet he said Joshua stood up there say Shut Up This Is My Land well come on devil Shut Up This Is My Land This is my Holy Ghost that's my family that's my inheritance sister Francis your grandson called me your grandson called me this past week and started testifying to me about miracles this guy don't go to our church but he ain't here yet but I ain't counting it out but he called me he was so happy here's a man that should have been dead by Co sister Francis should have been dead late in the hospital how many days yeah that's a lot 10 and some days laid up in the hospital with Co she died how many times went cold blue so many times never going to work again but he had something on the inside Brian had something on the inside of him he wanted to work again he wasn't like the Le rest of the bums in America that just simply want to sit around and eat upon the governments he wanted a job he he work for it they told him you'll never get that job you don't have the has to still walk around has to use oxygen every once in a while but he pressed towards it he kept pressing towards it and he just pushing forward but he testified to me thank you for all your prayers and your church family for praying for me he got hired on last week at a full-time position should have never been able to work again should have never been able to testify how good God is I don't care if he ever sits in this building God was God to Brian so if God was that kind of a God to Brian what about your God is he still not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever It's Your Land brother BR I'm said now there's three stages to this journey he said the first of it the first of it is justification they left Egypt he said the second part of it was sanctification in the Red Sea where they killed their past I know that there's a lot of times that people stay right there it's good to stay there at the Red Sea and watch them drown I enjoy looking back and seeing them but you can't stay there you can sit there and look at them all your days but just because you see them laying in the ground you got to go on and live because if you're constantly looking at that giant that whipped you and beat you you're no greater than him if you're still chained to that man if you're still chained to that man you're not living any higher than him but you got to go on that's why brother brandham would preach a token he said it's a climax of my my Ministry the token which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said there's three parts to this journey he said it's first leaving Egypt second killing your past he said but the third part of it is crossing over Jordan because it is a sign of death to yourself that you're getting ready to move into your inheritance now I'm going to read this to you cuz I don't want I don't want you to miss it my brother brandom said that at one the third stage is when they cross cross over Jordan he said their inheritance never laid there in Egypt though God blessed them down there their inheritance never laid there again in adoption series he said now remember God predestinated you by for knowledge that you are coming to this everybody understand it raise your hand see God by forn knowledge predestinated you to come to the promised land what is the promised land for the Christian today just raise up your hand if you know it the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and it shall come to pass that in the last days sayith the Lord I will pour out my spirit upon your flesh and on your sons and your daughters don't you recognize that you're predestinated to walk into that land you may not understand this but you're predestinated to get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may not want anything to do with this message but you're predestinated to go in there and Conquer this land he said the promise and question and answers he said the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised of all throughout the Old Testament and New too he said the promise is behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peter said on that day he said on the day of Pentecost that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for for the church is to live in the power of the spirit he said it's another world it's another land you have to come out of that condition that you've been in to come out and live in this promised land to receive the promise that's the promised land for the believer is to come out there and live under the power of the spirit now look all of you ain't going to let L your hands on a sick and watch them recover but it's for you is that right it's for you let me say this to you there are different part counterparts of this land let me say this to you you may not go over here and live in Dan's inheritance you may not go over here and live in ephraim's inheritance but it's still the children of Israel's and the Bible said that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall take up B deadly things and it shall not harm them we ain't walking around like a bunch of snake handlers and going around and trying to tempt God by that but I do believe that there is a portion of the body that just like Paul when he was over there preaching a message and a snake come out of the fire Paul just shook it off I ain't going out there looking for the snake but if he comes by my way I can simply throw him under my feet and keep on preaching the message now ain't all of you going out there and trying to drink arsenic po arsenic poison but I believe that if you accidentally got into it that our God would show up I forget that brother's name but just coming to me forgive me I don't have the quote in front of me but this brother one time there was a guy that was up there challenging Mark 16 he was standing up there and old hillbilly come up there he was challenging Mark 16 hillbilly come up here grabbed the Apple out of his bibed overalls and started biting on that thing and he looked up at him and said can you tell me if that Apple's sweet or bitter he said well how am I supposed to know I ain't taste it yet he said exactly how can you know if there's no power if you've never tasted of it that same man stood there and said now if there is any real Christians out there that believe in Mark chapter 16 that you can take up deadly things if you drinking didly thing and shall not harm you he said now let me tell you something he said I he said I don't believe I got to do this he said but I'm not going to stand there and let you challenge the very word of God he took that arsic poison and said in the name of Jesus Christ drunk it and kept on living let me tell you something Billy Graham stood up in front of the raw heathens and stood there and they challenged to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and Billy Graham couldn't answer them William brandom said he said I tell you what I would have done he said I wouldn't let some raw Heathen try to challenge me and let God go down into defeat he said whether God would have showed up or not I'd have stood for Jesus I can lay my hands on you and I can believe you with all my heart but whether you get healed or not I'm still going to stand up for it let all the naysayers come and try to tell us that this message This Land Is Not Right But I already seen the Borderlands of it I've already had somebody go over Hallelujah I've already had somebody go over to the other side and said whatever you do don't miss it somebody's already went there for you a prophet messenger went on that side whatever you do little bride don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it it's a good land I'll tell you how good this land is that it takes 10 gold men to show you how powerful the fruit of the spirit is we got to do it I hope this thing comes out if not I'm gonna look like a biggest idiot come on Matt we still stand for the American flag around here I tell you how good this land is we got fruits of the spirit it's such a cluster you got to think about when these children of Israel went there they went there in the time of harvest and the cluster was hanging all the way to the ground I'll tell you what was in there it was a baby for Anna Thomas it was Deliverance for Melissa Hill it was cancer completely over for Ron Spencer so don't tell me I've already seen the fruit of it you Hoist the flags hoist them colors there's a banner at F Gospel Lighthouse that God still gives the holy ghost that God still delivers brother brandom said it like this it's time that some young people start walking back the evidence I'm a part of the land I may not be there yet but I'm on my way well blessed be the name of the Lord Glory Hallelujah it's my land and I ain't going to let no anaite I'm I'm not going to let no head tight stand up here and tell me I can't have it it's [Applause] yours that land looks pretty good don't it I think it's amazing I think it's amazing that if if we really shouldn't go inherit this land if it's really not that good then why is there that many scarecrows [Music] around is that right if it really if it really if his holy ghost ain't that real then why we got so many people telling us that it ain't real if it ain't that good leave us alone but it is that good I've tasted of it I've seen it I know it's good I know what it can do I see the power of it I see the anointing that's on the land let me have it some of you may not been called out there to go with Joshua and Caleb but you're still under the message and I seen some of your testimonies this week some of you said I didn't know whether my testimony was strong enough or not let me tell you if you're standing there with Joshua you got enough it's powerful enough God push you just put your voice behind it come on Joshua can't everybody be a Joshua can't everybody be a Caleb but get behind them can everybody be a Matthew Spencer but get behind them can everybody be a Chris Morris but get behind him can't everybody be a William Boron but get behind him let me tell you something while we're in this land of testimony just for a minute maybe you didn't go out and smoke and drink get caught up in all the world thank you Jesus thank you Jesus we need testimonies like that I didn't go out there and dope I didn't go out there and smoke I didn't go out there and get involved in sin but I was still born in sin I was still shaped in iniquity but I I recognized that I needed a Joshua savior I heard a preacher tell it one time I about beat the socks off of them too he said you know what there's a season in young people's life message preacher said our young people got to go out there and so their Wild Oats I said that's a bunch of baloney that's a lie Straight From Hell you ain't got to go out there and so that you can have a greater testimony you can sit right here in this message Church all the days of your life and have one of the most powerful testimonies I caught the revelation of who Jesus [Applause] was I know it's simple but it's still my land let me tell you it may not be as Bountiful as your land it may not produce crops and grain like Bethlehem C but let me tell you it's my land I love this I found this B said that Jesus knew that Satan was going to try to keep you from this he said so he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he said he seen the deceitfulness of Satan and what he would do so he put your name on there he knew what Satan would try to do let me tell you there was nothing that Satan didn't try to accumulate or try to build up that God doesn't already know so he saw the deceitfulness of Satan said nah I'm going to write their name on the book let me say this to you whether you see your name or not not I believe I believe you're going to come to the spot where you recognize that this is who you are I really believe with all of my heart that we are living in an hour where you can know that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life this is no longer guessing do I have the Holy Ghost or do I not have the Holy Ghost you know that you got the Holy Ghost let me say this to you how do you know that it's for you because you keep showing back up you keep pressing the battle you keep listening to the message when Satan tried his best he didn't just write your name down with pen that could be erased he wrote it down with the blood of the Lamb let me say this that over your name sister Cindy over your name brother it's the blood of Jesus Christ amen when David was on his way when the ark was making his way back David put on his Priestly ephod the ephod he put on the 12 tribes of colors he put on the the Y and thumb but he put on the he put on the priest of ephod and it had all 12 tribes names on it I had a dream this is I wasn't going to tell it but we're here I had a dream and the Lord the Lord showed me show showed me two parts of it and I knew that I knew immediately that it was of the Lord but there was a brother that had given me a gift he gave me a gift and I Heard a Voice said this this is representative of the 12 Champions and then the dream is shifted over and I was standing out on this great ledge out on this great ledge and out in front of me was this shelf of all kinds of goods and I Heard a Voice say it's time to divide the inheritance when David is out there dancing before the Lord he's got 12 Champions on his shoulders and there's coming times in your spots of your life that you don't recognize that you're a champion but whether you feel it or not a king has walked into the shika Glory wearing your name he's wearing your name he's wearing Benjamin he's wearing he's wearing Reuben he's wearing Ephraim and as David is dancing before the Lord he's carrying your name the voice said be careful but it's time to divide the inheritance let me tell you there's going to come some spots where you look out there on your land and you say well I don't know if I can go in there and possess it or not but let me tell you everything that you have need of is laying there in Exodus 23 and 20 behold I send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way you're going to come up against cancers but you're still going to press through you're going to come up against trials you're going to come up against tumors you're going to come up against criticism Hallelujah you don't have to work this up Moses didn't have to do anything just preach the message Moses just preach a m just preach a message Lord spoke some to a brother a while back so when you get in when you get in a tough spot simply preach a message Moses you don't have to work this up you ain't try to God you ain't got to create anything you ain't got to go out there and make it all happen just preach a message Moses little bride just say what the tape say come on somebody I know it might be cliche but let me say it like this just say what the tape say don't try to add your own ideas don't try to put Pentecostal is M or Lutheranism in this message don't you try to hinder the most holy thing I've ever put my hands on just preach a message come on somebody I ain't disregarding Luther and I ain't disregarding Wesley but this message is the most holy thing that I can give to our young people that's why I want to preach it to them with everything that's with within me because it will give them power to [Applause] overcome don't take my message from [Applause] me let me say you're going to get into some spots in this land but it's still for you and when it looks like that you're not going to go over there and possess what those jebusites are on let me say this to you as we I I got more material here on this than you can ever imagine but when you get up against that mountain and it looks bigger than you just whisper at it your mine your mind that's what you did Brother Randall you got some big mountains in your way just looked over that and your mine every one of you say sitting here every one of you sitting here is a miracle by God's grace and whether you share your testimony or not let me say this to you your life proves who you are I really don't care if you post it on the Internet or not but I believe it'll help somebody I'm not pushing you to do that but I want you to live this message because if you live this message I have done my job you take what I'm giving you let me let me say this you take what I'm giving you let me say this I don't know how to heal brother on all I know how to do is preach a message and God will back up his word I don't know how it's all going to come to pass but if I can preach the message and you can accept it it's liberty it'll do its job [Applause] if we live another 30 or 40 years let me tell you all of us the whole dynamics of this church is going to change I don't think we got that long I had some nut right me this week and told me that we still had to 2030 to live that the Rapture was in 2030 bless another idiot going to come by my way thank God for the idiots they keep us fresh sorry I must have grabbed a hold of Matthew's notes man wo you ain't got to listen to this but y'all do but if we live another 30 years the whole Dynamics are going to change I keep preaching the way I'm preaching in 30 years you're going to send me down the road in a casket I mean really the Dynamics are going to change so we ought to prepare we ought to prepare for the coming of the Lord today but if it ain't for another 30 more years let's live this message with everything that's within us well has it been shown to you brother Andrew whether you're going in the Rapture you're going by the way of the Grave I don't have it by Vision but I do have it by scripture that they that are alive and remain and right now I F fill that portion come on somebody what land are you talking about I'm talking about 1 John 4:14 that greater is he that is in you than
