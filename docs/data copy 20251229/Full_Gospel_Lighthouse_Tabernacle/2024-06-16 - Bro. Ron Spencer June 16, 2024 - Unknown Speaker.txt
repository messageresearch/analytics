pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen and amen Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 you can be seated amen finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil we've got a showdown we got a showdown for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand in the evil day and and having done all to stand stand therefore are you with me having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GED about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God notice these next words praying all always most powerful weapon that you've got and with with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints in Jude chapter 1 and verse 34 Jude chapter 1 and verse 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling let's read this together now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy now remember this God don't fail God don't quit that's right God's always on time you are not an accident you are not an accident you're not an afterthought of God God thought of you before the foundation of the world he didn't pick you to lose he didn't pick you to be an example of what a failure is he picked you to be an overcomer [Applause] Hallelujah now overcoming means that you're going to have to fight with things and wrestle with things and you're going to have to be in some battles there are no perfect days tell your neighbor there are no perfect days I find it amazing that you and I need vacation I I I enjoy vacations I really do I enjoy it I like vacations but the devil never takes a day [Applause] off so no matter where you go top of the mountain down to the beach wherever you go I find that that we escape from our normal little world and we go to a place to where we find that we're going to get some peace and Harmony and some quiet time and a million other people have the same idea and you're standing in a line behind a thousand people vacation so God called you to use you he sent the greatest message in the world to you of all of the generations he gave you the best message that he could give you this message from all the way from 49 all the way to the end and continuation with the greatest preachers there are on the Earth all over the world new New Zealand's a good example Australia All Over The World God has armed men of God to be cheerleaders in front of audience and congregation we can overcome we're going to win here God's going to have a bride we're going to stand on streets of gold we're not going to be defeated and Men of God all over the world stand to Their audience whether it's small or large and they stand there and scream and cheer the people on and take the word of God notice heavens and earth will pass away are you with me but his word uh when you think about heavens and earth passing away but his words will never pass away now let remember remember this a Believer is one that takes the word of God and speaks it and go forward sometimes we get the idea that that that we're standing alone but God never tells you to do something and then not back it up are you with me he gives a vision then you believe the vision and then you walk walk into it none of us have been asked to build a boat that all the animals can get in but one man had to take God at his word and work on an ark for 120 years and everybody said it's not going to rain everybody said well you know what a horrible Ark that you're building it won't float just give God time amen Moses stood there before one of the greatest bloodbaths that was ever going to take place with the children of Israel behind him believing the message that he had been preaching now this time and they had seen the plagues and they had seen the signs and wonders and the greatest army in the world had turned them loosen now there's going to be a blood bath and he be to cry out to God and God as God asked him why are you crying out to me speak and go forward do we really think that this message has brought us to this spot I'm challenging you now do we really think that God has brought us to this spot before resurrection and Rapture for it to not take place [Music] tell your children get them ready we're getting ready to have a body change here brother Ron I don't see much going on listen just let me just give you a couple of things that happened this week that has historical importance the G7 convention and the pope is one of the leading speakers at artificial intelligence well he's qualified to give that cuz he's head of hybrid religion Russia brother Bram taught us watch Russia and here we have Russia with the atomic nuclear Arsenal at Cuba oh brother Ron they're just playing games really really there's going to be a time that we're going to come God allows them to come up to a certain spot and then backs them off there's going to be a time that they come up to the spot to where it's time for fulfillment and let me just remind you it isn't about Russia there's great Believers there are you with me we're all from different countries we're represent different countries in that day but let me just say this you it isn't about it isn't about all Russia it's about you being ready it's you being ready you having the token I was thinking this week people have a lot of trouble believing for the supernatural realm folks we're promised a body change folks we're we're promised a body change well SS don't prove it it don't matter we're promised a body change that's what this message has been about to get you ready for the Rapture Hallelujah you believe that so far are you with to me we're near home we're real near home the scripture says and I just quoted it Matthew 24:35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away you read a letter edition of your Bible if you need that but my wordss shall not pass away I want us to read those that scripture together Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away in Matthew chapter 4 and verse three and when the tempter came to him and said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written brother random said he did not use his power because he knew you was coming along and you would need to be able to use the weapon that you have it is written it isn't about your emotions it isn't about what you feel Hey listen when you feel like the world is spinning and you've got the tiger by the tail you know everything's great but when you in the dark caves of your life and you want to cry that the Rocks fall on you it doesn't matter how you feel it is written man shall not live by bread alone let's finish this but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God how do we defeat the Devil by the word of God the scripture says and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him God will respond don't you worry God will respond to your situation 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through the pulling down of strongholds casting down every imagination and every High thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of God and bringeth into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ brother brandham answers a Critic how do you feel brother brandham when you stand there and you see the people coming out in different languages and things are you afraid no sir no sir he told me he told me so he said so never been afraid Yet brother Brandon's been in some spots cuse he told me so and I believe it's the truth notice these words if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington tomorrow morning I'd invite the whole world come and see it done bring every get every critic that you can to stand them around and you're going to see the glory of God set that chair over there over here and where that you can sit down and rest a little while and he'll be here in just a few moments I noticed last night yesterday I struggled I I studied all week as we do and studied all we week and yesterday morning I got up and it was gone oh Lord oh lord it's gone so I I studied in this room and I studied in that room and I studed over here finally I took a walk and I said well I'm going to go back to where I I got the inspiration so I walked in I sat down on a certain chair and I was sitting there and it begin to flow wow wow why did all this happen then when Andrew was preaching last night I thought me and him are preaching the same sermons and he's going first and I hope he leaves me something over in the maps but you know he begin to say there's going to be a miracle here tonight there's going to be a miracle here tonight and no doubt the enemy I heard you say it the enemy gets in your face whenever you you step out on faith whenever you walk out in the water when you step out in the Red Sea can you imagine how many people heard brother brandom say this if God told me to go raise George Washington can you imagine what the backlash in that audience was but I also heard brother Andrew say something last night that's in my notes there's another Elijah coming there's another one coming you miss this one in Gentiles but there's another one coming but it's not to you it's to the Jews and listen you and I have to take a Rapture so he and Moses can come there's 144,000 Jews that's got to hear the message of the hour so we've got to take a rapure there's got to be events happen well brother Ron I don't believe believe brother Brandon was a prophet I don't believe he was Elijah well you won't believe that there's going to be Elijah in Israel either if you can't believe this one you won't believe that one are you getting where I'm at so the devil will give you questions and doubts and fears and frustrations and all these different kind of things in every service but you have to turn him on his [Music] heels you have to turn him on his heels when he comes to your Pew and begins to cause you to doubt you go ahead put your put your finger on your chest you now he says here he said then today they they have the nerve to say wonder whatever happened in the god of the Bible where is that God why you choked him out by your Creeds you choked him out by your Traditions you placed him way back there in history he is a god of history and what he waiting on today he's that same God of history and then when Moses called him out at the Red Sea the god of History Rose Way up and Joshua called the god of history at Jordan and he rose up up and made a way and when Daniel called on him in a fiery furnace he made a way and in the Lions then and the Hebrew children in a fiery furnace he made a way he's still the same God of History he's waiting for his people to call him out of History the same God remains God the same God remains God he's God forever can you say it he's my God now let me explain something to you this really hit me when I was a young Christian God is not a man to where that he loses power so God can save the worst sinner in the whole world he can save the worst sinner in the whole world it does not diminish his power any any now you and I have people that we don't think will'll ever be saved but what about a man that killed 37 murdered 37 different people you and I may have limitations but that man is a believer that man is a Believer we could go to a sister and all the Deery of the world but when God Saves them it's as though she never did it in the first place man's Grace is much different than God's grace sometimes we don't think well go there's a certain limit of of of sickness and and you know once it goes by a certain limit that you know this is now out of the hands of God are you serious are you serious Lazarus is a good [Applause] example worms are now crawling in his body whether you know it or not you can have the best casket you can have the best mortician you can have all that but about after 4 days you're a wormy sack me yeah that's why you put perfume on that's why you have to bathe that's why you need to brush your teeth turn to your neighbor bathe brush your teeth it'll be easier to set beside of you if you you bathe and brush your [Music] teeth but just give it four days after death and worms start eating your body worms that you have been feeding fet Manan flounder come on Crow ATS salad mine don't get a lot of salad the only thing I like green is jello honest to God Boy Scout honor without hope Lazarus was without hope but Jesus called him by name he called him by name and when he stepped out of the Grave he told him take off his grave clothes he's not going to need them no more then he told him said let's eat so a man that had worms crawling through him come now had a change your clothes and now was eating with Jesus well brother Ron I don't know if I can believe Hey listen just look across this audience there's some wormy people here only a few days or months or years ago they were dead in sin worms crawling all through them but God changed the grave clothes of their life changed their neighbor CH Hallelujah and now they're sitting at the same table with you they're eating they're they're fellowshipping they're enjoying it unbelief but does not do nothing but condemn the unbeliever I want you to remember a principal theme Satan may put a curse on your life but it's only effective if you believe [Applause] it he may try to put a curse on your life but it's only effective if you believe it you got depression and listen you can go to doctors and give you all kind of labels but it's only effective if you believe it we had a boss named Charlie Charlie was a good guy we all love Charlie and Charlie was a guy that you know know was always nervous about everything and so I told the boys we needed Charlie to be away cuz we wanted to have a picnic we were making bombs and today we decided to have a picnic and we didn't need Charlie there Charlie Charlie might get too nervous at our picnic and uh I told the boys I said every time Charlie walks by you tell him how bad he looks and so he walked by me and I said Charlie you feeling okay buddy well he after he done walked about past 10 people he said you know what I came in this morning I was feeling really good but you know how I really ain't feeling that good about 15 minutes after I talked to him he was gone he checked out he went home he was gone to three days we had a wonderful picture picnic we got our work done but we had a wonderful picnic why don't you tell the devil when he comes picking on you Satan you don't look so good are you feeling all right you don't look so good your bite is not as bad as it used to be and your howling is getting all soft and wimpy you used to be a really bad devil but you're kind of a wimp anymore he wants to talk to you you talk back to [Applause] him now God is true to his promises he says no matter what he has to do now think about this no matter what he has to do he will bankrupt Heavens before he will let his word go defeated I want you to think about that God will bankrupt heaven right before he lets this message not have a rapture I'm going to I'm not going to shout right here but I sure feel like it now God asked us to believe for the impossible because he's able to do that which is impossible Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but with strong giving praise unto God God wants you to do the miraculous right he's not just talking to preachers here your child gets a fever it's a got a tooth AE it's got an earache you Faithful moms and dads lay your hands on that baby doll and believe God wants you to do the miraculous he wants you to believe the mirac ulace and by accepting it by faith you prove what you believe he is you see it God wants you to take his word for it he speaks it and if God has said it all heavens and earth will pass away but his word can't pass brother Ron I don't know if I can you don't have to he's already conquered for you Lord he's already conquered for you we just claim the promise and go and take it it's already conquered death's conquered hell's conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered all Devils is conquered hell is conquered death is conquered the grave is conquered and we stand in the gate taking it don't have to to fire a shot it's already been paid for on Sunday afternoon I was called to Sister Betty aers Betty Morris aer's bedside She Was preparing to pass away she was still conscious she was very much alert and after Sunday when I preach here I'm generally just toast and so I just told I said please forgive me I can't I can't get there tonight I'm I'm just too tired so on Monday morning at 9:00 I showed up at the hospital at Rockingham Memorial all of her family was there which which we know their family I'd like to thank everybody that was at the funeral yesterday on Friday and so so anyway I walked in her son Joe is actually the one that was uh on the life saving Squad that that actually helped save my life when I was burned in the burned in the fire and so um just to give you an idea my throat was sealing shut and it and your throat just becomes if it's burned it just becomes plastic and it just melts together and then you can't get oxygen so he was able to run just the smallest tube and get it in just in seconds and in time which is incredibly important and so he called his mother and said you'll never believe who I've got in the ambulance and his brother Ron can you please pray so I know their family very well and so and so anyway sister Betty was a real believer her husband Milton real Believers and and so so anyway anyway I I show up and I begin to talk to her about what's getting ready to happen that person that's going to walk in into this room

that comes in this Clinic going I don't need pain medicine medicine he said every patient I see needs more pain medicine well I got [Applause] it now brother Brandon makes an incredible statement he said don't underestimate Jesus Christ Christ I think that's incredible don't underestimate Jesus Christ will you stand Jay I I want you I want you to stand and wave at this audience don't underestimate Jay I'm going to tell you something you may not know about it Jay is the best tennis player that ever come out of this church sorry let me brag on you so if you are his opponent and you walked out looking at Jay you would think I'm going to have a good day here today but after Jay got done with you you can say I underestimated come on church I'm getting you here I'm doing this for a purpose I'm doing this for a purpose when demons are assigned to your house they may think that they're going to have a good day well they have underestimated you [Applause] Hallelujah and after you whip them all day long and turn them loose and they go tucking their tail back to hell and they beg the devil don't send us back to that house no more brother BR said God has to have somebody that's

we I I want you to say it with me now I'm going to say it and I want you to say it come here turn around look at that dude you look good my God God has to have has to have somebody somebody that's not scared that's not scared brother Rond you mean to tell me that God that the devil is scared of that guy right there he's terrified he's terrified of that guy right there cuz he won't stay this size and about six more months he's going to be taller than the pastor maybe not heavier but taller and what you do with your lips you will tell the devil he is defeated now go ahead and tell him you're defeated you're defeated you're conquered you're conquered in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ than brother Ron that's real silly what you just did well I did that about what 15 years ago at your church in a camp meeting and I pulled a little boy up and now that little boy's a preacher so sometimes things are not as silly as it looks don't you love the Lord now uh this is my favorite scripture so if you'll give me a pass what shall we then say to these things Romans 8:31 well brother Ron that just works in church it works in your business it works in your home it works in your relationships I'm giving you equipment that you can defeat the Devil anywhere any place anytime are you with me are you with me and what should we then say to these things let's read it together if God before us who can be against us that was really nice for a first grade class let's read let's let's let's put some passion in it if God be for us who can be against [Applause] uses Psalms 46 and verse one God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble brother Ron Christians have trouble how many of you had trouble this week isn't that amazing did anybody not have any trouble no brother Mike didn't have no trouble but he was putting on his glasses I say it again did anybody have trouble this week and you still showed up you still showed up I'd give you an exercise to get up and look at the seat that you're sitting on but you're feeling the seat that Satan tried your best to not let you set in this week he did all that to you and you still showed [Applause] up now a contest if we could go unbelief belief a contest is a test of strength now in the olden days I wasn't there I'm not that old but in the olden days there was an Indian tradition of who was the strongest and they would build a fire have a rope and they would pull their opponent Into the Fire and that would say who is the strongest now it wasn't for husband and wife amen it was not isn't that good news so what I'm here today is trying to drop something into your heart take a hold to the Rope pull the devil Into the Fire now let me let me just give you a couple more things before we let you go Satan has tried every scheme that he can to discredit this Satan's tried everything that he could to discredit him discredit you he's tried to get him to take the kingdom without suffering he tried to get him to take it without Redemption when he was up on the Mount of Temptation he tried to give him the kingdom but God knew that it was going to take Calvary to redeem you are you with me now now I want you to remember who you are and I have quote the scripture way too much ye are of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you go ahead and finish it Greater is he that is in you in the face of all doubt God goes right on and proves his word un Bel does not stop God it doesn't hinder him I don't care how much the world unbeliev it it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever so you've got neighbors you've got family and when you tell them that you drive four hours to church and you tell them it's worth it amen how many wants to get in the same van with you they laugh they make fun they say all the different kind of things but you believe are you with me all of you you believe and Believers [Applause] believe unbelief does not stop God it only stops the unbeliever are you with me oh I love it don't you and God is true to his promise God doesn't make a promise he can't keep God is not a politician he's not after your vote he's your god brother Ron but I I I sometimes I just I just need more strength well let me give you a couple more quotes Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I come in this Duel of Faith challenging you not in my my own power or name you know that I could not do that but I come as a representative of Jesus Christ claiming the Divine gift that was ministered to me by an Angel telling me to get the people to believe that the sickness would not stand before them with all sincere prayer was made and I pray sincerely to God therefore you cannot hold this woman any longer I charge thee by the Son of God Jesus Christ come out of this woman and it left I like results Satan an angel of God came 14 years ago to Greens Mill one night and told me as a local Minister that I was sent to pray for the sick and this is what was told and you're aware and you're exposed you can't you can have unbelief in the people you can make people doubt but you can't make Christ do anything because he has stripped you of every legal right that you ever had when he died at Calvary he paid the debt of all sin and unbelief and God has given his servants power to cast you out and I use his name I come in the name of Jesus Christ I challenge you to a d of Faith leave this girl come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ now he says now I'm going to pray for you the Bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up and if I have found Grace in The Blessed God may this be the night that you'll they'll never forget May the Holy Spirit Come into every heart just now and just move out all everything and all the sickness from their body I challenge the devil to a debate now watch what he does Satan you are aware that you're whipped ain't that great ain't that great that makes you just want to shout right there Satan you're aware that you're whipped you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you of every Authority that you had and when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff and you know that when the Lord came to to the tree and he cursed the tree the next day it was withered and the Lord said to his disciples have faith in God for if you say shall say if if ye shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said is coming to pass you can have what you have said Satan you know the scripture on that and I have just taught this people that that it's God in them and if God is in them they can speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart and right then that disease has to move for Christ said so for it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwells in them that's speaking they're in need so come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ I say as a servant of God by the message from the angel who is Anointed and has proved to the people that Jesus is here and the message is right come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ I jur you to leave every sick Merc and get into outer darkness in the name of Jesus Christ and about that time a wind blows through the building are you with me can you give me just a couple more minutes and Jesus said unto him no man Haven have put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God right and in 28 and 18 Matthew and Jesus came and spake unto them and saying all power is given in heaven and in Earth in John chap 15 and verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I love this next quote I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God tell the devil don't know what to do with him can that be you are you with me now this weekend you have been challenged to believe in the Supernatural as the listen this audience ought to believe it like never before you have been challenged to believe but yet the devil will fight you not necessarily this church but he will fight you because let me just say something to you brother Shannon you're not going to stay baldheaded you either he's not going to leave you out Stephen you're not going to stay a child you're not going to stay old the promise is given to you so he will fight you on little elements he'll fight you in your home did you hear me he'll fight you in your car he'll fight you in your mind it's the greatest battle that's ever fought because you have a promise you have a promise you have a promise you have a promise every person in this building unseen and seen you ought to say This Promise is for [Music] me don't let the devil say I don't know if you're going to make it or not you're not going to be worthy of it you're going to be left out let me just say it's for every one of us and I finish last night you heard there's going to be a miracle in this building amen well let me just give you a little another piece of advice there's going to be a great big
