second everyone for their their prayers and thank everyone for what y'all did for me and Sarah and Uriah the last couple weeks and especially the prayers when we left church Saturday night four weeks ago and didn't expect to have a baby soon but we ended up going into she ended up being induced and I'm just thankful for everything God did and just real quick just wanted to say a quick testimony about about that situation of course we go in and Sarah's numbers were way higher than what they should have been and a lot of levels and once they told us naturally they walk in the room and say hey you're not leaving until the baby's coming there's a lot of stress there's a lot of anxiety that falls on you especially at two o'clock in the morning when you're ready to sleep and I asked Sarah I said what is there anything I can do for you and she she said the statement I just really need God to hug me and at that point God dropped down into her heart a vision that brother Andrew had told us about that God had shown him back before our gender reveal actually before right when we first found out we were even expecting we didn't tell anybody so there was no way for him to know but he we went back actually found the service and brother Andrew was walking across the we were praying for people here at the altar and brother Andrew had a vision that Sarah was holding holding a baby boy and I asked him when he told me I said well did he tell you the name because we were holding the name as well he said no he just told me that he was going to be okay and so we had kind of attributed it to a couple of different situations but then in that moment it gave Sarah and I as much peace as we needed and doctors even told us they said well you gotta seem pretty peaceful about this whole situation like if you knew it if you knew what we knew we know that everything's gonna be okay so we're just I'm just thankful for a supernatural God that that shows those things and is with us in those moments it's just Bauer heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful to come and come and be able to be in your presence this week after all the storms and all the trials that each and every one of us has been through during the week Lord and it's a it's a place that we can come and find Refuge as we know that you can come and sweep through our homes and sweep through our cars as we are worshiping and spending a moment with you in prayer Lord but just to come into a building that a building that we know that there's no change that's going to hold us back there's there's nothing that's going to come and hinder our worship but we have ministers that will come and they believe in the in the true God of today a true God that is the same yesterday today and forever and he can come and show the supernatural when they will yield themselves to a gift and we're so thankful for that as we're so blessed to have ministers that stand behind this pulpit and preach a truth to us and even when it cuts even when it hits deep we know that it's correcting we know that love is correcting Lord we hear each and every one of the prayer requests that's came forth and we see the storms and the storm that came so abruptly there for the the burner family you know you know that situation you know exactly how to bring peace we don't have answers in all the storms that we will face but we know that there is not one thing that comes and surprises you all we need to do is just lean upon your Everlasting hand that that's going to be with us in those moments and just pray for peace pray for comfort because we know that that Spirit can just you can just send it right by our way Lord and we ask that your healing hand come and just speak Miracles and bring miracles to our lives Lord Jesus I just ask that you'll just come tonight use the minister of the hour and allow him to just use that inspiration that you've given to him this week use it and just yield himself once more he yields himself every weekend yields himself through the weeks and we're just so thankful for that because if it was just us as men we would be nothing but Lord God it's you that comes and uses us as vessels Lord and we just ask that you'll just speak to every need tonight and we thank you for what you're about to do in Jesus name we pray thank you yes I will receive the seasons often give

Shekinah Glory that would come down upon the Tabernacle of wilderness Lord and the children of Israel would recognize that you are in the camp but Lord they would see you come time and maybe one year you'd come and as the high priest would enter in but Lord every single one of us sitting here under the sound of of your word tonight we are here as high priest we enter into your Shekinah Glory Lord in the message has awakened us to recognize that thy Shekinah Glory is here Lord It's never failing it's never going to leave us where we are it's not leaving us in our situations of life and Lord we want our praise to come before the God Lord let us be dead into the things of the world father Lord that we wouldn't hear what the rest of the world has got to say Lord but may the veil of the Holy Ghost drop around us Lord Jesus Lord that we couldn't hear what's going on around but Lord May the world hear us praising the god of Abraham Isaac and Israel Lord I pray father that tonight that as we would enter into your house Lord with Thanksgiving in our heart Lord Jesus Lord we know that you are here for your people you are here because of your word's sake father lord it's not because of men it's not because of a building Lord men can build all types of buildings Lord Arenas and and different places have their kind of atmosphere but you are here because the word father Lord your children have gathered in your name and we recognize where two are gathered there you are so tonight we recognize that the god of the Bible has come into this room to declare himself as God and Lord we want our lips Lord not to be given over to men's service of lip service of men but Lord we want our lips to give praise to the god of the Bible Lord we know that you have something in store for us tonight lord it's very special Lord the atmosphere tells us that it's special Lord your presence here Lord that's moving on your people Lord I feel the effect of it Lord as it's working on their lives Lord Lord they just want to lift up their voice and shout hallelujah they want to lift up their hands and they want to sing out a song and praise you and father I pray Lord that you just minister to them in a special way Lord this subject that we take tonight is very dear to our hearts Lord Jesus it means it means a whole lot to me father and I would ask Lord that you would come and give us Grace father tonight Lord we're your children and Lord you know our needs so father we come before you and ask God that you take control of this service control of our lives and you just be be here ever present in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look into a few scriptures here over in the Book of Psalms chapter 113. Psalms 113 verse 1. then down to First Corinthians chapter 2. verse 9. Hallelujah do you love the Lord this evening amen Psalms 113. praise ye the Lord praise all you Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forevermore from the rising of the Sun and to the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised the Lord is high above all nations and His glory above the heavens who is likened to our God who dwelleth on high who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in Earth he raises up the poor Out of the Dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill that he may set him with princes even the princes of his people he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be joyful mother of children praise ye the Lord First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9. First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9. but at his as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we may might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord and we we see here by our scripture reading here tonight that we see that God's thoughts and his secrets are only understood by the spirit and if we're going to ever know or gain any knowledge from almighty God we're going to have to have the same Spirit of the one that wrote the word and we recognize that the Bible is very clear upon this point and we see that these scriptures line out according to what Moses said in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 that the secret things belong unto the Lord but the things which are revealed belong unto us and we recognize immediately that there is something that is given unto us which is faith that is a revelation and we recognize immediately that the word of the Lord is very very special under the Church of the Living God we we recognize without that word that we are absolutely nothing we recognize without without his power that we are powerless and we we recognize that the one that is amongst us is the god of the Bible and you remember when when brother Branham is laying or he's heading out to go do a little squirrel hunting one morning and he goes out there and there before him it's early before the Sun is up and he's walking out there and there appears unto him three or three rainbows and he said he said whatever it was it was alive it was pulsating unto him he said there was one on the left and one on the right and one there in the center and he was drawn he was drawn to what he had seen sitting there and he was he was heading out there and he started walking towards it and the angel of the Lord said that's close enough and he brother Brandon said I screamed out Lord what would you have your servant to know and he said these words the Lord spoke these words that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and he said that was confirming my message of him that the 31 years of my Ministry was not in vain and the thing that we recognize that this is not the message of a man that belongs to us but this is the message of the Lamb that belongs unto us and tonight by the help of the Lord I want to step into something that is very very special to me something that has been upon my heart for quite some time but I would like to speak to you something tonight just for a few moments on the God that I know the God that I know and I know that I'm stepping into something rather special here but I know I don't know too much about the gods of the world I don't know too much about the gods of what men say is there God out there I don't know too much about the gods of basketball or the gods of baseball or the god of football I don't know too much about Michael Jordan's stats and I can't say that he's my God I'm not that kind of a man I enjoy those things in a certain element but that's not my God I I don't know those things I don't know all the stats I don't know about King James I don't know all of his stats but I do know some stats about this King James and I'll tell you that this King James has never led me wrong and I'll tell you you can look at a man of basketball that they call King James and he's got so many records and he's got so many wins but there is going to come a time when he is defeated but this King James version has never been defeated and it never will be defeated because it is the very written word of almighty God I don't know what what men say is the god that they know but the God that I do know is is very much alive he's he's very much patient with his children he's he's so powerful that he wants to show his power to his children and to me tonight to know that I I don't know the god that Elvis is I don't know the god of Michael Jackson I don't know the god of music but I do know the God of this Bible I don't know what they call the goat or what is the greatest of all time but I do know the lamb that is the greatest of all time I I can tell you about a God that I do know it and to thinks that tonight in my little finite mind that I don't fully understand who God is or or I don't know everything about God because it's not revealed unto me everything about God but what I do know what I do know about God it's too wonderful that it can't be contained in books I'm like John said in John 21 and 25 that the works that the lord they're not already in here but if they were that every book could not be able to contain them and the things that I know about my God they are so powerful and they're so wonderful if I could take the time just for a moment and tell you about the God that I know we would be here for 10 weeks telling you about the God that I've seen throughout the Bible I'll tell you the God that I know he is a living God he's so great that books can't contain him he's so alive that the grave can't hold him he's so great that death couldn't stop him he's so wonderful he's so powerful there's no power that can combat him he is so merciful that his Mercy is far-reaching his grace is sufficient his love is Limitless his blood is powerful enough to forgive any sin no matter how bad it is no matter what situation that you got yourself in the God that I know has got a blood that's bigger than his sin it's bigger than your family problems it's greater than your alcohol problems it's greater than your drug problems the God that I know is the god that can get you out of the pit I'll tell you the God that I know he declares himself as one God he's not three Gods he's not a weak God he's not a Lesser God he is my God Hallelujah he's a my God and I can tell you about my God that I know because the Bible said who he is he is and the Bible said that when Stephen was standing there and he gave his sermon after after he had been stoned and after he stood there and declared who Jesus was the Bible said that Stephen looked up and saw on the right hand of almighty God he saw Jesus standing there but that does not mean there is another God but the right hand of God means the authority of almighty God and Jesus is there as the authority of God's word you see he's there at the right hand of power you see he said after his resurrection after he had resurrected from the grave he said all power in heaven and in Earth is given unto me and if there was if there was some of the god there's some God a pair if there's three gods that means that that God that's up there is powerless but because there is one God he's heaven and he is on Earth he's between the earth he's in everything you can't go to hell without finding God you can go to a big chamber without finding God you can't go to a devil's hair without hearing about God I know we live in an atheistic and an agnostic world where they don't want to talk about God but I'm one man that knows God and I'm not going to shut up about my God he's so big I Gotta Serve him he's so wonderful I gotta Praise Him [Applause] Hallelujah he's one God I tell you what the Bible said or what we recognize is that men have taken the Bible and misconstrued the Bible and they tried to make God complicated but God ain't complicated it's the people that make God complicated but God's real simple I'll declare it to you like this ain't but one God and his name is Jesus [Applause] now we know that Jesus told us in John 14 and 17 that even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because the Sea of him not and neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and William random said this he said but I think that the main thing that I'm trying to do or to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ notice that's the main thing it wasn't to bring some idea it wasn't to bring somebody he wasn't to bring his own knowledge but the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ and you may not feel him here tonight you may not sense him here tonight but he's here because the Bible said that he would be here and that's just good enough for me I can take his word to the bank and it will be fulfilled there is men that will let you down but this Bible will never let you down there is men that will fail you but this Bible will never fail you I'll tell you how amazing it is it's so amazing that the God that I know he will lead you through trials and he'll make you the Conqueror it's amazing to know that the headship of Heaven has come down to the body and he's identified himself with a body by identifying himself and proving that he is the headship so what you are seeing in your brothers and your sisters is the very expression of almighty God by his Jean seed he is saying that you are his private property when he places his seal upon your life of the Holy Ghost you are God is saying that's my Prophet property that's my personal property that means that Satan cannot touch you at all because you're God's private property you see when sickness comes by your way you can say the God that I know said that he sealed me he filled me and I can say God you are obligated to your word turn on your devil right here the one that you created to be destroyed by my lips you can say to that devil I'm God's private property let me tell you there's some things that I have of property there's some things of houses of lands and cars and things that are my profit property I've got titles to them I've got Deeds to them but what I'm talking about tonight is that you are God's promise that God has a title deed for who you are that when the lamb stood up John was weeping a bear in Revelation chapter five but there came a voice behind them said weak not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and he is more than able to open the Seven Seals you're not serving a God that you don't know what she's talking about he knows what he's talking about he's not going to leave you here with a closed book you need to change what you're thinking about you're not serving a God that's got seven unknown Thunders you're serving a God that's released the word and you are now understanding what those seven Thunders are the God that I know has not left you here unequipped it's amazing to think that you are so important to God that God predetermined your comings and he predetermined your going that's why the Bible said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sinneth in the seat of the scornful so what is God saying that I know your position I know your position he raises the poor Out of the Dust he lifted up the needy out of the dung heel that he may set him with princes even with the princes of people so Paul is recognizing here that he that he takes it through the scripture that he could say to these things what shall we say to these things if God before us then who can be against us so Paul recognized how powerful his God was it didn't matter what he was going through in the Roman jail it didn't matter what they did to him if it's receiving 39 Stripes he still could say if God before me who can be against me you know one of the most powerful scriptures that ever was recorded was recorded by a false prophet one of the most powerful scriptures that that is that is laid here in the scriptures is there in numbers 23 and 19 when baylock was was trying to get Balaam to curse God's people but the Bible said watch how the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Balaam and he said God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or have he spoken and shall he not make it good behold I have received a commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it you see the God that I know cannot put a curse and curse upon his children sickness might come against you curses may come against you but the God that I know did not curse you hallelujah what was Bala trying to do he was trying to stop the Church of the Living God from going on higher but balak didn't hinder him the fall didn't hinder God lot didn't hinder God Judas didn't hinder God Skeptics never have and critics never will hinder my God sickness will not hinder my God cancer will not hinder my God that's why Paul could say when he was tied to a Roman Jayla that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me he knew that the god of Moses was the god of Paul Hallelujah Paul understood his weakness he understood his Humanity therefore he could say in second Corinthians 12 and 10 therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities and reproaches in necessities and persecutions in the stress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong Paul recognized that he was not God he recognized he was not all-powerful he recognized that he was not the omnipresent one but he recognized that the God that he was serving was he recognized that God ain't changing he ain't moving he ain't backing up off of his provinces he is the all-powerful one I'll tell you the God that I know he's watching over you when you're asleep he's watching you over when you're in your bid he's watching over you the God that I know who was who is and will forever be the one that spoke it and it was good the one that said let there be light and there was light the same one that did those sayings is the invisible God that's made visible right here by the actions of his word that's why Zephaniah 3 and 17 declares to us the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over the evil singing I said God that I know the God I know gives strength to the weak the God I know gives power to the faint the God I know gives rest to the weary the God I know gives sight to the blind and when it came to the man in John chapter 9 that the Bible said that he was blind since his birth for the glory of the Lord and when Jesus walked by him and he touched him and he healed him there there began to be a great story amongst the Pharisees and and the religions of the world of that day they begin to ask him said is this man a sinner they ask his parents but his parents didn't want to be kicked out of the synagogue so they said demands of his age go and asked him and they said is this man a sinner and the blind man said I don't know whether it's a sin or not but this I do know that I once was blind but now I see he could say the God that I know is a living God he's the god of Abraham he's the god of Moses he's the god of Jacob he's the god that made Enoch walk he's the god that opened my eyes I can say the same thing I once was blind I once was lost but now I'm failed I could say the same thing like David said oh Lord set me on a rock [Applause] Hallelujah you have to go find that out whether it's a sin or not but I do know this he's still the same yesterday today and forever well you say brother Andrew I can't serve I can't serve that God well don't you worry I'm talking about the God that I know if you don't want to hear about the God that I know you have the right to be dismissed right now but if you want to hear some more about the God that I know the God that I know is real the god that heals cancer the god that heals TP the god through us who is and forever will be [Applause] [Music] Paul said in Philippians 3 and 10 that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death a lot of people want to know him in his power but a lot of people don't want to know him in his sufferings but to know someone is different than just saying you know of that person or you've heard of him or or you know their parents or you know where they grew up you see there was a lot of people that said That's The Carpenter's son there was a lot of people that looked Upon Jesus and they recognized him that was that little boy that could take toys and make them live that was that little boy that went down there at 12 years old and he and he blew the mind of the of the Great Men of that day but they didn't know him but when the field when Philip and Nathaniel met him he said Thou Art the Son of God what was it Revelation had opened himself up to our disciple brothers that they could know the god of the Bible so just to say that you know him or you know of him it does not mean that you know him you see you cannot say you cannot say you know somebody unless you met them personally come on somebody there's a whole lot of people that's been in spots they've been in spots where celebrities are but that doesn't mean that they know them celebrities come on now but I'm living in a spot that all the celebrities of Hell know who I am they've come in contact with me and they know that I believe this Bible they know I have power to cast out Devils they know I have power to glory on on the Elders of the church and their hands on the sick and they shall recover that's why them demons are scared tonight is because if you get this knowledge Satan knows that if the true church ever gets a true revelation of who she is and what she can do that she can do the Greater Works that she will be an invincible Army Satan knows these things he knows he Saints but I know him I know him you watch the context of the message throughout its entirety you you'll find that you only can know God by faith you do not know God by intellect you do not know God by by science or or ideas you know God by faith you know God by simple child like Faith to accept his word is to say that it's truth and believe it that's how you know God is by faith you see faith is something that is born in you something that God give you you see that's where it comes from through here there through the unadulterated power of the Lord Jesus Christ that makes a new creature a new person he baptizes him Anew in the Holy Spirit and when that man he washes him he hangs him up and seals him into the kingdom of God then he stand there and he knows where he's at you see if you really know where you are it doesn't matter if everybody turns their back on you or not if you know where you are it doesn't matter if every devil in hell is trained it's gone against you if you know where you are if you know who you believe if you know what you understand is the truth and now let me say that this is not a knowledge that you've garnered from some men but this is a knowledge that you've garnered from The Living Word you see there's a lot of men that will run away and hide because they don't know the god of the Bible and and there's many times when men go to pray for certain needs or or they go to go to confessing certain parts of the promises of God they cannot contain them and they can't put their full port full force of authority behind it it's because they don't know it there's a lot of people that don't know that God still gives a Holy Ghost but I do know this because I recognized that he gave it to me and if he gave it to me I'm not nobody more special than anybody else in the economy of God so if I know that he gave the Holy Ghost to me I know he can give the Holy Ghost to you there's a whole lot of people that don't believe in laying on the hands and they don't believe in this that or the other but I know that the god of the Bible ain't changed the god of the message ain't changed so I can stand here and I can preach the entirety of the message I can believe with all my heart and I can sit here and know that you can have whatsoever you desire because I know I know say how do you know it's like when Peter was standing there with Jesus and cicery Philippi he's standing there and asking me he said whom do men say that I the son of man am there were some other people that were saying that we know him as John the Baptist and lies and one of the prophets but he didn't ask them that who no men say he said but whom do you say that I am you see it's it comes down to a personal revelation who do you say Jesus is come on somebody who do you say Jesus is he just a was he just a prophet was he just a good man that had good teachings went about healing people or was he God and then he said Thou Art the Christ for thou art the Christ the son of the Living God what did Jesus turn around and say to him he said Peter he said Flesh and Blood didn't give this to you you didn't gather this knowledge from your father that was a great message believer you gathered this knowledge from my Father which is in heaven here Peter was standing on Earth but heaven was revealing itself to somebody right here in the room that's the same thing that's happening right now there's somebody that's revealing that God is revealing himself to him that he's still a Healer he's still a way maker he's still a promise keeper you can say like Peter said thou like the Crush let me tell you something it ain't no good if I can preach this message with all of my heart and they don't live on Monday let me tell you if I know God don't have no grandchildren but if I can preach this with all of my heart and my children don't see the effect of the message what good have I done if they see me as a man that just preaches on the weekend but live like hell all week long they're going to say I don't want to serve a god like that okay Keegan go back home they can see a daddy that prays that can see a daddy that listens to the message they say I want to know a god like Daddy knows come on young people yeah it ain't just about your Grandma knowing it it ain't just about your parents knowing it who do you say that Jesus is do you still say he gives the Holy Ghost do you still say he's he heals he delivers you see what God does what good does it do to preach a god of History if he ain't the same today he said brother sister I say this I read of a god of History one time I read of him in a book I read of him in the Bible but one day I met him I met him he come to me he took he told me not to drink nor nor smoker to find myself he had something for me to do when I got older he said I was just a little boy bitty boy he proved that he did it and here's the picture hanging right here where scientists took it I met him I can tell you what it's like to live in dormal I can tell you what it's like to live a second-handed life of knowledge of people that have garnered things about the message I can tell you I I was in a spot at one time in my life I could tell you about the stories of my Grandpa Charlie I could tell you about how he went down to Sister Barr's house down there in Radford on Radford Road and went down there lady that was eat up with cancer he laid his hand upon her prayed over her the prayer of faith and immediately she was made whole told you about those things on Blacksburg road that took place I could tell you about the God that that healed my Grandpa Charlie when his fingers were cut off in a chimney sweeping accident I could have told you those things how that my father Ron Spencer said don't you don't you cut them off don't you give him Noms you saw them back on there we'll pray and God Will Make A Mark again I could have told you about those things I could tell you about when my daddy how that he fell off a 40-foot ladder broke every vertebrae in his back doctor said he never walk again but my papa Charlie my mom walked into the hospital room that night I said the night you're gonna walk out of this hospital hospital room well a man that was paralyzed in a matter of minutes is out walking out of the hospital I could tell you about that Garden laughs but at that time it wasn't my God I didn't know him I didn't know him like I know him now but I remember being in that spot I want to know him I want to be able to tell people my story I want to be able to tell people how God heals how God says how God gives a holy ghost it was something on the inside of me I wanted to know him and when it didn't look like it was coming my way God showed up it ain't just that he's sorries no more it ain't just Grandpa Charlie and Grandpa Homer sorries no more he's the god of Andrew Spitzer he said God that saved me when I was strung out on drugs when I was strongly I don't see it I know him I know him [Applause] everybody wants to say that the god of the Bible has changed or the god of the Bible is dead but the God that I know he ain't changing he ain't dead he's very much alive because the Bible said Malachi said it this way that the lion the Lord thy God and I change not Paul said it this way he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of those of those Nations was God he would see it was the common denominator in the equation of life it was Jehovah of the Old Testament he's Jesus Christ of the new you see you put God to one side and you put Israel Israel was like any other Nation you see you cut Samson's hair off him he was just like any other man you take the anointing off of David he was just like any other sinner filthy man but the anointing there put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it you see it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone who can do that the point is whether you whether you whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are reprobate and you're none of his what makes you special brother Andrew him close the books up close iPads up close everything else up what makes me special is him come on somebody you can't live without him you can't live without him You Gotta Have It you gotta meet him you got to know him come on somebody but Daniel said that the people that do know their God shall be strong and shall do exploits he's talking about this people this generation these believers the God I know can take a century old man make him young again and bring forth an Isaac the God I know can take a Hebrew baby float him down a Nile River crocodile infester River and make him a mighty conqueror the God I know can open up the Red Seas the God I know can destroy the greatest armies and make them fish food but God I know can have men shout and walls fall down the God I know has meant to speak to the Son and the Stan's son's got to stand still the God I know can put you in a lion's den and make the lines be your pillow the God that I know can take one Angel and Destroy 185 a thousand Assyrians the God I know God I know God I know I said no weapon that's formed against you shall prosper because because one man went to prayer God rained down hailstones and destroyed the enemies that Angel's in a room the God I know is bigger than your problems let me tell you about the God that I know when I was lost he found me when I was on the break of bankruptcy he stepped in and saved me when I was sick he healed me Hallelujah when I was broke he fixed me when I was bound he freed me Hallelujah the God I know is the lion of the tribe of Judah the God I know is not a god of yesterday he's a god of right now he said God that hates he hates sin he said God that delivers he's a God that sets free when I was in pain as a 17 year old boy when I couldn't even get up and go to work God healed my back so I could go back to work and since that day I've never missed one day because of my back hurting he's the god that heals [Applause] he took a boy that couldn't read and make him an advert reader he took a man that didn't know how to put poems and scriptures and things together and make him a preacher he had he took a man that man ridiculed men made fun of men laughed at and made him stand before the early Christians of the day I'm gonna tell you about the God that I know he's not ashamed of you no matter where you came from what your last name is what's your genealogies are what's laying in your DNA history the God that I serve has got a blood that washes away all of your sin the God that I know is so good he's so mighty he's a God that can take a Boy by the name of Wesley I'd take him and walk him around this church a boy that couldn't walk and make him walk he said God that gives generational blessings he said God that delivers from the fire he's the god that delivers from the hell he said God that delivers from sin he's the god that delivers from lightning strikes he's a god and he's my God he's my God I ain't talking about Tim Pruitt's God I ain't talking about Ron Spencer's God I ain't talking about brother branham's God I ain't talking about Paul's God I'm talking about my God my God is crazy sufficient his blood is so powerful [Applause] Paul said in this letter in a second in second Timothy 1 and 12 he said for which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I hath believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep which I have committed unto him against that day you see the God that I know not only saves but he keeps come on somebody you know you're saved oh brother Adrian I know I'm safe but I just ain't got the keeping power let me tell you the God that I know he not only saves you but he keeps you he keeps you from falling he keeps you from Temptation he keeps you from trials he keeps you from sickness he keeps you from cancer Hallelujah Hallelujah the God that I know not only anoints but it protects David was no match at all for Goliath when Saul should have been out there he didn't know one thing about military strategy he didn't know one thing about Paul's or Saul's ecclesiastical verse he didn't know one thing about that but he did know one thing he knowed his God and that's the main thing he knew who he had believed in and so when the giant made his challenge David knew another thing he knew what was right and he knew what was wrong Prophet said sometimes we go to church and don't seem to hardly have the spiritual intelligence to know the difference he said if we do we don't act any different he said but David he knew what was right and he was wrong he knew what was right and wrong he knew it was wrong for that Philistine to defy the armies of the Living God he knew it was wrong but he knew it was right for him to stand up against that what do you know what do you know when the Giants of this day come calling your name who do you know come on somebody David knew he was anointed but when David walked down there into that Valley and he started talking to Saul he didn't go out there say hey I'm the great one I'm the I'm the anointed one next to be king he said I am your servant Saul he humbled himself he humbled himself to be a servant of Saul a man that a man that had turned us back on God was right who do you know come on David you don't walked into this Valley you better know somebody that can get you out of the mess you got yourself in come on David come on now you remember when the seven sons of Stephen weren't up there and it tried to act like Paul and cast that evil spirit out of that man out of that man and that evil spirit looked back upon them and said Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you I can turn around to them same Devils today that's that and you know Paul you know Jesus but the god of Paul is a god of Andrew Lee who are you who are you Stephanie Breeden who are you that has the power to call down heaven and change the world around you who are you David breeding who are you don't strike who are you Gabriel Spencer IMO Devils ain't saying I don't know you they said I've been to their house before I've been kicked out before I know they got power I know they got Authority I know I know in whom I have believed that word no in the Greek it is it means to perceive to understand it means to come to know or to get a knowledge of or perceive to have the knowledge of it's a Jewish idiom for relationship of a of of intercourse between man and a woman it is to know this ain't some fantasy world but you know it's for a relationship if you know you know it means to become acquainted with to know you see to the Greeks this word meant to know facts but these facts may or may not affect your conduct but to the true Jew knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until the fact that had a practical outworking in his life so you cannot say that you know God you cannot say that you have a relationship with God until look like a world dress like the world look like a duck talk like a duck I believe it's a duck but if you say that you know him you dress like him you act like him you announce yourself as a Miss Jesus Christ you're not just knowing this by facts come on somebody we got enough fat Checkers out there but the knowledge that you have received has came from a relationship from the headship and the body becoming one ain't no wonder Hallelujah Hallelujah your headquarters is not in Jeffersonville your headquarters is not in Rome your headquarters is from Glory I was preaching one time I was preaching one time but somebody come to me say where do you get that material from I got it straight from my headquarters I didn't get it from this place or that place I got it straight from Glory [Applause] where is he getting that kind of material at I'll tell you where I'm getting it from I'm getting it from the very mind of God had a guy come tell me one time with a real possessed fellow too he come to me say hey I want to let you know all the hell hates you we hate you down there I swear you go back and tell all your buddies I hate them too go ahead and announce to him why don't you go ahead when trouble starts coming your way and sickness starts coming your way and trials start coming your way and cancer starts coming your way why don't you announce to the devil that you're coming I'm on my way you ain't gonna knock me off my guard you're not going to surprise me I'm already coming for you got a word and it ain't never failed I got a God that never backs up oh Hallelujah I know him [Applause] yeah you say your brother your brother you're bold brother Andrew that's all right I know who I'm talking about no no we know that we're living here in this lay Odyssey and church agent and the the letter that says in Revelations 3 and 14 that under the angel the Church of the layout of seeing right these things saith thee amen the faithful true witness of the beginning of the creation of God and when when William Branham starts breaking in he starts breaking into the church age and laying out he goes back and Taps into Isaiah chapter 65 and 16 that he who blesses himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth he said if you look at it he said yes that's true he said but the real translation is not the god of Truth it is the god of the amen so he that blesses himself in the earth blesses himself in the god of the amen and you go to reading the rest of Isaiah 65 you'll see here is Jehovah of the Old Testament the god of the amen here is Jesus Christ of the New Testament the god of the amen here it is O Lord the Lord thy God is one there it is again Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and it's done forever none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be amen so let it be means amen aren't you glad that you served that kind of a god you can know exactly where you are with him at any time at all times he is the amen God and he will not change these things saith thee amen he said I like it it means that whatever he said is final I don't know if y'all about y'all but I had a mama that believed that she was a man around the house you could be having a conversation with her I want to go over to I want to go over to Josh's house I want to go do this that or the other and she said I'd have heard it for the last time that's final go to your room well Mama spoke it like that it was Final I didn't have to say anything else about it I knew what she said was final and When God says anything no matter what it is it's final it ain't up for debating it ain't for arguing if he said in Malachi 4 that behold I send you Elijah Prophet before the great and terrible day great and Dreadful day of the Lord he's sent Elijah the prophet if he said I'm going to give the Holy Ghost he's going to give the Holy Ghost get mad all you want to he's the god of the amen he said God of the amen and what he says is final if he says Ron Spencer is healed it's final devil you got to get out of my way it's final if you said Zoe breeding's gonna talk get out of the way it's final he is the amen get mad all you want to you can watch a football game baseball game basketball game and if your team loses you can get mad cry hoop and holler or you want to but the absolute is a referee he called it and he said that was it it's final and when the absolute is spoken over this bride of Jesus Christ every devil in hell can try to turn us around try to stop us but the amen said that we'd be there that's why William Branham said that's why the devil hates that book of Revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what these ends will be how he fights that but we are on the winning side I mean Believers of his word are on the side of the amen every devil in hell line them up I'm on the amen side every disease light them up I'm on the amen side every cancer death hole I'm on the amen side it's final you see that's where Faith takes its resting place for it knows that God will never let the enemy ride over the top of him he never has Faith knows that so regardless of what the thing looked like no one knows that the ark could float then you'll know that God could close the lion's mouth the Hebrew children know that God could stop the fire Jesus knew that God would raise him up again because the word said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to seek corruption he no corruption said in 72 hours he said within three days I'll raise up again it took its Eternal resting place in the sanctuary of God's word and there is stood Jesus could trust what the word said about him to go to the cross and know that the amen had already spoken he's the god of the first he's the god of the last has serving a god throughout all the ages he's declared himself as the supernatural God we're not clown for nobody it doesn't count for no one when they hit him in the face hit him in the face and they blindfolded him and said tell us who hit you he wouldn't he wouldn't knock down to them because he knew what the Bible said in Isaiah 53 that he stood before them dumb as a sheep but when he displays himself he displays himself as the pillar of Fire that Pillar of Fire has seen been seen in this room that Pillar of Fire when I was a little child I heard about it rolling through rolling through our house while our mom and dad were sitting there and talking about the God of the Bible and talking about supernatural events all of a sudden this great big ball of fire come rolling right through our home and rolled right out the other side we are a people that are identified by the supernatural you see his pledge his presence it is a sign that the power of the Supernatural is there when you recognize the presence of the Living God is in the room and when you go to worshiping what are you doing you have bumped into another realm and it makes you throw up your hands it makes you speak in tongues it makes you shout it makes you it makes you get excited because you are tapping into the world of the supernatural now brother random after he he tells a story about a woman that he prayed for one time that that that that that she came up before him and she had a handkerchief over top of her nose and brother random thought that she was just crying and trying to hold her tears back or cover them up but when she removed it he seen that her nose had been eaten off by cancer William Branham prays for that lady and just in a short time she comes back to him and said shows him that knows how it was perfectly well they asked him they asked her when she went to the doctor said how did this happen see he said she said I simply changed doctors he see he said well what doctor did you go to she said I went to Dr Jesus you see the angel of the Covenant was there at the platform and this we know who's more powerful the angels in heaven or the angel at the pulpit and when William Branham gets done telling this after this event he said there's got to be a mastermind that's putting all of this together because if not he said we would have the head of a duck we'd have the arms of a chimpanzee and have all of these things he said but some Mastermind is putting this together laughs what Mastermind can take and thwart the eyes of Science and said there's no way that an arm can go back but under the fifth seal we recognize that there's coming a time when when missing limbs will be spoken right into existence what happens William Branham is talking just before just before that service William Branham prays for a little bitty girl that's got leukemia throughout all of her blood cell he prays for her and she starts at getting well completely they had to go get her all kinds of food and he turns around he turns around in the fifth seal and delivers this to us that there's coming a Time that missing limbs will come back into existence what is it it was the god of the word proving that he was the king's sword don't fear it don't fear it this is simply the Vindication of your ministry it is that third pull what is it what are you handling here I'm talking about the God that I know the God that I know might do strange things sometimes and you might question why it does things but God is the god of Destiny and they we recognize that that God harnesses troubles and we recognize that God God does not create sickness but he uses sickness for his glory it's not his will that you be sick but it is his will that you've been delivered from your sickness there was a sister in Arkansas an El Dorado Arkansas that that William Branham went to see that that she was dying of cancer her name was Lady my Rick and you can go and look it up in a message that you'll see that she was dying of cancer and they they flew William Branham over there to her to her place there and all of her family had gathered around and she said these words said I have prayed I had prayed that God would save my children I prayed these prayers William Branham said this might be the opportunity that God gives you your chance and when he spoke that a cool breeze come whirling through the room and said thus saith the Lord you're healed and in three weeks time that little girl that her body was raging full of cancer was sitting there perfectly well what was it the god of the Bible was proving he's the god of the supernatural you see job wanted to know him in this way job wanted to speak with God he said in job 13 surely I would speak to the almighty you see there was something on the inside of job that was pulling him knowing that he wanted to know that man wanted to know him as a Creator he wanted to know him as a savior he lost everything on the inside of job when saying I want to speak to him I'm going to speak to him now job is the oldest book in the Bible it's placed there right in its perfect spot but job is the oldest book that ever was wrote job never had one thing that he could go back a message book or any tape that he could go back and learn about the God of Moses of Abraham any of those things but job had something on the inside of his harp and inside of his heart that he would know that he would be able to speak to God and when God finally speaks to job in chapter 38. you mean to tell me that God's going to wait God's going to wait all of these chapters he's going to wait 25 chapters to talk to me God's going to send you through some stuff but the God that I know will answer you come on you prayed and you asked but the God that I know if it would talk to job after he lost everything the devil took everything from him except for his wife because you cannot touch God's wife but I want to talk to God and when God began to talk to him how did he talk to him he'd talk to him out of a whirlwind he veiled himself in a whirlwind and he said where was you job when I laid the foundations of the world when the stars and the sons of God shouted for Joy where was you not in your trial not in your sickness but are you are in my mind as a brother Andrew I want to know that God I want to tell you the God that I know has the power to heal you because it says in Isaiah 53 and 5 that he was wounded

coming against me like a roaring lion he's the god that raises a standard I want you to know that God that I know he will not turn his back on me he will not be he will not beat me out of my

name of Jesus will set you free from the bondage of sin and Satan from the change of your past but only in the name of Jesus Christ can this be done for there's no other name given amongst men whereby

to read but one scripture to tell me to do it but I've got an entire book to tell me to praise him you cannot go throughout this Bible and go through there and not find the word praise or Worship in it because the God that I serve and the God that I know loves to be praised he said praise ye the Lord praise ye the Lord praise God in a sanctuary Praise Him in the sermon of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according his Excellence greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him within us altar in a heart praise him with a Timber in advance praise him with the

that I know you got you got just a few more minutes the God that I know when you're going to reading Psalms and I know that Psalms is a favorite for the Church of the Living God but when you go to sir when you go to searching and studying out the Psalms it's very powerful studies that are laying there in the Psalms things that you read about in today you'll find in the Psalms but when you when you go to studying out Holly which means praise Hallelujah means praise you're the Lord praise is a name that is given to the group of the the section from Psalms 113 to Psalms 118 which I I read to you Psalms 113 at the beginning of this of this of this service tonight that these arms are known as the halei these are the songs of preeminent psalms of praise and when these Psalms was read it was chanted in the temple while the passover's lamb was being slain so you can imagine as as the worshiper is coming in and he's he's coming in he's bringing his sacrifice in he's coming and he's bringing it before the high priest that they begin to chant these words they begin to chant the high priest would chant these he would chant these Psalms he would stand there you see but notice that these Psalms was also chanted on the Festival of occasions and it was specifically used at Pentecost it was used at the Feast of Tabernacles and at the Feast of dedication and the Levites would stand there before the Altar and they would chant these verses by verse they would go from Psalms 113 all the way down to Psalms 118 and the people that were standing there in the court of worship they were standing there and they would either respond by repeating that verse or they would stand there in sync and in tone with Hallelujah so let me let me just give it to you in this order that now in Psalms 1 15 and 1 that not unto us O Lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy true sake so all of the Levites are chanting this Psalm and the people would stand there and they would say hallelujah verse 2 wherefore should the Heathen say where is now their God hallelujah but our God is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased their Idols are silver and gold the work of men's hands they have mouths they have mouths but they speak not they have eyes their eyes they have but they see not they have ears but they hear not noses have they but they smell not
