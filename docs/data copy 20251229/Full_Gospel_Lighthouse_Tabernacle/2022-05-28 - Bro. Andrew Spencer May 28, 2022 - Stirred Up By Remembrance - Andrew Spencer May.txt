of my heart he's everything to me it's more than a story it's more than words on a page you can take everything away from me but don't take my jesus amen amen second peter chapter 1 and verse 10 before we read let's just speak to the author of this word father what a mighty god that you are lord you are mighty to be praised for the lord we look out upon the handement of your workmanship father you handcrafted it father lord that which was in your mind lord you spoke in the beginning and there went off clinkers of light and worlds and universes father lord it was by your very spoken word that the stars were created the moon and the sun in order to think that you had us in your mind before creation ever came into existence lord what a mighty god that you are father we know that you're faithful to us faithful to the end faithful in our trials faithful in our troubles and our circumstances thou art faithful lord i pray this evening by the help of the lord that you would come and lord that you would just take this scriptures and take my thoughts father lord let it line up into something that will bless your children tonight lord i know that i've been studying these things father but lord it's it's so special when you come and you make it more than just a scripture you you make it lie father i pray lord that you just come and let life fall in this place tonight for every need and every sick body father those that are here and those that are on the way of the internet lord may they fill the brush of angel's wings lord and lord i pray that you would be mindful to every person the little children the mothers that are in the nursery those in the sound booth father you can be special to every one of us here tonight we look unto you the author and the finisher of our faith in the name of the lord jesus christ ii peter 1 and 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance if you'll skip down to chapter 3 verse 1. notice what peter was declaring to us you can also find this in the book of timothy of stirring up the gift that was placed in there but notice what peter is bringing unto us he is saying to us stirring up that which was already there it was something that they had already become acquainted with it's something that they knew ii peter 3 and 1 in this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust i'd say we're here have you ever seen a day when men are walking after their own lust like this day i'd say this is a prophetic word and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep and all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the lord as as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to take a thought this this evening on stirred up stirred up by remembrance and i know that this weekend in the americans here for the americans that are listening that this weekend is a very special weekend for us it's it's a memorial day weekend we have a extra long holiday holiday weekend and every every business typically re honors that day it's a day it's a day in american history where we observe on the last day of the month of may honoring the men and women that fell fell and died in in the u.s military who's died serving in the us military it's a day when it's a day when we remember we remember where we came from and we remember the men that that that gave their life for freedom and if you go to studying out the actual actual win win when when the memorial day was started you'll find that that they originally called it a decoration day in general logan in 1868 after the civil war after they had went and all of those men that had died there they they called for a nationwide remembrance to honor those fallen soldiers that had died in in such a chaotic chaotic war and and those men and what they would do in the springtime at the end of may it started on may the 30th and there they would go and they would decorate these these fallen soldiers and they would go and decorate their decorate their graves with the springtime flowers and they would go and pay homage under these men that that were willing to give their life for home and give their life for freedom and i i believe that it that if we are ever living in a time to remember our freedoms we're certainly living in a time or right now like never before men are forgetting they're forgetting their freedoms they're for greed they're forgetting what men they they came to this nation for how they left england and how they left their homeland just to come here and start over and under the freedom of worship under the freedom of religion and if there ever was a time to remember where we came from how that men fought for our freedoms in the revolutionary war how that men fought for our freedoms in in the si in the civil war and how men gave their lives and bled on the battlefields so that you and i could stand here and preach this message and preach the power of pentecost and preach this beautiful message that each and every one of us love here i think it's a time that we ought to pay homage not just to fall and fall fallen fallen men and soldiers in wars but we ought to we ought to honor men like trailblazers like brother homer fraser like brother henry greene brother billy andrews brother biscuit all of these great men that went on before us i think it's a time that we we ought to spay and pay our time a memorial and remember where we were as a message how that how did it we we only had it in we only had it in maybe tape form or on reel to reel but now it's in everybody's hands it's accessible to everybody and i think it's uh it's a time that we ought to remember where the message is at today and and to think that like never before there's a people on the face of the earth that's identified with a message that they're known by that message i think it's a time that we ought to stir up our remember stir up what's been given unto us something that we know it's it's not something we're not a schoolgirl or any squirrel girl anymore we know who we are we we know we've got the the predestinated wedding band of grace on our hand we we know what jesus came and did for us we know what he did there on the cross we we know what the lamb came and did he opened up the seals and he showed us who we are i think it's a time as sons and daughters of god that we ought to remember where we came from not just let every devil in hell try to come and make us forget what happened 50 or 60 years ago but i think it's a time like never before that we ought to rise up in the liberty of jesus christ and remember what god did for us and if god did it then he can still do it right now i think it's a time like never before not only just to stir it up in our mind but we ought to stir it up in hell and tell the devil that the same mighty angel that was there in 1950 is the same mighty angel that's here right now i'm not just talking about stirring up your heart i'm talking about stirring up your minds that what's been deposited it's a time like never before that we ought to remember that this ain't a closed book church it's an open book church it ain't a church that's been bound by creeds and bound by dogmas it's a time like never before to shore up our minds that we're a free church we've got liberty in the house of god we've got a liberty to worship we've got a liberty to praise there is freedom if there ever was a time to remember i say this is a day of memorial where we remember what jesus did for us i say it's a day of memory for the bride of jesus christ november 19 in 1863 when our president abraham lincoln stood and gave the gettysburg address after one of what was one of the bloodiest bass in the silver war there it was estimated that 46 000 to 51 000 men died in that battle and here here abraham lincoln is standing there standing on a stage standing on a battlefield where these men had gave their precious life fighting for fighting for what they thought was right i don't care what side you think you're on i don't care where you came from or what not these men gave their life they weren't just out there they weren't just out there because because they somebody somebody was somebody had called them they were out there fighting and if you're willing to fight for something you you get behind it and these men were behind they were behind the ideas of their generals and and abraham lincoln stood up there and he said and you you can go and read you can go and read the great gettysburg address and you can everybody knows how it starts out and but they they don't recognize they don't recognize the depth of that meeting or the depth of that speech but abraham lincoln stood there and he said the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but he said they can never forget what these men did here and you may you may forget what i say here but i want you to know there is a legacy that is standing behind this pulpit not just of ron spencer not just of homer frazier but this is a lighthouse for the message of jesus christ you may forget what is spoken necessarily tonight but you'll remember one of these days i hope you're not like lot's wife i hope you're not like judah sent you that you wish you wouldn't have sold him out for this but these men at the silver war these men were fighting for what they thought was right faulting fighting for their beliefs it could never be forgotten what they did there and america wants to thrash that out america wants to dismember our country and try to rip us apart try to bring in a spirit of division amongst americans try to separate us and cause another civil war again they're going to get it they're going to get it but when when it when all of that breaks out i'm not going to be here they're asking for another war but i'm going to be gone they're trying to say what happened there and what happened with slavery didn't happen they tried to pretend that it happened they try to rob it out of our history books they try to take the holocaust out of our books but you ask you ask one of those jews over there in that homeland they know that that holocaust was real they remember they try to say that it was just a fig in a figment of man's imagination that those things happen but you go and talk to somebody that was in world war one in world war ii they know that it was real it wasn't just a bad memory it happened bad things happen in war they don't they want to try to say that it didn't happen they try to say that there was not a mighty angel that met a man in a cave this ain't just somebody's memory they try to say that there was no 16 men that fell off fell off a bridge they want to say there was no man up there on the finland border that had that had been crumbled up that had been crumbled up by a car wreck this ain't just some memory church there was somebody that was behind it before it ever happened before it ever took place the vision that spoke that this boy would get up off the ground he said he said if he's not above the ground in five minutes call me a false prophet that little boy didn't raise up and say he was a false prophet because he was walking where he was once dead how could i stand here and say that jesus christ is no longer alive when he's living right here this ain't just a memory this ain't just a hope so this is the living christ amongst the church [Applause] peter said stir up your remembrance stir up your remembrance you see you see that we're a church we're a church that knows how to sing you don't know like i know because what it does it stirs up our remembrance i remember what i was i remember what the devil tried to talk me into i remember how he tried to kill me i remember how he did this that and the other but you don't know like i know what he did for me what is that song doing it's not just stirring up my remembrance it's stirring up god's remembrance he remember how he saved you he remember how he fields you [Applause] william branham comes and he he preaches one of the most powerful messages on spiritual amnesia brother branham comes and he grabs from amos chapter 3 and said hear this word that the lord has spoken against you o children of israel against the whole family which i brought up from the land of egypt and saying you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for your iniquities here amos is going down to samaria he's going down to samara and he was coming to this he was coming to this great city where where sin had been heaped on every side and the ministers had all gotten away from from the word of god they had they had they hadn't had a prophet in long years and here when amos comes he he found them and they were so decayed so morally corrupted it was a great time with and it was a terrible time that that where there was women in that city had become almost like they they were here in the united states he said they become they had become corrupt everything that a god expected out of them they went right the other way he said we find out that it's a great place where they had dances on the street the women so immorally stripping their clothes off and so forth like a striptease of course that was a public museum in them days now it's every day just like the just let the weather get hot you don't have to go in to any show they're out there on the street anywhere anyhow shame on you women to do such a thing like that aren't you ashamed of yourself here amos he he found them in that day and they had a bad case of a disease spiritual amnesia he said and that's just exactly what we've got today he said but we find out that israel exposed or got exposed to the world and it fell into this rut and the prophet was sent to dig them out of it he said if he could get he if he could and if he could and to tell them god by his grace had chose israel from the rest of the families on earth he said grace did that here they were here they were they got in this condition but the prophet was sent to get them out of that rut aren't you thankful that even though america's interrupt we had a prophet a people that were chosen a people that were chosen by god though you may have been in the rut there was a prophet that came by your way there was somebody that was willing to get down in the trenches for a people that though it looked like they weren't children of god though it looked like they should be ashamed though it looked like they shouldn't be serving god there was a prophet that stood in this day that wasn't ashamed to call black black and white white [Applause] he said grace had did that he had given them the choice lands he'd give them houses that they they never had to build god did that he chose him he gave them farms they never had to bought he gave he gave them food that they never had to plant he gave them wells they never had to dig he gave them victories that they never had to want he gave them grace that they never had to merit it god did that by his grace for this people israel his own chosen his beloved and he said in the bible he found her in the field as a little girl sitting in her own blood and he watched her and he cleaned her up and what he done but after god showed all of these mercies she got rich and she got amnesia and she forgot all about where these things come from and i'm afraid that america has forgot her liberty i'm afraid that she doesn't have a memory and there's so many people today the church the church world in this last days they've forgotten what a testimony of a real christian means i'm afraid that that we've been blessed beyond measure i'm afraid that we've been blessed when we come in and blessed when we go out he's made us ahead and not the tale but i'm afraid that too many times we we wallow around like a hog and we we're eating those apples but we never look up to see where they're coming from to think where you are standing at today to think about your liberties to think about where you are in the message to think about what god has done for you you'd be a fool to sit there and not thank god for it but when jesus came when jesus came they forgot they had forgot what the bible said that a virgin shall conceive they had forgot that moses had said that the lord our god would raise up a prophet like unto myself they'd forgot those things and when jesus was standing there because of this spiritual amnesia that was on them they couldn't recognize the the original life that was standing there they couldn't remember they couldn't remember where what what they were really doing there they they stood there and all their feasts they stood there and and all their pump and their splendor they stood there and they had dressed out they were they they looked apart but they forgot they forgot what god called them to be and israel every single time that she would get out of the land she would get out of her place and when the bride of jesus christ gets off of this promised word when you get out of the promised word for your day you are getting out of your position and you're beginning to forget what god called you to be god didn't call you to be no slave god didn't call you to be a children of fear god did not call you to be a children of doubt he called you to be serpent bruisers devil stoppers that when the enemy comes up against you you look at the devil and say you remember me you remember how you lost last time remember you're going to lose this time remember me devil i'm the same devil that whipped you 15 years ago i'm the same man i'm the same man i may look different i may talk just a little bit different i may be a little bit knowledgeable in the message of jesus christ but i'm the same man i'm the same man that whips you when you accuse me falsely i'm the same man that knows my sword i know what it can do i'm the same man remember me devil i'd say when jesus was put into a tomb and it looked like he was going like all hope was gone it looked like every every fear that they had was completely rocked but when he went in that tomb but when he come out of that tomb i'd say he took a look around and looked at those demons said remember me you just i just visited you down there in hell but remember me i'm the same one i've got 120 40 days from this time that's going to be filled with my spirit my life my power i don't have this by scripture but i could i i just i could imagine peter and his boldness coming out say you remember me i'd say it's a time in your life that you need to look up at the devil and said i have forgotten what you accused me of but i have remembered what god thought of me i'd say it's a time to remember i'm wondering sometimes if we don't forget the things that come from him remember he's the one who blessed you remember he's the one who saved you remember he's the one who healed you remember he's the one that kept you remember he's the one that opened your eyes remember he's the one that he saved you from a car wreck remember he's the one that got you out of that financial trouble when you look like he was in bankruptcy remember remember he was the one that came looking for you when everybody else had turned you down when the world had flipped you upside down everybody else had turned the woman away but he remembered her there was some men that walked through her and said no i don't want her she's done being used up but jesus said i have remembered her i have come by this well because i got a need for her and you sit there and you've got your stone in your hand wanting to throw it at this woman you without sin cast the first stone don't you remember where you came from then why shouldn't these young people have a chance of the word of god you were a prodigy one time you were a castaway at one time remember where you were memory ain't always a bad thing it can be used for the glory of the lord [Applause] if you can always remember that god is present if you could always remember if you can always remember that he said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you if you can remember that his that his angels are given charge over you to keep you that that the angels that the bible said in psalms 34 that that the angels of god are encamped about them that fear him so matter no matter where you see them or not i know some of you been blessed to be able to see a flicker of light every once in a while or maybe see the pillar of fire or maybe see something supernatural but whether you see it or whether you don't whether you see the angel standing here or whether you feel him or don't he's here and i want to say this by the word of the lord he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world don't ever forget it i know he's here right now don't ever forget it i know he's here to save you from your backslidden condition don't ever forget it satan i want to remind you while i'm reminding the church of the living god i want to remind you you lost 2 000 years ago and you'll lose right now you can try to hold them in their backspin condition you can try to hold them in the in their sickness you can try to hold them in their diseases but i want to remind you isaiah 53 met in a person he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of their priest was upon him and by his stripes you may have tried to stop the redeemer from coming [Applause] but it meant the person jesus christ i there's got to come an awakening there's got to come an awakening to shake your memory and to break the disease of of of amnesia to remind you who you are that's why i've spent the last few weeks telling you and bringing you back to the fundamental faith of who you are you've been predestinated you've been chosen but the devil will tell you that you're not good enough the devil will tell you that there's an all-knowing god he can't forget what you did the devil would tell you the devil will tell you he's infinite he's infinite and he knows what you did in your past he knows how you tried to cover that up but you can't whip him on your own that's why i'm trying to give you bible doctrine if you're gonna whip anything you gotta whip it by the you gotta whip it by the word of god and the bible said in hebrews 10 that there was a remembrance of again made of sins every year under those sacrifices but it didn't stop there it was a remembrance of sin under the old law but when you come down to hebrews 10 and 16 he said i will put my law in their minds and in their hearts and in their souls and i will remember their sins and their iniquities no more [Applause] oh satan you done lost it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness and he can try to keep you in your in your cage and try to keep you in your condition but the blood of jesus christ that reaches to the highest mountain and goes to the lowest valley says i will remember not what you did i won't remember what you did yesterday i won't remember what you did today i will remember what you did 10 years ago i won't remember how you talked about me some of you sitting here said you'd never be here some of you sitting here saying i'll never i'll never worship like that some of you sitting here said i'll never leave my my dead cold religion that's all right it's good to remember because you're not a trophy of hell no more matter of fact you never was i remember i remember the grace of god that come walking in this church when there were some cheerleaders that come in here that look like the world dressed like the world i remember how they were when they walked in here when when you sat there some people sit there in their righteous indignation and thought my god ain't the pastor ever going to preach on a clothesline religion but you ain't the pastor [Applause] god had a purpose and god is as good as his word if there is seed they look like the world when they walked in here but when the message got ahold [Music] when the message got a hold of them i want to remind you satan you didn't stop them and you won't stop their children oh i remember you're messing with the wrong guy i got a good memory i can remember things that you did to me i can remember things that you said about this congregation i can remember things that the devil tried to rob us from but i'm here to tell you i'm reminded that their lord our god he said do not forgive my benefits so if we're going to remember something let's remember what he said about us [Applause] it's amazing to me how the devil could come in and whisper one thing to you and you remember everything that he said it's amazing it's amazing to me how the people can come in i'd say i remember this and this is what the devil said and this is what this one did and this is what that one did this is what he said about me he told me i was no good he told me i'd never lived this message he he told me and you know what before long they're quoting paragraphs that the devil said but they can't quote one sentence that jesus said if you can remember what satan said about you surely you can remember what god said about you the bible said now are we the sons of god he's going to tell you you're no good he's going to tell you you're not qualified he's going to tell you you're not elected but i happen to be a positive and negative kind of person anything he tells me i just turn it on him if he tells me i ain't caught that means i am called if it tells me i'm not good enough that means i am good enough if it tells me i'm not elect that means i am a less if it tells me i can't be healed that means i am healed i remember what jesus said about me and i refute the devil and rebuke him that tries to tell the children of god that they can't be healed that they can't be delivered that they can't be free i remember what jesus said when the sun is set free is free i remember [Applause] well i remember the day he saved me up from my sin and shame i'd come up out of that water baptized in jesus name [Applause] powerful message brother branham preached preach it twice on remembering the lord go and listen to it one's before the seals and ones after the vision one's before the seals ones after the vision over over in 1963 and brother branham starts talking about he starts talking about a hay burn hay burn building there in louisville kentucky and he's up there on that he's up there and he's riding this elevator and he said there's these ministers if you'll study the message real close you'll find out that brother branham was one of those ministers he's riding up and he said they didn't recognize that one minister and he said these men these ministers were riding up on that riding up on that elevator and he said here they come up on that elevator got all the way up here to the eighth floor and one minister looked over at the other minister and said i believe this is about as high we're ever going to get we might as well get on off here brother branham said i sat there quietly he said i let him say what they was going to say and he said dale's about to get off and he said i said now excuse me sir he said maybe by your own merits this is about as high as you can get he said but if you can remember if you can remember what jesus did by his marriage it'll take you higher and if you're remembering everything that you did you only go so high the devil is always wanting to tell you that you can't get no higher than this but the message of the lord was remember remember remember what he did for you remember where he brought you from and notice my brother and said he said he said i like to say something he said if i can forget what i was and remember what he is if i can remember jesus and if i can remember at the cross if i can remember what he'd done for me if i could remember the hour that he washed my sins away and gave me the holy spirit to guide me then i'm lifted above everything that holds this earth i'm lifted above every earthly thing into heavenly places where i can fellowship with him they are in his presence for getting what i ever was glory to god forgetting all my sins and everything because they're in the sea of god's forgetfulness for getting all my past forgetting everything and remember and remember that he made me his own by his own death he took my place if i could ever forget what i was and remember what he said about me you remember when brother branham goes in that museum that one time and there's that colored man that's sitting there looking at that glass and there's a piece of cloth that is laying there it's got a blood stain on it and that that black man is sitting there crying and weeping and brother begins to speak to him he tells him he's a minister he said he said can i pray for you and he starts turning his attention he said you see that cloth right there he said that's the blood of abraham lincoln right there and he lifted up his shirt and he said you see that mark he said that's the mark of a slave belt he said it was the blood of that man that set me free from this slave bell he said oh if a colored man a once that was once a slave could be set free i could feel that liberation because the blood of a man what if the sons and daughters of god when they look at that old slave belt that shake them put on them and told them they never lived to serve it or they never left rise to sun mentality what it ought to do to you when you see the old rugged cross so many times satan has put his he's put his shadow on your shoulders and you watch people they're always constantly getting rolled around by the devil they're so wore out so rolled out because you got them big old hoop earrings in your ear that he's got for stirrups there and he's been riding you riding your monday riding your own tools that ride you through your work i'll tell you what you need to do kick that old shadow off your path say satan my shoulders ain't built for ridin [Applause] find a new ride it's an old song it's an old old song my my little reagan she used to love singing it when when she was younger i said don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it he said they said don't let the devil ride cause if you let him ride he'll want to drive so don't do it oh don't invite him into his car because before long he'll want to take over the steering wheel don't bring him into your family because before long he'll find himself in the bedroom and you'll be doing all kinds of filthy things in your marriage and it'll corrupt you don't let him get in your car don't let it get in your house don't let it get in your mind don't let him get in your soul don't let it get in your spirit don't do it don't do it don't do it that's for you ray-ray my babies my babies are seeing their mother-in-law this weekend they still love me if you're wondering where they are he said but he said remember jesus remember jesus when the barrel gets empty at the house and there's no more flowering remember jesus when the doctor said there's no more chance remember jesus when the devil is tempting you remember jesus when when he that he remember that he will come again that same jesus that was taken away from us we're returning like manner as we have seen him go into the heavens remember remember i ain't going to leave you to go through tribulation remember he's not going to put anything on you that you will not be able to bear remember he's going to return for you remember him in in in the rising of the sun brother braden brother branham is standing there and he's preaching about botany life and he said it he said that it takes the issue in to raise that botany life up to what it is he said it takes that s-u-n to bring it to life he said just like it does the s-o-n life it takes the s-o-n light to bring these those that are chosen and those that are predestinated it takes that same s o n light and this is what amazes that amazes me when jesus was standing back there before before there was a molecule before there was an atom that ever was spoken to existence he had in his mind whatever seed would be and when he planted the seed he knew what it was going to be he knew what it was going to come up forth and to think when you plant corn you get corn and when jesus was planting corn to think that seed had a memory in it to remember what it was supposed to be like let your mind loose just go to a garden just for a minute put your strawberries in put your potatoes in put your maters in there remember it's something powerful if a little seed can remember what it was destined to be he didn't wake up and say one day i'm gonna be a tomater when you're supposed to be a corn he didn't wake up and say you know what i'm supposed to be i'm supposed to be a corn stalk but today i'm gonna identify myself as a strawberry it remembered what god destined it to be so what he put in the ground has got to come up and brother branham said that on that day on that resurrection morning he said there our bodies was laying in the dust of the earth he said our attributes what we were was in him he said there we were in the dust of the earth he said but up in heaven there was a book of memory i say that when jesus was on the cross he could remember this wasn't just for me this is for every son and daughter of god and jesus begin to remember this is for fred perry this is for gabriel spencer this is for brenda klein this is for jeanetta thompson this is for randall griffith why was john weeping and rejoicing in the very second next sections in his life he was weeping because there was nobody that was found worthy to reach up and take the book i don't happen to believe that he turned from weeping to rejoicing just because he saw my name or because he saw jeffrey thomas's name i happen to believe that john saw his name you may not understand why sister rachel shouts like she shouts her brother jordan shouts like he shouts or if sister anna shouts like she sats or sister katie shouts like sea salts but if you saw your name like we saw our name [Applause] john said i everything in heaven and everything in earth heard i said blessings honor and glory because he saw his name there and if you would ever get yourself and remember and remember that he paid for you remember that he died for you oh what's going to happen jericho was going to come down you don't know like i know but jesus said jesus said in john 14 and 26 that the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you so literally the spirit of the living god is going to inspire you to remember every word that jesus told us he said i give you power to walk on serpents i give you power in my name to bind i give you power to lay hands on the sick and they shall i give you power whosoever sends you remain on earth shall be remitted in heaven and how do we remit them we remit them by remission of sins in the baptism of the water tank repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you can remember to repent you can remember that you'll be filled but some of you don't forgot how to repent so you forgot how to be filled but oh it's a simple it's a simple prescription he said i'm the lord thy god that heals all of thy diseases i'm the lord thy god that heals oh i forgive all of your iniquities i find it amazing when david is writing out this psalm he places both of them in the same scripture and the greek word salvation means so so it's both healing and it's both salvation the same atonement that paid for you is the same atonement that heals you are you with me repent i know it's hard you don't want to turn away from your ways you don't want to turn away from from your wicked ways but the bible said seek ye the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near he said let the wicked forsake his way isaiah 55 and 7 and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he you don't know what i've done you don't know the stack up against me and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly abundantly pardon thank you if he don't remember it if he don't remember what i did if he don't remember what you did if he don't remember the hell hole that you were in if you don't remember the hog pin that you were in then why should i spend my time remembering it brother andrew you don't know what this person did let me tell you bring that under out underneath the blood it's on you notice that david over in second samuel chapter 23 i ain't going to read it to you but i just want you to go for a reference that david was there that david was there in a cave and the bible said that his three his three teeth his tree the mighty men came unto him here in this cave there they were they they found the king the supposed to be king hiding in a cave the philistines had surrounded him on this side and saul had surrounded him on this side and the bible goes on to say that the philistines had garrisoned themselves about bethlehem and david david was there in his worst times in a cave anointed in a cave in a cave all running over top of him in a cave listings on oneness on this side problems on this side troubles on that side can i get a little more personal cancer on this side sugar diabetes on this side covet on this side troubles on that side depression on this side anxiety on that side but yet you're anointed you're elected you're called [Applause] every devil in hell has surrounded you he found you in a cave but i'm reminded oh king i see you in the morning daniel may be in the lion's den you may be staring down lines and about to chew you down but don't you fear there's a pill or fire that's coming darkness on one side lines on another but a pillar of fire watching over his prophet because daniel had purpled himself in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's meat trouble's on this side trouble's on that side self on this side pride on that side [Music] oh come on somebody but there was somebody that still believed that david was going to be king it was right in the midst of harvest time when david stroke got to parchin him said oh that i wish that i could have of the water of the wells of bethlehem that's by the gate the bible said that david longed the day that david david desired this water and here we are in harvest time and if there ever wasn't time to water king jesus right now's the time [Music] those mighty men everything that that saul was trying to do it looked like david wouldn't fight back he'd look what kind of king is this saul's making fun of him so i was trying to kill him and think you got a bad job you think you got a bad job you think you got a bad job and here i am i'm going to be the next manager over the whole entire kingdom and the and the predecessors trying to kill me you think you got a bad job try try david's one time got saw on this side and got absolutely on that side here he was rejected people spitting on him people mocking him but david handled himself like a real king people trying to stab him in the back people spitting on him there he is walking up gal galgoth was healed i rejected king but yet there's still some men that surrounded him i said i believe this is the king we wish that this was going to be the man who are you talking about now we thought that this was going to be the messiah we thought this was going to be the king of judah and the king of israel there he is in a cave oh and you thought kingdom life kingdom life was all that great it's about setting up in a palace and having all the fine robes and all the beautiful ladies fanning you with palm trees and somebody dropping in grape juice and grapes and crackers and cheese maybe you would like a little cheese for your wine all kingdom life's gonna be so great but here i am down in a cave here i am the one that healed the leper here i am the one that opened the blinded eyes but they're spitting on me they're hitting me they're mocking me and they're putting your cross your cross for what you should have been bearing they were putting it on the king of kings and the lord of lords are you sure you want to walk this kingdom life [Music] but blessed is he blessed is he well i said is he who his reproach for my name oh i remember i remember it should have been me i should have been in that cave i should have been under that cross i should have been under that load but i remember there was somebody that was willing to take my spot there was some men that still believed that david was going to be king and he said that they that brother branham said there and why little bethlehem he said that's the warriors of god like was with david they had their hands on their sword walking at his arm he said that's the way god's warriors walk ready they're not setting they're unprepared they're not setting their complacent they're not sitting there mentally disposed but you have joined yourself with a band of army men that are equipped and ready to witness of the holy ghost i say this that devils tremble when sons of god have confidence in their sword that this demon of cancer that's raising its ugly head is begging that these sons of god put back their sword put back their sword and their sheath but i'm going to steal the devil it's too late my sword is uncheated i'm ready to fight whether you put him in a cave whether you put him on a cross you got a few more minutes he said the enemy says you have to take a little drink to be sociable but the warrior says i'll not touch your unclean thing he said oh why don't you renounce that old holy roller stuff you believe and a warrior says i believe god and i'll stand true oh there's no such thing as divine healing the warrior says that's what you think because i know better there's no such a thing as a baptism of the holy ghost them days has passed on that's what you think i've already received it it's just for you it's just too late for you to tell me anything about it here david he was letting his memory go to work it's something powerful about your memory i know that the devil wants to get in your memory i know he wants to get in there and try to rip it apart and play all the emotional parts on your memory of how you remember things happened you can ask one person one thing and ask another person a different thing it's all on how they remembered it but david david was setting up there in this cave and he was letting his memory take a hold of him he said oh i remember them old days back there i remember i remember how that that was my land i was born for that land my grandmother when when she was born when she bore judah when she bore judah and that's the lineage that i'm out of when she was bearing judah it was placing me in my position in the land he said i can remember that's the land of my grandfather that's the land of my father's that's the land of my grandmother and there the philistines is garrison around my hometown i remember that's where i was a sheep herder i remember that's where i was anointed i remember when samuel came by my way i remember what it was like there was a good old days what was this doing what was his memory doing it was taking him back to bethlehem why don't you let your memory take you back to the house of god's bread that he'll feed you that man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god why don't you let your memory go back to them good old days ephesians why have you lost and left your first love you remember what it was like to be saved you remember what it was like to feel the holy ghost coming to you you remember what it was like to feel the spirit of the living god sweeping over your soul why don't you come back to your first love why don't you come back out of your backslidden condition and repent remember remember what it was like remember how he called you he said it'd been better if the church world looked back to their good old days when they're few and far between the little schoolhouses out there in america falling under the power of god throwing water out in their face it'd be better if you baptists look back to where you came from and the rest of them you pentecostals look back to where you came from that's right that's right but notice what brother adam said he said in the heat of the battle not when everything was going good but in the heat of it david began to think what did what did paul tell us whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are righteous think on these things you're gonna have some trials you're gonna have some days when people talk about you but think on these things he said oh i can remember them nights i laid out yonder on the hillside i remember when i watched them stars how they moved up yonder how god talked to my little boy heart he said i can remember when i got in the spirit one day looking at the clouds and the shady green pastures till i screamed out in the spirit and saying the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow's death i will fear no evil for thou art with me here david could sit there and say i remember i remember when a lion came in and snatched one of my sheep i remember i remember the same day i got that sheep back in there came a bear coming after the sheepfold and i took this stone and i took this sling i remember i remember going after that sheep i remember getting him back i remember i remember when there were some people that was telling me i was too young i remember when people was telling me that i was too ruddy i remember when my brother said he only come out here to look on the fight i remember when saul tried to put his ecclesiastical vest on me but i remember walking down into a valley unafraid i remember walking down in there and looking on that big giant i remember walking down in there and said this ain't nothing for the battle of the lord i remember grabbing those five stones and just like brother branham said he picked up jesus on his way to the fight i remember picking up jesus i remember picking up faith i remember they said i'd never do it i remember them laughing at me i remember them telling me i never lived this message i remember them telling me that i'd never be no good i remember but i also remember that day i remember that day when that goliath that stood up against me i said this day will be your last day to breathe i remember taking my sling and taking my stone and hitting him right between the eyes but the best part i remember taking his sword and cutting his head off i remember singing praises i remember walking through the streets and everybody's screaming david has kept saul has killed his thousand but david is tens of thousands i remember how it routed the enemy and it gave a charge to the children of israel i remember the bible said in first chronicles 16 8 give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing songs unto him talk to you of all of his wonderful works it seems like god wants you to remember glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually remember his marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and his judgments on his mouth psalms 11 and 4 he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the things that he's done he's made them to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all of thy diseases who redeems thy life from destruction who crown of thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles i remember hearing about georgie carter nine years laying in a bed 47 pounds but i remember when she got up out of that bed i remember hearing about congressman upshaw 66 years on invalid but i remember when he come by the way of a prophet i remember how had iraq had said the right word i remember what brother branham what brother bradham said this king swords was it was the opening of the word that is the third pole i remember what he did for me i remember praying for my daddy when he fell off a 40-foot ladder and broke every vertebrae in his back and they had called from the hospital and said it looks like your daddy's going to be paralyzed go to prayer i remember praying but i also remember the night that he walked in the house i remember when he was burned and it looked like all hope was gone it laid there for 17 days i remember going to the hospital days in and days out wondering will he ever get up will he ever get up but i remember when a man of god came from louisiana said i'm going to talk to my friend i remember when he started talking to us yeah he talked some crazy stuff to us at first but i remember that the devil lied he said i'll be with you in the fires i'll be with you in the floods i'll be with you in the oceans i'll be with you i remember him standing behind this pulpit coughing and we thought he was going to lose a lung and you thought he'd never be like he was again he'd never be able to preach to the ability that he was preaching at before but i remember a camp meeting down in north carolina when there was a man of god that was preaching order out of chaos and there in that moment i remember there was an oxygen tear they came over my pastor i remember what it did then so i remember what it can do now i remember elena butts getting a diagnosis that the doctors had said all kinds of things taking this evil kind of medicine it was it was ripping her apart as a as a lady he was destroying her body cancer was trying to destroy who she was i remember praying prayer after prayer after prayer but i can never forget where i was when i got the news cancer's gone what the doctor's seen in one thing is gone now i remember sitting at a mcdonald's and culpepper when i got the news that sister elena butz was completely whole i remember a tent meeting in south carolina when a prostitute walked in one way and in a matter of moments she walked out a complete daughter of god i remember watching a black man walking all the way from the back of the building with a cane in his hand i remember how he walked up there and i was watching him as he'd make his way he was crippled and he was he was hobbling as he came up that way he stopped and held onto the tent he held onto the pole of that tent and he'd hobble a little bit more he'd hold on to a chair and he'd hobble a little bit more he'd hobble all the way up there and when he got to the platform he threw that cane down and ran back i remember a little girl that had club feet andrew glover standing on one side isaiah brooke standing on another side ron spencer standing right there and when the man of god prayed a little girl with club feet got up out of that wheelchair and started running all over that tent i remember praying for a man in canada that had a dislocated shoulder and all of a sudden we come through a prayer line and he struggled all weekend long but when he come in that prayer line the healing angel touched him and his shoulder went back into place i remember praying for a little boy just a few months ago in oklahoma that had flat feet had terrible pain and his mama come to me and said can you pray for him he forgot his special shoes or his insoles that he had to wear because of these flat feet we got the news this past week he ain't complaining about his feet and he ain't had no pain since that prayer [Music] i remember two weeks ago telling you to stomp that devil stomp arthritis [Applause] i remember telling you to do it but i remember that there was a man jeffrey thomas that the doctors told him that he had arthritis in his feet and it would be there but i remember just last weekend he was playing volleyball like a teenager and it never bothered him one time i remember telling you to stop that devil's sugar diabetes and jim noel that had struggled with sugar diabetes in a moment his sugar diabetes was completely made whole i remember what he did for me [Applause] i remember i remember when roger taylor was sitting here in this building and billy andrews said before the night's over you're going to need god the pillar fires hanging over this one but roger stealer still here i remember steve thomas how the pillar fire showed up at his heart at his funeral i remember louisiana camp matthew speaking in tongues slaying in the spirit why don't you let your mind go loose and begin to remember i remember the day he saved me it wasn't 15 years ago it was 2 000 years ago and what satan thought that he'd rob from me he'd already paid for david said i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast quickened me if we could just go to remember that all of his promises are yes and amen if we can just let our mind loose to the fact that he said if you trust me i'll use it like never before my angel i remember i remember what i was i remember what it was like to come to church when i love coming to church i remember what it was like but it seems like i've got cold on god i remember feeling that fire running over my body but i'll let sin come in and i let sin destroy the man that i was meant to be i let sin and complexes and stigmas erode away my life but you're still here if you can remember you've got to look past yourself you've got to look past your mistakes you've got to look past your failures you've got to look past what you said about me what you said about brother ron what you said about this message you've got to look past those things forget those things that the devil's wanting you to remember and remember that he said i'm the lord thy god i'm the lord thy god that heals all of your sicknesses where you're sitting at right now i want you to go to remember that there was a man that took your place where you're sitting at right now in your own physical condition i want you to remember there was a one that paid for your healing i want you to remember what you're going through that there's nothing that has happened to you that god has not already seen because all things are working together for the good to them that love god to them who are be called according to his purpose but you say but i remember what i was but there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and if the same spirit that dwells in christ dwells in you it will quicken your mortal bodies why don't you remember what he said about you that no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper why don't you remember if god before you who can be against you why don't you remember why don't you remember that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me why don't you remember that he paid the ultimate sacrifice so that you could go free [Applause] oh hallelujah this ain't as high as you'll go it might be men around you that this is as they'll go but church of the living god you were born to go higher you're not going on your own marriage you're going on the merits of the son of jesus christ you're going on his merits what he paid for he's already paid for what he died for has already been died for so why should you keep beating yourself i want you to remember these words i healed you i feel you i saved you remember i called you i elected you do you still got faith in him though men's tried to water it down though men's trying to spit on this do you still got faith in this message though men's tried to rise up with their own believe the sign and disbelieve this that and the other do you still believe that david still anointed king do you still believe that william branham fulfills malachi 4 do you still believe do you still believe you're not going to be like lot you're not going to be like lot's wife but you're going to be like abraham that stood up there by faith by faith abraham believed against hope are you going to be like that abraham covenant people that will stand there let's joint heirs with christ are you going to remember that you're born to be a son and daughter of god or are you going to remember what satan said about you i choose to stand with jesus i choose his side i choose his healing i choose his power i choose his life i choose i choose so i choose to worship there's a reason why we can sing you don't know like i know because we remember god saw you sister erica when you were listening all those months god saw you and he remembered this message ain't just for one person tonight this is for everybody you can false accuse me and you can scandalize my name but i'm going on jesus i remember him talking about homer frazier they said it never last said he won't last nine months he said i'll stand on my head for nine months just to prove you all wrong i remember a man of tenacity that they thought they was going to turn around but this was a bible man filled with a bible god i remember when they told me oh you used to dance a whole lot more when he's out in the world than when you dance right now but i remember when i stood right in front of them my shells and made fun of the way that we worship and i said if you don't like that watch this and i dance right in front of them i remember how they criticized full gospel lighthouse and said oh we'll shut them down we'll walk away from this church but i remember when there was somebody when somebody walked away but i remember when somebody said i stand for jesus [Applause] i remember they said they shut us down i remember but i remember what jesus said i started my church the way i wanted it and i'm gonna finish my church the way i started it that's for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord because you don't know like i know what he done for me cause you don't know like i know [Applause] [Applause] remember me devil let the musicians come give him praise in the house of god i'm gonna close with this words satan has done everything to stop you and god don't take it lightly [Music] when his enemy tries to stop what god's already ordained [Music] you see you were ordained to go into a promised land just like the children of israel were ordained to go into a promised land but notice sometimes when you're going through deuteronomy 25 i want you to go back there and take a look what god says remember he said remember amalek how that he tried to keep you out of the land how he came in behind you and he tried to come in and grab the weak ones that's an amalekite they'll come up and sneak up behind you and try to grab the weak ones try to grab the ones that were lagging behind but god says remember what he did for remember what he did against you remember how he tried to stop you [Music] but you go on down god said you go over there and you blot out his name you blot out his name that his name will never be remembered no more i want you to take a look in revelations 12 and 10 that we overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony and the accuser of the brethren is cast down look over in revelations 5. i want you to look over there and see who was there you see the lamb there you see the elders there you see john there was a type of you but see who you cannot find there satan i happen to believe that john was shouting because he saw his name but i happen to believe he was also shout because satan wasn't there and if you can go to remember you can go to forgetting [Music] oh don't you love the lord [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] every eyes closed he said brother andrew [Music] i have forgotten how much he loved me and i was remembering everything that satan put in my mind but i'd like to flip the script on him and remember what god said about me and forget what satan said about me maybe that's you maybe that's you in that backslidden condition that you have lost your first love and you know that you don't got cold on
