step aside Lord that Lord that the pull of the people and the needs of the people Lord can draw Lord and be ministered to this morning I pray father Lord we thank you for what you've done last night Lord but here we are again today Lord needing you once again needing you for the day and expecting you Lord to move but we thank you asked you bless the word as we read it and just take the Lord the rest of this service may you have the preeminence in Jesus name we pray if you have your Bibles we're going to be looking to to Luke 19. in the first verse and as you're turning I'd just like to take the opportunity once again to to tell you how wonderful it is to be with y'all and and how thankful I am for the for the friendship and the opportunity from with brother Ron and then and the Spencer family they they mean so very much to us and and I'd like to bring greetings to you as well this morning from my pastor brother Tim and the church there at home evening like Tabernacle and y'all y'all are truly are a sister Church to us it's uh we love y'all very much and we appreciate you and just we're thankful to be associated with you amen amen and we're going to turn now to Luke 19 the first verse and and it says and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guessed with a man that is a sinner and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is a son of Abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost amen you may have your seats this morning I'm so thankful that he came to seek and to save that which was lost and and that even here in the in the end time and I know we we have a wonderful message and we we dive into the delps of it and there's wonderful Mysteries and and we're so thankful for all those things and the restoration of the word but may we never lose sight of the fact that it's all for him seeking and saving those that are lost and and bringing those that are his back unto himself and what we find here in this story is is like with all men and and all women Zacchaeus faces obstacles and hindrances in his quest to get to Jesus I believe all of us can attest today that life isn't always easy and that there are real battles and that there are real struggles that we all face each and every day and it seems like life is a is a constant struggle and a constant battle we dealt with some of that last night it seems like that one battle leads you not to a time of Peace but it leads you directly into the next battle and and from that battle we go into the next battle and there isn't much time for us to to sit around and celebrate the victories that we win because before we know it we're right back into the very next battle it it seems like just as things begin to settle down and you think you have a moment to breathe the next assault is on its way or or the next wave comes crashing down over your boat now I'm sure that's how job must have felt when when his life began to fall apart and it began to crumble he lost his property and and then all this is bad how much worse could it get and then he loses his children and then you know his body's attacked and then his wife doesn't didn't support him and then his friends came and attacked him it was just one thing right after another wave after a wave attack after attack and yet through all of that it was in that that job caught a vision and it's in the midst of this battle and it's through this struggle he catches a vision of one that's coming and he says I know my redeemer liveth and he says though the skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh I shall see God so what I'm hoping for this morning what I want to encourage you this morning is in the middle of your struggle in the middle of the battle you find yourself in the day look for Jesus look around and recognize I'm gonna be victorious in this I'm gonna see God move on the scene in whatever situation that I'm in because unlike those that have no hope unlike those that are tossed about on the sea of life this morning church he's in our boat and because he's in our boat we're going to Crest every wave we're going to be victorious in every situation we are not going to find ourselves defeated you may have a day where you feel defeated you may have moments where you feel defeated but in the end you are going to be victorious amen because we have a captain we're going to win you know just for a moment why don't we stop just for a moment before we get going and let's remind the devil of of who the winner is and who the loser is wherever you're at today however you're feeling I want you to know you win and Satan I'd like you to know today that you are a loser you have been losing from the beginning of time and you're going to lose again because I'm the winner and there's only room for one of us so remind him today who the winner is and who the loser is amen listen strong winds are blowing strong winds are blowing from every side that the enemy's attacking the brides being attacked your family's being attacked your body may be being an attack but I must stand once again in reminding brother Ron it's going to take a stronger win than this because we are determined we are anchored we are going forward in the word listen we will rapture we will overcome we're not stopping your winds can blow but it's gonna take a stronger win than this to keep us from our promises amen hey man it doesn't matter who comes comes against it doesn't matter what comes against this morning we're determined that we're going to get to Jesus hey man I want to speak to you today on Beyond The Press Beyond The Press this account that that we read in Luke is the final trip of Jesus's life this is the same trip um where he's coming through Jericho where Bartimaeus is healed this is the this is leading up to the very final week of his life and it's in the very next chapter or it's actually in this very chapter that we read of his entry into Jerusalem and the people are shouting and they're praising and they're laying out their garments before him and he's riding in on a coat and and and and here it's only days before days before is crucifixion and his mind is already turned and set on Calvary and this man named Zacchaeus begins to desire to see him he begins to desire to see this Jesus for himself now I want you to know that these things don't happen by accident these things don't just happen on their own it isn't happenstance when someone begins to long for and desire God when that happens God Is On The Move listen that feeling on the inside of your heart that tug on the inside of your heart that isn't just you that isn't some just some funny feeling if God's moving in your heart this morning respond to it that's God calling you that's God Jordan it's not just some accident that you're sitting here this morning but God is on the move and he begins to pull and tug on your heart and and he's going about Gathering the last few ones what we're seeing here is the last moments of his life and here we are in the last moments of time as time is closing and he's going about seeking to save those that which were lost brother Branham says that his wife had been praying for him she says she is a Believer on the Lord Jesus and she'd been praying for her husband a businessman of the city to become a follower of the Lord Jesus and you know conviction can make you very restless it does that and so a good Praying Wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees at home than sometimes the preacher can do on the platform listen mom listen Dad don't let him hinder your prayers by making you think it's insignificant it's working it's moving it's going after that lost loved when it's going after that son or daughter and your prayers may do more than hundreds of sermons across this Pulpit don't you quit praying don't you give up don't you back off where you've been standing you keep calling out to God you keep crying out to God you can well I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and nothing's changed don't ever ever let that be your testimony you testify the finished work I prayed and it's finished I prayed and they're coming back I prayed and he's healed I prayed and the Holy Ghost it's on its way you say well I don't want to testify of Allah it can't be a lie if it's the word of God the word of God says you're healed the word of God says that you'll be there that your Offspring will be there it's not a lie just testify about what he said just testifying to finish work you're not testifying of what you feel you're not testifying of what you see you're testifying of what the word says amen it's not a lie when it's the word of God get your eyes off the press get your eyes off the situation and off of your current condition and in the current circumstances that are hindering you Focus Beyond this hardship Focus look Beyond this failure because what those things are is just a press the Press is the hindrances and the hardships and the battles that try to keep you from getting to your full inheritance they try to keep you from your encounter they try to keep you from your moment in his presence but it's just beyond the Press it's just beyond the Press it's just beyond this trial just beyond this sickness just beyond the things trying to keep you from getting there just beyond that is where Jesus is just beyond where you're standing today where you see no hope there is your deliverance just beyond today when the sickest of days there is your healing just beyond it today where you fill off backswing so far and I can never come back to God there he stands just right there waiting on you just beyond the Press but there's a part you have to play you have to be willing to press you've got to be willing to go in and not be hindered by every little thing sure it's going to be tough sure it's going to be a hindrance Zacchaeus couldn't see anything he wanted to get to Jesus there's always going to be something there to stop you from your encounter but do you turn around and go home empty today do you turn around and go home to feed it today or today do you say no sir I'm gonna enter in I'm going to push through I'm going to fight through I'm gonna get to Jesus today in this service Luke 19 1 are open in scripture we're gonna go through this for just a minute and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich Zacchaeus Was A Publican or a tax collector and not just any old tax collector he was the chief he was the boss of the tax collectors in Jericho and Jericho was known for the trade and the selling of what's known as Balsam it was known throughout the ancient world for its medicinal use and its rare perfumes it was the most economically significant plant of all ancient times why do you tell us all that because it brought in lots and lots and lots of money which created lots and lots and lots of taxes which shows us that Zacchaeus Was very very very rich and he was hated because he gained his wealth not because of his job per se not the pay that the Romans gave him but because he taxed his people more than even what the Romans did so that he could skim off the top and line his own pockets now can you kind of understand a little bit why when Jesus stopped to talk to him the people didn't like it so much I've been stealing your money every day and you know it and there's nothing you can do about it you were poor and you are struggling and you can't pay your bills and I'm rich and who's Jesus stopped to talk to me it kind of puts you in a little bit of an understanding of why there was a frustration are you serious of all these people and this one over here I mean you know the life they lived and they're they're good people and they're struggling and when they could sure use a visitation from Jesus today nope Zacchaeus think about it now he he goes to Zacchaeus and he is absolutely hated verse 3. and he sought to seek Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature you know Zacchaeus had a lot of things working against him that day things that had probably hindered him his whole life things that he had battled against and Ward against his entire life complexes that had built up over time you know complexes may not seem like that big a deal to you and mind battles may not seem like that big a deal to you because it may not be where you fight it may not be where you were let me put it to you like this just for a little silly illustration I wouldn't have had a hard time seeing Jesus that day it wouldn't have been my battle but to Zacchaeus it was the biggest battle in his life at that moment sometimes you may not understand what somebody's going through but that don't mean it ain't very real that don't mean it ain't a very tough battle that don't mean they don't need you to pray for them it may be it may seem simple to you but listen I want you to know if you're in the battle with a complex or a mind battle I'm not looking at it going get over your complexes I understand they're real but I also want you to know that you can be set free that you were fearfully and wonderfully made that God doesn't view you through that complex you can rise above that thing quit worrying about what this one thinks and that one thinks this one says you're a Son of God this one says you're a daughter of God this one says you're gonna make it this one calls you a mighty man of Valor complexes are real it real struggles they're real battles to the tall guy the Press wasn't an issue at all it wasn't an issue at all for him to see Jesus it wasn't his battle but to Zacchaeus because of the press he could not see Jesus but he didn't let it stop him that's what I'm trying to get to you today it didn't let him stop him Luke 19 and 4 and he ran before I tell you what apparently it's okay to run if it means you're trying to get to Jesus apparently it's okay to get a little loose and get to running if it's trying to get to the kids said I don't care what they think I don't care what I got to do if I got to take off running down this aisle to the altar if I gotta run here run there I'm gonna get to Jesus today and Zacchaeus runs ahead and climbs up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way I'm so thankful that there's something on the inside of us when Satan puts up a roadblock here or he puts up a roadblock there and he throws this up we don't go oh well I quit there's something else that says I can't quit I'm gonna get to Jesus today if I got to go this way and I got to go that way and I gotta fight through this no matter what I'm gonna keep pressing the battle it's dark it's evil everybody's quitting I'm not quitting I'm gonna get to Jesus and not just today I'm going to get to him at the very end I'm gonna get to the Rapture I'm gonna press through no matter what no matter what the Press whoa what what a hunger what a blessed desire that we have as Believers today what do I have you have a hunger don't ever quench that Hunger for More Of God don't ever quench that thirst for more of God don't ever get to the place where you don't recognize I need another drink today I need another portion today I need a refilling today I gotta get to Jesus today I've been serving the lord 25 years but I gotta get to him today I need more of him today outpour it today Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah when others turn away and when symptoms are out of control and people say it's no use something on the inside of a Believer says I gotta find a way to him I gotta get to him today it's a blessed desire I must see Jesus you others were tall and had no desire to see Jesus the blessing is it your height or how easy life is for you or how hard it is what the blessing is that you have a hunger those that hunger and thirst shall be filled there's a hunger in you you count that as a blessing today well well I don't measure up to others I fall short I I don't have gifts people might say something it's all part of the press that's all just part of the press listen there are many Souls out there that look the park there's many Souls out there that walk into church just perfect and their family walks in just perfect and they all look the part but when it comes right down to it they won't go down in the valley and face the giant that's down there stealing everything from them taking their kids robbing their home destroying it may look perfect on the outside they may look good on the outside but they don't have what you have on the inside something that'll take you down in the valley something that'll take you down there and say not today Goliath this belongs to me this is mine what is it I have today you have a hunger to have it all you have a hunger for every promise you have a hunger for the Holy Ghost you have a hunger to see it fulfilled in your life that is a blessed thing you're not a soul today you maybe you don't look the part maybe a ruddy little kid but you're the one that's going to rally the troops you're the one that's going to cut his head off you're the one that presses through when others quit it's a blessed desire others can't push through the Press others can't stand before the Giant they may seem to have it all together they may seem to have a happy home and a good job what do I have brother Aaron what do I have had hunger that see Gene a willingness to fight I must get to Jesus thank you brother it doesn't matter what I have to do today it doesn't matter the struggle that I'm facing what are you willing to do whatever Aaron I've been backslid for so long I've been sitting here cold so long I've been sitting here and everybody thinks I've got it all together it doesn't matter get to Jesus today get to Jesus today get to Jesus today it don't matter what I have to do if I got a snot if I gotta run if I got a boohoo at the halter if I got a jump Shout Whatever and whatever I have to do lay pride aside lay your pride aside Jesus I need more of you today I gotta have it to make it Lord I need you in this place I need you in my heart I need you in my home I don't care what anybody else thinks I don't care and I'll tell you this if you're at the altar and somebody thinks something about it they need to be at the altar next to you what do you think this place is for get more of Jesus get more Jesus Hallelujah we've come to a place where the altar's got such a stigma that people are afraid to come there and worship I heard a man say one time that that I took a shower last week but I'll probably need another one this week too it's okay to come down here and clean up every now and again pour things out listen the altar is a place of worship hey what gives us the right to stick our nose up in the air so my come on now come on now that's like me saying I ain't going to the gym because there's fat people there [Applause] well what do you think the Gym's for is to try to help people like me is to try to help people get back and say why do you think we're here for if you're struggling we're here for you if you're in the battle come on down we'll fight with you we'll pray with you we'll help you along that's what it's all about and if you got a problem with that come on down we'll help you too that's what the church is for to get more of Jesus I need more Jesus I need more joy I need more peace I need more victory Hallelujah but you got to press through to get it Hallelujah he's right there Beyond The Press he's right there brother Brown says if the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among Us then press till you get to him like the little woman with the blood issue and all of the different things that take in place in all the adversaries in her way she just pressed right on through until she touched him he says oh it's true she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrances you might have some I've got plenty of them a lot of hindrances but about your faith that's the thing if you can't be persistent if you're going to let everything hinder you he says now physically you might feel bad physically you might not feel well and otherwise you might not feel like going to church you might not feel like doing anything but your faith don't have no hindrances it moves on anyhow when you're willing to lay that pride aside when you're willing to set fear aside when you're willing to fight through the Press I promise you he's going to meet your knee he's going to meet you there but he wants people who are willing to fight we said it last night he don't want no cowards in your foxholes he wants people that are willing to fight willing to not back down willing that when discouragement hits when the doctors report ain't what you'd hope for you say that's okay I'm still looking to this report I'm still fighting in I'm still pressing in people that are that have a backbone about them you've prayed and prayed and prayed and it seems like nothing's happened you've called for your family and your family member he's struggling he's going to die and you pray and it seems like Jesus just went further seems like you just walked away seems like your prayers ain't getting out of the building fear Whispers I'll just give up doubt begins to come in says I told you it wouldn't work I told you it wouldn't work but something on the inside of a Believer something deep down on the inside says even now even now Lord Jesus even now is there anything too hard for the Lord there is nothing too hard for the Lord there is nothing too hard for the Lord today in this presence in this place there is nothing too hard for the Lord if you're willing to stay right with it to push through push back your doubts begin to doubt your doubts be honest before God be honest like the man says Lord I believe but help my unbelief if there's anything holding me back if there's anything from keeping me from getting to you Lord help me with that help me move beyond that today your flesh always says stop sure it does your flesh will tell you to stop your symptoms will tell you to stop but your faith says forward your faith says keep going keep pressing the battle amen he says but this one thing remember this morning seek life pursue after it thirst for it just keep reaching for it don't let nothing stand in your way he says seek for it seek for that life don't let nothing stand in the way listen there's a squeeze coming against the Bride of Jesus Christ right now trying to squeeze the life out of it trying to make it cold and dead and formal trying to squeeze the life out of our services trying to keep life from springing forth trying to keep people from getting a new birth with Jesus Christ or they can talk about him but don't get to him we can preach about him but don't get to him oh no no don't be so fanatical you don't got to press through all that stuff and get to him trying to keep Jesus from being born in the hearts of those that are seeking him trying to stop the new birth brother Branham says what they're afraid of is the new birth that's the reason we got grandchildren in the church afraid of a new birth afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of the power of God listen it's an anointing it's an attack on the anointing it's an attack on the atmosphere Twisted quotes building up a press Twisted ideas and they remove the the altar call out of the church they remove worship and spirit and Truth out of the church and what do they do and they're setting up a press to try to keep people from getting to that life listen as long as I have breath in my body I'll stand up I'll fight I'll push I'll pull and I'll say you gotta be born again you gotta get to the New Birth you got to get to Jesus for yourself I'm glad you believe the message I'm glad you've accepted it I believe the message brother and congratulations you're on the level with the Devil you've made it as far as Satan not a good place to stop because he believes and he trembles I say believe and keep going believe and get more believe and push through believe and get to Jesus believe and get born again Hallelujah Hallelujah they keep trying to put a cage on it keep trying to squeeze the lay you can't keep that eagle caged up forever eventually listen an eagle can't help but believe in the Supernatural he can't help but but go beyond the Press brother Branham said if a man is born of the spirit of God he believes in the Supernatural he can't help it because he's a son of God he said that's the reason tonight we got so many old cold formal and different God forsaken backslidden churches Lord May that never describe us he says because men and women are not born of the spirit of God they have no taste of God they don't know nothing about God and all they know is theology that's the reason you can't get them to believe a thing that's exactly right why don't people see healings why don't people see miracles why don't people see the gifts manifested well that don't happen in our church and they say it almost like a brag because there's been a press set up there's been a press set up why do you see it here because it's preached why do you not see it other places because it's not but you don't have to preach against it just don't preach it you know a lot of times I think people are going to be held accountable not for what they preach but for what they did not preach they didn't want to offer you living water they didn't want it it was just old stagnant the water listen listen through the Dark Ages the whales of Living Water were clogged up and rocks and pollution and things were put in it but a message came in this day and all of that was dug out and it was pulled out and water began to flow freely once again pure again like on the day of Pentecost just like in the first age and now people are coming and they're putting pollutants back in it they're dropping little things back in it I say I won't stand for it I want clean water I want pure water I want it just like the Bible says I wanted how the message says just preach the message and you'll preach the supernatural just preach the message and you'll believe in signs and wonders and gifts and the new birth if you preach the message that's what you'll be preaching [Applause] Mark two and one and again he entered into Capernaum after some days and it was noise that he was in the house I like that how you know he's here the noise and straightway many were gathered together and so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was born of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they told their friend we're sorry buddy you just gonna have to have the palsy days of Miracles has passed God don't do this no more we're going back home no no I don't have that I don't have that translation says when they could not come unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay and when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven them listen there was so much in their way probably a lot more than was in your way getting here this morning maybe there was a little fight in the house maybe you caught too many red lights but you got here they couldn't get in they couldn't make it in they listened sometimes we just need to get a little bit unconventional and tear the roof off the place he said to listen you keep caging people up you keep keeping people from Jesus you tell them you can't worship like this and you can't worship like that you better be careful cause they're about to tear the roof off the place I'll do whatever it takes to get to Jesus I'll tear the walls down I'll rip the roof off I'm getting to Jesus I need salvation I need healing I need my joy restored you told me I can't dance I'm gonna tear the roof off the place Hallelujah you can't keep an eagle cage up forever your denominational box is about to explode Hallelujah you can't hold them in there forever oh you ain't coming this way you ain't coming that way there's no room for you here look out devil the roof's gonna come off this place Hallelujah when men get desperate enough when women get desperate enough that I Gotta Have Jesus I gotta have him today I'm lost I'm sick I'm bound they'll do whatever it takes get out the way I'd like to warn you devil don't stand on the tracks when the trains coming through because there's a bride today that's gonna get to Jesus no matter what it takes you can build walls we're gonna tear them down Hallelujah get to Jesus get to Jesus he's just beyond the Press Hallelujah there was a great press but it was just beyond that was their friend's Deliverance here's their friend's healing you know sometimes we're gonna Sidetrack here for a minute we don't recognize how important it is that man couldn't tear the roof off himself that man couldn't tear the roof off himself well it's just it's not my service okay I ain't argue with you but what if it's somebody else's and they need the roof tore off listen Jesus could have rolled the stone back himself but he told lives his sisters go roll it can you imagine he could have said Stone but he's got these two sisters out there hey just watch are they willing to do it are they willing to do it it's sweating there's people gathered there's men there were a couple men go to help and Jesus no no they got to roll the stone away think about it for a minute there's people sitting here wrapped up in Graves clothes they're sitting here in a tomb Bound for Hell Bound with sin and all he's asking you to do is to roll the stone away for him today so that he can call him out of the Tomb I say it may not be your service but get in there and begin to roll the stone began to push began to pull begin to tear the roof back so that sick person can get to Jesus so that lost person can get to Jesus I tell you what there ought to be such an atmosphere created around you that he can't sleep on the Pew next to you he gets a little tired you say Glory what's going on what's going on they just tore the roof off for you now get in there and get to Jesus get your healing get your salvation get what you have need of you got a job to do today you got a job to do every service roll the stone rip the roof help other people get to Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah yes Lord yes Lord she's at the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among Us then press till you get to him amen we're in mark 5. 21 it says that when Jesus passed over again by ship onto the other side much people gather unto him and he was nine to the Sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter life at the point of death I pray that he come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years now notice this is going to tie right into what I just said this wasn't her service this was jairus's service think about it sometimes we sit there and this one's jumping and this one's shouting and you're going they're having themselves a time they're they're having a good you know we talk about it way too much in Broad terms well we had a good service today wow it was powerful there today at the Full Gospel Lighthouse wow God did some wonderful things and it's easy to do that and not make it about you did you have a good service today did you get everything out of this service that you were supposed to get I don't care if every single person in here was delivered and ran the aisles and got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost if you didn't for you that service was a failure it's about you what are you getting oh this is their service it's okay he's in the room you can have him too you can have a portion too you can have your part too there's enough of him to go around what if she didn't say well he's occupied he's already dealing with somebody's heart that's not how it works when you see him dealing with somebody's heart you say yes Lord Do It For Me deal with my heart feel my soul heal my body give me more of you just like you're doing it for them said and he said she had suffered many things of many Physicians had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she heard of Jesus she came in the Press there was something keeping her from him she came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may but touch his clothes I shall be whole and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned about in the press and said who touched me and the disciples said unto him thou seeest the multitude thronging thee and sayeth thou who touched me he looked around to see her that had done this thing but the woman fear Him and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and here's what happens when you get through the Press and he said unto her daughter thy faith have made thee whole go in peace and be whole of that place she had every reason to quit she had every reason to turn back stop you're pushing are you pushing through the crowd for every man she had ever went to to help her had failed her she was considered unclean wasn't even supposed to be around them her family had turned her out her family wanted nothing to do with her you talk about complexes you talk about hurts you talk about scars and then people telling you sit down you don't got to be so fanatical why is it always you jumping in church why is it always you let it let some of us have our quiet time with Jesus you're gonna have to go have your quiet time somewhere else I'm gonna go ahead and tell you right now I didn't come here for quiet time I come through to press through the crowd to fall at his feet and say Jesus I Need You Now she pushed she pulled she shook I don't know she might have knocked some poor beggar over poor fella it was her time she wasn't worried about him he needs to get to Jesus for himself I'm getting to Jesus my opportunity my time my moment has he pushed through the crowd [Applause] poor beggar maybe she pushed some people down they've been waiting a long time I don't know but it was their responsibility to get to him for theirselves it was her responsibility to get to him for herself yeah I kind of thank you when I read her story I I think about that little little lady in Mexico with the dead baby brother Branham said I had hundreds of ushers this lady here in the Bible got that same attitude just try to stop me yeah I'll tell you what it's okay to come to church with a little bit of attitude it's okay cookie come to church with the attitude just try to stop me just try to keep me from my blessing today you just try to keep me from the Holy Ghost you just try to keep me from my healing you just try to stop my dance you just try to stop my joy you just try to stop my peace come with a little bit of an attitude you just try we come a little bit too passive it's okay we're Fighters there's nothing wrong with a little bit of attitude if it's directed at the Devil problem is we come to church with the director we just try to bless me brother Ron just try to make me get excited brother Andrew oh sure yeah you like that song but not me try to find one I like you know I told the church back home last Sunday there are songs that I don't like I shouldn't say I don't like that don't speak to me or move me per se let's be honest there are songs you sing that aren't your favorites right here yep but guess what that song ain't about you or for you it's about him and for him so in the moment it may not be your favorite but guess what he's my favorite so if it's praising him I'll just go ahead and I'll sing it with all my heart I'll clap with all my heart I may not even get it I may not understand it but you know what it's for him it's about him it's his praise it's his worship so I'll give him all I got I tell you what this uh forgive me on this one but too many people yes I was not always a Christian this reference will tell you that but too many people got Club religion where they sit over there with their buddies and talk to the DJ plays their favorite song and it's oh that's my song wow Glory and then they're gonna sit back down and don't do nothing the rest of the service how about you praising the whole time with your whole heart with everything you got from start to finish and everywhere in between I don't care what's on the DJ plays I'm there to worship [Applause] it's all for him it ain't about what you like [Applause] hallelujah it's truth anyway [Applause] how you go from that to the very next song be glad when this one's over I know you've seen it surely ain't just where I go I started to say my church but it's not my church a determination to get what you need will always bring results brother Brown says Christ is our Variety Store by one Spirit we're all baptized into one big Variety Store amen anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing I'll take it if I need Joy I'll take it if I need Victory I'll take it it's all hanging around in God's big Variety Store and I'm a possession and you have a possession of everything in that Variety Store when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost Amen brother you talk about Elbow Room he said let's take over we need healing there it is sitting there for you reach over and take it you might have to kick over a few things to get to it push through a few things to get to it but go ahead and take it you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it but God's got a ladder there if you're interested in getting it who it's Out Of Reach this morning brother everything let's climb for it maybe even a sycamore tree I can't quite get to it we'll kick over whatever's in your way whatever you got to do get there push through anyway till you get it because there's always going to be a press there's always going to be things in the way but what I want to ask you right now is how desperate are you to get to Jesus how important is that moment to you how important is it what are you willing to sacrifice what are you willing to give up what are you willing to go through how important is it because I find this very interesting look in Luke 8 19. I'm going to tell you right now it don't matter who you are how long you've been in the message how long you've been saved who your daddy is who your grandpappy is don't none of that matter you can be a descendant of General Robert E Lee himself that tends to hold weight in these parts you gotta be desperate verse 19. Luke 8 19. then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the Press his brothers his mama you don't know how it is when Mama wants to talk to you it's mama now they're thinking I'm mama and we're his brothers listen what they say and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy Brethren stand without Desiring to see thee uh oh mom and brothers ain't desperate enough mama and brothers think hey you know I don't want to get in with all them folks they're running and jumping and shouting here I am with my hair up I ain't losing no bobby pins today I ain't doing it y'all go tell Jesus that I'm out here waiting on it tell Jesus I'll meet him on my terms tell Jesus I need the Holy Ghost but I ain't giving this up I I I need I need a financial blessing but I ain't willing to work uh oh listen too many people think of financial blessing is I wake up and I go check my bank account and boom knew it quarter meal let me tell you what's really going to happen you keep praying for that Financial blessing and you keep not doing nothing on your end and that thing will keep saying zero and you keep crying about it and fussing about it and whining and asking for handouts but the minute you say Lord I'm willing to work I'm willing to do whatever I don't want a handout I want a job I want you to provide an opportunity I want you to do something for me and then things will start growing a little by little by little by little and you will be able to pay your bills and you will have things overflowing you gotta be willing to do your part and it goes for the same thing in healing and deliverance and salvation everything you got a part to play [Applause] bad case of the lazy artists running around and we'll move on verse 21. and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God and do it in that moment because they weren't willing to Humble themselves he didn't even claim them as his own he said these are my family these people right here who've gathered who've come to hear me speak who were willing to drive however far do whatever it takes fight through whatever unbelief that's my family these are my brothers these is my mother these are the ones that I love you're not willing to do that he literally said go tell them they want in here they got to come the same way everybody else did you want in the kingdom of God you're going to come the same way everybody else did you got to repent you've got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and you got to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the pattern it'll always be the pattern until the end of the ages there is no other way but Zacchaeus was willing to climb Luke 19 and 5 and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make case and come now for today I must abide at the house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully I love how Jesus comes and calls him by name calls him Zacchaeus it's the last person called by name before Jesus enters into Jerusalem it's the last name that gets called I love it how he doesn't look up there and go hey little short fella I I figure that you're probably up there because you couldn't see because you're 311. Hey listen back then everybody was shorter than we are today so for it to be mentioned in the Bible that he was little I'm not trying I'm not trying to be funny but I figured he was a door for something is that is that proper dwarf is proper time yes because everybody back then was like five foot tall and he's so short that the Bible takes time to point it out and go this man was little so and I don't say that once again to be funny but I'm telling you I figure even climbing the tree was hard we just look at it like oh he climbed the tree well you go climb a tree now do it being three foot six he was willing to fight through but listen he called him by name he calls him by name because your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I imagine he probably thought like Nathaniel did when did you know me just before you climb the sycamore tree I already knew you I'm the one that put that desire in your heart to see me quit worrying about whether or not you're going to make it quit worrying about whether or not he's going to meet you quit worrying about whether or not listen he's the one that put the desire in your heart to begin with he's the one that put it there he's the one drawing you he's the one intentionally walking by your tree today you're gonna make it he's gonna meet you he's gonna Supply your needs he did it all on purpose he knows exactly who you are he knew you he claimed you Isaiah 43 1. but now thus saith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by name Thou Art mine listen before you ever sinned before you ever walked out on God you were his before you ever backslid the first time you were his your name was there and he didn't look at it go oh boy I gotta erase that one oh no no he knew who you were he claimed you Satan has no legal right to claim you he doesn't have a single right that's what he tries to claim you that's why it's so wonderful to understand that you're a seed Gene of God that's why it's so good awesome to understand that you're an attribute of God and that your name was written down before the foundation of the world and that book that name on that book is a time stamp it is a time stamp that does away with the claim of the enemy and we're fixing to be bringing this down how many of you know what a time stamp is a time stamp is is a prove when a transaction was made or when events happen and can be used in the court of law as evidence they can look at a bank statement there's a time stamp on there they can see when a sale happened on the internet there's a time stamp that shows when the transaction took place and the enemy comes and he tries to put a claim on my life and he says no no God I see here where he fully surrendered his heart to you in the year 2013. Lord says that's right he says well according to my official paperwork look I had him wrapped up in sin and doing awful things all the way back in 1991 when he was just a boy so rightfully my claim predates your claim and he belongs to me the Lord says oh well that that's quite interesting let's go to the record so he opens it up and he goes oh there was a transaction there was a transaction took place I see it right here and you would you say 1991 according to the transaction there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and no sins they are wiped away he's been mine all along you have no claim on him it's time staff you're his you're his when did he buy me before the foundation of the world before I ever sinned before I ever stumbled before I ever even struggled he said time stamp your mind timestamp I bought you with my own precious blood his claim is not legitimate he has no claim on you you are always his you were always his Hallelujah the enemy's claim today is fraudulent this would be our last little portion here I love how all of this has taken place in Jericho Bartimaeus is healed in Jericho Zacchaeus is spoken to in Jericho because if you'll recall Jericho is a cursed City Joshua 6 26 tells us and Joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the Lord that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho and you can type this over to the fact that Jericho's a cursed City but our flesh is cursed human flesh is cursed and and families have cycles and families have things we would call Family curses but when Jesus came to the cursed City those that lived underneath that curse were set free and we like to point to our flesh and well I can't because this and Daddy had a temper and so I have a temper Daddy had a lust problem so I got a lust problem well my family just has a we have problems with Temperance just who we are it's this cursed flesh and you know brother on this this flesh isn't converted hey that's a true statement this flesh will always be a thorn in your side but it is not to rule over you Jesus came strolling down through Jericho that cursed City and people were set free how about you let Jesus stroll through that cursed flesh today let him stroll through that cursed family stroll through that family cycle Let Jesus come walking down through your temper problem and your lust problem and your backbiting two tongue unforgiving Spirit Let Jesus come walking down through that today and watch Freedom Break Free watch the blind eyes come open watch people come down on the tree when Jesus says I've come to seat and save that which was lost oh but it's cursed it sure is but add Jesus to that equation and those who live underneath that curse will be set free and here we are Jesus is doing the impossible in an impossible place and he was doing it for people who were willing to go beyond the Press they were willing to fight willing to cry out like Bartimaeus willing to lay it all down and what we're going to see here is that our response to Jesus plays a major major role in the outcome of the story your response to Jesus determined your outcome Luke 19 6 back to Zacchaeus and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully now I want you to notice and we're going to read it in a minute the difference in the response at the opportunity to be with Jesus between this man and the Rich Young Ruler and we've already established they're very similar this man Zacchaeus is very very rich they're put there for a purpose side by side back to back chapters and when they saw it they all murmured saying he was going to be guest with the man that is a sinner and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and right there people go see it ain't Fair he told the Rich Young Ruler he had to give everything but now as a kiss is Just saying he give the half there's a reason why did you listen and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold listen I love his repentance when there's true repentance in a heart you don't have to come to him as a preacher and go now you know you wronged this person and you wronged that person and you're going to need to go make that right if I'm having to tell you the things you need to go make right you haven't repented because true repentance he's telling Jesus what I need to go do Lord I know I've done wrong I need to go make this right I need to go make that right I need to go take care of these things and it's after he says all that Jesus says salvation has come to this house because he recognizes a true repentance Jesus don't have to say now go sell everything you own and restore your debts and and your money Pro your money is a problem and not only that but the way you got it's a problem Zacchaeus said half of all my goods will I give to the poor and anyone that I've wronged listen that's going to be a lot of people he fits and be busy for a minute he's got a lot of things to make right and he's going to start doing it he says I will restore fourfold shows me the man knows the scripture because he's going all the way back to Exodus 22 to where if you stole a sheep or killed somebody's sheep you had to give them for in return and he's basing it on this principle he said I'm going to restore it four times of what I took and that's why he didn't say I'm going to take everything I have and give it to the poor because he needed lots and lots and lots of money to pay back the debts from the people he stole from he wasn't saying I'm not going to give it all away he was just saying I'm only giving half of it to the poor and the rest of it I gotta restore fourfold all my money's about to be gone he is selling out in a way the Rich Young Ruler could not all of my money is going to be gone I'm going to repay all of this verse 9 and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he is the son of Abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost it's so powerful to me right here in the closing moments of time and that's what this was it was the closing moments of the Jewish dispensation their time was running out and what's he doing he's on his way to Calvary the weight of the world is upon him but it wasn't too late for him to stop by for a little man named Zacchaeus it wasn't too late for him to come by your house today it's not too late for him to save your lost loved one you keep praying we're right at the verge of the crucifixion and he's seeking and he's looking to find those that were lost and not only is he saving but he's saving those that are impossible to save living in a cursed City why you say impossible to save Luke 18 18. in a certain ruler ask him saying good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good none is good save one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said unto him yet like us thou one thing sell all that that has and distribute it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven Come and follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful notice the difference one was joyful one is sorrowful for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was sorrowful he said how hardly now pay attention this is why I said savings Zacchaeus Was impossible how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven I'm not sure your definition of impossible but in my little simple dictionary this is impossible but what I love about the way the Lord does things and the way he says things is he tells you how it is without him and then it's like a little simple algebra equation he adds Jesus into the equation it's impossible it can't happen a rich man cannot be saved verse 26 and they that heard it said who then can be saved it's impossible verse 27 and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God he speaks of the impossibilities and then says now watch me do it it's impossible but watch me do it it's impossible brother Ron but watch him do it it's impossible for that one out there today but watch him do it your Situation's impossible but watch him do it today he says I'm coming to your house today I'm coming to your home I'm coming to your situation it's impossible watch me do it musicians musicians can come watch him do it you think it's too late for you you think your situation is too far gone I say it's time to push through the Press there's a press set up before each and every one of us there's hindrances set up before each and every one of us but it's time to get up dust yourself off load your weapon get back on the line and say I'm gonna press through the Press today I'm going to push through and I'm gonna get to Jesus I'm gonna press through for my joy I'm gonna press through for my healing I'm gonna press through for my peace I'm a pest press through it to this to this anxiety leads me until this depression leaves me I'm going to press through I'm not gonna stay where I'm at today because just beyond the Press that's where Jesus is just beyond the Press we all got hindering spirits and things trying to keep us trying to doubts coming against our faith just behind the Press but brother here in my Situation's impossible brother you don't know how long I've been in this case you don't know the things holding me back I can't seek Jesus because of the press I can't get to him today because of the press you're the ones he's looking for he came looking for you today because he said oh your Situation's impossible watch me do it watch me do it in the very next chapter
