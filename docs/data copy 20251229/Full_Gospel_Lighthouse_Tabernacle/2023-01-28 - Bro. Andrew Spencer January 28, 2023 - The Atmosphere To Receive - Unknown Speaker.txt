Samuel chapter one first Samuel chapter 1 verse 1. and then down to Isaiah chapter 44. two through four there hey ma'am amen before we read this evening let us let's just speak to the author of the word tonight how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen amen let's just go to him in prayer now Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus Lord with this this sacred word in front of us Lord tonight and we place it over our heart Lord and we recognize that it is you and letter form father and all we understand the the power of what we hold in our hands tonight but Lord we recognize that you don't want to just stay on the pages but Lord you want to come home the tablets of our heart and father we invite you even so now Lord to come and take every person here under the sound of our voice Lord Jesus Lord you take us under your control father for your glory Lord and Lord we just invite you father to come Lord I see all of these hands father and Lord I know that there are very dire needs amongst us Lord Jesus that that only you can meet so father we ask Lord that you would come and you'd make yourself known alive and visible may we recognize the presence of the Living God right here amongst us tonight Lord we we commit ourselves unto you we ask Lord that you would just come behind this word with an amen tonight father meet the children's needs in Jesus Christ's name amen amen first Samuel first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 1 now there was a certain man of Rhema thaium so from of Mount Ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of Jerusalem the son of elahu the son of tohu the son of zoof of ephrath and an ephrathite and he had two wives the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was panaya and banaya had children but Hannah had no children and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in shalom and the two sons of Eli hofna and Phineas the priest of the Lord were there and when the time was that elk and I offered to get to he gave when elkana offered he gave to panaya his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb notice the Lord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb ain't that a stinking enemy this is the Lord's doing but the enemy likes to get behind things and do a good job of being an adversary and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not did not eat then said elkana her husband to her Hannah why weepest thou and why Edith thou not and why is thy heart grieved and not I better to thee than ten Sons so Hannah rose up after they had eaten and shallow and after they had drunk now Eli the priest had set upon a seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a vowel and said oh lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the infliction of thine handmaid and remember me remember me and not forget thy handmaid but will thou give will give unto thine handmaid a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and they come to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunk and put away thy wine from me and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord count not thine handmade for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him and he said and she said let thy handmaid find Grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad Isaiah chapter 44 and verse 2. and as you're turning there I'd like to speak to you tonight on the atmosphere to receive the atmosphere to receive and brother Branham said in the message the supernatural he said any person that ever come into the atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else Isaiah chapter 44 and verse 2. thus saith the Lord that made thee informed thee from the womb and will help thee fear not o Jacob my servant and now Jesse run whom I have chosen or I will pour out water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thy Offspring and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the watercourses may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as I said we'd like to speak to you tonight on the atmosphere the atmosphere to received brother Branham said in the message convinced and then concerned he said so I believe tonight that the holy spirit is here it's here for those who are destined to receive it who that believes it who is waiting on it it's here to straighten out every one of them spiritual problems he said it's here to heal every sick person that's present it's here so the holy spirit is here for those that it's destined for it's here to heal every spiritual problem it's here to heal every sick person that's present it's here but you've got to come and get into the atmosphere of it and the attitude to receive it you've got to come in not in an emotional workup you've got to come upon the basis of believing a promise that God made that doesn't that's what does it and I think it's a very wonderful thing that we recognize that we are living where we are and I think it's a wonderful thing that if you can look and see where you are and where you're living at but to look that tonight that we can look all the way back through prophecy and look through the Old Testament and see that there was Promises of the days of Jesus that was coming and when Jesus came he fulfilled all of the prophecy that was laying there for him to fulfill now we recognize that Jesus Christ fulfilled all that was told of him in the Old Testament but we recognize that we are here living out this generation and here we are as the Bride of Jesus Christ sowing forth that he is still alive and he's still the same yesterday today and forever and we're living here at the winding up of all of the prophecies and I think that we've been given as the children of God one of the most greatest opportunities of the hour to be living in is to witness the very power and the confirmation of his resurrection it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost living amongst the Church of the Living God and to think that that that God would choose such a people as ourselves to come and live in the most wicked and the most adulterous generation and there is going to be an overcomer that lives out lives out this day and doesn't knock down to the devil's ideas and not not give in to what he says about her or what he thinks about her but this bride of Jesus Christ has been foreseen overcoming every devil and every tactic that was that was said about about the Church of the Living God this bride will overcome every enemy and I think that that the reason why we can have such a fervancy in our heart is that there is prophecy that we're riding on there there is a fulfillment of scripture that you and I are riding on tonight that God is going to have a spotless bride tonight and to think that that we're living right here where we recognize that we are already here on the cusp of the Rapture and we're right here at the culmination of all things where we're where we're watching the blending of Eternity with a blending of time and you're you're watching as our bodies are getting ready to change and and I believe that it's a wonderful time as a Church of the Living God to be living in and to recognize that the time has come for us to stand like never before and I don't think it's a time that we ought to waver on our faith I don't believe it's a time that we ought to back off when people call us Fanatics for believing what we believe leave but I I believe that that we ought to be more scared of the people that are afraid of us than the Fanatics that might be sitting around but I believe that right here tonight that in the atmosphere like you feel tonight I know that you're aware of it you're accustomed and you you understand that you're in the presence of the Shekinah Glory that Aaron would walk up there he would walk in there year after year but you recognize that you are in that presence and it's not something that you do you weekly after weekly but it's something that you do day after day it's not something that leaves you but it's something that goes with you and it guides you and to think that this atmosphere is here and it's here to change your bodies it's here to give you a faith to believe like never before I think it's a wonderful thing that we recognize that that where we are you know for anything the atmosphere has got to be right for anything to happen the atmosphere has got to be right you go to a you go to a place of business and they're trying to sell you whether it may be jewelry or sell you some kind of some kind of piece of furniture they have the ability and they they know what they're doing because they've studied out business for so long that they know they how to set an atmosphere to get you in a buying mood there are salesmen that have certain pictures that they'll throw at you just to make you feel like you really need this item you go into a jewelry store they've got the lights set at a certain place they've got they've got the Black Velvet over top of the diamonds they've got the light underneath of it just so they can sell you on the point and the more light that you put on it over the darkness the greater that that diamond shows but you see what are they doing they're creating an atmosphere if you go to a nice restaurant and it you really they really know what they're doing they've got the tune set at a certain decibel so that it doesn't flutter your heart in such a way but they've got it set so that you get in the atmosphere and you enjoy yourself and you think man that food was amazing but what it was they were playing on all of your senses now I think that if the world in the carnal world can play on your senses in such a way that they could build up a stake or or they could build up a light and they could put it out before you and have the knights can sitting in a right spot and have the have the lighting just dim to a certain spot if they can work on that kind of atmosphere how much more is a Church of the Living God how much more so would we be able to recognize that there's an atmosphere that is setting here and if we want anything to happen tonight the atmosphere has got to be right brother Brandon would tell us who said you get the music right on the piano you get the music right on the organ and you watch Supernatural things begin to happen and I know that there's a lot of people that that want to kick out organs they don't want to kick out they want to kick out the string instruments and they want to kick out the piano but the Bible said let everything the Bible said let everything that hath breath praise you the Lord he said praise him on a high standard symbol praise him on a low sounding symbol so if the Bible said that these things are going to be there we ought to use them to the ability to bring about something Supernatural now we ain't got no fog machines and we ain't got no big lights here tonight but there is a word that is created an atmosphere here tonight that can set the tone for the supernatural to take place the Bride of Jesus Christ don't need the lighting right she don't need she don't need a fog machine she don't need somebody to get up and make her feel all ugly and googly she just needs the word of God to come pass over her in the right atmosphere and you watch as Miracles begin to transpire he said but that's the hardest thing to do is to get people in that kind of an atmosphere an atmosphere of worshiping an atmosphere of believing now I I find it very hard as as a man of God that stands here week in after weekend that know that you know how to set an atmosphere that knows that you know how to worship that knows that you know how to believe that God would lay this on my heart in such a way to preach it to you that we've got to get in an atmosphere to receive you already know how to create an atmosphere he was here before I ever got to the pulpit you entered into worship what does it do it is setting a tone for the service but I believe that right now that I believe that God's got something in store for the Church of the Living God and I believe that the Winds of rapture are blowing like never before they're blowing through this building you may not be able to sense it or you may not be able to see it but there's a holy wind that is brooding across the Church of the Living God and it is preparing her and it is preparing her to leave this whole world now I'm going to tell you tonight if I if I didn't believe that this was true I surely wouldn't let my children sit underneath of this tonight if I didn't believe this with all of my heart I wouldn't invite you here after weekend after weekend to try to tell you that this this works if it doesn't work but I can sit here under the auspices of the Holy ghost and I can tell you that if we get the atmosphere right that we can watch healings transpire we can watch families restore we can watch people that have broken hearts watch them with a contrite spirit what's the peace of God pass over their life I believe anything that is worth is worth doing is worth doing it well and so I believe that if we're going to serve God then we ought to serve him with all of our capacity we ought to be all in in everything that we do we shouldn't do anything half-heartedly you wouldn't want me up here if I was half-hearted you wouldn't want me Pup here preaching to you the message of Jesus Christ if I was out there trying to live every type of way and then come up here and speak in tongues dance and shout and preach you the word of God when I was out during the week when I was living all kinds of sin you wouldn't want me behind the pulpit but you get somebody that knows who they are been born again by the Holy Ghost all right what is it we are living in the hour where manifested sons of God are walking out there by the power of God and going out there and taking the very power away from Satan because you recognize that that power belongs to you every devil is underneath your feet I heard the prophet say this week he said if you are the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil inhales underneath of you atmosphere ain't got nothing to do with how you feel atmosphere ain't got nothing to do what you see there are certain people that you just love to be around because they've got an atmosphere and there are certain people that Satan is scared to get around you know I I'm thinking I was thinking you know you know they they at certain times in a year they give out these Awards or they have award ceremonies in football season they give out they give out the all-americans and or they give out the the first in the nation or they give out the best in the defense so they give out this that or the other but I'd like to just maybe just take a look down in hell and see maybe you know you could just let your mind just drift for a minute or begin to imagine hell having an award ceremony down there can you imagine hell going down there and say hey your first team all district you went up there and you defeated that guy with cancer and we're giving you your ceremonial Badge go ahead and tell everybody down there in Hell How Great Thou Art and you can imagine as hell's going around and all the demons are all pumped up about it you see what they're doing is they are in an atmosphere where they're rallying around somebody being defeated but I wonder tonight if we would if we would be able to stop all the ceremonies that would be transpiring down in hell that this one right here this demon all slew foot right here he didn't get a badge because he went up to Elkton Virginia and he'd come back whooped if that's the case I want to make sure every death that you come up against doesn't never get a ceremony it's time that the demons that you've been facing in your life that you start addressing the Devils that came attacking you time and time again foreign Demons of depression it's time that they start losing Demons of suicide it's time that they start losing Demons of pornography it's time that they start losing Demons of of unsettledness it's time that they start losing Demons of anxiety it's time that they start losing Demons of cancer it's time that they start losing Demons of depression Demons of anxiety Demons of fear demons are paralysis [Applause] thank you baby but you've got to come to a point in your life when you're ready to address the devil in your life you've got to come to a spot in your life as a son and daughter of God where you address the enemy that keeps attacking you you know if he keeps attacking you over certain things that happened 20 years ago you know he ain't nothing but a liar but if the devil keeps whispering in your ear week after week well you know you know you shouldn't be going to church because you've been out there smoking and all those things it's something that you need to address but if the devil's been lying to you and telling you that you're not going to make it and you're never going to be good enough I want you to rise up and the faith of almighty God and Stamp Out every death there's going to be somebody that rises in this generation that walks out there and takes the very power away from Satan now notice I think it's a very powerful spot that brother Branham drops this in the in broken sisters 1965. he said it takes an atmosphere to do things he said that's the reason that you men are always taught bring your children here well certainly that's right he said he said I was glad to see my daughter Rebecca come in sit down just a few minutes ago he said some of you seen me weak at a woman he said it was my daughter he said so she came in and sat down he said I want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and he said that's why she's here in the meeting that's what the purpose of it is for it takes an atmosphere now I think if William Branham could could call a meeting and he could say I want to get my daughter in that kind of a meeting I think that we ought to do everything under this Malachi 4 Ministry to get our children in that type of atmosphere brother randomly he would quote die he would quote on Dr Bosworth he would tell her he would say now he said you know he said you can lay a hand egg underneath old pup and he said it'll hatch he said because it simply takes an atmosphere now I know some of you I know some of you came out of denominationalism and it doesn't make you it doesn't make you a part of that denominationalism but do you recognize that it takes an atmosphere to create a birth now know of people that gave their heart to the Lord of watching a little house on a prairie I know I know a man that gave his heart out there on the streets of Victoria when there were people walking around that were drunk on natural wine but there was somebody up there that got stimulated by the Holy Ghost so you see it doesn't necessarily matter where exactly it is church is the greatest place for it to happen at but you can have this kind of atmosphere in your home [Applause] is that right now the Bible said in Deuteronomy 4 and 29 but if if from thence Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God and thou shall find him if thou seek him with all the heart and with all thy Soul we we recognize that that there is something on the inside of a human being that makes him long for more of God that's why you're sitting here tonight is because something is on the inside of you and it's making you hunger for almighty God is that right you see and there is always going to be a time that God has a word that is going to be fulfilled in a generation and when he's got a word that's going to be fulfilled there's going to be a people that is ready to receive it just like when it came time for the deliverer to come to Israel when Israel had got so under the condition of the taxing of all the task Masters down there in Egypt there was a call that came across the Israelites Hearts to go to praying for the deliverer you see God had to get them in the atmosphere to call for deliver y now you read the reason why they were calling for a deliverer is because God had already showed his prophet Abraham that God was going to bring them into a Strange Land so God lays out his map of how things are going to be throughout the scripture and God has got people that are looking all the way back when Abraham and Joseph had begin to pray what were they looking at they were looking at prophecy over 400 years ago now what was it it was amram and Joseph had that got under a hunger for the deliverer and they got up there brother random said they got up there and they begin to pray until the word of God began to be fulfilled and you know the story that the angel came and met amram because he went up there to pray what was it it was a hunger on the inside of Abraham and Josephine they were hungering for the move of God now you've been sitting here and you've watched as there are mothers that are sitting here that have said here maybe five years but now their son sitting beside them there's all kinds of cases that are all throughout this building it was because a mother or a father begin to pray that God would deliver their children out of the bondage that they were in what was it it was a hunger that was on their heart to see the move of God in their life and that's exactly what Abraham and Joseph did had got up there under the inspiration of Abraham and they got up there and began to pray Hallelujah they begin to pray and it's usually those that go to praying is the one who's got the burden and they're the one that get to see the thing done hungry hungry just give me just a second here beat every day of your life discomforted every single day working under the slave master's hand I would say that it would create a hunger in your life I know I know I know I know that everybody hadn't went out and seen and done by awful Deeds but anybody that ever smoked cigarettes knows that that's a real devil and there are some people that can go can go and they get under the inspiration of the message or by the preaching of the word and you watch them and they're automatically they come and they've been a smoker a chain smoker for all of those years and all of a sudden in his presence they drop it and never go back to it and there's some people that fight it all their days you see it's God that calleth and to him that willeth and to him that runeth God is the one that shows the mercy now you watch you watch there there are things that you know that you faced in your in the demons in your life that are constantly there it causes a hunger on the inside of you for freedom is that right each and every one of you face little bitty stigmas or complexes yeah maybe living under the shadow of somebody greater than you and it makes you have maybe a complex or or maybe just a just maybe you you begin to think things in your mind and Satan starts telling you you'll get hungry like amram and Joseph begin to get hungry for to deliver to come by their way you see you can sit here and you can watch all of the children of God get so under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost but something's got to move on your life there are people that say well let's just let them do their thing and when they get done we'll walk out with them and we'll make will make them think that we're a part of them you've got to get a hunger on the inside of your soul not an emotion not a wire cup not just something that you feel but something that is a true Pentecostal experience now watch what brother Branham does when he he's here speaking with some patients he said he said now and the message do you believe he said you also suffer with the same you have been to some doctors you've given the examination and that examination he tells you that you must have an operation and the operation the entire female section must be taken out but do you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well you've been thirsting for God you've been hungering for a closer walk it has been just a day or two ago to you are praying for this thing he said I'm not reading your mind that's the truth you believe that right now that the spirit that's on you that's on me and on you has healed you of this female trouble you accept it right now with all your heart will you seek God till he pours out the Holy Spirit upon you if he will heal you or without or heal you without your operation will you do it almighty God I bless this woman in the name of Jesus Christ and curse this disease and come out of her in Jesus Christ's name amen go rejoice and sister God bless you yes what was it she was in the atmosphere of the supernatural but something on the inside of her was great Hallelujah you may have walked into a line with a certain disease but the prophet of almighty God saw something that was laying there that was greater than the disease that shaped Hallelujah that Satan could put on your life and you thought that you walked in here and you were battling depression but it's Satan trying to cover up the hunger come on somebody help me preach tonight if God has called you here there ain't one disease there ain't one devil that can hide he said now another place he said well you look why what are you looking so earnestly this way for sir do you believe me to be his Prophet you do all right if you believe me to be his Prophet you're sitting there earnestly seeking for God you're hungering for God you are nervous upset and you have a stomach trouble and things has bothered you because you're nervous but one of the main things that you're looking for is you're trying to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if it is raise up your hand then in the name of Jesus Christ receive the spirit go receive the Holy Ghost you had a tumor didn't you all right it's left you while you were standing here go in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and be made well you see you were formed and fashioned to be an image of almighty God but Satan can attach himself through the blood cell of your body and die begin to tap in and cause all kinds of Bruce cells or different things in your life but in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost [Music] I want to tell you and I want to make you aware that you are in the atmosphere to receive your healing you are in the atmosphere to drive depression out of your life and let peace that passes all understanding flow over you [Music] you have battled and battled and battled men have provoked you men have criticized you but you are in an atmosphere to receive healing you see the atmosphere has got to be ready now I know that I know you're very aware that when brother Ron went through the went through the fire the brother biscal called him even though he was at his worst state that brother bisco called him and said or called Mom and said he's going to be the next year speaker is that right you know the story he's going to we bought Mount Baker camp and he's going to be the speaker next year now let me say this just to grab you just to draw draw your attention in this way brother biscoll could have never said that five years or it never would have been related to brother Ron or sister Connie until the accident happened you see the atmosphere was ready for the supernatural when brother Ron went through the fire and when brother Ron was laying there in his condition when he was laying there for 17 days he'd been laying there 36 hours brain dead and it looked like all hope was gone what was it for it was time for the atmosphere the atmosphere was ready God knew what was going to happen so God allowed a man two thousand three thousand miles away when the atmosphere was ready to cause the children of God to believe he called him when a Ministry would have been at stake if brother Ron died but the atmosphere was ready for sister Connie and this church to receive a promise you might be sitting here and you might be perfectly well in your body and you can look over Isaiah 53 and you think well I don't need that right now but they're Hallelujah Serge of the Holy Ghost that is moving in here and you might be perfectly well but the Holy Ghost has looked all the way into your future and five years from now you might be sick as all by as anybody could ever be but Isaiah 53 is laying there for you whether you need it right now or whether you don't Isaiah 53 is in effect for you but when you get in your case when you get in a worse condition now I know I'm preaching above some young people right now because they feel invincible and they think that they'll never go through a crisis but when your back is hurting and you've got pain reaming throughout your body you need Isaiah 53. but when you get in the condition the condition has got to be ready for you to receive it so God is going to bring you through something to bring you to something that is greater than you can believe you've been battling to get here you've been battling just to be in the service but I want to tell you that the battle is worth the victory you've been through all hell but the conditions are right for you to receive heaven now notice that Jesus said when he was speaking to Nicodemus he said he said merely a man except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and in verse 5 he said except the man be born again of water and the spirit it cannot enter in to the kingdom of God so one cannot understand or enter into the Holy Ghost until a new birth takes place I don't know it's a paradox but it's very true tonight it's regular it's very old hair I'm very aware that there are children here tonight that are sitting here that are on the edge of a birth foreign I know you can't see it and I know you may not understand what I'm saying but there are children that are here there are people that are sitting here under the sound of my voice that Satan has been warring with but God has got them in a condition God has allowed them to go through some stuff to get them into a condition to believe that it ain't just for the pastor it ain't just for the Deacon but it's for me [Applause] if it was good enough for William Brown's Rebecca it's good enough for you Rebecca hallelujah it's good enough for every one of your little Rebecca's here tonight the Holy Ghost doesn't care what your last name is the Holy Ghost don't care what you've been through but he's brought you to this condition so that you can receive the supernatural seed you can't even understand the mind of God you can't even enter into the mind of God until the new birth one might say and can't understand the power of peace without the new birth one can't even understand Miracles without the new birth men will say that it's for days gone by without the new birth but if you're born of almighty God and if God is your father you're born into the family of God and you seek those things that pertain to God that's right there there you are your God shout your nature is God's nature then when somehow you hear them all say oh oh our church believes that the days of Miracles has passed how could you believe that the days of Miracles has passed when the very nature of God is in you when he is all together a miracle his nature is Miracle his habits are Miracle his whole being is Miracle how can you be anything else but a miracle foreign again you're a miracle you can't be nothing else when you have the worst day in your life when you're throwing up your guts you're a miracle when you can't see straight you're a miracle when your wife's mad at you you're a miracle when your boss is upset at you you're a miracle the very nature of almighty God is laying on the inside of you oh it's a paradox that God would want to dwell on somebody by the name of Jonathan Damron it's amazing it's a paradox that God would so love you that he gave himself now God ain't going to ask you to do something he's not willing to do himself he's not pressing you to believe him when he didn't have to believe his own word he had to he's not asking you to go out and have some kind of super Faith he's just wanting you to grab the little hyssop the little common faith and he's wanting you to take that little common faith and create and create such an atmosphere that the little children here or the oldest or the sickest person here because of your little faith God don't need your super duper faith God is already placed on the inside of you the gene seed of almighty God you are a word being you are a gene seed of almighty God I came from God I'm going back to God you recognize that you are here to manifest the very creation of almighty God [Applause] foreign was laying on the inside of Rahab when all the walls were stacked up against her when she's hosting this Lodge and she's inviting everybody in men that would ravish her men that would come in sneak in in the midday sneaking at midnight she's working in this place of lodging as a host as an Innkeeper but she's got a dual purpose and she's went through deep scars to be here but God didn't place you on the outside of the wall for no reason God didn't place you on the outside of the wall for no reason I want you to hear me God didn't place you where you are for no reason foreign you see because I want you to know that Rahab had something down on the inside of her that caused her what was she doing she was packing prophecy brother Chris can I go just a little bit deeper and so that you adults understand when she was taken by men she was packing prophecy when nobody thought that she would be in the picture she was packing prophecy when she was lodging all of these all of these events that had transpired in her life she was packing prophecy it may not look like it but Boaz is going to come forth it may not look like what you're looking at but God has got a condition ready for you to receive for you to receive your goal for you to receive the Redeemer I want you to know that where you are is not where God is going to leave you at because there is coming a message that's caused a shout in this camp that when the children of God when they are going around in the real reward is circling the camp that Rahab is getting ready to get out let me say when the messengers came by her way she lied for them she lied white lie black lie little red lie she lied but the prophecy that was on the inside of her was greater than all of her mistakes let me tell you when Jesus is setting in Simon's house and this woman is washing his feet let me tell you she was in the atmosphere to receive a blessing that no man could pour out upon her but she would be remembered throughout all of the history of the Bible that this woman was more righteous than Simon let me say this girl let me go a little bit further the denominations wouldn't wash his feet but there's a bride in this hour that has risen to receive him and because you've received him he's received you unto himself Rahab let me talk to you when all the walls are falling around you just get ready you're getting ready to walk out on the ashes you're going to walk out on the ashes [Applause] you imagine when all your friends are dying around you and the walls are crawl are crushed underneath of you but you just start walking out on the ashes you saw riding out on the walls of Jericho when the sin that once held you bound you start walking out on it when the demons that you had to address in your life when every Devon hell said you wouldn't make it they said you never produced it you start walking out on the ashes come on devil you know you ain't got enough to hold her you know you ain't got enough to hold him so back your dirty hands off of God's Property we are in the atmosphere the conditions are right the anointing is here the power is here let them loose let them loose let them loose let them loose Satan I charge you by the name of Jesus Christ take your hands off of God's Property [Applause] [Applause] I can point you to where he was I can point you to the tomb where he laid I can point you to where he moved in the past but our children don't need to pass God come on somebody last weekend was powerful but what you need is in this room I can point you back to the Luther h i can point you back to where he went up there and he nailed the 95 pieces on a on a Roman wall I can punch you up there but the mechanics of Luther will never work I can point you back to where Wesley was a man of God and he prayed and his horse got sick he prayed for his horse he got back on his horse and he rode it back then he began to preach all the way back in them Hills but the mechanics of Wesley will not work I can point you back to California I can point you back to Azusa Street I can tell you about the Miracles that they had back there how did a blind man would appear and begin to call on the name of the Lord and there was a restoration of gifts but the mechanics of that will never get you out of laodicea but what we need is the Dynamics of the message of the hour to roll over our soul and charge us and challenge us to believe and take us out of this whole world foreign and when they come looking for the Welsh Revival they were looking for where it was at you remember when they went over there they went over there we were looking for a layer of the wealth survival was at where's it at and there was a little policeman out there policeman out there throwing his whistle around twirling I said man can you point us to the wealth's Revival he said you're looking at it where's the bride's Revival at Point at your neighbor said you're looking at it what William Bradham was looking for you have arrived what every devil has been scared of you are here you're not just a bunch of weaklings you're not a bunch of school girls you're not a people that don't know who you are you know exactly who you are and the sons of God are going to walk out and take the very power do you believe him okay when a doctor brings in bad news do you trust him when you're having struggles do you believe him you see the message will put you in a position to receive you see a few weeks ago was my little daughter Ally's birthday turn eight years old man you talking about a kid she's all kid she's being a female body I'm glad she took after the looks of her mama but let me tell you she was excited for her birthday before her birthday ever rode around she was excited two weeks after her birthday she had gifts coming in from her Grandpa and her Grandpa I can't call them that Bella they were coming in from different places and she was under great anticipation for these gifts to come in and man let me tell you when she got them she was the most elated person and she wanted to share with him with you she wanted to play with you she wanted you to see it but what caused that anticipation I did she'd have never known it was her birthday unless I told her unless her mama would have said on this day on January the 7th it's going to be your birthday and when she found out it was her birthday you know as a child sometimes you just don't understand the calendar what day is it oh it's Saturday we got to go to church that's that day some people just still don't understand that I told you not to go there oh sorry sorry I just slipped out but the reason why she was so elated about her birthday was because somebody told it it was her birthday the reason why you're so elated that there's going to be a Rapture is because somebody told you about it and if nobody would have told you about it you'd have never been excited about it but because Malachi 4 lined up with what Paul said all the way back there in the book of Thessalonians it's caused an excitement on the inside of you let me tell you it's about to be all of our birthdays where we change from this Mortal to that immortality and there ain't one devil that can stop our Elation there ain't one person that can stop us from getting happen there ain't one devil that can stop us from getting excited you forgive me if I act like this all the time but I'm happy I'm excited something's about to change something's about to move over my body the atmosphere is here for it the Supernatural is here but God put something on the inside of your brother Timmy to hunger for it to see the pillar of fire working in your family not just a roll over your wife and yourselves family over yourselves but to watch it roll over your children what good is this if we don't want to share it with somebody else he had better been under great anticipation foreign and it never comes you can imagine Ali as excited she was I tell her you're never going to have another one you're never going to don't be excited about it no more your things are not it's not true baby you imagine you can sit there and act like you don't get excited about your birthday but as for me in my house I'm trying to get you good and relaxed real quick here is it working all right you imagine for the anticipation that it never comes you can imagine Sarah waiting every 28 days and it don't show up and she goes all the way through menopause and it don't show up and she hears the crowd mocking her mocking her husband mocking her it'll never happen this is what happened when Hannah is going through her greatest of Trials panaya the Scriptures foretail it doesn't tell us every everyone that she had but when elkana begins to talk to her he said am I not greater to you than ten Sons can you imagine that panaya is carrying these these children she's carrying them she's watching them but she like Leah like Leah and her sister there was a love hate because it looked like God had shut up her home things aren't happening for you it looks like the supernatural isn't visiting your home and it looks like it's on it's looking like it's on this brother and it looks like it's on this sister but when is it coming to my house I've been hungering for it too you don't know what it's like going up to the sacrifice going up there to the Feast of sacrifice and panaya is in my ear the whole time saying you can't have the Holy Ghost you can't speak in tongues you can't have the Holy Ghost you can't have a move of God in your life you'll never produce a Rapture you'll never be able to live up to message status you'll never be able to listen to William Branham and get past all of your circumstances of life you don't know what it's like to listen to panea's voice in your ear year after year foreign listening to panaya speak to you in this manner mocking you as Elkin shows you his love the Bible said that he gave her a worthy portion but she wanted something greater than what man could give her let me say this she didn't want what elkanah could give her she wanted what God could give her I don't want what the Creeds can give us I don't want what the deeds and the actions of of men of days gone by can give us I want what God can give us [Applause] you're never going to get over your barrenness you're never going to get over it let me tell you every time you go to Shiloh it's a reminder that you can never take into the Feast of sacrifice because when you go to studying out the Book of Numbers I believe in chapter 26 that you could not come before him at the Feast of sacrifice in mourning and every single time Hannah came before the Lord at Shiloh she did not even eat her countenance was said because she wanted this one thing you ever wanted something so bad you can't hardly eat that you go through the agonies of pain because you just can't find that inner peace and your husband and shower you with all kinds of blessings but yet you want that one thing and another cycle comes and another cycle comes empanadas in your ear you'll not receive it Esther you will not receive it Hannah you're not going to receive that you're not going to you're not going to be able to produce that don't worry this ain't up to you God has brought you to this condition to receive d and what God has joined together let no man put us under what's God been doing in this service he's been bringing you word on top of words Sail on top of sale Creator in an atmosphere for you to believe and Hannah was brought into a condition that when she got up there and she heard all of these things that she got before the altar of the Lord now she couldn't partake like everybody else does at the Feast of sacrifice because she couldn't even eat because the pain on the inside of her was showing on the outside and panaya was happy at her Agony banaya was enthused that she was creating such a misery she had taunted her with her language so much foreign this is going to be your last time let this be your last time you mocked me let us be the last service you deal with depression let this be the last service that you deal with a battle of anxiety that you're never going to be good enough that you're battling all of these scars in your family panaya this is your last service talk to me no more whisper in my ear no more I'm going before the Lord I'm gonna have a talk with almighty God panaya can't produce this how can I can produce this but I'm going to somebody bigger you can run out of gas you can run out of food you can run out of energy you can run out of money but God says I'm bigger than all your problems I'm bigger than your situations when you run out I never fail when you give up I keep going [Applause] oh Hannah do you hear me talking to you do you hear me talking to you Hannah you are getting ready to bring forth and it's not going to be by your own Deeds watch a Believer is one who acts on the word of God and God never tells us to do something that we cannot do Faith is doing what God tells us to do then expecting God to do what he tells us he will do Noah built the ark and God flooded the Earth Moses stretched out the rod and God parted the Seas Joshua marched around the walls of Jericho and God pushed them down Elijah smote the waters and God parted them Elisha threw the stick in the river and God made the iron to swim Naaman dip seven times and God healed the leprosy Jesus said it is the believer who may lay hands on the sick and it is God who will make them well James said that the Believers May anoint any sick with oil and pray the prayer of faith on their behalf he said it is the Lord who shall raise up the sick God says you do a small thing and I'll do a large thing you do a foolish thing and I'll do a wise thing you do something that only a human being can do and I will do something that only I can do [Applause] you don't understand what you're doing to me panaya you're causing me to get in such an Agony you're causing me to get in such a place that I'm going to produce a prophet be careful Satan be careful she knows what he once done with the word Rahab knew what he wanted done with the word is that right she had the token all of those days she had those courts stacked up there and thought why am I just stacking these things around you had them tapes and those books setting in your closet for it seems like six years now it's time that you break out the token I ain't claiming that the tape is a token but I'm telling you that there is rapturing Faith on the inside of this message and if you can let down what's on the inside of your closet come on full obedience entitles you to the token I want you to do me a favor after the service I ain't got time to read it to you it's too long but go read Isaiah 54. so sing Old Baron for thou will break out on the left hand and on the right hand I'm going to enlarge your tense drive down the stake and get ready Satan I want you to listen to me loud and clear you can no longer hold Anna Thomas and Esther Smith bound no more because there is a power and there is an atmosphere I know what you're ready for I know what you're asking for but I want to tell you Satan that you will not hold them no longer the atmosphere is here we're ready to receive it the promise is here is all you want to laugh at us all you want to but we're getting ready to bring forth a Samuel and when Samuel comes forth he's going to anoint David and when he anoints are David he's going to kill a giant and when he kills a giant he's going to anoint the children of Israel they're going to believe it's for them there's an anointing here Hannah get ready Hallelujah get ready said I never produce a son look at Samuel said I never bring forth child mock me all of those years time after time but look at my Samuel that I never had my breakthrough but look at my Samuel never said I'd received the Holy Ghost but look at my Samuel said my prodigals wouldn't come back but look at my Samuel said my family wouldn't be restored but look at my Samuel this ain't for some day going by look at my Samuel I'm not talking to you about days of 1963 and 1965. look at my Samuel let your enemies be scattered because God is rising thank you I know what it's like to be laughed at I know what it's like when men really cool you I know when it's men when men say all kinds of evil about you I know what it's like I was there I was with you when you walked down the road alone and you hung your head and you cried I was with you when you didn't see me I was holding your hand when you didn't feel me I had Angels charged to watch over you when it didn't look like he was ever going to produce God caused you to pray and what's going to happen prayed Joshua bed right and I prayed the shoe to my woman said all is well but I want to say to you that the glory of the latterhouse will be greater than the former the mocking is almost over the scoffing is almost over the Rapture is at hand let them laugh but when Los Angeles Falls beneath the Earth you'll be the one sitting there saying I'm secure in his arms Marcus said say what you want to but when Russia bombs you we will be here the atmosphere to receive a body change is in this room mock us all you want to but we really believe the sign the waters are running clear for you little bride your future is clear your destiny is secure you're going to make it [Applause]
