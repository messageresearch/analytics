morning by God's grace let's go to 2nd Peter 1 verse 6 we'd like to continue this little series on the mystery of godliness restored to man so we want to continue on that and we'll look a little more temperance this morning we looked at temperance on Wednesday night and it'll look a little bit further at it today by God's grace also to our memory verse as well so 2nd Peter 1:6 and just say no brothers up with all the dads I got a little gift for you after service ok so don't leave without seeing me of course I'd like to shake your hands but I got a little gift for you I got you all roses ok I'm just kidding just now I got some gifts for you you know for Mother's Day we always tried you some nice and so I got some so I got some some beef jerky for your brothers after sir that's actually what I got you so don't don't forget to see any brothers and even the brothers that aren't Father's yet the adults I want to give you one too because when we have Mother's Day we gave all the sisters a chocolate bar so well by God's grace so hope you brothers like beef jerky you like it believe it hang you like it alright I just want to say thanks you know I appreciate everybody's support you know we God has been so good to our church you know especially during this time he's protect protected us from the kovat plague might call it or whatever you want to call it pestilence is what Jesus called it and everybody's support throughout this has been fantastic thank you I'm brother even brother Stephen was around somebody who had a fever and we they weren't sure if he had kovat but i asked even to stay home a couple weeks and he did so thank you brother we just want to use wisdom we want to just want to use wisdom yeah we just want to keep everybody healthy and so I want to thank everybody for all your support praise God so let's look at 2nd Peter 1 verse 6 we'll read that then we'll read our memory verse in verse estonians 5:14 so let's read verse 6 together 1 2 3 and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness praise God for the first Thessalonians 5:14 this is our monthly memory verses verses 14 to 23 beautiful beautiful portion of the scripture I was reading yesterday about you know some historical things and and some people believe this was the first letter Paul ever wrote some people believe it was the earliest letter I believe around ad 51 and if that's true that'd be awesome because he writes about the rapture in this letter praise God so verse 14 down to 23 let's begin on three one two three now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying --zz prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I break your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ let's just have one more word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it on unto God by raising of your hand or in your heart just say a little prayer Heavenly Father we love you or gathered here not to be seen or heard Lord of men but we're here to hear from heaven and to make our requests made known to heaven dear God and we want your spirit to have free course today Lord God let your will be done we don't want to quench the Holy Spirit we want the Holy Spirit to flow so lord help us to Lord God to do that to yield to surrender and father to let thy will be done bless your people especially the fathers and the mothers and the families Lord each one of us Lord and and minister to each and every soul we pray on this special day in Jesus Christ's name sure said amen god bless you didn't see the praise God so I'm just gonna have one little slide up here Acacia so if you can switch over just a moment here just want to give a visual again we're all familiar of course with a statue of a perfect man we only have one appreciation sister Wendy she printed out that this week and we're willing we'll hang it up this week by God's grace the statue of a perfect man praise God we appreciate that let's give her a round Bob thank you sister [Applause] as we preached on recently you know the last few years I like how it's his faith it's his virtue it's Jesus's knowledge it's a portion of his anointing and so we all know that we're all familiar with that but as the revelation continues to unfold we know there has to be a full understanding so as Mother Branham preached the revelation that the Holy Spirit gave him we saw that faith as justification and then you work your way up to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost when love comes down and then once you're born again now you have the the armor of God but the RAM said Peter had to go up to the day of Pentecost to put on the armor of God and then you start manifesting the fruit of the spear after you you're born again and you daily feast on the Word of God and daily repent and live such a godly life you start manifesting the fruits it's also called your adoption because a son has the seed of the father right the placing in your position so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is so crucial but it's not the end it's just the beginning praise God the beginning of a life of adoption praise God we know the final adoption though takes place when you get a new body because that's what Paul says to it the adoption he said the redemption of your body so once you're born again you start growing into adoption God God trusts you a little more with more of the word amen that's how it should be my God's grace we should be seeing more of God's Spirit flow through our lives and that's exactly what Christianity is all about more and more submission to the Holy Spirit now today by God's grace we want to just briefly review what we looked at on Wednesday the fourth anointing of the Holy Spirit you get is temperance so first God gives you faith where you believe you become a Christian you get saved baptized in water then he gives you virtue which is like what Ruth had strength virtue strength to live it publicly Jesus told him right away said if you believe the biggest war is gonna be against those in your household right I'm gonna be said I'm gonna set father against mother right daughter against son-in-law or daughter mother-in-law father-in-law he said your your enemies will be those of your households you need virtue to love them praise God and stand for Christ and then of course live it on the job as well then he gives you knowledge to understand to turn on the lights about why about why we walk this way gives you the why knowledge is the why the deep understanding it's the key right to understand the Christian walk praise God and then now gives you temperance and temperance is according to the Greek its self-control it's the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites so we all know that we have two appetites we have unholy appetites I should say three we have unholy appetites right we have physical appetites and then we have spiritual appetite so we have at least three appetites and we must feed the good ones praise God and then crucify the lust of the flesh praise God you must crucify that one the sinful desire in our minds and of course in our flesh as well sin is in our members so this is an anointing so see Church you and I you know we need the anointing of the holy spirit and it's the anointing that breaks the yokes I say that plainly says that he says you know when we are addicted to sensual pleasures whether it's as we looked at you know drunkenness or cigarettes or you know sexual addictions eating overeating pride well you know political positioning whatever whatever temptation it is those must be crucified it's a it's a yoke right it's an addiction but when the believer who is addicted when even though his house you know it's full of demons we'd say is - may have demons that have robbed his his victory once he confesses that he says I'm sorry Lord forgive me I want to be free from these addictions once he admits that then the Holy Spirit can come in to his house praise God and command all those squatters to leave he's got rebuked all those spirits caused them to leave the mine praise God and then then take we'd say dwelling praise God and then let the anointing is of God bring these back so let's just use cigarettes because that's one thing I battled for when I first became a Christian you know I was still I was trying to serve God but I had a cigarette addiction and chewing tobacco addiction and so I had tried many times to quit over the course of years I even told my wife before we got married I said I don't know if I'll ever be able to quit chewing tobacco such a it was such a demonic hold in my life but I kept praying kept believing and I just kept confessing I'm I'm wrong I know it's wrong it's evil it's dirty it's gonna cause me mouth cancer someday I know it's awful and then uh well then one Sunday after I threw out a pack of cigarettes or a can of two I can't remember which one it was I went to church and it must have happened at that church service but I I confess and I got such an anointing that this is my testimony you believe it or not two weeks later or two Sundays later my mind just kind of opened up and said wow I haven't smoked or had any chewing tobacco for two weeks and I knew right there I was always going to be free from that moment and so see when I could infect that last time all those demons were exposed and I must have went to church and worship God or something something but some power came in to me praise God a greater power set up being yoked hosts the addiction the demons of addiction I became yoke to Christ amen and his anointing came in and has now given me temperance that has lasted almost twenty years I think it's about 17 or 18 years since I've had any tobacco product and so that's just one simple example that's just one small example of how we have we have sensual physical appetites but they must be confessed they must be daily crucified because I every to this day I still walk in Walmart and Target and my flesh wants to buy it I've never had a day where my flesh didn't want it right but it must be crucified every day praise God in my mind I know I'll never go back praise God but Johnny Satan even gives me dreams multiple times a year Bella Johnny oh and in my dream I'll be chewing tobacco like how did I go back to this I'll be smoking like how in the world did I fall back to this and I'll wake up and my mouth will feel like I've had chew it too in there I don't know it's so often so strange don't know how to describe it but when I wake up I say praise God I did not bow to that demon Amy so see Satan is constantly try to work and he you see what he tried to be trying to get our anointing he's trying to come into his house I'm sorry he's coming he's trying to come into our house and our minds and get us to compromise and think about those things he's trying to take our minds captive but the Bible said we don't let Satan take us captive we cast down anything and exalts itself against the learn of God we don't let the devil's come in right we don't let them come into our house we cast them down out of our minds and that's just one small example with with temperance that I know for sure worked in my life absolutely undoubtedly work in my life let alone many other things that the Lord had to deliver me from so when you get the anointing of temperance you're no longer serving your five senses all the time you start living and serving your sixth sense faith praise God you start that that gets more attention than your five senses okay and on Wednesday we looked at the three channels of every temptation the lust of the flesh the lusts the eyes and the pride of life and we saw the lust of the flesh you'll battle drunkenness in Scripture overeating sexual sins and drugs just drug use because that's called witchcraft in the Bible they use drugs everything they've always used drugs centers have always used ropes down through the years but that's witchcraft a lust of the eyes would be sexual attraction property material possessions and financial prospects the pride of life is reputation is what you'll battle to try to build your own reputation greatness arguing the cycles argued who is greater strife which is electioneering for people's positions that are not your own and then murder would be a of pride as well because Cain killed Abel because he was jealous of him pride of life but and then we close wednesday by showing how Eve and Jesus were tempted in all three by the devil right lust of the eyes and Eve fell to all three but Christ overcame all three by simply obeying and loving righteousness amen the Bible said he loved righteousness and he hated iniquity amen that's it that's all we need to overcome any of Satan's temptations is to hate the sin and love the obedience and that is the full power that that can be the full power of the Holy Spirit manifests in our lives so many times we just want to see like the dead raised which is great but there's also power in overcoming everyday temptations praise God Jesus proved it right there he was he was tempted by Satan he was full of the Holy Ghost and all powered heaven earth was available to him but he proved the best way to overcome is to love obedience to love the Word of God and hate iniquity he proven it can be done any believer the weakest Christian can overcome Satan anytime anyplace anywhere by simply loving a righteousness and hating iniquity praise God in any church you'll go to any special meeting you'll go to any place you'll go that is the theme of every special meeting right just quoting the word put the word in your mouth let the word be the sword let the word be your scepter right that's a--that's a theme of everyone is getting the people of God away from beating the lust of their flesh and living and feeding the sixth sense the word of God and it'll be it's the theme of everyone so see it doesn't matter which which places you go to now let me say this or something wrong with going to special meetings but see if you can live it in your daily life if you're not getting the victory in your daily life then an occasional deliverance isn't gonna have you need the anointing to help you everyday praise God amen so you don't backslide into those things right that is the power of temperance because it gives you an anointing go this morning amen it gives you a power where your spiritual man his desires are greater than the natural man praise God amen it's so true and so I would look at a few things here before we get to what I want to close with now temperance you see is this word about self-control now I want to give a couple of examples it's a very it's not a word used very much in Scripture it's a rarely used word so let's look at the first time it's used in the New Testament acts 24 24 Paul is a prisoner of the Lord everybody thought he was a prisoner of Rome he was but really he's a prisoner of Christ right because he knew Jesus when you have to suffer many things for Christ's sake and part of that was imprisonment and so here he comes before Felix and his wife Drusilla and she was a Jew she knew what the word said and that awesome Paul wants to witness right he said remember in Philippians he got the witness to everybody in the whole jail even and everyone in the palace knew he was a message believer glory and here as he's here before Felix is great ruler and Drusilla they send for Paul and they want to hear about his his belief in the Messiah see that's why she won here she's a Jew she knew they're looking for a messiah well let's hear this Holy Roller let's see what he's got to say about the Messiah now let me before I get to this scripture go to I'm sorry I'm gonna read out of this lexicon about Felix Felix means happy so here's a happy sinner he's a role in pure curator of Judaea appointed by emperor claudius in 53 ad he ruled the province in a mean cruel manner his spirit office was full of troubles and submissions and this is when Paul is brought before him at Caesarea and he remained in prison and kept two more years in hopes of extorting money from him he badges Philip would keep a prisoner hoping somebody would give him money for this prisoner that was his whole motivation not justice but money isn't that our political system today right it's both sides Church it just ain't Democrats it's Republicans do right every four years the Republicans will say semi money we're against abortion and they never end it with me how come they don't do they got enough votes why they do it see it's cuz they're all about money many of them they just want the money oh my thank God I'm not a Republican or a Democrat I'm a Holy Ghost field safe praise God now I'd normally vote Republican but what good I'm sorry what good have they done we got we go there are voices we got to pray for that first and then make our voices heard that's right now he says this now let's read our scripture here so you can see this man was the husband of Drusilla she was a daughter of Herod Agrippa who was the third wife my his third wife whom he persuaded to leave her husband and marry him me see these guys were adulterers these guys and gals the Gauss - they didn't have temperance ladies God they just married one I'll marry another I'll bear and I'll put this one away I'll get another and a real man of God will tell them the truth of God's Word look at verse 24 after certain days with Felix came with wife Drusilla which was a Jewess he sent for Paul and hurt him concerning the faith in Christ I love this I was I loved when brother Johnny or amen will tell me they just got a chance to witness the message isn't that one the best feelings you can do is just witnesses somebody about Jesus Christ oh it's one of the great greatest feelings Church to share and testify of the God you know and like the Bible says God opens the door of utterance for you amen they want to hear about faith in Christ and of course there are adulterers now look at verse 25 and as he reasoned of righteousness so he knows there adulterers he knows his man's a dirty murderer he's cruel he knows he's a money-grubber writer oh that's right where he's just like money he wasn't fair he's a very unfair man he starts reasoning here of righteousness which means to dispute or argue now of course we know Laurentiis christians don't argue so he was reasoning with a calm voice we'd say he was just giving reasons why listen you need to live righteously because of these reasons it's the right thing to do in other words your life is going to be judged by Jesus Christ according to my gospel at the Judgment praise God he was trying to reason with them you need to live righteously and what else did he reason about temperance he was trying to argue with him and give him reasons you need to be more temperate and self-control and not what a fourth wife and actually get rid of your third and second to you can't you get back your first so let live single right when I get to that point just live single if you really got a heart for God that's right so he's giving him reasons how to control his sensual appetites and we know Herod memmer Herod a first birthday they had big birthday parties right and then he had his stepdaughter dance that sensual dance see and if that was Herod Agrippa what about these men you know it was an awful time period they probably had all more awful things and with them no doubt they didn't do what the Bible says they did we preached on that not long ago about Ephesus and how it was just it was just wherever the Roman government was it was rampant with sin I'll tell you about anything these guys stuck out like a sore thumb these Holy Ghost filled women these Holy Ghost filled men they stuck out like a sore thumb because they actually loved their lives and they were true to one wife praise God and they actually love their children amen didn't beat their wives they didn't beat their children they and they respected the slaves you know kiss Lavery was still around that time even God's ended up in the Jewish religion when they respected them as equals right as equal under God praise God they they were so different and people look at our lives they should see the same today we're a different people are something about us we're just so different because we have the love of Jesus Christ our lives are so different and so he really tries to give him all these arguments you need to be temperate and look at this and judgment to come if you don't repent you're gonna be judged Felix Felix tremble I like that look at that oh he must have might under a powerful anointing to argue the Word of God you're gonna face my Lord Jesus one day if you don't repent of this adultery you don't repent of this extortion that's money laundering laundering if you don't repent of that you're gonna face my Jesus and you're gonna be guilty and so he starts trembling now what a what a what a difference today you tell people about Jesus they laugh it off they get they fill up their car with gasoline drive away don't even think about what a difference see but they travel and don't forget Church you and I should tremble too because the Bible says work out your salvation with fear and trembling amen there should be times not every service of course when there's to be seasons where we come to church and we're just trembling and we just want to make sure everything's right we want to make sure we're anointed with all of these are known we don't want one missin if one's missing brother amen we get nervous listen even if I don't see this I don't have this anointing on me Oh God I need it send the Oh Lord send the power just now praise God see we don't want to be weak we don't want to be taken captive we want to be overcomers amen we want to be strong in the faith hallelujah so we search out our salvation with fear and trembling many times before service when I'm praying here I'll just tread water the power of God knowing I've got to answer to Jesus Christ for what I preached that day but also I don't want to fall short of the glory of God and I want to live what I'm preaching praise God because I have to answer and I want to be right with God I want to make my calling and election sure Oh everybody to know which side I'm on praise God so he trembles in the answers that go that way for this time for when I have a convenient season I will call for thee and the numbers 26 he don't also that money should have been given him appalled that he might loose him wherefore he sent him for the oftener and commune with him my his only motivation see his wife wanted to hear the word this this new revelation this new message but he's trembling realizing he's under the conviction of the Holy Spirit but he said I'll just keep her around to try to get some money see how people can be so look how close he was to salvation all right he was right he could have been saved right there there was trouble he was at a valley of decision but he turns it down and just get out of my presidency we got to hang around Holy Ghost fell Saints Amen when you feel conviction hang around church a little longer praise God if everybody rushes out after service thank God they've got no we got things to do fellowship whatever but if you're trembling and on friends hanging around request more prayer seek God with all your heart trembling in fear is a godly attribute and I say we need it more praise God we don't need it less we need a bar even but you know but you see it less praise God I'm sure Wesley in his church with Johnny used to go to the church there I'm sure I'm sure we see it at all at all churches right we got look at our church as well are we are we trembling in fear for our salvation are we more concerned about other things after church see it has to be a constant examination praise God we got to be constantly examining ourselves and making sure we have this godly temperance that we're supposed to have praise God now the only other time it's used is where we get to at the end the only other time it's used in Scripture is Galatians 5:23 where Paul talks about the fruits of the spirit and we'll get to that at the end by God's grace he lists he lists all the sins that will not inherit the kingdom of God they'll have no rulership in the kingdom of God they will not sit on the throne adulterers murderers drunkards revelers emulators those have variants those with hatred witchcraft they will not inherit the kingdom of God they're not worthy but see when we obey God's Word it makes us worthy amen that's right he said he told the Sardis church he said you are worthy because you walked with me and why praise God your daily walk your daily innocent Christian walk makes you worthy to rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years that's right church he said but the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22 is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith so see faith is you have two you can have two annoying things of faith an anointing when you just get saved but then you have faith that is mature faith that people can look at your lives and you're an experienced Christian now and they see a fruit of it it is evident it is clear they have an assurance ain't no this faith is an assurance faith is a revelation so a mature Christian has the fruit of faith it's so evident it's clear this person's got a revelation they have an assurance that Christ is real praise God it's rare you don't find this very often like we said when we preach it you don't find these fruits burnouts and they're very rare and Jesus said something very rare because there was only four kinds of grounds only one of them produced any freaked one out of four kinds right and so building off of that now when I look at a few more things here I want to deal a little bit with a little more on the flesh here so let's go to Philippians three I'm sorry Philippians four metal roof ins for for now we're not there we're not to chapter four yet in the Philippians were still in chapter one I haven't been on that series lately the last few weeks cuz I've been feeling led to preach on this so Paul is closing the letter he's greeting people he's kind of correcting people here in Chapter four at the end of the letter verse three and I treat the also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life and they're yeah people that labor faithfully for Christ their names in the book of life when were they placed there before the foundation of the world verse four rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice now the next verse is where I want to get to let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand the Lord is at hand means he's near he's you have near access to God his time of coming is imminent it's soon to come to pass so he said let your moderation be known to just the church no let your moderation be known just to your family no to everyone see where I'm going now moderation means fairness mildness gentleness patience and physical moderation a church let me say like this you and I and our church has a our church has a reputation this is why I want to get to churches in Lima all have a reputation all right Mansfield churches have a referee reputation Pennsylvania churches have a reputation so do we everybody has a reputation praise God Paul says you need to be known your reputation should be established upon moderation gentleness and self-control praise God why because the Lord is soon to come right see every nun think about this every church has a reputation I can think right now churches that are known for the plays they put on that's what they're known for our plays okay well yeah they can be okay but is that them should that be the main thing when a church is known for I don't think so that's why I don't do many here they're fine if you want to do one every now and then right how many how many know a church this no more place how many know a church that's known for their youth meetings I know that that can be good especially if they're Holy Ghost meetings praise God oh yeah that's what you want but then there's other churches we know that are known for arguing fighting division church splits worldliness right compromise and the church said see every shirt you have a reputation letting know it or not we have a reputation whether you know it or not and Paul says here your moderation your control is what everyone should know about you hey churches like this everybody else in the world's like a loose cannon they shoot all things with their mouths they'll take in everything in their body they'll wear anything they'll say anything go do anything but you would hire to be known that we can control this devil right we can control these Devils we can rebuke these that way we can control this devil nature in our bodies why because they've got a greater power than the signature we've got divine nature amen praise God a lot of churches are known for their food and fellowships that's okay but is that what we're supposed to be known for you're supposed to be known for your moderation praise God and of course the Holy Ghost and fire like we said you services where the Holy Ghost fall that's great that's awesome so see Church everybody has a reputation and we want our reputation to be moderation we want our reputation to be the Holy Ghost praise God God's pure word a made love of the Brethren right loving your neighbor as remember there's only two thirsts and Satan's right or two directions of the thirst right to the world or to holiness and so it's one or the other praise God and we all see churches that have a reputation of feeding the black dog writer or feeding the worldly lusts and they don't have the temperance they don't have that they don't have that Co weed Saturday they don't have that reputation praise God but we should have it by the grace of the Lord amen let's go to back to proverbs 23 I want to just bring this out again briefly proverbs 23 20 and 21 so let's look at gluttony a little bit more by God's grace cuz I believe this is one of the biggest hindrances upon the American church how many would say amen to that I know lots of churches that have a lot of great feasting but now how many have a any fasting hello I know a lotta they can cook a lot of good things which we like it times we like that sometimes but not all the time if you like that all the time you are certainly lacking this and if you're lacking that I got a lot of concern you're lacking that you don't understand what's going on to you if you're lacking that I doubt you're living it very well there and you might just have that because at least you can come to church you know what I mean so proverbs 23 20 21 let's let's read 19 though 23:19 here that my son of be wise and guide thine heart in the way see got a guided W eyes verse 20 be not among wine-bibber x' among riotous eaters of the flesh he says for the drunkard and the glutton II shall both come to poverty and drowsiness shall close a man with rags okay so I was dealing with this a little bit on Wednesday night I didn't feel like I had finished the thought and I'd like to finish this a little bit more here or deal with it a little bit more Paul says let your moderation be known to all men everyone to know how much control you have if not you have sinned against the Lord amen the Holy Spirit Guides us to this and then he gives us the next one and the next one and the next it's a journey huh me on a journey with the Lord praise God amen yes you're on the journey and so Solomon the wisest man who actually fell to this eventually write drunkenness and women and he places drunkenness and gluttony together which is very fitting and he says it'll bring you to poverty so see because you get lately says there you get lazy when you eat too much you get lazy brother branham got sick because he ate too much I have a quote on that this is from 1965 so now we were just come back from of the east I kind of run myself down a little by overeating and he says why over kindness of all the people down the mountains so he was visiting people down the mountains he's out on a hunting trip visiting and you know how he said he's a guest and you know how people like to be hospitable and he got sick from overeating and what to do it took him down he said so I got sick and I haven't felt good this week so you pray for me so seen he kind of he admits he just ate because the people set the food in front of me ever been guilty that don't worry though people just set something Brody will tell you you need an anointing to say no thank you you'll get it if you ask for church that's right temperance Amen Jesus was 40 days hungry but they met and Satan said turn this stone to bread and he said man does not live by bread alone but by every word ever see the mouth of hey man it don't have to be eaten I understand my brother branham would I probably the same thing but as the more times I went four times in South America each time I went add more grace just to say no thanks cuz all they have is pop over there and pop is the worst thing for me but even if I drink pop you I get rashes all over here I get red rashes if I drink pop because it's it's awful it's gonna kill people it's gonna get people diabetes right okay so I would buy the third or fourth time I'm like no I don't want your pop I didn't care because I gotta take care of God's man you know brother said that you have to take care of the Lord's man but they meant Satan's trying to kill you kill the man or a woman that you are but you got to take care of God's man that you are God's woman that you are did you know that dr. Bosworth of told brother Branham this it was in 1961 brother Bosworth said stop preaching too long and too hard and both man kept trying to say well I'd rather wear out than rust out my brother BAM realized he was gonna wear out and that's why he started increasing his hunting trips because the trips would wear him down physically and so he had to go back up there to rest and restore and recover and then he tells his story of Paul Rader Paul Rader was a wonderful preacher and I think he wrote hymns as well he said I remember Paul Rader how many ever met Paul Rader he's a great man of God told a little story one time he was going on a train I listen this story you like this and he was with another man and said this man tried to get back at him because he slept in a Pullman that night now Pullman was kind of like we'd say like a first-class bed or seat on a train so there was preachers on the train and Paul Raiders like I need to get a Pullman I need to ride first class and the other preachers are like they're upset at him because he rode first class we'd say now did something similar that I don't know exactly but I looked it up on the dictionary that's what it says okay so I'm doing the best I didn't live back then so I don't know I don't ride trains either so I'm just doing the best I can and then at the morning breakfast a group of ministers was going somewhere for a convention and so this man sent right next to Paul you ever meet a Christian like that they just want to sit by you so they can criticize you I let them they purposely come around you just to tell you you're wrong and to criticize you well let me tell you that's Satan is he's the accuser of the Brethren this guy comes around he watchin imagine he's carried his Bible and he watches Paul go in the first class a man of God take first class and so he says the next morning I'm gonna sit by him I'm gonna fall him on I'm an embarrassing in front of all the preachers oh I can't wait to embarrass him and when you act like that you know you're devil possessed maybe not in your body but in your mind now look at the story now of course he said well praise God he said i sat in a chair car a chair car last night and I saved the Lord some money look at these look at this pride he's around the table and he knew he slept in the first passage I slept in a chair last night I saved the Lord some money Paul said praise God I took a Pullman and I saved the Lord's man worried about money but Paul knew I've labored really hard I preach really hard I need some rest if I don't get some rest I'm gonna be an awful angry person tomorrow and you won't want to hear me preach tomorrow you see that so he said oh I saved the Lord some money bless God he said I slept in first-class I saved the Lord's man a church I've never flown first class God is my witness but if I was desperately tired sister Wendy I consider it if I thought I was going to like pass out the next day really amen I consider it but I've never been that harsh I've never been that sick or tired before but I've never labored like some of those brothers labored either remember one vision that struck Daniel he got sick for many days if brother Branham had vision after vision after vision let him go up in there for two-three weeks let him go over there for a month he's just trying to recover so he can serve God's people so see there's a ballast to all this and I'm just saying that from I'm using myself as a decimal I would only use the first class if I absolutely needed it and so far it's been good I haven't he really needed it because I have a labored like them but if somewhat of a man or a woman was desperately tired or sick or labored and they needed to treat their flesh a little more gently go ahead you're taking care of God serving praise God oh thank the Lord get a good night's rest Church you're tired go to bed early save God's woman you mothers your time dads take care of that put the kids down let the moms go to bed early save God's woman praise God don't let him die and wear themselves out and frustrate themselves help people so they can recover and get back and have more strength so when the enemy comes they'll have more strength to be able to cast him down praise God and you know whether they have said his hardest temptations was when he was most tired and the thing is it's proven by Jesus when he was the most tired after forty days not eating not drinking that's when Satan came your hardest battles are going to come when you're the most tired when you're the most weak so save God's men they meant save God's man he's been doing a good job and let me give an example when we have special meetings four in a row I was like by the Amen instead of you doing all four song services can I lead a couple now first I don't remember I don't know but you have to correct me on this one man I don't know if he was open to it right away but after a couple of times he's like yeah he's like he's like brother Jesse can you lead two of them and I'll lead to him he's trying to save God's man praise God and that's why I set my timer I'm trying to save God's man not today I'm not trying to save God's man he's only got one service I'm gonna preach to them longer today by God's grace yeah I could secret tomorrow brother Wesley if I want so you see it Church it's about having wisdom how many the wisdom of God so I have to balance everything I have to balance on you know starving my body crucified my desires but also recognizing this might be a moment when I need to rest a little more because I know the Christian life is not a flowery bed of knees it's a war it's a cross caring journey take up your cross every day and follow me it's gonna be a slow death slowly learning to obey slowly learning to live with this anointing I know most the time it's going to be a hard battle but if there's a time if there's a juniper tree frames behind it and there's a place I can find those arrests then I believe God will guide me to it I want to be open to embrace not and what God to give me to feed me like you did Elijah and I want to be able to go in that food for 40 days crazy you understand what I'm saying praise God in other words I want a fresh anointing praise God in my moment of weakness my hours weren't tired which really took compared to Jesus we're really not we don't have it that hard at all compared to Paul and a prison here it's really not that hard [Applause] well yet what's hard is our mind battles there's never been a harder time of mind battles than right now and that's because Paul said evil seducers will wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so church many times our bodies are going to be tired because our minds have been laboring and fighting all day to cast down all these thoughts and temptations and distractions and deceptions it's never been this hard on the human spirit then right now I got one more to prove to you Jesus said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold Church this world is getting more and more full of iniquity they are literally going to be workers of iniquity children of hell that Jesus pours the vials of judgment the woes of judgment the trumpet of judgment afar because all they knew god help us to be anointed to work righteousness amen yeah and that starts with conquering your body's passions that's where it starts it has to start right away in the morning most the time I don't have to sleep in I every morning where they run Johnny I probably get up at 5:00 5:30 every morning I have to sleep but I go to bed 10:30 11:00 I get up at 5:30 no problem no problem it's so what I'm saying is most of the time I've got to be careful not to give in to the lusts of the flesh in other words I rarely have to rest my physical body like gods man like the large man in the Pullman I don't many other times do that and so you and I need to focus on being anointed with temperance to deny the sensual lusts of the flesh because remember gluttony and drunkenness go together they get all their money's on food all their money's on drink and so the Bible says most of them will become poor they have no savings because all their money is into their current pleasures what do I have now what I have right now I got to feed my pleasure right now and they're not sitting anyway for the future so see and we're all going to have a reputation in fact you don't have to tell anybody your reputation just then being around you they know your reputation amen because the Bible said let your light so shine that they might see your good works and glorify your father in heaven and he said he said all men are gonna know your reputation reputation but you have to make sure your reputation is moderation Oh everybody knows pastor Jesse's the first one in line at the buffet and he's the last one to leave what kind of reputation would that be for a preacher but you know a lot of preachers got that they do everybody knows that right most people know that see you're gonna develop a reputation among us and this should be moderation it should be self-control well I just can't do it I happen to know somebody who can Jesus I mean it's anointing annoying thing praise God you're just gonna ask believe I just can't overcome this I just get on just this this fleshly thing I know something that can Jesus can overcome it he gives you an anointing which is power and authority he gives you power authority over the sensual desires amen because really your body's not your own see when you feed God's body more than it needs or when you feed God's body things it doesn't need you're wrong it's not your body how many number first gonna insist you are bought with the price you can't say well I can eat whatever I want I can drink whatever I want I can spend my money on whenever I want no you can't I bet you you're gonna answer for it and if Paul was here he'd argue with you Oh glory that's what he would say you're feeding your sensual desires you need to be temperate cuz there's coming a judgement a praise God and God is giving us a power that can overcome this body amen I know yeah oh thank you lord so see it's an anointing instead of being anointed with the desire for I'm just using buffets you know because it's a big place of it's a big place of gluttony it's an obvious place of gluttony that's one of the most things that you see I'm so sad that's why I don't go to buffets at all curses they're dirty as well a lot of germs you know about day one reason I don't like going there is because I see people and they're like slaves to the buffet line they are very very unhealthy I'm just gonna say like that and they just keep going back and keep and then plate after plate and Turk that breaks my heart look what they're doing to the temple of God it's not even their temple it's God's temple now if you need an extra plate that's what we knew done I don't know your calorie income that you need or your calorie matter on it I don't know what you need but you know what you need like I imagine look at Johnny and I'll even use myself Johnny how are you 6 4 6 6 praise God look at that he could probably eat way more than all of us and it doesn't even it won't even go to like fat right like his body needs that much let me give example when I was in college football explained attacker I could eat to Chipotle burritos in one city now I can hardly one now Wesley but when I was working out seven days a week and I was trying to be tough mr. copped my calories and protein high PD two of those burritos okay he's like you're crazy I know I was I was crazy I was a sports fanatic I didn't have this but actually you know what I needed that actually others say like that I actually needed that I was trying to be 190 and everything like that but I'm just giving you an example like there's some people that just need it and then some people are made bigger and wider than others and some are like skate flagpoles you others are so skinny but God loves a variety but the point I'm trying to make is that it's the anointing that allows you to treat God's body the right way they praise God we just have to reject the wrong anointing and take the holy anointing of God like yesterday now I'm gonna give you an example what I ate yesterday my wife said my breakfast isn't very we're talking on the way here and I admit it but most days I get up at 5:00 I'll drink a lot of water now this has worked for me I don't know what will work for you I'm gonna make changes this week honey so hold hold hold me to it down it's Father's Day I'm gonna turn a corner today actually I'm gonna try to anyways I'll wake up a five-dollar water before I come to study the church I'll just have an apple too orange see healthy sugars are okay I'm sorry natural sugars okay well my wife says I need more like was a healthy fats in the morning and protein and healthy cholesterol so this week I'm gonna buy some hard-boiled eggs with a mint I hate taking time to make the food I just want to eat and go on I just thank God for wives that you know thank God for mothers I would sit there and take that time and they'll make sure it's healthy me I just want to let's go let's pick it up in I can eat so fast you should see me brain and I can eat man I can eat fast I just want to get it done to move on and then for lunch I have a huge meaty salad you know and then for supper yesterday I had the chicken and then one piece of pizza rice then I got home I had some meat that was all I mean very very little and so I've learned over the years to try to eat as little as I can and then I don't we try too fast regular Luna tea right you'll be very healthy if you fast regularly at least once or twice a week it's called intermittent fasting and God showed me 20 years ago I stopped drinking pot 20 years ago because everybody knows sugar is gonna produce diabetes and let me tell you I'm not gonna name this person but I sat down at the table with the person lesss so he already passed away few years ago but I sat down with the person and he was diabetic and I he I saw how he got there I'll just say like that cuz he wrote down every day all the calories diet coke or I'm sorry the coffee was sugar in the morning gonna see oh here's a pad in here hey was it a go or Legos or pancakes and syrup a cherry cherry pastry for lunch pizza and then the evening upper sandwich and a burger oh and in each time in between drinking diet pop all day the man died of cancer and he had that so I'm saying is he became a type two diabetic and that this is the sad part the doctors were telling him you're pretty healthy and he's feeding himself trash all day and then they wonder why is it this way because it's all sugar no temperance see that's just one example I want to give you because I saw a man with her away in the last ten years I've seen him wither away till he died of cancer I just eaten eating and drinking sugar all day right we got to eat healthy Church right you got to eat Whole Foods try to eat it in the way God made it if you can now brothers I'm gonna give you some meat afterwards and it's probably not in the right state but it says natural on the label so let me say eat it in moderation don't eat it all one city but see like I told you we we have to be known for our moderation we can fast at times or then we can when we need a meal we can get a good meal but we really have to use wisdom because my wife and I have seen it we've seen people curse the devil for them getting cancer or diabetes and it's their own fault it wasn't the devil that that gave them that cancer the devil might have tricked him to having that bad diet it was the bad diet it was the lack of Holy Ghost anointing praise God and then then after all those years and decades of not having any temperance lacking that anointing now they wasn't God anoint them for healing in church sometimes God has done it thank now if that's a if that is a mercy I don't know what is you purposely feed yourself God's body God's temple you purposely defile God's temple then you get mad when it suffers the consequences of it I think Steven you and I talked about this one time I used get fast food fanatic I told a madness in college brother I had so much money I grew up poor Stephen and so I got a full scholarship and they would just send me a huge check once a semester it was like I don't even know what does that felt like a rich man I said to pay my rent and all this money for food well-dressed even in the morning I do my eggs and you know and then for lunch I would always do my eggs but every night I just treat myself you know I'm just so proud of myself for getting a college degree of playing college football each night I had a different fast food choice Monday was Chinese Tuesday was Mickey D's and you name it you know on down and after I got done playing football it that was a bad habit and it got worse brother Wesley then every morning I was going for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's and when I started getting when we got engaged I started realizing wow and my wife's like just fiance you're spend a lot of money on fast food Jesse we're gonna get married and sorry finally started a trend you're stirring up there oh yeah this probably isn't the healthiest way plus it's not a good use of money either and so God had to take I was addicted to dr. pepper as well and that's when I would get the rashes and everything like that and that's when God had to show me I had no temperance praise God I couldn't even control myself it's like it's kind of got felt like a shaking on the inside Stephen I needed that double pounder or double quarter-pounder with cheese it was awful and that's what that's what my wife knew me as that was what I was known as a fast-food junkie a dr. pepper drinkin junkie Church we don't want that kind of reputation we don't want the reputation of the person who eats the most cake right we don't want the reputation of the person you name it at the at the fellowship that goes up for four or five plates or the person who every day is known okay there's a certain family member I love but they're known for drinking gallons of Mountain Dew that's going to destroy them teeth first and then later all the effects of that gonna absolutely destroy them like now we laugh a little bit cuz every now and then we like a little splurge right that's okay brother Graham did it every now and then but it's moderation it's a very few times but see it takes an anointing to do that did you know that church you need anointing just to sit down at the dinner table you can see who's anointed is they like that we can see who's anointed at the dinner tables who's got the anointing of the Holy Spirit for temperance now that just matches one area remember all those other ones I listed you know sexual temptations and pride and division this is just one area one one area but we have one anointing that covers all the areas let me try to find a place to close now I don't have the scriptures but I didn't have time to look it up you could find them very easily God foretold Israel he said you're gonna start doing the Promised Land he said but when you get full when you get rich when you get complacent that's when you're gonna get other gods to yourself read I just got done with Deuteronomy right numbers I think it's a new drawing me God told Moses tell those people when they get in there once you get a lot of money a lot of food and if you see if you don't notice if you don't exercise temperance that's when idols will spring up in Our Lives praise God and I can find it if if I try real quick here maybe give me a second see if I can fold up here I'm just trusting in God's grace oh yeah here's a warning Deuteronomy 8:11 the warning is Deuteronomy 8:11 beware that they'll forget not the LORD thy God and not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command you this day less when thou has eaten an artful and has built God goodly houses and dwell therein and when I heard thy flocks multiply thy silver thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then heart be lifted up and now forget the LORD thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage hallelujah I didn't even know the words I was gonna search for so thank the Lord that was a warning at the onset a church what about us word Laodicea we have access to everything we can get credit I could get right now then again I got 15 or thirty thousand dollars in credit on discover I could just go run that up but I gotta have temperance on that so we have access to almost anything we could possibly want proving it's a Leo to see an age Amen but as October the Amen the zeal of the hour is to zealously repent don't give God a half-hearted repentance you've got a zealous repentance and do your first works Oh ain't it works it's all about you what you're saying it's all about your works you're saved by grace through faith but then if you've got faith faith works by love Amen see so app you're saying it's all about your loving works what which works are you gonna produce whichever one you love the most if you love the flesh or who works for the flesh if you love the spirit you'll do works for the spirit what a great warning to us once you get enough money that's the time you got to be careful great how many can say amen to that I've been going through that the last few years you know God has finally helped me pay off all my bills and all my debts I got only one left in mortgage well sir I got a house loan to renovation loan that one's almost paid off but I've noticed it too with all the extra money I noticed it like I just feel better like as far as fleshly better like I feel more comfortable and I don't like that feeling you me like because when your partner like Oh Lord you know you're constantly praying how am I gonna make ends meet am I gonna pay the bill I'll be the hottest Church once you get all these bills paid off we got to be careful careful not to get complacent and then start compromising on the word of god what what's gonna help you overcome be anointing of temperance Lord yoke me yoke me let me be let me work with temperance in my life so the zeal of the hour is to repent you see yourself get a little fleshly you know given your flesh too much pleasure right you got a zealous li repent and say God I'm sorry right it's all about your motivation it's all about your motivation I'd like to in a few more things by God's grace let's go to first cuttings 9 here you know once you turn in their first grade a design of a few years ago my doctor saw my cholesterol levels now there's a good cholesterol and a bad one my bad one was going up I'm like doctor what do I do and he's like well you're what do you eat I was like burgers I like hamburgers he's like you gotta stop eating hamburgers because that bread is bad for you cause it's not real bread I hate to tell you but because that wrote that bread at the burger joints that's not real bread and he said these words he said I always remember this he said eat a meaty salad I was like oh then I started eating a mess our liking of my and each year I've gone back my numbers have gone down or stayed the same I just had to trade my fleshly desires for wisdom you still get still get the potent protein you need from the meat I'm not a dietitian my wife said my wife said she reminded me I wasn't a dietitian and I appreciate that I'm not I'm just showing you the examples it's true I'm not but I'm just showing you examples how God is give me wisdom to increase better to have more temperance if you're if you have to go out to eat between services or you know choose something healthy and you'll be better off and I've seen that year after year after year I thank the Lord and then you got to eat xr/e exercise routinely right get an exercise routine whether you just start taking a walk drink a lot of water right there so if you want to talk to me about diet I'll be happy to talk to you about diet just talk to me after church but you got to get you got to get on water you got a routine exercise Church if we are slaves of this how we ever ranked we were not gonna go in the rapture if we can't have this cuz you have to you have to be born again and you're very good here they have to have mature temperance if you want to go in the rapture it's got to be mature first contains nine so Paul's compares himself he says he's a he's a prophet he's a teacher the Gentiles he's a messenger from God and he compares himself to a runner in the Olympics or some Olympic sort of game verse 23 and this I do for the Gospels sake that I might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain how many ever ran in a race before did you want to win or lose when Paul says run the Christian race like you're gonna win that means you got to go to every lengths to win brother amen without cheating but man's gotta play by the rules there's no shortcuts the temperance amen it must be daily acted upon daily habits let me read this real quick how many know Michael Jordan I just looked up one time what was his diet like breakfast oatmeal with strawberries blueberries and raisin scrambled eggs white glass of orange juice wait did I see fruity pebbles in there this man performed at the highest level you could perform look when he fed his body lunch chicken breast sandwich or lean hamburger just the breast right just the burger pasta baked potato small green salad did they say Baconator in there did I miss them dinner whatever he wants so he would be real temperate oh but the last one you got whatever he was look Paul says you need to act and treat your body like you're trying to win the race I was a state champion I know if you know that village honest a champion in the hundred meter 200 meter and long Joe in Ohio now I could eat whatever I wanted back then I could I never competed on the level but here's a professional on this level and you don't see junk food in here right Paul says you need to have the attitude like you are a professional Runner and run like you're gonna win the race praise God verse 25 and every man that striveth you at the war where the word strive is a war striveth for the mastery see you are fighting again it's a war against your flesh it is an absolute war Paul wasn't joking around I know I told some jokes at him it's not it's not a joke when it comes down to it because it shows whether are you take the world's anointing or God's anointing you're fighting for the mastery is temperate and only some things oh you're temperate two-thirds of your meal every day like Michael Jordan now you got your three once a week have your splurge you know really that'd be good once a week if you'd only Spurs once a week how much more healthy would we boot you I think I try to do that now there was times my wife Bobby let me be honest here sometimes I get in the bad habit most even to buy an ice cream sandwiches I'll have one per night it's I'll eat oh I kind of do the Michael Jordan one Oh eat real healthy you know I gotta have something nice something nice you know but Alice I haven't had many those the last few weeks by God's grace you know it goes in you know it's a battle it's a battle striving for the mastery and church we need to be temperate in all things let me look up this is a different Greek word I didn't realize that temper at all things oh it's a very similar work yeah self-control continent exhibiting self-government conduct oneself temper temperately in a figure drawn from athletes who in preparing themselves for the games abstain from oh unwholesome food wine and sexual indulgence food wine and sexual indulgence athletes have to be very enough to take very good care of their bodies right and Paul says you and I are running for glory we're running away more important race than the Olympics that they rescheduled for later on who cares who cares and they run around like they're half naked anyway bunch of heathens that's what they are now I love them I pray form you know fashion them I'm saying they know better right God with the conscience and every mod and every person knows better than that but we're running even a greater race to that amen hallelujah the eternal ray nice amen the hard part is but Johnny I was a sprinter but now I'm a distance runner I'm talking about the spiritual and I didn't like distance at all I still don't patience is that what huh not my favorite thing but God give me grace I said like this I have a portion of it by God's grace because I've seen it I've seen God help me but see we have to run up we have to have the mindset I'm a distance runner who's patiently laying aside anything willing to lay it down and run the race with patience makes me go run right down haven't run for years and this is the illustration Paul's trying to get the Corinthians and member there's many games there's many sports events around quorum that was huge on sports cuz they worship anything with God he said we must be temperate if you're gonna fight for that first place in everything sighs if you're gonna fight to rule and reign with Christ you must be temperate in all things not just some what you eat right what you say what you do all those how you act your words its temper and everything but food is the most common one we see in America we all know it okay it's not like some it's not like a fly on the wall I can you know we know we're it's it's real to us all verse 26 therefore so I run not as uncertainly and that means punching with a blindfold on like you're not you're not aimlessly serving Christ right you know where you're running he said so fight I not as one that beateth here I'm sorry that's what that means the beating the air uncertainty means with no finish line so church we know we're running we're running to godliness right we're running to a real fruits of the Holy Spirit this is where we're running to be like Christ to have real fruits of the spirit so Paul says that's how I run I run to be temperate in all things I know Gouri I know where I'm running and I know who I'm beating up praise God I know I'm fighting and I know where I'm going Bray's God Boston where the guys are gonna fight the most is yourself and I'll tell you one way to do it give her a good get yourself a buddy with John Graham got in my life and of course my wife first she really helped me John Graham got my life and he really he rubbed me the right way with being more temperate and making sure ie to the right way and make sure I went to bed early got up early like you want to be more golly talking fellowship with people that are godly if you want to if you want to run in Olympics should you hang around the the harley-davidson motorcycle gang no you better get yourself a running group right you better get up at 6 a.m. and do your running every day with your running group you want to go in the rapture you better get with Holy Ghost field Saints amen you have to and you have to be accountable because listen everybody knows your reputation anyway praise God so be talk with people and surround yourself with people that are into these things and it'll lift you up praise God cuz you can't do it alone don't run uncertainly you don't know where you're running you don't know why you're starving yourself or robison they starving you don't know why you're being moderate no you know why you're trying to get victory over the flesh you're you're not beating the air you're seeing your punches have an impact pressure's high amen he said when I keep under my body and bring it into subjection that means beat til it's black and blue that's what that word means bruise it he said I bruised my body to bring it under subjection lest by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway see a castaway is a ship that sails away in the wrong direction someone that's unfit someone who's unproved or not approved someone who's reprobate and doesn't stand the test like that we could even say a sinking ship how many want to reach your destination I don't want to sink and see my testimony go down in the seas of this world I don't want to be a castaway well how you do it Paul you have to bruise and beat your body not physically but you have to starve it yep not another's deny it bring it into OB it's to the Word of God because you gotta live like you're the only one that's gonna make the rapture they run like you're the one who's gonna win the prize praise God that's glorious I'm closing with this yeah I'm going a little bit longer today and I appreciate your patience with me I'm closing with this I you know there was numerous examples as I wrote this chapter and I was just meditating on it I just thought of these simple examples look at the temperance Daniel and the three Hebrew children had they had every food laid out but the and it's proven by the Book of Daniel they started not partaking of it and they continued not partaking in it and when Daniel fast and later on and like the Bible said he didn't eat the great even the meats he just ate fruits and vegetables that's why Rick Warren started that Daniel fashion ever heard of that the Daniel 5 I never did it I never felt like I needed it but if you need it that's a good thing to do eat eat what gods made eat the foods God has given us and be give thanks for them praise God Joseph look at Joseph now this is a different one Joseph was about 27 or 28 can you imagine he's at the peak of his sexual desires and Potiphar's wife every day now brothers think about that every day she's like come lay with me here's his schedule now look she gonna print it out in that day right she could here's my husband's schedule look you just saw me here and she's begging him every day but look at the temperance Joseph had 28 he's in the prime of life some of your sisters in Rosa you're in the prime of life for your passions are the hardest what did Joseph have he had temperance praise God every day this woman would beg him come lay with me and if we we have power we can go in this chamber here and nobody nobody nobody nobody he's in the very height of his passions but he had such an anointing of the Holy Spirit I love what the Bible says he I love this when the devil's trying to get you do something ask the devil question he says how can I do this great wickedness and sin against God as the devil that question how can i sin against the one who's brought me to Egypt to save life and he wasn't even he was still in that you're still just a slave there but he had such tempers with aim and every day oh I know the girl just brothers praise God doesn't it we could have such an anointing of tempers how do you know it's not by my power Church it's by the power of the Holy Spirit not by my mind not by my power but by the power of temperance sayeth the Lord amen that's how I do it how do you turn on those cookies and those brownies by God's Spirit I turned on that dr. pepper that cigarettes by God's Spirit argue it not by my might or power I my flesh was freely given but it's by the anointing that God has placed upon my life thank the Lord last one Philippians ends lets go back to Philippians for that just can't get out this Philippians here here Paul Church as we read this he's been serving Jesus Christ for thirty years he's been shipwreck lows at three times beaten five times 39 stripes each time this man has given his body soul and mind to Jesus Christ after serving Jesus Christ 30 years let's look at his temperance here what will our lives look like I see it you know what some of the Lima Saints like let me just give an example Marilyn Brown she was in brother Graham church we went to a fellowship last year and I was just purposely watching her kind of life does she live as she would laugh and smile you know she's precious here she's got that meek and quiet my wife and I was just that meek and quiet spirit I love it praise God but I watch how she was in she barely had a little bit they know she's a little older of course too I just thought what a good example cuz I know a lot of old people that don't do that we could all point to numerous people that are older that they don't have much temperance like I told you brother Brooks is a great example he's 65 I think 64 he still runs four five six miles a day because his metabolism is really slow and he wants to serve God better than he ever has before now that's a godly example right there he's big-boned he tells me he's like how are you so skinny I'm like I was born that way he's like I was born this way some people are just bigger than others but that don't mean you have to let yourself go and lose your temperance because you can easily get it back from the Lord Jesus this is about 64 AD Philippians 4 right after we just read earlier moderation be known to all men verse 10 but I rejoice in Lord greatly that now at your last care of me have flourished again wearing to you all you were also careful but you lacked opportunity but I'm sorry not that I speak in a respect of want for I have learned look at this after 30 years of being robbed beaten shipwrecked I have learned what did that what did the Lord teach him what kind of temperance did God teach remember he just said be moderate everybody needs them know your moderates I'm sorry your moderation rather he learned this whatever state I am I am content so if we go to the buffet I'm content I'll get a salad there if we don't go to the buffet I'm content we'll go home and have some eggs and cheese then I'm just trying to make it real for us right first well I know both how to be abased humbled know how to abound everywhere and in all things look all things again it's always all things temper in all things modern and all things see preference is a way of life it's a way of habit building that's that's our word for it but before it wasn't habit it was temperance now our word is habit it's you have good habits everywhere they're everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry and to abound and suffer need where's he at right now Church he's in the palace did they feed him did Romans a Roman prison is known for being a picnic like American prisons absolutely not they were awful conditions beaten disease the toilet you know the system was awful I mean these do for naught this was not a party and then in the midst of this he says verse 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me I can do I can abound or I can be humbled I can be hungry I can be full and I'll do all of it through Christ so this is the context Paul's writing at the end of his life two years before he died what does temperance look like what is the fruit of temperance look like looks like this you learn amen god help us to keep learning amen we keep learning we learn from every situation God puts us through we learn how to serve God with more contentment and more self-control if that's what he learned I think we're learning the same thing because he said everywhere at all things now he received their gift in verse 17 not because I desire a gift I love this aim and I are talking about this but I desire fruit that may abound to your account Paul did not like to get gifts now most of us like gifts right I like this yeah who doesn't like a nice kid but Paul said the reason I wanted a gift was it because I wanted it myself but I wanted people to send me something because I know God will reward them in heaven a church how many of us think about this how many of us believe would be willing to go to jail lack food just so other Christians can visit us or give us food so that they'll have a reward in heaven in other words who wants to go through hard trials so that someone has to give you something but what do we like we like being a controlled everything we like I know Idina like being control I could be like everything's going my way I've got Paul said I'm okay I'm okay we're never say that God puts me in I'm okay because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and God has allowed me to come in prison so that other people can get heavenly rewards you know maybe said many times sure I think that's why older people get in the hospital get diseases so other people can Christians can come and pray for them when I was sick you came and visited me a lot of Christians in the message going they get sick right just it's the end of their end of their life and somebody goes to visit them or someone goes to pray for them Paul says this is what that's why I got a gift that's why I wanted to give not because I wanted it but because I know God has put me in prison to further the gospel and to give other people a chance to earn a heavenly reward because when they give to me they're really not given to me they're given to Christ verse 18 but I have all and abound I am full having receipt of a preferred itis the things which were set from you and odor of sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus let's say into our feet praise God so before you switch that off this is this is what we're aiming for this is the finish line right here where are you running brother just right here this is I want to have a mature love I have mature joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance that is the whole the fruit is the whole purpose of the plant right we want things to come to fruition right our lives come to fruition when we can we can laugh things but yet we're still content we can be gentle even when people are harsh we can love even when we're hate musicians if you'll come by God's grace you know every time I come to temperance you know the Holy Spirit will bring these thoughts back because it's so critical in this hour this is the age of increased Goods and especially increased moods and money status popularity we have to continually die to self I have to do a church all of us have to continually die daily deny the flesh and if he did here Wednesday nights no listen that brother Graham said I lost 25 pounds so I could serve the Lord the best I could [Music] now a prophet who is already in service realize I'm eating weight and I'm not able to serve God as best I can if a prophet could do that what about us [Music] we have to serve God the best you say like this how to take care [Music] George Lopez says you have one time to pray I didn't get the best picture Jesus and John the Baptist were known by their moderation John was known to be fasting all the context Jesus was known to be eating over time but he said after I go go fast then see every group is known by what they do and so we need to know the power of God [Music] [Music] I don't know more areas I know mine I've shared some of them even this week you know Wednesday the lust of the eyes looking at other people's house and landscaping had to overcome that not compare myself to the flesh [Music] so let's pray together that my father I lift my voice to because I want to take care of God I don't want to pamper God but I want to take care of me I want to give him the right foods or give enough so that God's man can continue serving Lord anoint us set the fresh anointing of temperance upon this church who we know by something and let me know by the power of the Holy Ghost moderation every area of our life you want to be tempered at all things dear God like John the spiritual [Music] helped us to deny ourselves is to feed our adversary thank you that we might win the prize of B language erased this is part of your design thank you lord these are necessary [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
