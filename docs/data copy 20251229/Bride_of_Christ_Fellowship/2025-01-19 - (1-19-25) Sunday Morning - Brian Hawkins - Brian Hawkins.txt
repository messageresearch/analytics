========================================

you all again and did I hear you right one service yes one service so if it goes lengthy yall won't mind right well well equal to no we'll do whatever the Lord leads how's that so good to see you sister and uh it's good to be here once again and before I forget brother Jim wanted me to uh extend greetings to everybody here he says hello and uh and everybody behind him also says hello so it's uh good to see everybody smiling happy happy in the Lord and uh on a wintry day you know they keep throwing or threatening uh inclement weather bad weather but you still came out so that that just shows that you have a desire and a love for the Lord amen so know just appreciate uh you all making the effort to come and uh it's really good to see you all again and this is a really fast turnaround uh not not used to it so much I think a few years ago you know i' ministered a few times for youall it was like every every other month or something like that for a little bit but uh yeah so Lord be with you all if you would please turn with me to chapter or Ephesians chapter 3 and I had just preached this at the at the home church just a little bit ago so hopefully it's just as fresh and uh hopefully it's a a blessing to you as well uh I think it's in Daniel it's a in a couple places in the scripture where uh men have tried to do things and try to do it for the Lord but there's just something that always stands in the way and uh so we we we tried and I always feel bad because I I feel like I didn't do my due diligence to get myself set aside and never assume that you have a whole Saturday to do something to study because uh what I do is I work on generators and I got a couple calls yesterday and I had to get out into the field and repair a couple customers generators so that took me away from that a little bit and that's a lesson to me to don't don't depend on a whole Saturday so uh without further Ado you've been standing for a little bit uh Ephesians chapter 3 starting at verse 7 and it's always difficult to uh I know I'm rambling I'm nervous so uh it's always difficult to start somewhere in the scripture when there's a semicolon or a colon you know I hate to break it up so we're we're this is a little bit lengthy but not not too long don't don't worry but I just can't stop it once but so it's nice to get the whole thought of what it's of what it's saying getting the whole context of it so he says whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power so we see the gifts are given by him correct so verse 8 it says unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is the grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ right and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ see this is this is a time where our eyes are open that we are blessed to be able to see things that uh men and women of old time were not able to see it but what privilege we have in this day that we're able to see these things that our eyes are open amen hallelujah so verse 10 it says to the intent that now unto the unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord Amen in whom we have boldness and access this is what we have in Christ that we have a boldness and we have the access see we are still privileged he's still going on to say what a privileg people you are Hallelujah with confidence not shaking well I almost feel feel like I'm I missed the mark of I feel led to go a different different direction now but you you and and and we could just oh Lord help me because I don't know what direction to go now but we'll just continue on but we'll see how it goes so verse 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith of him 13 wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man so this is kind of where I want to get to is the next few verses that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend or understand with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge it's not even a knowledge game it passes knowledge you ever try to describe God and you just can't find the words because we just have these the the words of man and it's he's so beyond what a man can even explain right so uh may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End so he is able to do exceeding abundantly above that above all that we ask or think which he knows what we're going to ask before we ask it he knows what we need before we even bring it before him and he's already ready to bless it before we even speak it amen but it's just that whole thing is that we have to take that step because as we read in there it's as a faith right it's it's something that we that we are laying hold that we are claiming already see faith is the substance of things hoped for you hoped for it in the past but now you're going to say I have it going to say it's something that I have it's something that I possess now amen so when you're praying for sickness when you're praying for deliverance you give God thanks as if it's a done a a work already done that's having faith saying I have it I'm going to receive it not just laying it out there well Lord I hope that you're going to move on this I hope you're able to do that we already know that he is more than able to do these things exceeding and abundantly more amen so Colossians 2 and verse 6 if you would turn with me there in verse six it says as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord everybody receive Christ Jesus the Lord this morning amen it is a true gift so if you've received him it says so walk ye in him so walk in his ways walk in in the way that he's established walk in the way that is pleasing unto him not according to our way but according to the way that that he is amen so verse 7even it says rooted and built up in him established in the faith not just some kind of uh I'm hanging in there for the moment but being rooted and grounded unshakable unmovable yes coming with a faith coming with a confidence to know that you were his child am so rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving abounding so there's there there there's a way to abound in Christ through all of his benefits amen so verse eight it says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ and we see that there are so many philosophies way back in jesus' time the Greeks were known for their philosophical views and they would have their disputes they would have their debates of who uh look at Socrates and and and I can't remember him right now but there were so many philosophers in the day and this is the warning that was established beware of those that have philosop uh the philosophical ideas that try to draw you away from Christ it might have a it might sound good for a moment but it's pulling you away from the grace of God that's right it might sound good good it might be so close that it might deceive the very elect if possible so things can sound so good but yet it's trying to pull you away that's where we have to have our discernment exercised amen being able to distinguish to to to be to discern between good and evil amen so real quick to give a definition in the two scriptures I I read about being rooted and grounded so what is to what does it mean to root everybody kind of has an understanding of what root means correct so what a to root it means to to uh this is figuratively to become stable to cause to strike a root to strengthen with roots to render firm to fix to establish to cause a person or a thing to be thoroughly grounded a tree a plant all those things have Roots even a Vine has roots even and that's where the life is coming from as it draws and it it draws from the ground it draws from the soil it's getting the the water it's getting the nutrients as it as it goes down it has to get down into the ground it has to get down into the soil so when the wind blows it's not going to blow over it's strengthened by the root amen so if I could this morning uh if we could bow our heads this morning uh I'd like to speak on uh fruit of the root if I could have like a a side thing on that so cut the root you kill the fruit Heavenly Father we just thank you so much for what you've done for us we thank you for safe travels every one of us here and uh even if it's snowing or blowing and and and icy in different areas Lord uh each one has had the desire to make it here into the in the house of worship this morning to come and sing songs unto you to give you praise to give you worship and to hear your word father I pray that their effort would not go in vain but Lord I pray that you would bless each and every one that's made the effort to come here this morning and may they go stronger than they have in a long time may they go revived may they go uh uh just having a refreshing of your Holy Spirit Lord as we depart from here we ask the same that you would continue to be with us and keep us safe in our travels we ask it all that you would uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would be here and as we're here in your presence we pray for your blessings be with the speaker and the hearer I just pray that you would keep my guard my lips keep me from speaking anything wrong in correct or or anything contrary to your word Lord we ask all these things again in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so like I said I'd like to speak on Roots the fruit of the root and brother Jesse made a comment just before I came out about uh fruits and I brother you have no idea what you're just saying well I'm sure he has an idea he just didn't know what I uh what I what was prepared this morning so I'm just going to try to take my time so we we've we've all we all know the the story of the the the parable the sewer of the different seeds I'm just I'm just going to try to uh paraphrase uh through them uh if I go too fast uh raise your hand I I'll try to slow down so I just want to make sure you you're able to to understand it see uh y'all might not be hindered I I don't I was telling the brother here I have a hard time with accents sometimes and and it it it's not so much you all okay it's more me I just have a hard time under I have sometimes I have a hard time understanding my wife and it's not because of her it's just I just don't understand it very well so it's I if if you don't understand me if I'm going too fast just raise your hand so depending on what uh on what ground you are because the the parable of sers talks about the different types of ground of how the seed is able to be received correct so it depends on where you are in that in that Parable uh to see in your life uh where the where the spirit of the Lord is right so we understand the the seed to be the word of God right so uh so those that fell on the Wayside and this is in Matthew 13 I think is one of them and uh yeah in Matthew 13 and the other one I can't remember uh there was another one so those that fell on the wayside it means that that that seed or those people because we understand the seeds to be people right so uh excuse me the the roots and trees to be people uh so those that fell on the wayside it shows that they have no understanding and the wicked one comes and takes it away this is what the wicked one does right so and so there's there's nothing there that's going to be rooted and grounded so it's there there's no understanding there's no comprehension of of of what the word is they they hear the word but it didn't make sense to them and that can kind of you could attribute that right to predestination uh it doesn't mean that he's that we're puppets I I can't remember if I talked about this the last time but we're not puppets in the Lord's hands we're not marionettes you know we make our own decisions we we've been given that uh free moral agency that we can make our decisions and it's our decisions that determine what our destination is so uh we just thank the Lord that we were given the understanding that we could that we were able to see uh the meaning of his word so those that fell in the Stony places in Matthew 13- 20 uh it says but he that received the seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word hearing the word each one of these heard the word but there was something about uh uh each one so they they Hearth the word and a non with joy receive it yet he hath not root in himself but doth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended see what is the Forgotten beatitude blessed is he that is not offended in me so when we hear the word if if uh a lot of people especially new converts or or or young people have that question uh as they're they're they're living their Christian Life how do I know if I really have the Holy Spirit or not that is a very common question question not just among the the youth but it's also even in in in adults how do I know that I have the spirit how do I know that I've I've been baptized or um not baptized but sealed with the Holy Spirit you know that that is a that is a question that people ask a lot so and that's one way to gauge if you have the spirit or not when you read the scripture are you offended in the scripture when you hear the preaching of the word are you offended over the word does the word of God bother you because if it bothers you that's going to be a pretty good answer right there that if you get angry at the word if you get upset at the word that you probably don't have that spirit and I urge you to to get into prayer and seek that spirit amen so uh and and so they dth uh yet he hath not rooted himself but doth for a while for when tribulation or persecu persecution arises so when when hard times come uh uh uh like says in the tribulations and the persecutions when somebody comes against us we're not rooted and grounded enough and we get upset about it and then we want to turn away because we're not fitting into the world view right so there's another one uh that talks about falling among the Thorns they hear the word again each each one of these you hear the word and the cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches choke the word to become unfruitful the things of the world the desire of the world uh uh seeking uh celebrities sports sports fanatics looking at at these Sports people I guess you can call them icons or or whatever Idols you know and and people idolize these people so much that the home Church knows that they pretty much know how I feel about celebrities is I really don't care about celebrities you know uh they're celebrities because they are popular with people okay you acted in a film then all of a you've made millions of dollars now people idolize you just because you were able to act in a film or a sports celebrity just because you can carry a ball across the line yeah that's great that you've got those that you've got those skills but you know what outside of that what kind of people are they so when these when these young ones or when these people want to idolize these celebrities or these icons or Idols they don't even realize what they are idolizing they see that oh they can run uh they can run a 100 yards and and 6 seconds flat not happening but you you understand what I mean so uh just because they run real fast they're carrying a pig skinn football so what or they could throw a baseball you know a lot of and people look under that just because they can accomplish something in a sports game or they can accomplish something in a film you know all this film stuff it's all Hollywood it's all fake anyhow it's not even real so these people get get Popular by doing something that's not even real it's acting it's pretend yes and people pay big money for it it's entertainment but if you if you meet some of these people you'll find that they're probably not real likable people that's right because when money hits they get stingy they get greedy they get uh uh uh uh prideful all these different sins that come into their life and these are the kind of people that they are and some of them have have been accused of of of of of assault and you want to pattern yourself these people want to pattern themselves after these people oh but they got bank they got money so what that money is going to go in the grave with them they're not going to take it with them so what are we interested in the fruit bearing fruit we are interested in character how we could treat one another amen I don't care what color skin you have I you don't care what color skin I have and I know I'm treading ground right so we don't care about color skin we don't care because if if I cut my finger you cut your finger you cut your finger what do we what do we bleed we all bleed red right I'm not better than you you're not better than me right we're all human beings and those people people put their pants on one leg at a time just like you do yes sir so what makes them so special it's other people that make it seem like they're more special brother I don't know how I got on celebrities but that's how I feel I'm more interested in one person one person gets my praise one person gets the greatest honor that's where my that's where mine lays that's where give my glory that's where I give my honor is to the Lord Jesus Christ prise God I'm not going to worship some some persons that's just as fallible as me they're going to misspeak sometimes they're going to say wrong things like I was talking about Jonah and I was talking about the juniper tree and it was a gourd I was talking about disciples and I said it was Peter that said we're going to call out fire from heaven and I spoke it here and I didn't say Peter we just make mistakes like that they make the same mist mistakes why do you think they have to do so many takes yes sir you ever watch a movie and you see the bloopers careful raising your hands but you seen the bloopers why because it was a blooper it was a mistake yes it's not a perfect take every time and I'm way off my notes is that okay yes sir so yes but it's the fruit of the person that we're interested in right and and I think brother brother Jesse might have said something about I can't remember but uh but what is the Golden Rule treat PE treat others respect others as you expect to be treated right not treating others because you were treated a certain way how do you expect to be treated then we treat others with the same Hallelujah right because we expect the same result it doesn't mean that we will get the same result and I think it worth talking about that because about somebody getting bullied or I I can't remember what it was so and still showing the love of Christ persecution tribulation should not be cont our our our relationship with the Lord should not be contingent on how people it doesn't depend on how other people treat us but we should still maintain that love of Christ to show it forth amen how else are they going to see it yes good unless we show it rightall and how else can we show it l we abide in him because if we're going to be like him we have to produce the same fruit right so that's the Thorns is hearing the word and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches that's how we got on that the deceitfulness of riches don't think that rich people are always happy it doesn't always work that way well Money Can't money they people say well money can't buy happiness and and they're right but it sure helps sure having a lot of money sure it would help if you want a bigger house that you can't even you got more rooms than you got friends you know 15 15 rooms and 10 bathrooms and you got two friends what's that going to so what you got a mansion but we've got a different mansion that we're concerned of amen that's the one that I want whose Builder and maker is God amen GL so let's talk about the good ground the good ground are those that hear the word again they heard the word right how else are we going to receive Deliverance how else are we going to have Liberty yes there's a whole lot that goes into that word it all depends on how you hold it it all depends on how you view it it all depends on how you apply it yes Hallelujah those those words written in this book are just going to remain words as as long as it lays dormant between those covers if you get into that word and you absorb the nutrients within the covers yes by the washing of the water the word rece absorbing the water right yes as long as we're in that oh I guess we get into some something else sticky just because you read it doesn't mean you're saved that's right just because you read it doesn't mean that you believe yes sir just because you read it doesn't mean that you're a Believer that's right the devil knows a word too yes sir I don't care how good you can quote the word that doesn't mean you're saved that's right and as long as it lays dormant inside you know back in school I learned stuff I was okay with math problems as long as the math problems were on the board you know what I couldn't I couldn't stand is I couldn't I I really didn't like was the word problems you know what the word problems had you do it had you face reality I knew how to work simple Algebra I could do that you give me the problems I could I could solve them I I I could solve them uh pretty quick it might always be right but but anyhow but once I got those story problems give me something to apply what I've learned I had a hard time figuring it out see same thing with the scripture we might have we might know what the word says we might be able to quote it but until you apply it that's where the working power is yes sir yes sir amen it's got to have substance yes amen but the good ground here's the word understands it and is able to apply it by bearing fruit that's how you know that there is a Believer because not only are they in the word they produce the word amenl so the function of a root I know what we kind of covered that but there's more so the function of a root it means to Anchor and to support holding the plant firmly in the soil preventing the plant from washing Away by water or by wind not carried about by every wind of Doctrine not being offended when they hear the water of the word yes sir amen but absorbing it and to be able to withstand it amen so it also absorbs and it stores nutrients and energy the message the message is the word you can look at it as a storehouse we've got a storehouse of sermons before us yes of the message of where we can go and that we can learn what the word if we don't understand this we can go to the message yes amen hallelujah I know I'm Los I'm I'm using that term kind of loosely because I think you have an understanding of how I feel of what the message is which I believe the message to be Jesus Christ am right so and brother Jesse is getting nervous what you going to say but if if we could keep that Focus that the message is Christ we're going to be doing okay we don't we don't want to go wide right we don't want to go wide left we don't want to go Thunders we don't want to go this we don't want to go that but we want to stay right down the middle as long as we can keep Christ as a focus Christ is the message and the and the message right that was given to brother brandom it was to bring forth the bride to meet the message amen yes Hallelujah so we've got a storehouse of messages of sermons that we can go to when we don't have the understanding that his message came and and and brought and introduced and clarified a lot of the Mysteries that brought forth so we could have the understanding amen that's right so when we get into these things when the no matter how strong the wind blows no matter how strong the storms are that we could be rooted that we could be grounded that we could be established into the word that no matter what persecutions come we're going to stay right there and we're going to have peace in our hearts we're not going to let anybody Shake us and we're going to have a boldness because we have access to the one that is exceeding abundantly able amen prise God go see Roots they dig deep in the soil they absorb the water and nutrients and they carry it through the rest of the body being rooted and grounded in the word we sustain constant nourishment Jesus is the vine and we are the branches so if he is the vine we should bear the same fruit hallelujah amen if it's showing forth a different kind of fruit that is of the wrong branch that Branch doesn't belong into that Vine so the vine is the life and the branch Bears the fruit right so if we bear fruit other than what is in the True Vine then we are not of the same life that is in the vine yes sir so brother brand says this he says look the same wind was making one moan and one groan was giving the other one a big time and I happen to think well what's this one doing and every time that little tree would twist what would it do it would pull the Roots loosen up the ground that's right loosen it up the ground that's what it's doing so it could grow deeper and get a better hold amen hallelujah hallelujah and every time God sends his blessings upon a born again man or woman it only loosens up the roots to grow deeper higher better Freer and glorify God Lord that's what it's doing that's what the tribulations are doing it's loosening up that ground so you can get rooted so you can get grounded so you can be more established amen amen and he says but I will restore sayeth the Lord that's what the Lord will do when you get a little bit hairy here and there you get a little bit weary here and there there's one that that'll encourage you that's one that's going to prepare the way for you Hallelujah for what did he say to the children of Israel when he spoke through Moses he said do you just stand still watch the salvation of the Lord amen he will restore when we get a little down we get a little hardships here and there he's still there to give us that Comfort he's still there amen he will not leave us he will not forsake us amen he is right there when we're in trouble I think I preached a message here a little while ago he uh about I will meet you there so when we meet the conditions and we call upon his name he's not going to leave us forsaken but he will meet us there all we have to do is utter his name off of our lips but we get so scared sometimes I don't know why a Believer shouldn't be afraid to utter his name prise God through his name there's Deliverance through his name there's salvation through his name there's forgiveness of sins Hallelujah Glory but where does it come in the humility of our hearts amen amen hallelujah not coming to him boastful and prideful amen but the root is the source of life that supplies the branches The Roots need to go downward as we bear fruit upward we've all heard the expression the Way Up Is Down coming in humility yes why else do we bow our heads before him in prayer to show that he is greater than we are we come to him and humility of spirit see we will be rooted in something we just have to decide what we're going to be rooted in yes sir and whether it's going to be good or whether it's going to be evil we're going to make that decision of what we're going to be rooted in it's we are the determining factor of what we're rooted in we make that choice otherwi that's why the rift the the scripture says you reap what you sow right because oh my now let's see what was told Brother brand oh let's go back get into the Rolodex of our memory I think it was because you have chosen the harder way hallelujah hallelujah is that right because he chose the harder way because you have chosen the harder way and not the easier way of the way of the K of the way of King not the way of the world not the way of riches amen that's right but you have decided to root yourself and ground yourself in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah I don't even think I've got off page one yet but that's okay we don't gauge our sermons off of pages do we brother but we love the Lord amen yes sir now see through the scripture and this is where I think people get hung up is I don't think they realize that people are referred to in the scripture as trees yes and that's why serpent seed is so hard for people to understand because they can't view people as trees but that's where it is wonderful people are referred to as trees it's metaphoric yes sir Hallelujah this whole scripture scripture is symbolic but we try to understand it and read it with an an American mind and we try to Hash it out and we try to put everything of our understanding well this has got to fit into my American box you're not going to get the understanding this is an Eastern book that's right right this is an old ancient text it doesn't have all of our popular slang in it you know how many times the the the the words of of the American language or the English have changed the meaning of words yes it's funny because Caleb will try to He he'll come up with some of this slang that is not what that means and some well it might mean that today no it does not mean that I think the word was tripping I think he was using tripping or something no tripping means you're losing [Laughter] it dripping means you done lost your mind you you're going berserk over something silly right that's what I know tripping at so the those the English language has just changed over over the years I think it's because of somebody else's misunderstanding of the word so they wanted to they had the understand oh I think it means this you're far from it it doesn't mean that it means this yes so if you ever go back into the dictionary do anybody ever even look in a dictionary anymore my kids do because they ask how do you spell this well go find a dictionary well how am I supposed to find how to spell it if I don't how can I find it if I can't spell it I guess you're going to have to start from a and go all the way to Z start with what you think at least make an effort to go to the dictionary right but if you go if you if if you've ever gotten into a dictionary and you read some of the the the uh definition of words in there you'll see a little four-letter word in there about root of where that word came from it might be from Ireland it might be from Switzerland it might come from a a Germanic word it might come from a a French word yes sir but I think it all goes back to Latin I think all the languages if I'm not mistaken there might be a few but most of it is based on Latin and it's just changed over the years look at Spanish it's close to English and it's close to Spain but Spain and Mexican Spanish are not the same Italian is not the same as Spanish right but some of the words happen to be the same or you could figure it out why because there's a root behind that word okay I didn't know I was getting into teaching today but a dictionary could be your friend okay so if you don't understand I'm constantly looking at a dictionary you you brother so if you do any kind of study or research you're going to have to bef friend the dictionary be careful because some of them some of them are are a little loose so it's almost like Bible versions where'd you get that definition sorry and this is a side note I can't stand those words when you're trying to go look up a definition well what does it mean to what does sanctify mean oh it means to get Sanctified or uh to reach sanctification guess what you got to go to the root word to find out the meaning see there's something behind Roots eventually we're going to get back to Our Roots I'm going to I'm getting behind are we doing okay this morning so people are referred to as trees so so what do you think our fruits are fruit is our action what we do is considered our fruit so if we are trees what we bear is fruit if we uh uh lose our temper if we get anger that is our fruit if we are happy if we are kind if we have gentleness kindness meekness all these Temperance all these all these things it shows that what fruit we are bearing Hallelujah right it's our action that people see that's the fruit that's what it's talking about in case of you ever wondered what fruit was so that might help you back in the beginning about fruit because if we're going to bear fruit it doesn't mean we're going to Bear apricots it doesn't mean that we're going to Bear apples it doesn't mean that we're going to Bear pears right but it's our actions are the fruits of what it's talking about okay we got that right so doesn't the scripture say as a man thinketh in his heart so is he yes sir so that's going to show what he truly is somebody might do a good deed one time that doesn't mean that they're of God just because somebody does a good deed two times that doesn't mean that they're any closer to God some people just do good deeds okay it doesn't mean that they're Christian it doesn't mean mean that they're lost either right so but if you watch as they continue to Bear the fruit you can't judge a person by one or two actions see we we are people of Second Chances right because we beg and plead and I'm getting into a whole another Parable here so we beg and plead for forgiveness but we have a hard time forgiving somebody else right so when we're when when we're trying to get that we have to be mindful of how because we want the second chance shouldn't we give other people a second chance I might have been on this last time I I can't remember I was all over the place last time I can't remember where I was but Matthew 12 and 33 it says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit Hallelujah we are not what what's a oh don't judge me people are so quick to use that line especially the Christians oh you're not supposed to judge me yes I can because I'm not judging you I'm not casting judgment on you whether you're going to heaven or hell right when you're driving you make a judgment don't you oh you can't judge while you're driving a car Christian wrong judgment right we are able to make those kind of a judgments if somebody steals from a store they are what a thief if somebody kills somebody else for no reason they're a murderer oh we just judge people we made a judgment call according to the fruit that we can call it what it is that's right good good see people want to try to leave that obscured they want to try to leave it so Bleak that you don't call Sin Sin oh let's not be so specific here okay let let's just leave it in the gray area no I'm going to call it what it is we're not going to we're not here to sugar coat we're here to bring people to repentance as much as we can right if you try to sugar coat and tell people oh it's a flowery bed of ease than you're lying that's right right yes I remember one time testifying and I was a new convert and I had no idea brother brandom said this until years later but I got up and I testified you know I have never had this many battles it seemed to be so much easier when I was a sinner I didn't have all these battles and people the world would say well you can change that all you have to do is stop going to church your battles be over wrong I'm not here to compromise brother Jesse is not here to compromise brother amen's not here to compromise right brother van's not here to compromise we're not here to compromise right we're here to stay rooted and grounded and established in faith in Christ we're not here to compromise but we're going to say I'm going to continue on I'm going to even though somebody said this is physically impossible I'm going to pick myself up by my bootstraps and I'm going to continue on Amen yes it's metaphoric anyhow I better get off of that one so we could we know we can tell the the the the type of person that they're going to that they are just by their actions right because it's the fruit that's how we are fruit inspectors if you don't like to use the word I made a judgment call or I can make a judgment of what kind of a person I'm dealing with you could just say Well I'm fruit inspector if if you if you want to if you want to sugarcoat it okay so but I'm I'm not going to be told a lie by these people because they don't want to hear their sin that's right I don't want to back down just because they don't want to hear truth right you know and I'm sorry I'm I don't know why I'm going this way either but I I'm not on board for that non-binary stuff gender neutral stuff uh if if you could do simple algebra okay A plus b is two different variables right apple and an orange or you can call it banana cuz I said B so if you're adding an apple and a banana you have apple and banana it's not unless you're making a a drink apple banana strawberry kiwi stuff like that no it doesn't work you're either male or female okay that's that that's just the way it is nonb non-binary do you understand what that term is they're talking about binary a one or a zero because we're we're saying a binary is it's either a one or a zero that that's that's all the binary system is it's one or the other it's male or female you got two different things there if you add two males and two females you get 2 a and 2 B right you don't get 4 a okay you understand I understand you could do Algebra you could plug any variable in there that you want to I get that but still you cannot mix apple and orange and when they're trying to say that men can men can produce get pregnant I don't think so oh but trans man can well that was a work in science in the medical field not nature you can't tell me that a male by nature is going to get pregnant it's not going to happen it's not going to happen sorry I don't know why we got there but that's you know where I stand I'm not going to sugarcoat it right so I'm just going to call what call it is what it is now can we be nicer about it sure we could be nicer about it and but I don't know why I'm going there so Romans chapter 11 verse 16 it says for if the first fruit be holy now this is going off of Matthew 12 where it says uh either make the tree good and is fruit good or make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt so Romans 11:16 it says for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy right so if one part is Holy the rest is Holy so and if the root uh uh uh the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and vice versa if there's evil in that [Music] fruit the whole lump is evil the whole lump is evil amen so uh Jesus says this in John 15 in chapter 1 sorry it almost feels like there was a damper put on the service and my apologies so but I'm not compromising either so John 15 and verse one Jesus says here he says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband okay every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that he that that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit talking about the pruning we prune a tree so it grows better if it's left unattended it grows wild and then it doesn't produce as much fruit but if it gets prudent if it gets taken care of it grows more fruit and better fruit amen so that you see the importance of tribulations you see the understanding the need for trials and of course we don't want to go through those because it's hardships right we don't want to go through hardships we want everything to go easy you know I asked a question when I'm working can't anything be easy cuz you just run into one snag after another it's something breaks or something something doesn't go in the hole just right you know a bolt strips and can't anything go easy then you get a little bit frustrated but you know that's that's where we need to stand is that we don't get frustrated and that we don't get thrown off course just because those things happen but we stay the course The Anchor Holds though the ship be tattered amen and those though the sails be torn we still maintain our course amen if not then we're not fighting the good fight of Faith amen so uh verse uh verse three says now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself right it has to abide in the vine as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me you can not do the works of God unless God indwells in you amen he says I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into into the fire and they are burnt if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done on un to you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples you want to glorify the father you want to you want to uh uh uh edify him you want to show him uh uh honor you want to do all these nice things for the father he says herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit Glory much fruit not just a not just a little vidle once in a while not just a good deed once in a while right but it's it's an attitude it's a way of life it's the way we live every day we doing okay praise the Lord I know I ask that question a lot I'm told that often but I just want to make sure you're not mad at me no sir I don't know if you would tell me anyways you'd probably I'm not saying anything and that's probably good because it shows that you have a reverence for the sanctuary you know and a reverence for the Lord so so when we talk about Roots uh probably a lot of our minds go back to when when when I mention the word root you might think Green Thumb you know plants and stuff but what about your ancestry so the word also talks about the the ancestry also so when we talk about looking at our ancestries we talk about Tracing Our Our Roots right so somebody might say well what and where are your roots what are you talking about well where are you from well I'm from America if y'all didn't know I was born here in the United States and and uh my roots is [Laughter] mingled so I I have a whole slew of ancestry so they're probably hardly anybody pure bread anymore so when we look at that we typically look uh we we when we're talking about Roots we we typically think about uh what our family is what we're attached to what we value is kind of what we're what we are rooted to so uh so thinking of speaking of genealogies John the Baptist uh he he hammered this right out uh real quick on on those when he was baptizing people in Luke chapter 3 and verse 7 is uh he he cut it off real quick that uh saying that you don't have I'm not even going to give you room to say that you have Abraham as your father you know so uh because each one of us have roots to Adam so It ultimately we all go back to Adam right we all go back to Noah because there were eight Souls saved but then ultimately we go back to Adam right so so who can Glory what nation can Glory oh our blood is better than uh nonsense you know I I just kind of go off of the brace yourself this is a philosophy is people are people I judge people off of character I don't judge people off of nationality you know so character character is what we can uh relate with right that's where we could find common ground is is having character so that's what we want to look at so verse uh verse 7 in Luke 3 he says then said he to the multitude that came forth to to be baptized of him oh Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham amen so it do matter if they had TI of Abraham because they didn't do the works of Abraham as we learn in other in in other areas in the scripture he says this did not Abraham when they were trying to come against Christ the way that that they treated him he said Abraham didn't didn't treat people like this Hallelujah you say you're of Abraham and you're and you want to kill me this isn't the way of Abraham Hallelujah but yet they wanted to hold on to that genealogy of going back to Abraham's seed but they didn't have faith so so there's more to being uh a father Abraham for uh uh than just genealogy you know if you want to find commonality with them then we should bear the same same thing right so amen so in verse n it says and now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth forth or bringeth not forth good fruit is he down and cast into the fire so if you want to uh uh uh uh take something out which we were taught if you if if you want to kill something you cut off its head right so you got to cut it off at the head which is pretty much the the source of of of the body right that's how we function is through our head through through the knowledge so it's it's almost the same as the root because through the brain and the Brain stems that's how we're able to have nerves uh that's how we're able to respond to things that's how we have sight everything flows through the brain right muscle memory so if you want to kill something you get you get to the root which is the head so and and it's the same thing he's saying uh you can kind of look at this saying look I'm done playing around let's lay the axe to the root of the trees let's kill that Fruit by cutting off the root if you're doing evil works you bring forth uhh uh fruits worthy of repentance none of this false repentance stuff you know so so many things are sugarcoated out there and and and a flowery bed of ease that because they're more interested in numbers brother Jesse they're more interested in numbers filling the chairs than quality of people coming to Christ right yes sir so you say that there's false repentance yes I say that there is false repentance yes well how can we determine the difference well the difference would be one I'm not saying that you have to cry but we were warned about a dry-eyed confession if you're just saying oh I'm sorry and then you're you're longing to go back to do the same thing you didn't really repent what is repent mean repent means to stop turn and go the other direction the opposite direction stop doing what you were doing and cut it off at the root stop it turn and bring forth better fruit not just saying oh I'm sorry and not meaning it you know where the where's the genuine you know what I mean where's the genuine heart in that Hallelujah brother's laugh so where is the sincerity oh but I sigh and cry do you really and you can't even make it to the Altar for your own repentance right but you sigh and cry people might say they sigh and cry just so they can find common ground in the scriptures and seem more spiritual than what they actually are you know how the devil works right but repentance means that you have a desire to do it no more and you want that change yes sir hallelujah amen so this is Brother brandom again it's okay to read quotes right so now watch the scriptures let let them testify Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think or believe that you have eternal life and they are the ones that testify me in other words if this tree ever brings forth a branch I am the vine the tree ye are the branches he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also that's very familiar John 4:12 right 14:12 excuse me and uh now he that abideth in me it was he it was that was in my root at the beginning now see if you want to sing Redemption Song you have to be part of him from the beginning in order to be redeemed redeemed means to buy back right or to to come and and bring back so if you weren't part of it from the beginning if you weren't a thought in his mine then you're not going to be brought back right there there's no Redemption because you had to be a part of him amen so if you want to uh uh uh now he that abideth in me he it was that was in my root at at the beginning so that's the reason Jesus was both the root and offspring of David he was before David in David and after davidj both root and Offspring The Morning Star the rose of Sharon the L of the valley Alpha and Omega father son holy ghost in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily both root and Offspring to David okay so he that has elected life he he that is the elected life the predestinated life that's in me talking about Christ and he is the word from the beginning when he comes forth he'll bear my fruits so if we are a part of him we will bear the same fruit amen so but others will live by the same thing calling themselves Christians and Believers not all that saith Lord Lord will enter in amen so even those that claim to be Christians you watch their life they they'll just say that they're just you'll just see that they're just putting a label on their shirt Christian but not doing the works of a Christian right yes let me inspect this fruit a little while yes that doesn't line up that doesn't line up that wo you do that and you say you're a Christian you're doing this that's right brother brother sister I think you need to get to the Altar and really become a Christian if you're going to say that you're a Christian in love of course you we don't want to go prideful we don't want to go with a with a a spirit of uh not condemnation but we don't want to have a condescending attitude you know we're up here and they're down here and and looking down our nose at them you know we want to bring them to the altar you know show them the right way right we want to do everything in love we don't want to do anything out of hate we don't want to do anything out of anger right so we want to do we want everything to be done in decency and in order right so it goes back to the golden rule we wouldn't like it if somebody grabbed us and and we're shaking us you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong and constantly saying you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong you how about giving some hope in there so now this is to take place and be manifested in the last days when the mysteries of God should be finished these trees the True Vine and the false Vine yep there could be both so how they've grown up together brought them in individuals and showed that from Cain and abble the two vines that met at an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them Desiring life both of them coming worshiping the same God and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that the one was that was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the Bible said by faith Hebrews in the 11th chapter by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified that he was righteous Jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say I the son of man am he said pet uh Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God see it's by Revelation amen so like I said just because somebody someone shows good fruit one time two times that doesn't mean that they're of God because in the scripture when Jesus was doing the Miracles what did they say I think it was Nicodemus I could be wrong but somebody in there said how can a man do these do these Works unless he be sent from God was that Nicodemus so they knew that those that the fruit that he was bearing was back to God doing the works of God hallelujah even Jesus said I can only do that but what the father shows me hallelujah amen see going back to John John immediately discarded uh any tie back to Abraham because it doesn't matter to whom we related it doesn't M it doesn't matter if your mommy and daddy went to church for years they grew up in the church it doesn't matter if you grew up in the church it doesn't matter if Grandma Grandpa Aunt Uncle Sally uh uh uh Aunt Sally Uncle Tom whatever uh Uncle Jim uh whatever it doesn't matter who you're related to you have to have your own experience with God you have to bear the fruits you have to make the decisions yes sir amen yes your feet will be held to the fire to make one kind of a decision or the other you cannot sit on the fence of neutrality you have to decide good or evil you have to make that decision of whom you're going to serve even Joshua said choose you this day of who you're going to serve but as far as me in my house we're going to serve the Lord a decision had to be made that's right Joshua declared his decision people had to figure it out with Judas people had to see the fruit because he said he was with Christ but we know what he did we know what his fruit was yes sir see the righteous have no no problem declaring who they're following but it's the other ones that are trying to mask it they have a hard time declaring who they're following you have to find out by their fruit amen amen so Jesus said that he was the True Vine we read that in the scripture and that his father is a husband the husbandman expects good fruit for the heart Harvest and anything not worthwhile is discarded right it's wrapped up burnt burnt in the fire we we read that scripture so he knows the thoughts that he thinks about us thoughts of peace and not evil to give us an expected end right because he has given us the tools to navigate this world but what happens is is we don't take those tools we live under our privileges forgetting we must forget that we are children of God and that we have access to those benefits but oh I don't feel bold today I don't feel that the lord loves me if my children wake up that way then there's something wrong with me because there's they are still my children I am still going to Pro provide food for them I'm still going to provide a house shelter for them I'm going to provide clothes for them no matter if they drive me crazy the night before the morning the next morning I'm still going to love them because they are my children and if we know how to give our children good gifts so much the father knows how to give his children good gifts amen that's right amenu and we could take comfort in that being his children thank you Lord oh I made the Lord mad today he's not some like like those other God Gods back then like dayone and and things like that where they thought oh we've anchored the gods we still have we have a personal relationship with this God this God is our King he is our savior he is our provider he is everything that we need amen but yet we don't reach out and get it why because we want to do something else because we're fighting against this flesh it's always going to be a battle this flesh the carnality against the spirituality it's always going to be a battle it's always going to be there until the time of the Rapture that we're with him amen we're always going to struggle with the flesh so we we okay for a few minutes I I I know I've been going for a little bit so saying that with uh uh uh with the with the tree with the vine if it doesn't produce good fruit if it's not pleasing unto the husband the the husbandman he's going to gather it up and he's going to burn it with fire right so just like the fig tree that Jesus came across and he's he was hungry and he said oh I desire fruit of thee oh you have no fruit I curse you and then the next day right it was withered and the disciples were in awe over that and that's where he gave the teaching wheresoever you speak whatsoever you say you have this you have this ability too if you could just open up that realm if you could just open up your heart to it if you could just humble yourself and get there if you can get yourself out of the way and let him how much more successful we would be as a Christian yes sir but we try to push it so much ourselves well I got to do this I got to do that I got to treat this person such way I got to do this but we're CED about so much like Martha that we're not taking care of the merry things right the things that are needful that's right because we we let the things of the world come in a little too much yes sir yeah sure we desire things we desire a nice car yeah we we want something reliable to get to work and back right so sure we we want those things but when it becomes more important than him that's the problem yes sir that's the problem and did you know that the victory pretty much always represents Israel yes sir so do you understand where this this Parable where this cursing of the Fig Tree is is for a time because they stopped producing the fruit and then he's giving it over to the Gentiles amen now we have a turn but now it's coming full circle to where the Gentiles are not producing the fruit that's desired funny how that cycle works huh but it shouldn't be so if we have the knowledge if we have that understanding then we should be able to protect ourselves right so like I said true repentance is not just a confession but there's a changing when there's a true repentance when John the Baptist said bring forth fruits worthy of repentance he's saying really come and it's more than just a confession but it's a changing of your life when a repentance when a true repentance happens and you wonder well did I really repent did you have a change do I really have the Holy Spirit was there a change yes Hallelujah did something take place and did that thing take root Glory that's right GL because we want it to last not just rejoice in the Lord one time and then trials and tribulations come and then oh it didn't come the way that I expected so this isn't what I was cracked up to be so I can't serve the Lord anymore I had it much better out there I had I had more friends more friends doesn't mean better friends if you want friends a man must show himself friendly if you want friends choose yourself a good friend okay don't choose somebody that's that's that's got issues out of the world to be your best friend to be your your your go-to person when you need counsel you need Godly counsel iron sharpeneth iron right so Believers hang with Believers amen so when we get into those situations when we fall what what do people usually say well the devil made me do it but we can't we we're running out a room to be able to say that we can't say that anymore we can't use that as an excuse because uh James 1 and 14 and 15 it says but every man is tempted every man is tempted with something it's whatever your desire is Malachi's Temptations are going to be different from my Temptations this brother's Temptations are going to be different from my Temptations why because we're different people we have different likes surprise God likes a variety we're all not the same yes that's why when a church comes together and there's peace in the church when you have all these diversity uh uh uh diverse ideas husband wife they have different ideas they're not the same but they have to learn to coexist and in peace right so when you have a body that comes together in unity and can and can dwell and can serve and Worship the Lord in peace that's a wonderful body that you have going on that's where the presence of the Lord is welcome but when there's back bitings and strife and all these things happening the presence of the Lord is is a little bit quiet right right so we want the presence of the Lord because we want access to his benefits right so but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and is enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin so temptation is not sin we have that understanding right temptation is not sin giving over to the Temptation that's where sin lies because every man is tempted but you have a choice you make that decision if you're going to partake of that fruit or you're not amen so but uh uh uh then when lust ha conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished it bringeth forth death which is the wages of sin amen amen so we we see where that lies I'm going to try to wind this down uh give me a few more minutes is that okay sir I think I did the same thing last time I I closed I don't know how many times or I was I was in closing you know as soon as you say I'm closing now the eyes come Wide Awake oh boy he's getting ready to close so I'm going to say that often no I'm kidding I'm not going to do that wake everybody up so playing around I lost my spot so getting to it took me a long time to get to this spot okay we're going to kind of wind down with this thought here is roots when you cut the root you kill the fruit right so when you cut the root of the evil Vine the evil Deeds cease you kill that fruit and the same thing with the good Vine if you cut the good Vine The Good Deeds cease we don't want to cut that vine we want to cut the evil Vine the evil root we want to lay the axe to the root of the evil tree amen yes sir so uh just going to read through this if that's okay so it is vital that you search out to discover the root cause of every problem and this is what I wanted to get to is the root cause of situations the root cause of when people find themselves in sin what is the root cause if it's gambling it's the lust of one of of of the the uh the excitement of the gamble oh I might strike it big I might lose big but strike it a big and that's a terrible investment idea for those young ones out there if you think gambling is a good investment idea it's a terrible investment idea so getting to the root of the cause of what you're doing not just not a false repentance like what I was saying but truly getting to the to the root cause of the problem amen so if you go to counseling for uh a AA alcohol Alcoholics Anonymous if you go to counseling for drug addiction if you go to uh uh counseling for uh pornography addiction if you go to counseling for some kind of an addiction one of the first things that you have to do there that they counsel you on is first you have to recognize that there is a problem yes first you have to be able to humble yourself and recognize I am doing this right you have to say that there is a problem the second thing is you have to have a desire to want to get rid of that thing if there's no if you want to keep doing like that like that man that uh uh uh uh fell across brother bram's uh foot uh because he said I'm going to tear you from limb to limb or rip your head off or he was going to do some kind of violence to him' and and brother Brandon just said nah you'll fall across my feet so when they uh people were asking well should we move him you know should we cast out demon or I I can't remember the the whole story exactly verbatim but uh they were asking questions and he says no it's not going to come out of him there there's no point because he loves that spirit and that spirit's going to stay there because he wanted it to stay there that's right he had a love for that Spirit now see that's the second first you have to recognize that there is a spirit you have to discern that there is an evil spirit there second you have to be willing to get rid of that Spirit third you have to take the steps to take care of that spirit so recognize discern and put into action because if you don't if if you have the desire to want to do something about it but then you don't do anything then that Spirit has a right to stay there yes but until you take a step forward and say I'm sick of you I'm taking the ax and I'm laying it to the root of your fruit your root has no more dominion over me and you cast that thing out see but that's that's where sin still lies in people just because they come with a confession say oh I've done such and such but they are not willing to get it taken care of and we wonder why people are still sick we people we wonder why people are still struggles yes yes sir MH oh we we we'll get there so it is vital to honestly search out to discover the root cause of every problem for example the root cause is not drug addiction it is what is fueling the drug addiction the root cause is not immorality it is the lust resulting in the immoral immoral Behavior see we have to get to the root of it this is where you have to call black black and white white because we're not playing in this spiritual realm yes sir we are not compromising this spiritual realm we are possessing the Gate of our enemy and we have to put it in our mind I am here I am tired of it I am taking my life back I am taking this back I'm taking my joy back I'm taking everything good back I'm tired of you holding me down amen we've got to be sick and tired of being sick and tired amen but we' got to do something about it even the scripture teaches about that teaches us about that when you cast the spirit out then you've got to fill it with righteousness if not that same Spirit once it's swept and garnished out if you don't fill it with something righteous that spirit's going to come back and he's going to bring his friends with him and it's going to be a worse child of Hell than ever yes sir and you think it was hard to cast the first one out W my it's going to be much harder to cast out eight demons yeah then it is one demon yes sir yes sir so when you have these things taken care of you've got to fill it with righteousness you've got to fill it with word you've got to get into the word and suck up the nutrients suck up the water hallelujah amen so you produce the right fruit amen so the Bible commands us to diligently seek and destroy the roots of sinful Behavior amen see Hebrews 12:5 it says looking diligently lest any man f fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many many be defiled Oh you mean my actions can can have an effect on others yes sir your negativity can be contagious to somebody else your positivity can be contagious to somebody elseu it's what we choose our fruit to be it's what we choose to be rooted in because we will bear the fruit of what root we are rooted in I know it's not very deep is it but if you think about it it's more deep than what you think and that's where the problem lies so lest any root of B bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many being many be defiled if the root causes uh if the root causes of problems are not dealt with the problems will only intensify when is Isel invaded the promised land God told them not to allow any of the enemy to remain but the Bible records that Joshua spared Giants in three cities Gaza ashdod and gath Joshua 11: 21- 22 says later the Bible relates that Samson got in trouble in Gaza judges 16 the Ark of God's glory was lost in ashdod 1st Samuel 5 and Goliath paralyzed the troops of Israel in gath 1 Samuel 17 none of these tragedies probably would have occurred had not the Giants been left in the land Israel left a root and it bore fruit and it caused a snag to them later Giants beget Giants in both the natural and the spiritual World eliminate the spiritual Giants of sin and they will no longer reproduce amen deal with the root causes and the surface manifestations will cease as in the natural world so it is in the spiritual cut the root and you will kill the fruit of that root amen so smoking chewing gambling adultery are attributes of sin we understand that right the root is the unbelief which is the lust drugs and alcohol are not the root of an addiction but the lust the desire to have it people act out because of an underlying issue in their childhood that goes back to a root of some hurtful uh act that happened to them years past and it left the scar on them and that's why they behave the way that they do usually in a in a defense people get shut in they they just enclosed and they won't let anybody in why because there's a trust issue why because somebody broke their trust that's why we got to be careful that we don't root up the tears along with the wheat because we could pull up the wheat so that's why we have to tread softly but I'm not saying that we compromise but we tread tread lightly amen we tread with love love amen there was a woman that that brother Brandon told the story about that fell to temptation to the dance hall remember and then she she thought she lost her her salvation why was there why was there a a desire to go to the dance hall because there was something rooted in her she was a dancer and she wasn't fully cut off from that yes so when she walked by hearing that beat whatever beat you want to put in your mind I'm not a musician so I'll just throw out anything but it struck something in her in her spirit that she had common ground with before that wasn't fully cut off and then she wanted to go into the dance hall and she danced because she missed dancing and then she thought she'd lost her salvation no sister you didn't lose your salvation but you need to repent from that thing and stay away from that thing so when we now see I I changed I changed careers here uh last last April May so when I when I meet challenges or when I first met challenges there what do you think I wanted to do I wanted to yeah I wanted to go back to what I knew because I worked in the glass industry for 25 years I I kind of knew that that process pretty well so what I wanted to do is I don't like this I got to go back to the Glass Factory he said stop thinking that you're not going back to the Glass fairy glass no I'm not going to a glass fairy either you're not going back to the Glass Factory you know because I wanted a change from that and I'm not going back there but all the these thoughts come every now and then and it just types the spiritual so much because those those things come into our minds the greatest battle ever thought is the Mind battle right so things come to our minds and oh I got to revert back to the old thing why because it's what you knew it's what you're close more closely associated with because it's scary to move on to something new because we don't know what it's going to hold so what do we do we go right back to our comfort zone to what we knew and that's how people go just like the the seed when it's thrown upon the what was it the Stony ground when the tribulations and and the persecutions come they're not rooted and grounded or it might have been among the Thorns I can't remember I'd have to go back to my notes I wish well no not even going so there's another story that brother brandom talked about that a woman was sick and she went to him for prayer and he pretty much told her you're not going to get healed because you have an underlying you have sin still dwelling why I confessed all that well you still have to make it right to your husband because he discerned that there was adultery well I can't tell him that well long story short he said well rest assured sister he has the same thing to confess to you you know a Sunday school teacher and a deacon so it doesn't matter what position you have that doesn't that doesn't make you immune to to anything right right people can still fall into sin but they couldn't get their healing because there was underlying issue that they confessed but they didn't repent they did they conf they kind of confessed but they didn't confess you know when we do things to hurt one another we're supposed to go to the one that we hurt yes sir yes it's nice that we go to the Lord and apologize Lord I'm so sorry I did that yep we need to apologize for a fruit that we bore that wasn't of his Vine yes but aren't we supposed to go to the one that we hurt and that's where the true repentance comes in some people are just they have a hard time saying that I'm sorry they cannot come and say look I did this yes it's embarrassing it it is humiliating it is it absolutely is but to come before somebody and say I did such and such and I'm sorry well sorry isn't going to fix it no but I'm trying to fix it by apologizing repenting and you know hopefully we can keep a relationship going you know friends friendship or marriage whatever it is it's hard it is absolutely hard because you might lose everything that you knew just by coming but you'll be delivered you'll be free you'll be free in the Lord so don't hold on to things don't have that root of bitterness in you because it's going to tear you up and it's going to hinder you from receiving from the Lord amen I'll just go to close with a couple of these these here I know that that's what three has anybody been keeping track that it wasn't three I forgot no so Samson had that same issue is that he couldn't come he couldn't give the Lord his heart we know we understand that he gave the Lord his strength so that's all he could use but when the time came that mattered for him to stand strong he got weak and fell amen so because he let his guard down we cannot let our guard down we cannot let the bars down right we cannot compromise on the word yes sir we cannot compromise our position position we cannot compromise our relationship with the Lord so I talked about riches that was one of the the the seeds that fell upon the ground and the the deceitfulness of of riches right uh so it's not so much that a rich person I me I mean a person can have money but it's the love of money that is the root of all evil it's not money that's the root of all evil it's the love of money right that's 1 Timothy 610 it says For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many many Sorrows because they they had a love of money and how many's thinking of Judas how many think how many is thinking of Joseph when his brother with his brother sold him into slavery for 20 pieces of silver Judas the fruit shows when he sold out Jesus for 30 pieces of silver m yes because it was the love of money right and and jealousy gets in way jealousy is a root that needs weeded out ananas and Safa huh they they held back money when they sold their their property or whatever they they yeah they sold their property and they held back a portion of the sum and then they told the disciples oh we sold the property for only this much money and I think it was Peter he says why have you let who Satan enter into thine heart to do this thing yeah see you see the fruit right there it was it was called out black was called black and white was called White that that that the problem was rooted out right there why have you let Satan into your heart to do this yes sir so that goes back the devil made me do it no because we are making a conscious decision on many things we we could we're being influenced but it h now there has been a time before that that I I could say that something had a power over me but I can't say that every time I do something wrong that the devil made me do it right I can't say that so so jealousy John 12 911 and you can stand to your feet with me I'm going to close with these couple scriptures here so much of the much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there talking we spoke on this the last time about the alabaster box so this is the setting here so much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead see they were more interested in the Miracles that had happened than the one that was able to give salvation the one that is the root of all those Miracles so verse 10 it says but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus see he was the jealousy that uh that that they were calling people away from from them it wasn't as lucrative anymore they weren't able to con the people anymore because these people went to Jesus amen they found something better amen somebody was a little bit more popular than them so they got upset and they wanted to kill them right so and that's hate to give back to Hollywood but that's how Hollywood is it's a Cutthroat business over there I don't know if people are killing one another just to get parts I'm not I'm not saying that but but people trying to uh uh they're gunning for different positions they will put people down they will kill somebody's influence which is almost the same as killing a man and it's that's that's what it's meant by a Cutthroat uh situation uh it's it's a very competitive environment that people will chop one another down just to just to get that higher seat that promotion you know or whatever it is or something better so and unfortunately we have that in church ranks you know I'm not I'm not saying here I'm not saying in the home church but we've we've heard stories of different different uh uh uh uh places you know I think we've yeah so if you if you've seen stuff like that people uh trying to get to the higher position and they're cutting down anybody that they can in their in their way so we don't want that you know we don't want jealousy you know weep with them with that weep but Rejoice with them that rejoice sometimes that's a hard thing you know sharing in somebody else rejoicing uh sometimes that hard because the root of bitterness will come in or the root of jealousy will come in and it'll destroy that if you're not careful so uh uh we also learned because of uh getting to the root of a problem is because of the hardness of hearts in Matthew 19-7 it says they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so he said because of the hardness of your hearts because you're cold-hearted that's why you want the writing of divorcement because you want out of this thing you want something different you might have found something better than you want out of the relationship forgetting that you said vows that's right that you promis to stay with one another amen and what happens is is in those situations selfishness comes in and Pride because the other can't humble themselves enough to to accept the other person's explanation or or or trying to make something right yeah that kind of goes both ways doesn't it somebody trying to make something right and then somebody that won't let you make something right because of because they're coldhearted they cannot receive it so and you know uh the disciples tried to cast out a demon and they came uh so the Lord the Lord Jesus came and he cast out that demon so they ask a question Lord why couldn't we cast out that demon he says uh because of your unbelief for one so there's a root right there which we understand that because you know smoke and drink and all those things aren't sin but it's the attribute of sin we people do those things because they don't believe so because of your unbelief you were not able to cast that demon out and he says this kind and we know every seed shall produce after it its own kind right so this kind talking about a a demonic Spirit he said this kind cannot come out except by prayer and fasting so I ask you how how sincere are we in our relationship with the Lord are we are we sincere yeah you came to church this morning what was the purpose you came to church don't answer me answer yourself what was the purpose that you came to church I'm hoping that it was because you wanted to come and sing songs of Zion Sing Sing worship songs unto the Lord coming and fellowshipping with with Believers coming and wanting to hear the word hopefully your desire was to get closer to the Lord hallelu but you might find yourself that you can't get closer to the Lord and you're wondering why you know I prayed for a couple people and I this was that brother cams uh years ago I can't remember if I told this story here or not so forgive me if I repeated it so I remember praying for a sister one time and and uh brother Carle was with me I want to say it was brother Steven and we went to pray pray for this sister and uh I started praying she you know she came up for prayer we started praying and and uh it just felt like a whole wall came up and I and it was kind of weird that uh you know this was something strange that I had never experienced before but I I figured it was the Lord so I told her I said sister I'm sorry but I can't I can't get anywhere in in prayer I said I'll I'll pray with you for a few minutes and uh you know to see if the Lord will open up but it just feels like there's a wall and uh it just feels like that there's no access and uh so I was just with her brother Steve and I were with her and you know just talking to the Lord and that all you know it seemed like maybe five minutes 10 minutes it could have been a half hour for all I know I had I had no concept of time and just all of a sudden uh it was like that curtain came up I said well sister I don't know I don't know if you made something right I don't know what happen but all I know is that curtain is lifted I said now let's enter into prayer for your need and uh so there was a brother uh the same service it was like the same situation I went and I I I started praying for him and uh I told him I said brother just seems like there's a wall there that I can't I can't get through there and uh and I think I remember something I started saying if if you want if you want to receive something from the Lord then uh if you're afraid that you're not going to receive receive it you might as well go sit down because you're not going to get anything it was something to that that effect and I prayed with him about the same as his sister and that curtain lifted I said okay brother let's go let's enter into into prayer now I'm not telling you this to try to sound like I'm super spiritual that that was just something strange happened to me and then it happened at at the home Church another time and this was years later and uh and I explained it to the church and there was a brother that came up uh after that he said uh brother I've been it feels like I'm I'm not able to get anything from the it just feels like that there's that curtain there that I can't get access there and come to find out he had an argument with his wife and he he went and he apologized to his wife and he came back he said and uh I told him I said it just I didn't know this until after he told me uh I said brother it just seems like there's a a it seems like that curtain is lifted I said now we can enter into prayer so I want to the reason why I'm telling you this is because there's a a root there's there's an underlying issue a lot of times of why you can't receive from God you know the we've known we've known people to say that if I don't receive my healing I'm not going to serve god well that is not the right attitude the right attitude would be whether he heals me or not whether he sends me to hell or whatever I still want to to praise him I still want to serve him that should be our attitude so if we have an underlying issue in our hearts and you have to look and you have to look deep and you have to be honest if you're not honest with yourself who are you going to be honest with that's right you have to search yourself yes you have to search and you have to see if there's something in the way only you are going to know that so I don't know where it went but there was a quote that I want to read if if if you give me a couple more minutes here yes sir and the uncomfortable silence is it uncomfortable I don't know where it went maybe the Lord doesn't want me to read it but oh here it is this is out a question and answers in 64 he says when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let one of them live if it's a cute little baby a little amalaki or Amorite kill it okay he says you remember he'll grow up to be an amalaki he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back uh like that disagreeing with the word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what what denomination it belongs to he says you say and I'm going to say I don't care what message Church it belongs to if it's against the word it's against the word and you stay away from it right so uh just like we said uh earlier that all those that say Lord Lord you know he's going to say I never knew you you know so we can't just say that oh I'm a Christian I I should receive anything it's it's not always so so we want to make sure that we are genuine that we are real that we are honest that we are sincere within ourselves okay so we have to make sure that all all that unconfessed sin that there is nothing there if you want to receive from the Lord you've got to make sure that there's nothing that there's no root of bitterness there's uh there's no uh uh Love of Money there's no uh love of lust you know different things like that so whatever it is that you see the greatest desire that you combat that you battle with all the time you have to be honest with yourself did I really confess this do I have to go make it right with somebody else am I accepting things that are against the word of God am I getting into those am I allowing that in my life these are the types of things that we have to be honest with and he goes on to say you say Well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they are contrary to that word get that thing out of you it's a growing little amalaki looks cute looks innocent it looks like it's it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it well brother brandom I go down here because well I don't you just remember any amalekite anything that denies the word stay away from it amen have nothing to do with it at all how many believes that to be the truth he says sure it is see stay away from it if it's trying to pull you away from the Lord if it's trying to pull you away from the word you've got to cut it off at the root does it mean you're going to lose a friend friendship probably at the time you know when I gave my heart to the Lord I lost friendships but over the years I also gained respect and those friendships back because they saw that it wasn't something something it wasn't a phase that I was going through but they saw that it was an actual way of life that I lived my lifeall they saw something they probably everybody was expecting me to fail as they've seen so many people do before well I started going to church and then a couple years later you know and that's a problem in the church is when you're trying to get numbers instead of souls amen so what Ro what Roots do you need to let dig and what Roots do we need to cut so if you bow your heads I'd like to read this scripture here in Jeremiah 17 says thus sayith the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth in a man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the Lord for he shall be like the the heath in the desert and shall not see what excuse me and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be a tree planted By the Waters and that spread out her Roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her Leaf shall be green so no matter what trials no matter how hard it gets we our leaves will still be green because we are rooted into the water amen and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings let's look to the Lord in prayer most gracious Heavenly Father Giver of Life Giver of every good gift Lord as we've been here speaking this morning sorry that it's been so long but Lord just thank you for the word that you've given us we thank you for the spirit that's been here Lord we've we've laughed we've enjoyed hearing the the the word we've uh we've been here here today but Lord we don't want it to just be like any other service sometimes it becomes common when we come to service Sunday two times on Sunday come to service on Wednesday and it seems to repeat week after week but Lord may we not take that for granted just because we're in service it seems to repeat we have singing at the uh at the beginning we have prayer we we have preaching we have more singing and it just seems like a repeated thing over and over where some people would just grow weary from the same thing over and over but father I pray that it would not be so with this body of Believers here that they would not grow weary of waiting for your return that they would not grow weary coming to church service after service singing the songs of praise and and giving you glory and giving you worship because Lord if they're tired of it here they will not they will not like it over there when we're constantly giving you praise when we were constantly giving you worship where we were constantly speaking your name whatever it might be Lord father I pray that you would strengthen the hearts of the your people here today Lord if there's any underlying problems if there's unconfessed sin I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that it would be brought out today that it would hinder the people no longer that they would be set free today that they can come and receive from the spirit today that they can come and receive from you as it said uh receiving from your spirit that we wouldn't Harden our hearts oh God that we when we hear your word that we would not Harden our hearts but Lord that we would open our hearts to receive more of you to be rooted that we would be grounded that we'd be established more in you oh Father receiving more and more Revelation having a better character that you would be pleased with having a better a closer relationship with you being renewed in your spirit being revived in our spirit being renewed in our Christian walk help us today Lord to shed those things the the weight that this so easily beset us but father help this day to be a mark in our lives that we just say I forget the things in the past I want to start things a new because even even the breth in the scripture said that I renew myself my mind is renewed day by day and we understand that your mercies are new every day oh God so Lord what happened yesterday what happened last week whatever happened last month whatever happened last year 5 years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago whatever it might be I just want to put an end to that right now I don't want the accuser of the Brethren coming bothering me with it anymore but Lord I want to confess these things right now before you I want a true repentance to come before you oh God that I that any person here that they could be delivered that there would be nothing hindering them in their lives whether it's sickness whether it's a despair whether it's a sorrow whether it's uh uh not being able to understand your word whatever the the situation might be Lord I pray that you would move upon the person today that they can have that Deliverance oh Father Lord whether it's a struggle in in in in the in the adult entertainment whatever it might be father we just pray that you would give that Deliverance today as we search our hearts truly today for Lord you your you yourself even said that if we want to come and worship you we must come worship you in spirit and in truth truth means that there is no lie within us truth means that there is no deceit with within us truth means that there is no Gile within us truth means that there's that that there's no root of bitterness in us then uh uh and truth that means that there is no grudge amongst us oh God and I just pray that we just want to bring that to the altar not to pick it up again but we want to lay it before you oh God believing trusting and thanking you for a work already done we ask in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ may your blessings be upon our brothers and sisters amen and amen amen praise the Lord y'all all okay I just had to ask one more time before we left
