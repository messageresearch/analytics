prepared a little sermon you know it's very similar to the ones we did in 2018 when we did the july outreach so uh just introducing the message and brother branham and the bible and all that so we'll see if anyone comes tonight just let's just pray for that though if the lord be willing i looked it up last time we sent uh 2 000 or 2 500 cards out you know so this time we went 5 000 so we'll see you know we know there's going to be less and less people you know the pyramid gets smaller and smaller few there be that find it but again i just i feel led to do that you know there's numerous scriptures and uh quotes you know where we're accountable to the city that we live in uh we're called for this city we god called us to minister to this city so that's what we're to do by god's grace and give everybody a chance who wants to hear it uh to hear it it's like you've heard brother brooks say over the years you know you're never going to catch a fish unless you go fishing so we're just trying to go fishing by god's grayson and catch some fish so let's pray for our three miracles we're praying for brother benjamin vu simon pratt vivian pratt and just announcements next weekend my

know we'll get a guest minister brother keith randolph sends his greetings and i would i would call brother keith if the church doesn't want to go i'd probably call him and see if he can minister that

to continue on this series kind of relates to the you know the 3 pm outreach service if anybody comes but i just kind of felt led to go back to colossians chapter 1. we'll start at verse 1 kind of rehearse a little bit last time we preached on this sister betsy and brother dustin were here so it's been a little take a little break from that but i want to move into that this morning by the grace of the lord colossians chapter one this is part two of course colossians chapter one lord willing we're going to try to get down to verse 14. last time we preached through one to six and then i kind of ended with uh 9 through 11. so lord willing we'll try to see if we can get through 14 this morning by god's grace colossians chapter 1 verse 1. and perhaps it'd be pleasing to the lord why don't i read uh verses one to five and then we'll all read six and seven together so let me read one through five and everybody can join me on six and seven paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colossae grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying for you i'm sorry praying always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day he heard it and knew the grace of god in truth i'm sorry let's read seven and eight together okay let's read seven eight together ready one two three and as he also learned of ephraphus our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit amen let's have a word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make a known unto god we're so happy that we can praise the lord aren't you glad church you can raise your hands and clap and hallelujah and sing and you you have your place to do it praise god there's nothing going to take your place hallelujah what a blessing let's pray today heavenly father we thank you lord hallelujah that we can clap and we can sing and we can take our position in the house of god today nothing's going to take our place lord god lord as you told those pharisees if the people would stop crying out even the rocks would cry out hallelujah in other words lord your creation is going to praise you hallelujah and lord we're your creation we're your your blood bought sons and daughters of god hallelujah translated into the kingdom of jesus christ so thank you god for your adopting us into your family lord and we're here to give you thanks and praise and we ask that the holy spirit god would move upon us lord god move in a great way as i was listening yesterday the hand of the lord came upon ezekiel so lord may your hand come upon us oh god hallelujah may your presence come upon us lord god and move us to do your will move us lord into the position of the holy spirit for our lives lord god we have need of you today lord god we're not gathered here in vain but there's a purpose lord god and lord it's important that lord that we're listening to the word of god so help us lord he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says lord may we have ears to hear today father hallelujah and may you be with those that we don't see lord vain's family and naomi's family god may you minister to every need lord god be with your people lord god we just ask the holy spirit lord to meet all those needs of those here and those that are not here lord god also minister to those on the live stream lord we know you're going to take your word and it's going to it's gonna find its position lord god so we pray god you ministered each and every need especially those here in this divine presence in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god glory okay so i have uh some some slides we want to show to show the notes here looking at colossians part 2 book of colossians part 2. like i said it'll kind of relate you know to the outreach and things as we we believe in doing outreach and i got my date wrong i was going to preach this march 6. i forgot to change that that was quite a while ago but then i just felt kind of compelled to go on the doctrine of devils series and we may get back to that lord willing it's a 20th okay so i hope that was a help last week you know as we looked at rapturing faith how many believe rapturing faiths in heaven praise god it's going to come down into you now there's another aspect of it where the ability to receive it is already in you it's part of the seed it's part of the calling of god god's purpose for your life praise god brother ram said like a seed like a like an acorn seed everything it has need of is already inside of it right everything it's going to be is already inside of it so if we're going to live and be a part of the rapture if we're going to miss death it's already inside of us praise god it's god's purpose for our lives and so we just got to water the seed right we got to water it the bible says it's got to be planted watered but god gives the increase amen god's going to direct our lives you know as he has been for a wonderful way now i just want to briefly i guess i'll go really quick through this uh try to keep it about an hour because i i kind of need to study in between services for that second service in case somebody comes you know uh i didn't get all the notes done that i like to i'll just give you a just real brief preview i kind of uh i kind of got this i just kind of put our picture on there um just defining what an expo is an expo is a verbal uh explanation of the message and so i have some scriptures on here you know daniel and how we're in the end times and uh you know the mysteries are actually there in plain sight you know they're actually laying right in the bible so uh and then i go through the 12 new testament mysteries uh and then i get into brother brahms you know ministry just the every every part of his ministry that was so powerful this is why we know he was a true servant of god right but i want to add some more of those testimonies i want to add some video testimonies in here in case we get visitors and then just how we enjoy the fellowship of the mystery the bible says we enjoy the intimacy of the mystery so we see that in our daily lives right we see god doing miracles answering our prayers we see the love of god in our family we see the love of god in our local church so i'd like to spend a little more time on that so i know everybody loves me here and so you'll be patient with me i just you know as i said i feel a burden to you know reach out to akron i have some quotes on that as well by god's grace so so just reviewing remember real quick the reason i feel compelled the holy spirit to go over the book of colossians because brother brahms vision he was asked if he'd be judged and he said he asked what about paul will paul be judged as a leader and he said yes and he said well i preached the same word so in other in other words the the epistles of paul are what we must know and understand now church you'd be surprised a lot of people don't even know what the bible says yet they're in the yet they're in the message right so we know there's a balance you have to uh you have to read the bible you also have to listen to brother branham but you also have to pray amen you have to do at least those three things praise god and if you're imbalanced in one of them then your life is going to show it praise god because that's why god sent the voice of the the seventh angel right he sent a messenger we need to hear the voice but we must also read the bible and we must also pray hallelujah and so millions were resting on that millions were resting that brother branham preached what paul preached praise god because we're all going to be judged by what paul preached each and every person because paul's revelation from jesus christ is the judgment standard anyone that adds to it anyone that takes away is cursed according to paul uh okay now we're gonna and then this this quote just meant a lot to me from souls that are in prison now but uh thus saith the lord he said malachi the fourth chapter has to come someone's gonna rise up and fulfill that praise god and he said what is it gonna do what is turning of the hearts it's turning our hearts back to the doctrine of the fathers right the commandments of the fathers back to the bible praise god and so he says out of denominational differences and come back to the bible back to god so church when you read your bible you're getting closer oops sorry you're getting closer to god amen and the church said amen praise god i want to hold on to that real thought real hard real solid today amen see when you so in other words when you read your bible when you're reading listen brother branham praying you're drawing closer to god amen you have that remember brother man said you want to get close closer to god you want to grow in the love of god read your bible and pray amen hallelujah so it's a he said it's a great time what a great time we're living in how many you're thankful to live in this time amen now just real briefly the book is just divided up into four sections the greeting and thanksgiving lord willing we'll get through the first part today and then we'll start lord willing next time looking at the uh the godhead and i've already preached four sermons on that so this will tie kind of closely in with that i kind of stopped that series uh there's a couple more mysteries i need to preach i need to preach the seventh mystery and i never finished the first mystery of the godhead i think i preached through all of them if i'm not mistaken uh preached that to the saints here so um again remember colossae was that is that pile of dirt right there it's a pile of dirt it's 12 miles from laodicea 12 miles very far uh and it's it's it's unexcavated today uh so here that's the map of turkey so there's laodicea and colossi is 12 miles that way there's ephesus so paul of course you know spent a lot of his missionary work there in turkey and the thought that really blessed me was the fact that god sent colossi the message and they only had 10 years to receive it they only only had 10 years to put it into practice but god thought so much of it that he still sent the message there praise god in other words wherever there is in other words wherever there is predestinated seed god's word is going to get there praise god uh you know there's a there's a few examples i'll share just come to my mind there was a brother um in brother brother brooks's ministry who was healed of aids he had aids they prayed for him he was healed but then he died of something else just a year after that and think about that you know god sent the message he got healed he got healed of aids but then he only had a year to live on this earth to me that's the mercy of god because god knew this was the best time for him to go and look god allowed him all those years to kind of maybe fight against the message but then he got the healing he got the revelation right before it was time for him to go praise god just beautiful just god is the one who knows god has a set time for us to be here a set time for us to go praise god now church you've got to be grateful some of you are rather vague we've already had two decades to serve god in this message amen sister beatrice had 40 years in this message praise god 40 years where others may only get one year two years three years uh brother cam they had a death at their church a few months ago uh the brother just got baptized within that year within that year his brother uh brother craig's mother's second husband uh he was there the last time i preached at camps he was there he was in the back saying amen you know he had just been baptized maybe a year before and then he died and just think of that you know god all those years 60 years we'll say he was there he was there but then god had a certain time in a certain place for in other words he he didn't receive what brother craig his you know his what his his wife's son was preaching he didn't receive it all those years to that last year hey my goodness amen the church just hang on amen just hang on for your family members hang on for your friends amen just hang on god's got a a purpose in doing everything remember god is church god is striving with man god is wrestling hallelujah god is wrestling with our loved ones amen he's constantly knocking at their hearts door he's just have confidence in god amen just trust god amen god will bring it to pass hallelujah god will do god will save all those who want to be saved amen so they had less than less than a decade after receiving the letter to manifest christ or to continue to grow in christ now church this means they didn't even hear the book of revelation praise god they had the holy ghost as paul said they had christ in you the hope of glory and they but they didn't have the book of revelation praise god in other words god god ordains how much revelation you're going to receive god ordains how much you're going to hear how much you're going to receive so we ought to say thank you lord i've received all this and lord the bible says to whom much is given much is required amen so may god help us amen to meet the requirement that he has for us amen hallelujah too much that's why we do that's why we do the youtube ministry the podcast that's why we send the postcards much has been given to us amen so much will be required of us hallelujah amen now we looked at the city i'm not going to spend more time on that but remember uh colossae and uh laocia they never saw paul's face let's read that so just to see you got that colossians 2 verse 1. i'd like you to see that as well it's because we'll be referencing numerous scriptures colossians 2 verse 1. for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you praise god and for them at laodicea and for as many have have not seen my face in the flesh so paul had a great burden for the saints even though he never visited them even though he never saw them paul had a great burden for them how many got a burden for the message churches i do that's why we want to get the truth out there praise god that's why if other churches won't answer questions we want to answer the questions because there's there's people sitting in all kinds of churches that have questions and a lot of preachers are afraid to answer them i've heard numerous preachers say they don't have time to answer them that's you ought to make time to answer them praise god you ought to make time and let me just remind you that quote since i got it i think i got a quote down here i'd like to show about that we ought to make time remember this quote from who is this melchizedek now let's go down here talk about the godhead a baptist minor a few weeks ago came up to my house and said i'd like to straighten you out on the god god had some time when you got time well let's see did brother abraham have time to be corrected or not they come to his house now church today it's not so much come to your house it comes to your phone you got time i get them all the time you got time to be corrected and this guy come knocking on his door i'm starting no i'm sorry called me up rather called him up so yeah so now it is like the cell phone i said i got time right now amen because i want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it so see preachers or people that won't answer the question something's wrong because brother branham had time to answer and the bible says if we've got truth what are we afraid of we should have not we have nothing to be afraid of if we got the truth that we should be able to stand on it praise god like you heard that quote if i've got gold i'm not afraid to melt it down because i know it's only going to drive more dross out of it praise god it's only going to make it more solid hallelujah he says and in other words we lay aside everything else to do it do you remember this one from the fist seal this one come to my heart this morning brother brown's testimony about going beyond the curtain of time which we just referenced was put in a magazine and a minister wrote him and said brother branham your vision sounded really scriptural until you talked about a horse being there a horse in heaven he said heaven was made for being human beings not horses so brother ram took the time to write the brother back now writing a letter takes a lot more time how many can say amen to that you we can text and i can get back to you in 10 seconds now writing a letter put in the mail that's a different thing he said well i sat down so he had to personally set down to correct the brother see he didn't say i don't have time for these people he made time right because he has the love of god in his heart that's the thing if you have the love of god in your heart you want to answer questions now the bible says there's some foolish and unlearned question the holy ghost will direct us when there's foolish and unlearned and we can we can avoid those but when it's an honest question we should lay aside everything now not your children not feeding your children and taking care of your children now not laying aside your job you go to work but get to it after work brother bram didn't have a job right as far as a job outside the preaching so you can lay aside everything and do it so brother brandon said i wrote he said i put a letter right there and said my precious brother i'm surprised at your wisdom and not knowing the scripture i did not say i was in heaven i always said i was in a place like paradise because christ was still above see but i said if it might satisfy you turn over to revelation 19 when jesus comes out of the heavens of heaven he's riding a white horse and all the saints are with him riding on white hot white horses he said absolutely right he said and up in that place there's one that looked like an eagle ox he says why where's them horses that come god elijah amen he just goes to show you the human mind just wants something to pick on that's right so here's two examples a trinitarian and someone that's questioning brother branham's vision brother branham made time to correct them praise god see because if you've got the truth you're not afraid of questions do you remember i mean how many how many have listened to brother on the questions and answer sermons many times he says he says many times it's hard thing to take questions so like when we do our 3 p.m bible studies it's a hard thing it ain't always a easy thing because i don't have all the answers right only god does but i want to i that's why i like the youtube that i can train myself to take questions right the bible says be instant in season and out of season praise god how many how many know that by god's grace see it's training me to do that i wasn't at first able to do that but now by the holy spirit i consider i can take any question from anybody and i just want to be able to say if i don't know i don't know but if i know i want to tell you where it is in the bible so see these churches never saw paul's face but paul was still burdened for them and uh here epiphanous we'll get to him in a moment he's the one that established the church now let's go to colossians 4 12 though in 13 because of course we won't be preaching on that text here today lord willing in the future but let's read verses 12 and 13. of course paul is ending the letter here and he says in verse 12 4 verse 12 epiphus who is one of you now look it looks like epiphany was from colossae that's what it looks like he's one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always laboring fervent for you in prayers and that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god so again the greatest prayers you can pray for one another lord i pray for vang i pray for brother amen i pray for brother austin i pray for brother jose i pray for my brothers my prayer our prayers should be that you'll stand doing the perfect will of god amen amen like david did the will of god for his generation praise god he fulfilled all the will of god for his generation because church if you get outside the will of god you become like jonah you become like balaam praise god like lot you become like that when you get out of the perfect will of god lot should not have pitched his tent toward sodom because sodom led to the death of his wife and children and son-in-laws see so there was a better option for lot he chose the permissive will of god yeah they had to separate from abraham but he should not have chosen the worldly worldly approach amen and may god help us in all of our decisions not to choose anything worldly amen if we're going to decide on one side or another let's sign on separation and holiness amen we gotta have jobs you gotta do that but in other words if you have a choice between being around more worldly things or godly things then go take the way with the lord's despised view amen learn remember jesus remember god's wife amen remember that in other words remember those uh that were foolish virgin at one time but then fell away right remember that kind of life that gets connected to the world remember that and avoid that praise god like like james said stay unspotted from the world amen amen keep the world's dirty spots off you praise god i don't know did you see the dirty spot that fell on the uh uh or that came out of disney this week disney put out a movie last week did you see that well i got little first graders right so the kids come up and say i always i always ask them monday what's the best part of your weekend and they'll say like you know playing or uh you know but last last monday it was like oh we saw the disney movie i'm like oh okay did you like it some of them like yeah one of the guys uh one of the little boys his dad's a song in a church and he said we watch it my dad shut it off right away i was like oh well anyways i went online and of course i would never watch those movies but i listened to a preacher who did watch it now see he's not a message preacher but again but the movie was called turning red and it's about a young a young girl who enters into puberty and she starts going through her cycles and that's something disney's doing in the videos about that and in that uh i guess there's two cases in that in this children's cartoon just came out there's two there's two instances where she contacts her dead relatives with satanic with satanic uh seances and uh the whole point of the movie is to show as she enters into puberty and starts having changes in her body in her life she's allowed to sin and do whatever she wants she can be like an animal because that's her that's she's being she has her own truth and they talk in the this in this kids video they talk about strippers she becomes thinks about becoming a stripper this is disney right now church all you gotta fast forward is 20 years remember when they put out i watched the lad and you know 30 years ago whatever they that jasmine's half naked in there now they might not have said stripper but she was basically stripped remember ariel and the little mermaid she's basically stripper that's basically what she is right so none of them are good amen none of those are good and you'd be surprised how many message people there's a brother in canada he let me know he and i were sending messages he's a canadian preacher he said you'd be surprised how many message people what let their kids watch disney because brother ram used walt disney as one of his illustrations it's called the key to the door he said he said walt disney now brother man wasn't saying disney was okay he's just using him he said he was he was he was so poor in his garage remember he saw that little mouse he thought i'll make a cartoon about a mouse and that's where i got mickey mouse from brother i was just showing how different inspiration comes to people he wasn't saying disney's good but message people some of them are so carnal they'll take that quote and they'll say it's okay for us to watch disney and church they'll set their kids in front of that walk away and look what they're getting fed they're getting programmed by satan amen but you and i on a if we're going to put put our kids in front of something it ought to be the word of god amen i mean they're going to grow up they're going to have tablets they're going to have phones all these things but if you give them something give them the word of god only praise god because look look look look where it's at right now praise god so in other words it's okay to be a beast is what they're saying it's okay to be beastly which the bible says without the holy ghost the bible says they're natural brute beasts amen and this is the world right and this is what people love this is what uh so i thought thank for that little boy his dad's a song leader i said well he's got some good discernment there but i'll tell you he's actually lacking a little bit to even trust disney to come into his home like you got the disney app you better delete it off your phone praise god now i wouldn't expect our church to have that but if you do delete it amen it's only going to steer you towards hell because that's what that's what comes out of it now uh more on the background there they had many uh many nationalities praise god in the church of colossae at least uh uh at least three or four there and then uh eprefus's job was to inform paul of their faith now i forgot to put that in there he was also saying what great faith they have but then also talking about some of the heresies that it entered into the church and so the letter was to encourage them but also to correct them now remember i closed remember i closed with these you know and we were closing there and and imagine if you were praying for a people what five things would you pray for you'd pray for brother jesse you pray for me right let brother jesse have be filled with the knowledge of god's will to know what god wants done to have all wisdom and spiritual understanding right that's what i pray for you too may brother vang walk worthy unto all pleasing may our brothers here be fruitful in every good work do you know that church every work that you do there's going to be fruit to it whether if you help the poor whether you uh give somebody money or lend somebody money hopefully give it away try out the land jesus said try not to he said give it away and don't don't don't ask for a bag don't don't hope you get it back in everything you do for others there's going to be fruit that comes out of it praise god amen and then we want to see we want to see good fruit not corrupt fruit praise god our prayers should be help our sisters to increase in the knowledge of god help them to know more about god help our church to be strengthened with god's might that's that's what we what we should pray for the bible says the paul says this is what i'm going to pray unceasing how many need more strength throughout the week my hands up too i need more strength i'll tell you about this week by friday i was about ready to pass out i was so tired all the work in late summer we had late service on wednesday good service but my boy tired and when i woke up at 4 20 on one of the mornings couldn't go back to bed well i'm just going to go through the day with only four hours of sleep or five hours of sleep you know just can't go to sleep i don't know what why not you know but praying for you to have all might of god's strength according to his power so that euger so that you have all patience all the patience you need for your spiritual journey that's what paul prayed for amen hallelujah and also that you'll have all the long suffering you need praise god and all joyfulness you'll suffer a long time with joy oh man my goodness that's real christianity praise god amen that's what we ended with uh last time now if you've got your bibles colossians one let's read verses five and six i'm going to read that again i want to make some thoughts or some statements on this for the hope which is laid up so they heard of the hope which is laid up for you for the colossians in heaven where's your hope at church it's in heaven praise god we'll get to that in a moment your hope is in heaven where have ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel so the gospel the good news told them that their hope is in heaven hallelujah verse 6 which has come unto you the gospels come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day that you heard it amen and knew the grace of god and truth hallelujah so church let me say like this since the very day you heard the gospel of jesus christ it is producing wonderful fruit in your life praise god amen the very day that you heard it amen the gospel has such an impact on you praise god the bible is supposed to have such a uh overwhelming influence on you hallelujah you should be so influenced that the very day you heard it it should impact you and people should be affected by the love of god in your heart praise god amen from the first day see so when you have faith when you receive the anointing of faith on the statue of man from that moment it's instantly producing fruit in your life now we're going to talk about fruit with the four kinds of grounds in just a moment here because there's different kinds of fruit there's fruit before you're born again and there's fruit after you're born again and the church said don't be afraid to say amen because i got a scripture for it john the baptist said bring forth fruits worthy of what repentance you're first so the very first thing you do repent there's fruit to that amen in other words church there's fruit all the way from justification to sanctification but then there's a special kind of fruit that's a fruit when you're born again of the holy spirit praise god amen that's why church we can say there are some fruits the wise virgin i'm sorry the foolish version will have but it won't be the full fruit of the spirit like the wise virgin has all right that's a little deeper concept that's a little deeper that's what our next podcast is about too so we try to go pretty deep on that one amen i'm still working on i'm about halfway through editing it it takes me a little which one hour one hour at a time praise god now church your hope your hope is laid up it's reserved for us amen so your hope has a location praise god your hope is has a special place for it praise god and the bible said it's behind the heavenly veil jesus is our hope amen your hope is not just like a package sitting in heaven your hope is a living breathing eternal person jesus christ amen hallelujah your hope is alive amen amen the bible says in hebrews 6 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which enter if into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek glory see church when when uh when the storms of life come the bible says it's an anchor for the soul so think of a ship letting down an anchor the storms of life are going to come we ended last sunday with it right probably said a hundred foot tall wave right he said but thank god that jesus has a string attached to our boat amen and he's going to pull us through every wave amen when the nation when there's he said there's distress of nations and earthquakes and and all the end times pestilences all these things he said jesus christ has a hold of that rope amen that string and he's going to pull us through and he said we will crest every wave praise god the waves are going to hit us amen have you been hit by any waves this week but if you haven't there's going to come some waves amen and your anchor for your soul the bible says is one place it's in heaven praise god my what a word for the people that are going to have an earthquake in 10 years and their whole town is going to be destroyed amen imagine the whole city being uh uh destroyed think about where you work think about your whole factory destroyed you come there and it's all in ruins but paul told them you have an anchor for your soul praise god amen when the storms of life come when trials come your your soul has an anchor your soul can grab a hold like an anchor grabs on a rock your soul grabs on jesus christ who is the rock amen and your hope is in heaven praise god you're anchored there so believers who hear the word it affects the very day they start believing and then they have an anchor that will keep them in the storms and the anchor is located in heaven and the anchor's a person the person of christ paul said jesus is your hope church first timothy 1 verse chapter 1 verse 1 lord willing if the lord terrorists will preach on that book one day paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and the lord jesus christ which is our hope now church what does hope mean you ever think about that what does the hope mean it's an anticipation it's pleasurable anticipation right so we we we we're hoping for like the next steak dinner right like we we we know what hope i hope we can go there or i hope i can go get some fuzz sometime you know we have that hope right like that's a natural hope well i hope i can sleep in i hope i can get some rest like you're it's something you oh i anticipate that i hope somebody comes to the service tonight right you know we have all these anticipations oh it's going to be great anything you anticipate and look forward to with pleasure is your hope amen and so in the midst of trials we have to understand there's a pleasure to the coming of christ amen hallelujah we're anticipating the coming of jesus with pleasure praise god that's what hope is and jesus is our hope amen it's confidence in him as the the greek says it's expecting him it's expecting that he'll come with pleasure praise god amen this is what the colossians had and they were only going to have it for 10 more years whether they left or whether they died in that earthquake i don't know the history i haven't studied that far in it to look and actually see the history on it now get your bibles let's i'm gonna ask some readers out here some adult readers so but austin can you get ready uh maybe brother amen or sister who or whoever could read there but lydia you got a you got a bible hunt malcolm you got a bible all right i need some readers here now notice in verse 6 church they receive the grace of god and truth now this is going to go along to help austin alina who are new to the word that god uh grace is a gift from god but it's either accepted or rejected now let's show them one two three four now you only need two or three witnesses in the mouth of two i'm going to give you four there's at least four witnesses that grace can be rejected right grace can be forfeited and so i want them to see that by god's grace like god's grace amen so lydia can you get hebrews 12 15 uh by the a brother i'm sorry yeah brother amen can you get uh jude 1 4 and then but austin can you get galatians 2 20 and malachi uh second corinthians 6 1. so now see that's that's a great difference this is this is what separates us from many churches we understand grace correctly churches many churches uh pervert grace they say you have grace no matter what that's not true you only have grace no matter what if you're predestinated and god's the only one that knows that praise god hallelujah but just receiving the word you can hear it one time or hear it one time and like it for at least in the case of judas's spirit you can like it for three years but then turn it down see and now we've seen around the message they can hang around for 30 or 40 years brother bang and then walk away and i say i don't believe it he wasn't a messenger i don't even know if i was baptized the right way we've seen it with people we've met they don't even know is this right anymore they've been so deceived by the enemy they don't even know a revelation because it never was a revelation to them amen they never got the revelation of the word it just it was just intellectualism but it wasn't revelation unveiling amen in other words that was always a mystery to them water baptism is still a mystery to them because it never was unveiled to them praise god okay so uh lydia uh hebrews 12 15 says god's gift of grace can be failed go ahead lydia amen so this i think was speaking of not mistaken was esau he failed grace in other words god's grace came to him but he failed it and instead of letting grace control his life he let roots of bitterness control his life let's get to that we'll get to the grounds the four kinds of grounds we'll get to that in a moment so you can fail the grace of god hallelujah uh next uh i think amen can you do jude 1 verse 4 for there unawares who were before old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ amen wonderful now notice they were still preaching grace but they turned grace into lawlessness and the bible said they denied the lord when they did that now no doubt church they kept preaching the lord jesus they they kept preaching that but when they changed grace into lawlessness they denied the lord amen but yet with their words with their words they never say that but with their doctrine they said it and that's what jude says that's where they denied the faith that's where they denied the lord in their teaching praise god amen uh austin galatians 2 20 i please crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me okay i wrote down the wrong scripture then it says i will not frustrate the grace of god in galatians anybody see it 21 i was one verse off thank you sister well she's helped me twice there so she's she's really on it right here she must be reading the bible out brother okay read 21 brother i do not frustrate the grace of god yes amen thank you brother let me fix that in case i ever reference this again thank you all right so god's gift can be rejected in this case they were saying you've got to be circumcised to be saved brother brother austin the uh another example might be you've got to believe in brother brahma to be saved that's a lie brother abraham said it's not me it's the word of god that you got to believe now you want to respect god's prophet but see anything added on to being anything add on to salvation is a lie it's frustrating the grace of god exactly it's actually rejecting the blood of jesus christ praise god i've got i could have said something there uh look at cornelius cornish didn't even know about water baptism yet he got the holy ghost so that means he must have went through the act of repenting sanctification without the water baptism because that's just the outward show amen he already had the the answer of a good conscience toward god in his heart amen hallelujah thank god and then he got the holy ghost and then he hadn't been baptized yet so he's he comma peter commands you be baptized he got baptized just as outward sign praise god so all the saints knew that he was baptized the name of the lord see grace can be failed it can be perverted or changed it can also be frustrated or rejected and then malachi 2 corinthians 6 1. hopefully this is right if not we're asking naomi she's going to tell us the verse amen thank you okay got that one right amen thank the lord so see this is what happens brother uh austin people get receive god's grace but it it doesn't take effect in their life they hear about it but they don't let it take effect in their life it they received it in vain right i mean how many have all got gifts and you never use them anybody ever got a gift and you don't use it simon got me a great gift it's one of those jackets you put on and it has a battery and it warms up i didn't use it all winter i just forgot about it malcolm took it out one time and it was cold i should have wore it on a couple of times i was shoving out there but actually i've received that grace in vain or that gifting in vain i got to go get that out i thought about wearing in the mornings when it's really cold i just put it on you know while i'm studying and praying you know staying warm boston uh unmerited favor so unearned blessing unearned favor that's grace in other words you didn't earn it nothing you did for it it's just a gift yes praise god good question that's exactly right good very good yep very good very good and so see any gift can either be accepted or rejected any gift and even the gifts in your life right that man with the one talent he buried that talent in the ground he didn't have to do that he should have invested in it praise god at church if there's a gift in your life you're not sure you're investing in let's talk about it and i'll help you out praise god if it's money i can help you out with money or what whatever you need if you've got a gift of your life let's let's exercise it praise god let's not leave any let's not leave anything wasted praise god hallelujah you got a burden on your heart let me know about it but this is what i found if you've got a burden and it costs money god will provide that burden that's what that's what perry green told brother brother and told perry green as well now look more at verse six now let's get into this here this is what i said so this one i was gonna encourage brother austin you know and lena they're praying for the holy ghost but be encouraged because you have even fruits before you're born again this parable is about the fruits at the completion of someone's life the parable of the foregrounds we'll get to this here we'll get to this in just a moment this is about the end of a person's life but before the baptism of the holy ghost there are fruits you you'll show remember the bible said fruitful and every good work we just read that amen so all your works should bring forth fruit all right now verse six the word of truth brings forth fruit so if you have the true word it'll produce true fruit praise god now let's recall this four grounds parable this speaks of the end of a life right but there are also fruits of repentance in justification sanctification but when he saw many of the pharisees sadducees come to his baptism he said to them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth fruits they're i'm sorry bring forth therefore fruits meet or necessary for repentance praise god and that's what you two have showed praise god amen you showed the fruits worthy of repentance like we were talking brother it's not worthy to repent and then go cuss and swear the next day that's not fruit that's what the bible calls worldly sorrow and godly sorrow that's worldly sorrow and i've seen that so many times brother people that come to visit they leave not nobody here but people that visit leave they'll cry and i'll pray for them but then they'll go out and do the very same sin the next the next day that's just saying i'm sorry god but not being not but not accepting lord i'm accepting the power to overcome it amen hallelujah amen amen that's worldly sorrow and we got to be careful that doesn't us seep into our lives where we allow a sin to go on for months and weeks and years and and if we don't if we don't have power to overcome it that's different or if we need god to do a supernatural miracle that's different but i said there's some things brother that uh that take god to do it like even his sickness remember he had the brother braham had the sickness he looks like a demon like a squirrel looking thing every seven years it came back that was something he could never do on his own god had to do that paul's eyes remember he uh god allowed that in his eyes that's something god had to take away because god allowed that to humble him but then it would it would also have been something god would have to take away so see there's some areas of our lives that we're responsible for amen but there's some that that god is allowing there to lay there to teach us either humility or dependence on him obedience some and you got to seek god in your life you have to seek god amen you have to and god may be laying it there so you will seek him amen god may be leaving something in your life there so you will seek his face hallelujah amen so see anyone even if they're not born again can have fruits in their lives and i see good fruits in your lives you too hallelujah just like in the little ones too i baptize them i see them singing worshiping come in the house lord memorizing verses right nature wish i had a mind like you i missed my day no no i could still i could probably do it if i tried it but uh yeah i appreciate the the fruits you see the fruits of someone's sincerity praise god now so the end of your life you will come to one of these grounds amen the worst is the wayside that's the one who it falls on though it's not even it's not even in the in the garden it's off to the way side of the garden and the birds come around and eat the seeds right away that's jesus said that satan coming on snatching the gospel out of your heart that you heard so that's pharaoh right pharaoh his heart just get harder and harder and harder god knew he never would believe so that's why god hardened his heart by predestination god knew that he's a vessel and a dishonor we've had good questions about that in the sunday school god knew they'd never want to do it so he they're the wayside now the estonia is judas we're going to look at judas in a moment notice the the seed brings forth a little bit of fruit or not fruit the the seed grows a little bit doesn't bring forth any fruit but the trouble with that one is the ground the ground isn't the right ground the heart isn't the right kind of heart praise god the other one wasn't even on the on the path right i'm sorry it wasn't even in the the garden this one's in the garden but there's stones there okay that's a judas iscariot heart in other words can i say like this church the person wasn't really sincere as they should have been can i say it like that they didn't really get down to the real depths of repentance praise god in other words they didn't they weren't they weren't as serious as they should have been they weren't as sincere as they should have been that's a judas heart and i'm gonna say like this they weren't as honest as they should have been may the holy spirit help us to be honest because if you know if you know the parable here's what i'm going to get to in a little bit if you know the parable how does jesus describe the best heart he said it's a good and what honest heart well this kind the foolish version they're still saved but what does that mean it does that means they're not as honest as the wise virgins the church said and they had it for a while so that means they weren't very honest either and what did judas hide judas hid it so well oh my goodness hallelujah he hid his sin and his sinful heart so well that at at the at the at the supper the passover supper jesus said what are you going to betray me and they all look around and say is it i he was so he was so good at being and brother austin knows this too because we know people they're so good at being dishonest they believe the lies that that they say right through their mouth praise god they're so good at lying and being dishonest that they believe and can fool people by their dishonesty like judas for three and a half years he deceived those preachers and not jesus but three and a half years 11 other men brother 11 other preachers he deceived because he was dishonest in his heart may god help us to be honest now the one we got to watch out for was be here none of us are going to sell out jesus hallelujah and the church said i sold out everything for jesus i'm not selling out jesus he's i sold out everything for him praise god amen i left everything for him but here's what we got to watch out for not to let things and cares of the world choke out the effects of the word of god we have to have a good and honest heart now i preached a few weeks ago remember this brother austin the very first six steps the first things that six things to know as a new believer are in hebrews chapter six he says and we'll move on from these if god permits it and that was a beautiful that was a beautiful sermon that night a beautiful service the whole service was great it was beautiful service because it opened up in a way i never understood the very first one paul lists is what most churches fail on see they they never repent from dead works that's the key works you have to repent from all your sinful works hallelujah right they just say come to church oh you said a prayer you're saved that's not the gospel the gospel is repent of all your dead works amen hallelujah that was powerful my that really opened up to me that day so judas never did that he never repented from all the dead works he might have repented of some for a little bit but now all the dead works and then the churches got this wrong they they instead of having faith toward god they got faith toward preachers or they got faith toward brother branham which we would love brother and we have we have confidence in him but our faith is not in brother branham or any man our faith is in christ hallelujah or they got faith in riches right or they got i'll say this well yeah that's right i'll say that and then here's the one most of them and they all fail on this one too brother bang there's different baptism there's water and there's holy ghost amen and they fail on that they say as soon as you get saved in the water you're filled with the spirit they're wrong the bible proves that the bible's right praise god so your cma church my assembly of god church brother they didn't have this one right how am i going to how they ever going to move on to perfection right how they ever going to move on to perfection if they can to get these right hallelujah i'm going to make a video on that one day by god's grace the lord will help me lay on of hands the bible says there's laying on hands for healing for ordination as well right and the bible says you have to understand when to lay hands on praise god in other words you don't ordain someone lay hands we ordain them in the ministry until they're proved that they're a real saint praise god hallelujah and you don't lay hands on people to pray for them unless you uh first talk to them and make sure they've confessed their sins because the devil don't the devil don't have to move if they don't repent of their sins the resurrection of the dead they got they think there's just one resurrection there's two they just don't got that and eternal judgment they think it's eternal punishment but it's eternal judgment that soul is judged that's lost they're judged unworthy of eternal life and they're eventually annihilated but the judgment lasts eternally but thank god the grace lasts eternally as well amen hallelujah praise god eternal life hallelujah so that's why brother austin this is why we have fruit even in justification signification we have fruits that we must bring forth hallelujah amen amen i'm trying to move on boy this sixth verse must have been jam-packed with revelation this verse i can't get past verse six here see we're responsible for how we receive the word of god and what kind of ground we allow in our lives because jesus christ said the parable is this the seed is the word of god now look jesus says everybody that paul said the whole world has heard the gospel my in paul's day in 60 a.d he says as it it's come to you as it is in all the world see the gospel the seed of god's word is spread to all the world god gives everybody a chance to grow in the knowledge of god god gives that chance to everybody oh there's such power in the word of god amen have you seen it grow in your life church amen have you seen god have you seen god water a seed in your life and then enjoy the blessings of the fruit of that seed hallelujah glory amen thank you jesus like with austin alina coming back how many seeds and prayers did we plant with the word of god with jose's healing of glaucoma and banging who is dad being healed how many seeds did we plant a prayer how many seeds did we plant in the hearts in our hearts praise god let god seed be planted in our hearts how many times do we water it and then god brings forth fruits amen god's word is a seed hallelujah let it fall on a good and honest heart praise god and let god water that and it will bring forth in its season amen now you have the same responsibility with every gift just like this this is speaking of a husband and wife and hopefully you enjoyed oh hopefully you enjoyed the the video i put out about husbands loving your hopefully our husbands are doing a good job with that i put that out this week so if anybody ought to be doing a good job that'll be our church amen doing a good job hobbies loving your wives hallelujah the bible said husbands should love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself for it that doesn't mean you worship your wife but it means once you're done with your business how can i help my wife how can i give myself to help her out praise god there's got to be a balance like i was talking to a brother and he said we were doing a lot of uh a lot of home construction and they were this brother was doing a lot of home construction but he said the so the holy spirit put on his heart it's time to take a break from that and spend more time with the family that's what that's that's what that that's what this is right a man has to he he there there's a hundred things we can do at our houses brother to fix them right i can think of easily 50 all right fix that gotta fix that but so you're never gonna get those done in one day right you're never gonna never gonna fix all those problems so you gotta be sensitive to the holy spirit how can i get done some of what i need to get done but then also minister to the needs of my family and show them love and show them affection and show that show them the love of jesus christ i got to make time for that too in fact i would say that's the most important thing to do amen make time for the family because the bible says if a man doesn't use knowledge or understanding of how to treat his wife his prayers will not be heard so see there's responsible brothers if you're given a gift of a wife a gift of children you've got to treat them right or else god's not going to hear your prayers because you have sin in your life so see there's responsible no matter what gift we have no matter what the gifts we all have in our lives we got to be responsible with them and we have to have a good and honest heart praise god now many of the colossians had fruitful hearts now here's where i kind of jumped ahead of this on judas and brother amen has a good testimony about this brother remember brother amen had a good testament about this but amen said in his cma church and correct me if i'm wrong on this brother he said the way they would keep members coming is that right is to kind of fearmonger them he didn't use that word that's what i'm using in other words they'd keep you coming by fear and say if you don't keep coming back to our denomination if you don't pay your tithes if you don't pay your money he said you might be they said you might be a judas is scared now that's the wrong approach you don't you don't bring people back by fear you bring them back by faith amen you would say because you're not a judas i'll expect you to be back next week amen i tell you because i know you're a peter amen or a paul amen or a tabitha amen or a priscilla amen i know you're one of those you're a lydia praise god i know you're one of those amen because i know you're one of those i'll see you next week and we're going to keep pressing the gospel and god will be glorified amen but when you honestly examine your life like that's what brother amen said on the podcast it's beautiful now that i'm in the message i don't battle am i a judas anymore because i can look at the different kinds of ground i can see i don't have a stony heart towards god amen i've got a heart of flesh towards god in other words i feel the love of god i can be moved by the leadership of the holy spirit praise god amen i can learn and grow as a christian i can grow in god's grace amen in other words i'm not hiding anything from god i'm not hiding i mean i'm not hiding anything from anybody now there's things you don't confess to other people in other words my life is an open book i want all my sins all my sins are confessed praise god i live honest before god and man i have a good heart amen hallelujah and that's a beautiful testimony we can all look at our lives so you see the the judas ground they heard it and they're happy they got gladness for a little bit no no no judas saw all the miracles he saw walking on water he saw every single one of the dead the withered hand come back he saw all these mighty miracles and he was happy about it at the beginning but he did not have root in himself and when affliction and persecution arose for the word's sake there immediately judas was offended he was originally glad now look the bible says he wasn't rooted and grounded in what love he was excited about the miracles excited about oh we got a new rabbi new teacher new church movement revival's coming but he didn't have the roots of love in his heart to really love the word of god the turn turn to john 12 6 brother austin we read that john 12 6. here it is he was not honest he wasn't honest with jesus at any time brother amen he's going to wind up to jesus and say jesus will you pray for me i don't love the poor like i should brother vance any time he could have said i'm being greedy jesus will you pray for me that god will help me and he never did that instead he hid it from jesus now of course he couldn't hide everything from jesus jesus knew from the beginning he was going to betray him but he tried to hide it from jesus he no doubt hid it from all the other 11 preachers his dishonesty and then look how different that was from cornelius oh it's so beautiful man that's a good thought amen hallelujah john 12 6 brother sorry john 12 6. this he says yes sir so his statement was brother austin up in verse uh five why wasn't this ointment sold for 300 pence of money and given to the poor but he didn't say this because he cared about the poor he said this so because he had the he had the money and he could probably steal from that we don't know how much he stole we don't even know if he stole but the bible said he had a thief's heart and then he sold out jesus at the end so it's likely he was stealing the whole time but we don't know see but then cornelius on the other hand he didn't even see jesus's ministry he just heard somebody preach about it and he went to praying fasting and giving alms amen i didn't hear you praise god amen he just dedicated himself but now look church judas he saw the miracles happy for a while but pretty soon he started despising the poor can you imagine that he didn't even care about the poor people that they would help he'd go to services he'd say amen he'd do all he's just like everybody else he just acted like everybody else but in his heart he didn't care now church let me tell that to you if there's something in your heart that you don't agree with the word let's repent of it now praise god be honest be honest because no matter how great miracles you see if the heart is not rooted and grounded in love amen there's a possibility it can be a stony ground and that's what we see when people fall away from the message and they blasting the word of god or they deny the word of god see beautiful thought that's beautiful thought from the word of god all right now i felt like there was more i want to say on that one but church look at your life for a moment you know the bible says we're not this that's a judas heart we're not going to be that let's examine our hearts we just have to constantly make sure amen we got to check up every week praise god now if you have a garden how many know you've got to check out more than once a week on your garden got any gardeners out there praise god any amens out there if you check up on your garden once a week is it going to do very good probably not it's not going to do as good as if you check on it every day i know there are seasons where my wife sends the kids out to water every day because it's not a rainy season right right brother brother jose he's got a man back there so see it's not enough to just check up every sunday and wednesday we got to check up on our hearts and make sure the cares of the world are not choking out they're not choking the effects of the word in other words the word is having the biggest influence in our lives amen and then if you're if you have an honest heart you'll pull those you'll confess those cares lord forgive me you'll keep weeding right anybody knows you're going to get weeds you can pull the weeds brother one day the next day there's weeds again there how does that happen it's frustrating right you can live a good day a good day of victory and the next day you have an awful dream versus awful morning wake up with a bad attitude and you got to cast that down amen you got to weed out that heart and make sure it's a good and honest heart praise god all right verse seven so the colossians let's read verse seven colossians 1 7. i'm at uh whoa 59 minutes already okay hard to believe that colossians 1 verse 7. i'll try to go a little faster through here by god's grace i just thought that was a beautiful thought i had that thought this week you know listen to brother amen's testimony about judas that's so beautiful it's not fear that's going to keep us here it's faith that's going to keep us in the word of god and we just honestly examine our lives well lord forgive me if i've got off balance here forgive me if i've cared too much about that lord forgive me i want to be good i want to have a good heart i want to have an honest heart colossians 1 7. as you also learn of epiphus our dear brother i'm sorry our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit now notice the colossians church heard the word of grace through epiphanes it wasn't through the prophet of their age but yeah did they but who can answer that do they have the love of the spirit yes or no yes they never met the prophet they never saw but they still had the love of jesus christ amen hallelujah we can have it here too amen hallelujah we never met brother braham we have no stories to tell when i was in brother ramsey's meetings i have no stories of any of those things but i do have the story of the love of jesus christ coming down into my soul amen it was shed forth abundantly on me when i received the holy ghost amen hallelujah see you don't have to meet the prophet to have the love of jesus christ i would thank god for the prophet but not it's not everybody's testimony now eprefus was a deer or beloved co-slave of paul that's what fellow servant means a coast slave church we got to look at that my life is a life of loving slavery to christ i'm just going to do whatever the master tells me to do praise god i don't want to do what my flesh wants to do because i know that's the way i know that's the gates to hell and the church said amen let us see ourselves as beloved co-slaves of the gospel so we're all slaves together praise god we're all slave we're all slaves for jesus amen we're all servants to jesus we're serving jesus's purpose not ours and he was a faithful minister a trustworthy minister and each one of us if we're honest will be trustworthy see look i'm going to look at i want to spend some time looking at the character of this man epiphanes for a few moments his name means lovely so beloved ephesus beloved lovely that's what that means he's double loved amen his name means lovely fellow labor with paul he taught the colossian church the grace of god and truth and he was designated a faithful minister of christ on their behalf he was at that time with saint paul at rome when this letter was written 80 57 and we know paul's estimate of him faithful my beloved okay so his name means lovely the lovely brother here's another one from the easton's bible dictionary that was from the lexicon uh this is from the bible dictionary again his name means lovely he's a dear fellow servant faithful minister he's evidently with him at rome when he wrote the letter to the colossians so paul's in a prison remember he's writing a letter to the colossians which he never knew never met he just heard about them from ephephris he was a distinguished disciple probably the founder of the colossian church and he's called a fellow prisoner so here's the picture can you imagine paul in a prison and he must have said it's time for visitors who walks in epiphanes walks in my beloved brother paul can you imagine him running to paul i don't know if he i don't know i don't know if they got to go into cells like that i don't know or were they behind the bars i don't know but he said oh paul how are you doing my beloved brother they'd probably weep and cry you know you've been in prison all those months so many prison trips so many pr being in prison prison sentences just for preaching the gospel of christ and paul he'd hug him and say how are the colossians doing you started that church in akron how the akronite's doing i never met him how's their faith how's the church doing oh paul let me tell you they have the love of jesus christ in the church notice he didn't mention any miracles although miracles follow love right he mentions their love in the spirit their love and so paul says you know i feel led of the holy spirit i like to write this letter to the colossians pick up your pen pick up your pen and right like the holy spirit told brother brandon amen pick up your pen and write so then paul goes to writing the book of colossians through epiphus now i just i mentioned this earlier last time but they had 10 years left right so they get a letter and the clock is ticking the clock is ticking 10 years before the earthquake in church if time goes on just like there was no church in colossae there may never there might not be a church in akron or napoleon or happy valley only god knows how long these churches are going to last so we have to do our part while we have the time to do it right because this was a holy ghost filled church the colossae church but yet god let that church be destroyed or at least at least the city hopefully the people got out but some it's something to keep in mind church it ought to make us humble praise god in other words lord i don't know how much time i got help me to use it wisely for the kingdom of god help me to always be about the father's business now i want to put some quotes in here now here about our outreach a little bit here i'm going to share a few quotes brother brahm says about winning souls and he that wins souls is wise now remember the bible said the fruit of the righteous is the tree of life amen the word of god and he that wins souls is wise so we know there's a foolish version and a wise version the wise version tries to win souls now church what i find in most message churches they don't really reach out to the public denominations more reach out to the public than message churches that's not a good sign but it does fit in with the fact that jesus said few there be that find the narrow road we ought to be a church now i've talked to different pastors they say well we just pray for them and god sends them in that's true too but what about giving other people a chance to hear the word of god we've done that we've we prayed for god to send in people he has praise god right but the wise want to win souls so epiphus then he was a man god called to a community praise god just for a short time he probably was born in colossae raised there he heard about the message amen he took the message back to his hometown praise god and then he was burning he always prayed no wonder he always prayed for that church because it only had 10 years left amen and a short life span no wonder he was always making prayers for that church brother braham said it should be that a man was called of god to a community that encourages me i don't know about you i hope it encourages you but that encourages me god has called you and i to akron ohio and if he had to lay there like elijah did on top of the mountain at the brook cherith and expect the crows to feed him he ought to stay till his divine mission is fulfilled no matter if he gets a penny or not it should be the call of god first but it seemingly it's changed today to the call for money in other words preachers only go places for money or a bigger position and something on that order or to become a more popular person in a bigger church or something like that hallelujah how many want to be faithful to god's call for this community amen amen program said do you realize the responsibility of this city of tempe here i believe is resting upon your shoulders i believe that god has made you lighthouses each of you you you have a responsibility of the sins of this city is resting upon ministers upon the church people the pilgrims and we're as we're journeying through do you believe that i believe that the responsibility of this city is resting on our shoulders that's why we pray for the city that's why we pray for our family praise god that's why we pray for our loved ones amen it's resting on us just like it rested on epiphus the souls in colossae were resting they were constantly on his mind burdened about it now church think about who you're a burden for don't just think about it as you go through the week think think for a moment who are you burdened about which souls do you have a burden for just think about that for a minute who do you sit there if you're in your car by yourself think about i wish they could just receive it oh i should send them i saw a man's name i used to work with on my uh on one of my notes on one of my phone i'm like i haven't seen him for three years i'm gonna send him a text this morning so i sent him a text i heard back from him but he just came to my heart his name is ken i invited him to church i gave i offered him my book all these things he turned it down he just came to my heart see just different people will come upon our hearts and we should be burdened for them we should pray for them amen now here's here's a very can ever everybody receive this this is a real challenging quote right here okay so let me let me let me just preface that before i read this as most of you are already reading it which is okay he says the world is so dead and empty to you anymore till you simply can't have any pleasure here nothing but just winning souls to christ is all you can get pleasure out of this is a challenging quote because i just made jokes about you're excited for a steak dinner you're excited for fun excited to go to the park now kids it's okay kids you know it's okay for parents too but you know what i'm saying like this is a very challenging quote i think brother is just trying to lay it in here really hard because we should enjoy coming to church we should enjoy fellowshipping with the saints we should enjoy a nice meal the bible says the gift of god but brother is making a point here christians should have burdens to see sinners saved right and then he uses ezekiel 9 a very familiar portion to us do you know the marking angel that was sent forth to see what the holy ghost said only seal those who sighed and cried for the abominations done in the city did you ever read it not those who shout and dance those who sighed and cried for the abomination did in the city only ones that was sealed okay so this is a very challenging quote but we have to balance it out with all the other quotes right like for example did you know brother brahm wouldn't have the meetings uh brother bran was trying to set up some meetings to preach the trumpets remember that now the holy spirit then revealed to him though he'd already preached it in the in the sixth seal he preached the trumpets and the sixth seal but before god showed him that he was gonna set up meetings and he made this quote and if you want it i can find it but it just kind of came to my mind but ram said we can't have the meetings now because i got to take the kids back to arizona because they have testing to do so look at that brother branham adjusted that when services would take place for his family's education and the church said but yeah there's other quotes where education is of the devil education to the devil but yeah he wouldn't have services so his kids could take tests in school see how we got to have a balanced church in our lives so you gotta have a you have to have a balance on quotes program said we like education when it's in its place but there's some people say oh you're a sin and going to college or you're sinning learning that's nonsense you're only sinning if you're going against the will of god amen but if i'm in the will of god then nothing can stop me and god is for me amen hallelujah that's why no god's for me amen hallelujah i've always tried to follow his will by god's grace i prayed about it before i do it pray pray before you do it so see he's saying he said in other words make winning souls your greatest pleasure in life praise god make that the greatest pleasure lord help us to win a soul like when austin and lena come back you know that ought to be our greatest pleasure praise god you know when i dance remember when i danced for lord was it last sunday i was reminded that i told god if you uh or when austin gets out of debt then i'll dance for the lord remember that brother when i said that that's why i danced last night i was so happy i was like that's right it's all paid off now i never dance for the lord amen hallelujah because that's a victory amen the debt is drowned in the sea of forgetfulness amen that's when they dance when they got a victory praise god hallelujah you know y'all didn't know that that's why i was dancing i promised the lord lord if you get them out of debt i'll dance for you praise god i'll just rejoice and praise your name amen just my appreciation for the lord because that was all god that was all god now the same quote he said i want to ask you a question how many members of your family how many members of your church tonight if that angel passed by and seen those people so consecrated to god that the lost souls was on their hearts day and night they just cried inside for the abominations done in minneapolis here how many would he seal tonight just think of that for a moment this is a very challenging quote see it's a great thing to think of and remember that's the word of the lord okay so in other words he's saying if if the bible said that in ezekiel how many people would the holy spirit find in their homes praying god save so and so god save save their lost soul they're so lost god help them to get saved help them receive repentance help them to get baptized in water how many people are praying for that now how many want to pray for that amen that's what we should be praying for had that desire i'm going to go share the message with my hometown amen glory and he did praise god and a little church rose up brother bang a little church rose up in colossae hallelujah because they heard the message of the prophet now i just want to share this see we're doing church everything we can to get the message out there's two there's one good looking guy in black and there's one ugly guy in orange there i just want to show you church we just put out the podcast a few weeks ago we got 42 downloads very humble beginning but i've already gotten three or four uh messages thanking me for doing it that's a blessing and they're looking forward to all of our future topics that we cover see people are hungry for truth i don't know i don't know about you but i get kind of tired of the political podcast i get tired of the other podcast you know you need you need something to chew on praise god you need eternal life so seven countries in rome or in europe have downloaded it two in africa one in south south america no none over here yet this side of the nation or this side of the world rather so it's a good humble start by god's grace and those are the countries that it's got into our little podcasts there just a humble little start so i'm grateful for that i wonder if that was brother william right there i wonder if that was him there uh i bet you 20 bucks but i don't make that sorry i don't make bets now let's compare that to our youtube channel we started in 2012. this has reached 138 countries this is just the top 10. now i wonder how many of these were brother william right here's brother here's ghana again i wonder how many of those hours so almost 2 000 hours of the vid our videos have been watching ghana i wonder how many those are brother william i'm just joking so we still we still got about you know one uh a little over one million and a quarter and look church the average amount that we're gonna get to witness to somebody is five minutes the first five minutes that's the average amount but yet from those five minutes we've had many testimonies around the world i'll never cut my hair again on the haircut video i'll never wear makeup again praise god that's all god needs god just needs a voice god just needs a seed amen praise god amen and he'll find it'll fall on some good on his hearts amen he just needs some some sowers of the seed praise god amen like that one i'll never forget that one uh the person got baptized and he said you saved my life that woman said you saved my life through the water baptism video now that's her words not mine in other words they need to know real repentance what's that brother from argentina praise god praise god amen amen praise god growing up in holiness praise god yeah glory brother amen hallelujah that's beautiful and see we're we're pointing them what are we trying to get fruits in their life there's fruits to every work right either the wrong fruits or the right fruits praise god and that's what we're directing people to so i thought this would connect well with epiphys he took the gospel to his community and that's what we're doing we're taking it here to the community but thankfully through the internet we can take it worldwide too and so we're slowly uh growing by god's grace and trying to get the word out so what's what i want to end with let's be like epiphanes praise god let's be a loving slave of the gospel of jesus christ let's be a faithful a trustworthy brother let's be a trustworthy sister in the gospel of jesus christ and let's do our part like brother ram said let's do our part to pray for souls to come in so let's stand and get let's read ezekiel 9. let's stand we'll finish up there i'll stop right there i'll pick up here on verse 11 next time musicians can come let's go to ezekiel 9. let's just read that again
