standard tonight let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I like to look at our sixth of the Sardis Church age here I'd read verses five and six revelation 3:5 and 6 we had a wonderful time out up just after have you seen I'll just give a little brief testimony about the meetings out of New York there was a wonderful time anymore Revelation chapter three verses five and six so we'll probably not finish tonight on this artist church age because I'm I just didn't feel like I'd get done but maybe in about two or three more services I want to spend a little bit of time on the book of life by God's grace and then we'll go to the Philadelphia and after Philadelphia I've actually preached all of them but I'll probably do a little review on Laodicea hope you're enjoying it by God's grace I would so enjoy going through this Church age book it's a renewal and I think I'm up to almost page 300 in the book so I haven't read a whole book in a long time so it feels really good to work on that by God's grace revelation 3 verse 4 let's read if we can I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry verse 5 I'm sorry did I say 4 I meant 5 thank you verse 5 let's read this one together 1 2 3 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels let's have a word of Prayer everything on your heart just make it on into God tonight let's pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord we bow our heads Lord to you Heavenly Father we reverence you Lord God or we realize you're the great one among us Lord none of us are great here father we're just trusting in the great one Lord who lives inside of our souls dear God we love you tonight father take this word that we've read bless it to our hearts teach us and train us Lord speak to us here Lord we know wherever anyone comes who's hungry and thirsting for you Lord they shall be filled Lord God it's a promise Lord God we know if we went to our homes tonight and we were hungry there'd be somebody there that could put a meal on the table to feed us but Lord how much more if we come to your house and your table how much more would you feed us your word if we come hungry and thirsty dear God so we come that way tonight speak to our hearts Lord Jesus minister now by your Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ lovely name amen god bless you maybe see you there by God's grace so now Caillou can switch over I do have some quotes here tonight wonderful time we flew out Friday morning I took a personal day off of scores three days I can take for any reason I want so I use one of those reat days to travel and I'm really glad I did because it was just I want to get out there as soon as possible and brother Brooks preached Friday night and there was about a hundred twenty sisters there and they just kind of rented out this resort it was really nice and there's about 20 brothers there so it was really nice and my roommate was a the associate pastor at the church in New York he's been an associate pastor almost 16 years so he's in the ministry longer than I have he's about 45 years old a real good brother and then brother Berg's preach Friday night and read a really wonderful time in the Lord the sisters try to stay up as long as they can on those retreats and pray into the night so I I was told they were praying to like one or two in the morning service start at 7:00 so weeding it out to like 10:15 and they kept praying late into the night and then I preached Sunday more Saturday morning I preached on the rapture and the family and just kind of hit some burdens that were on my heart you know to keep the family clean and staying in the Word of God and keeping the family pure and had a really good time in the Lord and and then there was a little break in there I took a nap you know to kind of rest up and then brother Brooks preached Saturday night and that was probably the best service because at the end all these sisters flooded the altar and they prayed and and there was a grill move of the Holy Spirit and the next day Seven Sisters raised their hands that they got the Holy Ghost so it's a wonderful time of the Lord it was just powerful to hear them crying out to God and hearing the crying and the weeping and seeing the sisters go and pray for one another and they were screaming and worshiping it was just wonderful wonderful move of the Holy Spirit people were really dying out to themselves and Sunday morning I preached on driving out all the enemies so that little series on Joshua I kind of condensed it into one service and it was a real wonderful meeting I was really blessed and the sisters were really that and and the brothers there so it was a wonderful time in Lourdes and Sunday night we left that campgrounds and we went back into New York it's the first time I was in New York in the Bronx I Ted it's pretty dirty into the Bronx I never been there before a lot of beggar's on the streets it was different it was a culture shock to me to see New York and crossover you know from Jersey and a New York there and it was just really something you know I've never been to New York like that but the church was really wonderful at about 150 people there and they squeezed in this narrow Church in New York it's really narrow it's probably like this this this narrow but it's really long and and it just was encouraging to me you know they sing in Spanish it's mostly the spanish-speaking church but I was just encouraged because their bathroom is right up front by the pulpit so all through the service there's children women men using the bath shutting the door brother Brooks is up there preaching and and and it gets so hot there they had three people faint last year so it's just an encourage but you know every Church has battles you know I thought how blessed we are we don't have a door opening up over here you know what people using the bathroom and I mean hundred fifty people you know and just constant flow using the restroom and nobody passes out at our church for you know heat exhaustion or anything so I'll just really encourage you know and and the pastor has had a lot of good thing to say about the preaching and it was really great and just a one just a refreshing time in the Lord I felt really thankful to have a part of that and I look forward to going back and and one of the sisters got up on Sunday morning and she wanted to give a testimony and she thanked the Lord for how my wife watched the children so I could come and preach and how sister Ruby watch you know her grandchildren so brother Brooks and his daughter could come and she's a mother of seven children a pastor's wife so very similar to my wife you know we have six kids and and she just want to thank my wife and rubus it was really neat to see that that they cared they were so mindful and they sent gifts for my wife and you know a little notebook and journaling it was just really sweet to be a part of that kind of fellowship so we're very thankful one of the sisters got healed in the meeting she couldn't lift her left arm and then the Holy Spirit touched her on Friday night and she had she was showing her arm she had full Theresa God was certainly moving there and blessing the Saints it was just a wonderful wonderful time in the Lord amen so I guess we'll stop there and well I like to do is I'd like to switch over here cuz I have a ok you'd have to do nothing that's just me I just want to switch over to this use my phone if that's ok that might be a little bit better ok yeah that's better ok so let's look at part 6 tonight by God's grace I'll try to be an hour but I know last week I went a little late so forgive me I just got caught up in the sermon but I'll try to go about an hour today by the grace of Lord so for this church age we preached all that the aged messenger salutation denunciation warning judgment and eulogy and so tonight we're going to start the promise to the overcomer which is the section on the book of life I want to read a portion of the church age book after we read this he's overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment so there's a little portion on the white raiment I like to read to you is anybody reading the church age book right now with us Lydia and oh brother Adam was anyone else ok so if I read this it might feel fresh to you by the grace of Lord I thought it might help to you I know as I read it I thought I've got it I got to read this this is a blessing here so he quotes that he that overcomes shall be clothed in white raiment the Prophet says this we used to have a saying years ago that no doubt was taken from this verse it was keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a clear course away from it and now God is going to reward those who follow this advice they're going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white Peter James and John saw him on Mount Transfiguration and his clothes were white as light that is how the Saints are going to be clothed their garments will be shining exceeding light hallelujah he said we know we're living in the end time I'm gonna skip ahead more to the white you can't walk in the Spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it's time to wake up and hear the voice of God cry and come out of her organized religion my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues God is speaking shun the religions of the world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance and the blood of the Lamb but do it now for tomorrow may be too late like that aim ahead keep yourselves keep your skirts clean stay out of anything that's questionable staying something that's solid with the Word of God I thought you'd like that by the grace of God so that's the inspiration the Prophet had on this scripture too to share those thoughts now let's move on here diversify the underlined part and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life so those who walk with Christ and white will not have their names blotted out that's a reward I want you to see this I'm not sure if you caught this but brother Branham calls this portion of the scripture the book of life he calls this a most difficult portion of the word how many could say men in the head as I've studied the book of life it's gone from really really confusing to more understandable but I can't say I understand everything about it but I can say it started very very confusing so I agree with the prophet of God it was a very difficult portion of the word to understand specifically the part where he says the book of life in the Lamb's Book of Life he said they look like they're two books he said but they're one but then he says they are like two books he says so he says both he says it's like they're two books but it's like they're one book and so it is a very sort of difficult portion of the word and he says this possibility of a name removed from the book requires more than a casual study and so I preached five sermons on this in 2014 is anybody remember that I think maybe our sister might be the only one that remembers that and my wife maybe I don't know but I preached five sermons on I remember the Rolf's remember because Karen this is a Karen Delores would asking me different questions after I was preaching on it so I do remember that part of it and they might have forgot on that but that's okay the church age book has about 20 pages dedicated to this teaching which is the most pages dedicated to one doctrine in the entire book so the next few services were just reviewing some of these things and remember it's a most difficult portion of the word for someone who's brand-new to the Word of God all right at the very start of our study let it be known that there's not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as will point out shortly also it's not a question of simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had opportunity to receive eternal life we're in one group received it and had their names placed on record while the others who refused it did not have their name so place isn't that quite a statement it's not even that simple like it's not even while these people receive eternal life and these didn't so they're going to hell romance there's not even that simple it's more it's more different than that because we'll show by scripture that multitudes who are not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it is certainly true amen so let's review so let me put that a little more layman's terms okay I'm sorry my fault up I didn't even I am tapping the wrong one forgive me I got a I pad let me scoot these over here God is not presently compiling a list of names okay he's not presently writing names down he already did that before the foundation of the world according to those scriptures which for familiar with and also one group will receive eternal life even though they did not receive it while on earth so that's why it's a little bit more deep than what most people think well you know this person didn't receive it life they're definitely going to hell well you can't exactly say that if they did something nice to one of Jesus brethren then Jesus will give them eternal life we know that so it's not even that simple so it's a very deep study in the Word of God so I want to look at this now where the Prophet says this we will show that there's a group of people whose names have been placed on that record before the foundation of the world and cannot under any circumstance have those names removed amen but will also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation world will have their names removed so see there's a group that cannot have their names removed but there is a group that even though their names were written before the foundation of the world they can have them removed like Judas all right now I I did this a while ago I want to bring it back and just bring in I brought it just brought in these down here so this is the group that make believers a group that could have their names written on the book of life before the foundation of the world but then have it removed because of transgression but the the wise virgin or the the highest quality of the believer their names cannot in any way be removed praise God because they're written in the Lamb's Book of Life so remember this there's two destinies but then you have three kinds of believers but the program said there's a fourth class there's another class of believer that's the foolish virgin and this is totally scriptural as we know all down through the Bible I preached at numerous times so that should be kind of familiar to us to begin with there's no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's book of life or even thy book and the book of the living only names are written therein this is what revelation 13:8 says all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him the beasts whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 17:8 this is the most clear of all the scriptures I think we're says it and they they draw on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world see so see if your names if you if people wonder and admire the beasts and the Pope and the Antichrist system and the if they wonder and if they love that system it shows their names were not written in the book of life before the foundation world now is it possible they could do something nice for God's people and be saved yes it's very possible but they cannot worship the Beast system now it says when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is all right now I'm just going through a lot of America scriptures here but bear with me I'll get to some new things in in a moment here by the grace of Lord now revelation 20 verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works skipping down to verse 15 and who suffers not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire all right now you can see that though there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in the revelation that is called the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life praise God where's this book located Jesus tells us he said rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen this book is in heaven praise God he says the book of life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white throne judgment in these verses jesus said that their names are written in heaven they were written in the book of life for that is where names are placed Jesus was speaking to the seventy so let's go there if you got your Bible as you can see this here I thought this was really wonderful observation by the Prophet as he's discerning and teaching the word for us this is Luke 10 if you got your Bible Luke chapter 10 I like to see this because it improves it pretty plainly Luke 10 17 says and the seventy returned again Jois there's the 70 in this portion now in verse 23 he's still talking Luke 10 23 and he turned unto him and I'm sorry turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed it are the eyes which see the things that you see praise God so he has 70 plus 12 he's got at least 82 people around him right he's got a big group around him and he's talking about don't rejoice that demons move rejoice that your names are written in heaven praise God that's the biggest blessing is to be saved these had all been rejoicing the Devils were subject to them in Jesus name Christ rejoinder was rejoice now spirits are subject to you but rather your names are written in the book of life now here's how you teach Judas his name was removed from the book of life this is how the Prophet teaches it here he reads these scriptures these scriptures prove Judas was the son of perdition and he was a devil we're not going to take time to read those because I want to get to where I'm going I want to end with idolatry I want to end with idolatry tonight that's where I'm going here so those scriptures just prove Judas was the son of perdition and the perdition means destruction he was the son of destruction he was going to be destroyed now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus that's in John 13 18 I'm gonna read these john 13 18 John 1318 I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth the bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me do you remember when Jesus chose his disciples church remember before he chose them he stayed up all night praying remember that part of me wonders I just wonder is that because he was no II knew he had to face Judas face to face this one that was gonna cause him to be arrested and betray him and basically blaspheme the Holy Ghost that's what he was gonna do he's gonna blasting the word for his hour so we had to pray through and have enough courage I imagined to call him as one of his disciples and brother Branham said he was so religious nobody picked up that he was a devil okay so he was chosen Judas was chosen we must admit that yet he was not clean verses 10 and 11 because the Bible said he that's washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but his clean everywhere and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said he are not all clean and this is striking to Jesus was I'm sorry yeah Jesus from the father was given Judas as one of the servants that's in John 17 12 John 17 12 remember this is how you prove that somebody can have their name on the book of life before the foundation of world but then have it removed because there's no scripture of God presently writing down names where people got saved did you know there's quotes or brother Branham said your God will write your name on the Lamb's Book of Life tonight if you get saved did you know that so he had to grow in understanding it was in the late 50s I preached it when I preached it back in 2014 so I didn't want to bring it up you know but he even grew an understanding he thought well people got saved or now God wrote your name on the book but everybody that was going to claim to have life already had their name on the book before the foundation of the world okay so 1712 while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I've kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled so see those that thou gave us me so Judas was given to Jesus by the father the father chosen Judas and said you need to be an apostle you need to be a missionary and he stayed at it real good for a while right but then at the end he sold it out and proved he was not of the right seed now he said let it be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parallel as the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both far known they were predestinated to wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification so see you can put Pharaoh and Esau in Judas in the same group they were all for known but they were far known to be destroyed because God knew what they choose already that's why God could predestinate them to that wrath he knew what they choose now let's read this here let's go to first Peter two eight and nine let's read that that'll be good refresher for us first Peter two eight and nine remember this is a deep study you got to be careful in the book of life you got to be very careful because there are so many scriptures about it first Peter 2:8 and 9 we'll just read it because that talks about how people are appointed to destruction and a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where and two also they were appointed so some people were appointed to disobedience aren't you glad if you can obey the word of God he could not he could not obey the word at the end in fact we know he was stealing from Jesus the whole time because the Bible said he was a thief he was stealing money out of the bag the whole time and nobody knew it see how the devil can hide even the Church of Jesus did the devil can hide from those 11 apostles of course didn't have the Holy Ghost but they were living sanctified at times right they go from sanctification then they lose a little bit their strength you remember like Peter we preach on that with sanctification they were up and down up and down up and down now but ye are a chosen generation praise God amen now Judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous the Pentecost we just obtained amongst the twelve listen this and then loss was neither inferior Judas's ministry wasn't any less than Peters can you say amen to that he had a part he had a faithful part in the ministry his ministering was just as wonderful as Peters when he's under the Holy Spirit it wasn't inferior that's why they didn't know to the ministries of the other eleven nor was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others now let me say this I know five message ministers that have walked away from the message and I'm not I'm not saying they're Judas I'm not saying that but listen they've walked away and some of them have told testimonies of the Dead being raised one of them saw a dead person after God we're getting run over by a vehicle prayed for them and they came back to life and then left the message so what you see what I'm saying like Judas didn't when he was under the anointing it wasn't inferior it was just as great as everybody else and God is so good so glorified in those works for the believers right and Judas could have had a reward but the Bible said when you disobey you lose your reward so he lost any reward because he sold it out but the RAM said he was fooled but the elect meet a fool they not in who yeah they let cannot meet a fool with organization and blasphemy and things like that why cuz they fear God in their hearts they love God in their hearts hallelujah and see it wasn't nor nor it was not a devilish foreign ministry so Judas was not out there you know trying to pull a witchcraft like you know like an exorcism you know like you'd see on a movie or I never really seen those on movies but you hear about him he wasn't trying to use demon powers you know to conjure up and he wasn't saying Oh Hail Mary Mother of grace and you know rubbing things together and he wasn't he wasn't doing witchcraft Church he was saying in the name of Jesus and he was believing it just like everybody else believed but inside of him inside of his heart was a heart that was never really sold out to God Amen brother Graham said this in the seat of the scrumpet see he said Judas never had faith to begin with a genuine faith can you imagine that he said he never had genuine faith to begin with so the anointing could come on him just like the anointing in the water can fall on a thorn bush right just like the water can fall on a thorn bush it's still a thorn Judas was like a thorn but the jointing still fell on him and he still did miracles my Judas a devil lost listeners a god-given Holy Ghost ministry that's an amazing statement in one sentence Judas lost a god-given Holy Ghost ministry his ministry was nothing less than the man who had the keys of the kingdom I know you're James or John John the Beloved Disciple right who lean in Jesus bosom Judas is just as many miracles as him it was a non-inferior it wasn't devilish it was a Holy Ghost ministry that's why we appreciate all you know men of God or even sisters we have gifts of miracles but we better watch their lives and not exalt them because they might turn away from Christ though it's not the miracles that prove it's your life that proves amen because he had a he had a equal ministry as any of the disciples Judas did so he went and killed himself sadly and went to his own place the Bible says his name wasn't even in the book of life but his name was blotted out all right now here's one more point on Judas I wanted to bring out and I loved this point so get your behind us I said I love it for the believer now go to John chapter 12 this is what I was saying earlier about gratitude how many feel gratitude in your heart for God let me let me show you how much God loves that in church I just want to express a little gratitude you know just for the thankfulness of the word that we've received and how my wife and I especially my wife trains the children at home we went to the dentist yesterday and just a little testimony the woman who cleans my teeth when we first met her she was really really upset with us for some numerous reasons she did not like us she really my wife could tell you she really didn't think much of us there was nothing we did it was like scheduling problems or something like that but yesterday after a year or two of going to her she said can I tell you something I got my mouth oh man okay you know he's up she said if I come back to Earth in another life she said I want to be born in your family and I start laughing like what are you talking about she said he said I don't believe she says she kind of giggles cuz she knows I'm a pastor she's gotta go see it now I don't believe in reincarnation she said but I just think your family is so sweet and you have such a godly family you know cuz they watch the girls and maokai come in like that and church that just makes me grateful that a woman who's at the end of their life her dad's 90 and a half so she's got to be 65 you know 70 something like that it just really makes me thankful that if we just eat this book we become the book and we have to and when we first met her we have to brag and say hey we're pastors and we're a pastor we have a patent or the little over the head of a church we're nothing we just walk in there and when we faced with adversity you just try to shine the light back you just try to cast down the spirit that's dominating them you just try to change the atmosphere praise God and let the light of Christ shine so I just want to share that that was just an encouragement to my heart and I am thankful for that tonight that's why that's why I can come and preach even if there's just two people here I don't mind coming preaching because I'm paying for what this bird has done for my life praise God I know what it's done to my life I know the sinner I was before I got saved I know what I used to be I don't want the desires of my heart I know what I used to think and say and do and hide out new kinds of evil things I know what Christ has done in my life amen and I'm grateful for the grace of God tonight amen John 12:1 God is so good to us if you know this story this is Lazarus sister Martha and let me let's read the story verse 1 then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead and there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus I'm sorry I got a mixed up this no I got right this is Mary yeah but Lazarus one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair now you know brother BAM said that I told many people that how could womanish or hair wash Jesus feet she have to she have to do a headstand right she have to stand on her head she have to balance like a gymnast and stand on her head in order to wash his feet with Erics you don't have any hair it so proves God and God never asked the godly woman to cut her hair in the entire Bible there's one time God asked women to cut their hair in the Bible you know what it was it was Israel when God was gonna have him taken out by Nebuchadnezzar he said cut your hair make yourselves bald for the day of judgment has come so people have women want to cut their hair that's fine but judgments coming on you say what I'm saying that's the only time God ever asked anybody to cut their hair was when it was time for judgment to happen and how many under mercy that how many under mercy tonight by God's grace I'm not under God's judgment I'm under God's mercy praise God now look at this here verse 4 then says one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three hundred Pence and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear that which was put there aim and now Church be careful how you read this don't get it in your mind like Judas was like this like you know he's smoking a cigarette saying oh that should have been given to the park and he's got his bag of change over here brother branham said he was so religious he said it with the most sincerity so picture that he would have said I ran across some windows it wasn't the scruffy man you know with the torn clothes like we think you know like with money falling out of his pocket and he's got drool and tobacco juice on the side of his mouth like and messed up hair he was religious satan's excites himself in beauty he was the best-looking of those disciples if anybody looked like they had it together my eye was Judas you know he had everything together he was so religious he was so deceptive and what did Jesus say leave her alone I imagine Jesus had the real humility and maybe Jesus had a little bit of a Ignatian we don't know but he said leave her alone right because he could discern it against the day of my bearing has she kept this for the poor always you have with you but me you not or don't have always turn to Matthew 26 verse 10 this is a parallel passage there's a parallel passage and let me show you how much God loves when you just come to church and you just come now yeah we always want to receive from God don't we but if there's times we just want to come and just give God thanks and that's why I appreciate when you when everybody puts like testimonies in that blesses my heart so much and you know if it blesses my heart how much more does a bless God's heart because God loved Mary's worship because there was no strings attached to it she just one to be grateful to Christ I'm gonna jump ahead to my point but this is what doctor Scofield noted in his Bible he said notice all the other women that came to touch him they came to get something from him but Mary was the only one who came just to show her gratitude right the one with the blood issue she came what to touch his feet so she could be healed the the harlot woman she came and noted in that Simon's house why so she could be forgiven but Mary was already saved Mary already recognized Christ the Messiah she just came to give him glory oh that's how we need to come to church sometimes amen I just came out to give God the glory ain't the head and or just go to your prayer closet I'm not gonna ask for anything I just want to ask that you receive my worship because I love you amen that's what Jesus loves and because Jesus loved me so much he said every preacher in every nation wherever this gospel is preached will preach about this woman Judas sat there and got jealous cuz he wondered that money he wanted that money but Jesus saw through that lie and he said this is a true act of gratitude and every preacher that is a preacher will preach about Mary amen go to Matthew 26 10 and when Jesus understood he said of my trouble you the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me go down to verse 13 verily I say to you whoever some of this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman had done be told a memorial for her praise God hey man in that beautiful all because it was just gratitude I just came out to church to give God things I just come here to praise Jesus to pour my worship on Jesus that's all I came here to do is to sing a special or give a testimony or rejoice and thank God for the word that's all I came to do and Jesus said that is a memorial praise God heaven recognize this memorial so every preacher that is a preacher will preach about Mary bringing gratitude to anoint Christ amen hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus so that's what Judas pretend to be concern for the poor in steal the money but Scofield says Martha stands for service remember she was always what she said get up Mary come serve come help me Lazarus stands for communion so Mary shows the worship of a grateful heart Scofield set others before had come to his feet to have their needs met she came to give him his due to give him his worship although two of the van just recorded the act John alone gives her name that's just a side note isn't that beautiful my goodness I thought that's so powerful she only came to show her gratitude to the Lord praise God program says this he's talking about the wise men how they brought their best gifts they brought myrrh the best gift they could find we realize over in Saint John 12 this woman this woman brought the myrrh that anointed costly something to take the smell of death away and she broke the alabaster box important on the head of Jesus and Judas said why this ought have been given to the poor said not that he had respect for the poor but he was the thief to begin with he carried the money and said this all have been sold instead of put in and Jesus said let her alone for she did this she anointed him under his Barrow see this woman so grateful that her sins were forgiven so see she was already saved she wasn't like the woman at Simon's house the prostitute woman it wasn't like that she was already saved she just wanted to pour out blessings upon her Savior amen until she spent all of her money she had and took an alabaster box and broke it and poured the oil and just adored I'm sorry I'm so ordered the room with the fine smell of his myrrh that she had anointed him for his death now see she did the service not knowing what she was doing but she was so grateful to God amen hallelujah I love that there were scriptures where I read those alright so you see that's one more point about Judas he was criticizing women in the church for their Pentecostal worship can I say like that he was criticized by the RAM cause it spawned Dainius worship he was criticized in women that just wanted to shout and praise God and glorify God and scream and cry at the altar praise the Lord Judas criticized that but Jesus said let her do it let her do it because she's pouring out a blessing upon me amen hallelujah oh thank you lord Oh glory now just like Judas his name was removed and I'm gonna do it on time okay good 27 minutes God did the same thing in the Old Testament Dan and Ephraim now before we pursue this thought on Judas let us go back to the Old Testament and see where God did the same thing so that's why I love about brother Branham he he said memory of what he said the keystone of the Bible was what's the key story what's the foundation what's the cornerstone of the Bible Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if God does something in the New Testament removes a name he already had to do it in the Old Testament and he did it with Dan and Ephraim thus when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the tabernacle of awareness we find the tribe of Levi ministering to the 12 tribes named Reuben Simeon it's the car Judah Zebulon Benjamin Dan Neftali GAD Asher Ephraim and Manasseh the order of the host names them thus in numbers 10 11 through 28 there's no mention of Joseph or Levi but when we look in Revelation 7 4 to 8 where it says they were sealed on once sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel it names them thus Judah Reuben GAD Asher Naphtali Manasseh Simeon Levi it's a car Zebulon and Joseph Benjamin we are back to the 12 tribes with Levi and Joseph named amongst them but with Dan and Ephraim missing okay so could everybody understand that Dan and Ephraim were mentioned the Old Testament when we get to the 144,000 which is at the end of Jacob's trouble or the end of the Tribulation Period dan and ephraim are missing they're not in the roll call all right because their names are removed the question now rises why are these two tribes deleted the answer lies in Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 let's read that Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 and we know why they're removed now because of idolatry not adultery but I guess it is spiritual adultery but it's actually idolatry with the I I you know idolatry Deuteronomy 29 16 I love the word of God that's one thing about love about the church age book it brought out so many scriptures I would I never heard during the preaching and I never read over oh it's like a it's like a treasure trove of scriptures and gold nuggets they I never oh I never even heard brother man preach that and you can just dig and dig and find all these wonderful treasures in the Word of God all right 29:16 anyone want to read that for me verse 16 but Adam do you read what can you read 16 and 17 but okay thank you thank you brother now look abominations and idols and now they're gonna get their names removed for abominations now what do we call dominations homosexuality bestiality cross-dressing right all these abominations drinking eating or eating blood drinking blood all these abominable things but it's abominations and idolatry so many times we think oh just idolatry but it's actually abominations - so that's a little interesting nugget there by God's grace okay so we read 16 17 Malachi can you read 18 and 19 would that be okay buddy you got it Lydia do you guys okay you got it's okay if you know okay I got you wanna read it okay thank you I thought you had it buddy I'm sorry Deuteronomy 29 18 and 19 Thank You Melek I thank you sister Kristin I appreciate you sharing your Bible with them thank you did you catch that mind you got chat in verse 19 God said anyone that hears this here's what if you do abominations or gods or idols anyone that hears that and says bless the Lord O bless my soul I've got to love me anyway o God will forgive me anyway and think about how many people we know that have done this we've shared things about gods and a prophet why do you wear skirts or how come you don't cuss or swear how come you don't agree with gay marriage brother you know we'll tell them why and then they'll bless their heart and say praise God I love God and God loves me and they're under a deception they're deceived because see they sit there they bless their heart they turn away from what you told them they turn away from what they heard about Dena I'm sorry Bhama nations and idolatry they say all bless bless my soul God loves me anyway I'm on my way to heaven shout in the victory but if God knows their heart and they actually love sin more they love righteousness their names will be removed from the book of life that's right oh I'm gonna have peace Osia lome brother Shalom you know they shake your hand and say Shalom but their hearts turned away see that's why I lied you came to turn our hearts to God amen hallelujah that's why we got the Word of God for this day to turn our hearts toward right or back towards the Apostolic fathers amen but they're hard to turn away from the Apostolic fathers and they want to walk in abominations and idolatry and say that's okay bless my soul I have peace with God I know where I'm going and they're most likely deceived I thought I hope you caught that that was really striking see imagination they're just imagining or imagining they ever walk with God they're imagining they're obeying the Lord but they're not obeying the Lord if they're enjoying abominations and idolatry Church they cannot you cannot assert you cannot serve or walk with the devil's hand on the earth and expect to hold God's hand in the afterlife if you walk with the devil's and you're gonna be with the devil right and the evil spirits and all that judgment look at that now verse 20 the Lord will not spare him so see he's the same yesterday today forever that's not gonna spare someone who willingly walks in sin like that Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven you see how this is a very serious thing especially when you get to idolatry and you get to abominations and I'm gonna get to a few those in a few minutes here and I'm not trying to be critical of anybody Church I hope you understand that you know not trying to criticize other people I'm just trying to show you that we must run from sin we must flee from sin right we must stay as far away from sin as we possibly can so we read that thank you for the reading help I appreciate that brothers thank you here it is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out and the history of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry is found in first Kings 12 25 to 30 so can we read that adam in malachi you're gonna get ready I'll read some - that's okay because this is a type and I added this it's not in the church age book I added this right here those are my notes when I put those those bars Africa of their calling this is a type of God's only provided place of worship first Kings 1225 now stay with me here this is a really good thought I think brother Bram places in here for a reason I I believe it'll be a blessing to you first Kings 1225 alright brother Adam Geary 25 and 26 again thank you sir alright remember this point these two are the sons of Solomon remember Rahab ohm and Jeroboam remember that okay Jeremiah Jeroboam and you know they did they have the kingdom divided now and he's got his people and he's like my we're gonna lose some of our church members right we're gonna lose some of our kingdom well look what he says Malachi can you read verse 27 look at this idolatry alright so do you catch that do you remember what the division was it was 11 tribes against Judah remember that so when they broke off it was Judah against the world in other words it was Judah against the 11 tribes right that's what it was there's northern Israel against Judah that's what it was and so Rayo boom here yeah Jeroboam is getting all nervous like my if I let these people go to church or go to the temple their hearts are gonna get turned there because they're obeying God's Word right that's where the that was God's only provided place of worship was the house of God right that's where the Ark was right if I let my people participate in worship the true worship their hearts are gonna turn back to God and they're gonna want to serve God if I let them go back to Jerusalem go hurry look at this he's all nervous he's in loose Church members so what does he try to do he tries to keep them out of God's house and no wonder I always preach on how important it is to come to church no wonder brother Branham preached so much on you must come to the house of God ray of balm gets an antichrist Jeroboam gets an antichrist spirit all I'm saying oh I don't wanna lose any church members if they go to God's provided place if they go to the temple Solomon's Temple I'm gonna lose church members because that's where lives are transformed the house of God amen because that's where the word of God is preached that's where people are healed amen that's where the people are saved that's where they're filled with the Holy Ghost amen if I let them get the gods provided place I'm gonna lose church members so he says I'll build idols and I'll keep them from coming to church and you and I know the same thing is happening today anything that can keep God's people out of the house of God many times is an idol right now I'm not talking about faithful live streamers or people that really hunger and would do they'd do anything to come to church on Wednesday night that those are the true Christians I'm talking about people that will first say the live streaming pretty soon they don't even watch the service pretty soon they don't even care pretty soon one service is enough and pretty soon even that's a burden are you with me because a real Christian hungers and thirsts for more of God and the Holy Ghost doesn't lead you away from the truth that leads you into more truth you see and I know I preach that a lot church but it's such an indicator of people's spirits that they have on them and brother Graham said this this is his example I did not put this in the church page book God put in the church page book hey man God did look at verse 28 whereupon the King took counsel and made two calves of gold and said to them it is too much for you to go to Jerusalem it's too hard to drive to church it's too far to go to church can you see that it's God's provided please oh don't go with those holy rollers you don't have to make all that sacrifice you know it's too far to drive the church is too much money you know your family is too big your children can't handle it you know your grandma can't handle it or your your husband or wife can't handle it you don't have enough money to do that you see they'll make any excuse not to go to God's house because that's God's house that's where judgment begins is the house of God Amen you see that this is this is the Old Testament foreshadowing the new I'll do anything to keep them out of God's house so I can keep my church members or my most say idol worshippers so I'll build a big fancy idol out of gold and I'll place it in a spot where they don't have to go to church anymore behold thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan and the thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan can you see that I'll do anything to keep them out of the religious center of the of the church and what's the religious center today the fivefold ministry because you get perfected through the preaching of the word it's foolish to everybody else but to us it's the power of God unto salvation amen hallelujah so can everybody see that this is the star of Dan getting his name removed on the book of life what's this first thing he does he stops going to church hope everybody could understand that Jeroboam keeps them from going to church keeps them from doing their sacrifice remember God said I require every man to appear before me three times in Jerusalem and I've got scriptures where he says this God says if you can't go every if you can't go all the time no he said if you can't if the way he said the way be too far for the I'm not gonna cut up let me read it I'm just cutting it up he said the ways too far for you he said sell your animals that you're gonna come and sacrifice he said turn it into money take that money with you and then buy animals there and sacrifice the animals in Jerusalem praise God so the men had no excuse they had to go to God's house they had to give the sacrifice he made it easier said he said just hate change your money into animals and then change them back into animals you want to see it it's right in the scripture I want to show that to you because I'm not making that up that's the word of the Lord okay this Deuteronomy 14 verse 24 yes God required everybody in that nation to go to church men you got to go three times a year if you don't go I'm cutting you off hey men remember all the blessings they don't pay their tithes to pay their offerings their blessings are gonna get cut off as well oh it's such a simple system give God back to it you've got a little bit back to him and it'll bless you abundantly praise oh I've seen to be true over and over amen Jude Rodney 1424 if the way be too long for thee so that thou are not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the LORD thy God shall choose a set is named there when the LORD thy God is blessed thee then stay at home and don't go to church is that what it says yeah I read that wrong didn't I every 25 if it's too hard if the animals are too heavy and it's too far stay home a church or say stay home from church no verse 25 then thou shalt turn it into money and bind up the money line hand and shout go into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose can you say amen to that and God placed his name in the temple where the where the Ark of the Covenant was because memory said I'll speak to you from above the mercy seat praise God oh my oh my this is so powerful this is to me this is my Wednesday nights are so powerful little nuggets like this get brought out brother branham brings us out this is how a name was removed Satan first got them away from church and then he set up false idols that they worshiped and then the Bible said ephraim is joined to idols as well let him alone so ephraim worshipped idols now they worship their own idols but Dan worshipped a gold calf instead of going to church my goodness so we all know there's modern-day idols don't we we all know there's modern-day Idol I saw this on Facebook and I thought this was pretty awesome I don't know about you but I'm like I'm gonna do a screen save on that picture I'm gonna say this screenshot education can be an idol right school can keep you from church your denomination this case you know anything against the donation your church can become an idol yeah our church scream anything and become an idol if you love it more than God spouse right husband or wife sports your job our job and money go together and then that wouldn't have a name but your car you know you can make any possession and I don't I just thought that was pretty good something we always think about but I just never really seen a good picture of it I thought I'd share that with you I like that very much so if they or if anyone claims to serve God but then falls away to idolatry the Bible said their names will be removed from the book of life this is a very serious thing very serious and the Bible showed the first thing was that kept them from the church and that's why we read last week where Peter said judgment begins at the house of God and if the righteous are scarcely saved who go to church how about them that don't go to church where are they going to end up that I remember we've been preaching on the fearful series the fearful unbelieving abominable see abominations again abominations and idolatry just like God said in Deuteronomy 29 murderers whoremongers the mongers just a lot of immoral sexual activity sorcerers now that's drug use too so all those all these people that are addicted to drugs that don't get the victory by the grace of God and involved in witchcraft they'll have their part of the lake of fire and idolaters and all Liars even people that lie that one thing they can lose their salvation shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death why did brother Branham say we need to check up every hour why would why do you think mother brand would say that every hour because of this because any Idol that enters it can expose a wrong spirit in somebody's life and could cause them to go off the same way Judas did right sell out the gospel and just for a few pennies or a few dollars south of gospel and would show that they lose all their award and actually lose eternal life not that they ever had it but they were claiming it they were claiming eternal life is that helpful by God's grace see idolatry New Testament this is the same thing God said in Deuteronomy 29 abominations idolatry your name's removed it's cut out now we know this I'm getting here but but John the disciple of love he ends the book of first John by saying little children keep yourselves from idols why would he say that he said you would say that because he knew the Holy Spirit is grieved God is not number one God is not our center of worship we worship a car or he worship our education or he worship our spouse or family we love them more than we love Christ and he knew that this would be a danger and he knew their names would be removed from the book of life the same guy that did in the Old Testament he has to be the same yesterday today and forever removes it in the New Testament now go to Ephesians 5:5 I didn't have time to get all this down here and again Church I hope I hope I'm not sounding critical I'm just trying to be so sincere I'm just trying to show you how serious idolatry is the first thing that Dan did they got him away from church it's the first thing and so Ephesians 5:5 says the following alright I'm not there just give me a minute or not a minute just a few seconds okay I'm there now okay for this you know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God no inheritance so see anyone who has an idol in their life they love this more than Christ they love that more than Christ they might say they love Christ but if their actions show they love that more than Christ they have no part no inheritance in heaven all right now let me close with this I got five minutes great perfect that's all I need is five minutes in 2008 I preached a sermon called dearly beloved flee from idolatry does anybody remember that anybody remember that at all alright that's nine years old well this thought came to me as I was preparing in this message I showed many brother Rams quotes about what idolatry is but never said anything that's between you and God is an idol it takes the place of God so think about our walks with God doesn't it feel awful when we feel like there's something between us and God doesn't is that an awful feeling so if that happens it means something's come between us and brother BAM calls it an idol like I just don't feel right between my walk with the Lord and the Lord and I something's come between us when Idol has come in and it could be a complex which is it could be pride it could be anything it could be the love of money it could be the love of family more than you love God like we talked about anything could come in there anything that takes the place of God is an idol the Prophet says this but Ram said God made you to be a worshiper how many know that you'll worship something regardless of what it is you'll worship your wife he said you'll worship your children you'll worship anything your automobile you'll worship your pleasure you'll worship something because it's in mankind to worship don't you know you just have to hang around people for a few minutes and you're gonna see what they worship oh my the pack I was at the airport and the Packers won the game on the last-second field goal what are they doing they're worshiping just a few hours earlier where a church we're going the same thing what were we doing worshiping amen it's the same thing it's both worship but ours was true worship you'll worship your pleasure well Graham said but when you make that your God he said that's what you're depending on he said now it's an idol when you depend on something for strength or for hope or for anything and it's not God it has to become an idol brother Graham said there's not much road on idolatry there's not many books about adultery but yet the world is full of it I gotta keep going sorry but the random said idolatry is worship placed on something other than God anything between you and God is the idol we should never do that he says okay I got one two minutes okay sorry I'm trying to finish him now the first one I always see a lot of sports because I was raised in sports but did you know this let me give you this so you can just just kind of try to try to wrap your mind around this I want to make sure I read this I haven't read this in a few years I think my wife or sister beau might be the only one that would remember this quote brother man talk about a man who loved baseball and he said he would jump up and shout at the baseball game he said he loved baseball he was a baseball fiend just like a cigarette fiend or a whiskey fiend so I just that's that's that's pretty powerful Church I know I know it's might be hard for us to understand but when you see somebody jump at a football game or basketball game they are just as much addicted to that demon power of competition or whatever pride whatever it is they're just as much addicted to that Idol as a drunk laying on the side of the street brother Ram said so they're both demons they both cause them to worship things that are not God and that's why I don't I you know I don't agree we should go to many sporting games if any at all unless it's like a little kids game we're not gonna have half-naked girls there you know and all kinds of stuff like that rock and roll playing the whole time how can the Spirit of God enjoy that it can't but he said they're just the same as a whiskey fiend or a cigarette fiend brother branham said you can make any preacher an idol did you know that and that's found in second kings 18:4 okay I'm sorry I can't put up okay this is speaking of when Hezekiah remember Hezekiah he lived hundreds of years after Moses and he had to take the brass surf remember the brass serpent that Moses held up he had to take that and the Troi and smash it because the people were worshiping it though at one time people looked at this and got healed but now it became such an idol he had to destroy it is that striking something that used to be so reverent and so respectable now becomes an idol and a worship a piece of worship and he had to break it and he he said that he said Israel would take incense they would burn incense before this statue and they weren't supposed to do that but see this statue became an idol in church if we're not careful people will make brother Brandon's picture with the pillar of fire they'll make that idol they'll pray to that and though they'll think like there's some power you know from brother Branham or something like that like they exalt that above God that's the same thing that happened with the brass serpent brother BAM says the same thing and on time to get to it but let me read you how you should look at it here let me read this my time is up I just almost done I want to talk about the pillar five pillar of fire picture one more time because I've mentioned this I'm sure bows hurtness and my wife has heard this program told a story in 1954 a woman he said bought the picture of the pillar fire put it in a frame and went to a ten cent store and she had it at her desk at the hospital so she was in the hospital and she set this pillar fire picture on her desk and she was looking not at me of course but at the pillar of fire there so see she was just there at that pillar of fire in the picture not brother Branham the pillar of fire and she claims this is her testimony the doctor give her up to die she claimed the pillar of fire come out of the picture and hung over her can you imagine that tuition and two days later she was dismissed from the hospital and went home well praise God the Graham said see she just looked at that and believed now we know to look at that any other way would be idolatry brother Branham says so see even that picture we got to have such a balance if you just stare at that pillar of fire that's a good thing but if we stare a brother branham and make him the special thing about that picture then we missed the whole point we become idol worshippers a member I'm convinced Church I could be wrong in this but I'm convinced many people are gonna have their names removed from the book of life for worshiping brother Branham I'm convinced of that just like when they worship the brass serpent it just took a few generations a few generations later and now everybody's worshipping and incense to this it's an awful thing idolatry is an awful thing we don't want any idols we just want Christ as our said center of worship we don't even Christ to be an idol brother branham said you don't want to make him an idol you want to make him Lord let's stand to our feet hope that was a okay review I hope you enjoyed that by the grace of Lord I sure did and I think I'll close right there I think that was little children keep yourselves from idols and the grace of God be with you amen keep yourselves you know I look at my life and I've got to make sure that I make sure money doesn't become an idol I've got to make sure money doesn't become an idol my life like I just can't wait to the next paycheck you know I just get 5,000 saved or I get whatever safe oh that I'll be happy no money never if I was sitting father's who ever satisfied with money will not be satisfied with it it actually says that I think it's the word wealth he who must have her wealth will not be satisfied with it you'll never have enough money satisfied I've gotta watch this I've gotta watch and make sure I don't make services and ayah for example like if I don't see someone come from prayer if somebody if somebody doesn't tell me for the service they enjoy it sometimes I can I'm not careful I could make that Idol like oh I just had to hear that somebody was blessed I've got to trust Christ amen I gotta believe God I've got to make sure I'm pleasing Christ and I'm not just trying to please the people I got these crises no one's people to be happy of course I'll let them to be I want you to overcome our spiritual power houses brother right never said I would I want everybody here to be a spiritual powerhouse but I can't let fleshly things become more important than what Christ thinks I've got to care more about what Christ things than anything else I think it's something we all need to look at but I hope you can see tonight how important it is to stay away from idols the first thing the scripture records Jeroboam ascend is get them away from church get them away from God's provide a place of worship now humming oh brother have said they provide a place in worship was today he said it Jesus Christ because he said because that's where God placed his name hey man you see Jesus Christ is at the bride today right he's preaching through the bride because the spirit and the bride say come that the bride is the one inviting people to the Holy Spirit today so he can't separate really the bride from Christ in the spirit because they're all one by the spirit that's why it's so important to be in God's house I hope that's a blessing praise God let's bow our heads here as we worship in three how many father I love you tonight Lord I believe I've tried all that's within me to please you tonight I'm not trying to please the church although I want them to be happy with the word as I said Lorna never want to make anything in haidle
