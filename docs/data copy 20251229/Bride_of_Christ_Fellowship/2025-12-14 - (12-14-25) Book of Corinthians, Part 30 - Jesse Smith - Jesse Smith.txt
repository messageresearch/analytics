Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless everybody. It's good to be in the house of the Lord today. Open up with a word of prayer. Have a few songs [music] and uh preach God's word today. Just so all the uh live streamers are aware, I did cancel service. Um, as far as [music] I didn't want people out on the roads, but people are welcome to come if they feel led by God's grace, but [music] we don't want anyone in any danger. Um, so uh for those in live stream land, God bless you richly and may God speak to you and strengthen you, [music] help you. Uh we thought the audio would be better here uh for the preaching mainly um singing as [music] well, but we don't have good audio for the instruments on the live stream. So, we apologize about that. But we're just grateful to be gathered here despite [music] the snow and we're so thankful. Uh brother Chris wants to thank the Lord that he was uh safe last night driving around while he was working. [music] And I got a text from God bless her uh sister. uh she wanted to testify and say thank God that [music] she was driving up near I think Brimfield, I think, if I'm not mistaken, and God got her home safely. [music] So, let's thank the Lord for that. Amen. [applause] God is good. Amen. I'm thankful God got us here uh with no [music] accidents. We saw three or four cars on the side of the road. Grateful though God has kept us. [music] And let's have a word of prayer as we enter into worship. Dear God, we thank you for today. Lord, it's a joy to be in your presence. Lord, it's a joy to gather. [music] And Lord, although most aren't here, Lord, I know you're with them, Lord, in their homes. And uh we know you're with us. For [music] wherever two or three are gathered, there I am in the midst. What a promise, Lord. As we heard, Lord, during the instrumental [music] songs, Lord, you're the way maker. You're the promisekeeper. Hallelujah. You're the light in the darkness, Lord. You're faithful, Lord God. you could swear by no greater. So you [music] swore by yourself that you would keep your covenant. You would keep your promises. Thank you for a blood covenant through the blood of Jesus Christ. [music] Hallelujah. Perfect sacrifice means perfect cleansing, perfect loosing from our sins. Thank you, God, that we're washed perfectly [music] by the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.

I've had a dollar [singing] to my name and I've had friends that walked away and I've even lost myself a time or two. There [music] were bridges crossed and burned. Through all the wreckage I have learned, there's one thing that I could never lose. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I [singing] could ever need. Take [music] this world away from me and I'll be okay. [music] I got Jesus. [singing] There's a hope that's living deep inside. Joy [music] that I could never hide and a safe [singing] place to fall. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. I've seen weakness turned astray. I've seen failures met with grace. And it's not from what I've done. It's Christ in [music] me. A miracle [singing] I can't explain. He has given me his [singing] name. I'm the [music] richest man that I could ever be. [music] I got Jesus. all [music and singing] that I could ever need. Take this world away from me and I'll be [singing and music] okay. My God, Jesus, there's a hope that's [music] living deep inside. Joy that I could [singing] never hide. [music] Safe place to fall. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. Someday that trumpet's going to sound [music] and the king [singing] of heaven will ride upon the clouds coming [music] down. And I'll hit my knees, [singing] oh Lord, and sings [music] my soul. I'm going home. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I [singing] could ever need. Take this world away from me. And I'll be okay. I got Jesus. There's a hope that's [singing] living deep inside. Joy that I could never hide. Safe place [singing] to fall. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. Amen. Amen. Let's take a few prayer requests [music] here. After this, we'll sing maybe a couple more songs here. Let's remember brother Jose. was uh plowing snow all night and he's sleeping right now. So, let's pray for him. [music] God will give him grace and strength. We want to pray for brother uh Ben Nurro. It looks like his appendix [music] uh is about to burst or something like that. So, he's going to have emergency surgery tomorrow. So, let's pray for our brother by God's grace. He's [music] coming in January, Lord willing. So, we want to pray for brother Ben that he'll recover well. He can come see us here uh very shortly by God's grace. Again, we [music] thank the Lord for Zer's testimony there about God protecting her through the snow. So, we thank [music] God for that. Let's pray for that 22-year-old uh Elijah who uh battling is [music] it leukemia? It's cancer. Okay. Let's pray for full recovery for him by the grace of the Lord. Anyone else have a need this morning that I can remember? Brother Chris. Yeah, that's right. Now, he's he's got pneumonia, right? Okay. Amen. Amen. So, I've never heard of that. What's it called? Bronculitis. Okay. It's a lung infection. Amen. We'll pray for that. We pray for that yesterday. Keep praying for that by God's grace with us. Nina's not Oh yeah. [music] Amen. Let's pray for our sister Nina. Okay. Biopsy. Amen. Let's pray for the biopsy. Amen, brother. Wonderful. We'll pray for that. It's also remember sickness.

We'd appreciate your prayers for healing for everyone by the grace of the Lord. That's right. I [music] think uh Naomi's baby was sick, right? Leel. So, let's pray for Leel by the grace of the Lord. I think that's it. Uh let me check see if I have any text messages, any prayer requests. No. Okay. Yeah, brother. Oh, yeah. I saw her uh Friday and her [music] surgery's tomorrow at 400 p.m. That's right. Thank you, brother. Let's pray for Hannah. And so, the doctors are going to they're going in to see, you know, why things [music] are leaking out of her uh belly button there. And if they can fix it, they'll fix it right then and there tomorrow. if they if they search it out and they realize there's more issues, then they'll come back later. So, let's pray that they can fix it tomorrow by God's [music] grace. That'd be very special. I appreciate you remember that, but I forgot about tomorrow 400 p.m. surgery. We've got it all. Let's pray for these [music] requests. We have it all with Jesus. Thank you, Lord. What a promise, Lord. You're the way maker, the promiseke keeper. God, we come by the blood of Jesus Christ today, [music] God. Forgive our sins. We've worshiped you, God. We've given you praise and honor. You are holy, holy, holy, holy. We join the cherubam. We join the seraraphim. We join [music] the heavenly host saying, "Holy, holy, holy. The whole earth is full of your glory. So, we love you today, God. We worship you. [music] You're holy. You're set apart. You're special, Lord God. Hallelujah. We just don't have [music] words to rightly put it. Of course, it's impossible to summarize an [music] eternal being, Lord, with human words, Lord. But we worship you with all we have today, God. We give you thanks. We cry holy today. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord God, for blessing us that we can be here, for blessing the saints that they can live stream, Lord God, that we [music] can all worship you and hear the word of Lord and offer these prayer requests to heaven, Lord God. We know they go past the ceiling, Lord God. They're not stopped by [music] the ceiling, but by faith, they go up to heaven as incense, Lord God, because you've forgiven our sins. We're perfectly forgiven [music] by the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And we're priests unto God to make intercession. So, in the name of Jesus Christ, [music] we ask for healing, Lord God, for all those that need it, Lord. Brother Ben Nurro, we pray for healing, Lord. just use the surgeons there that his appendix could be removed and he could be recovered [music] in the name of Jesus Christ that we could see him soon in a couple weeks. Lord, bless our brother. Give him grace and [music] strength to go through these uh sicknesses, these ailments, Lord God. [music] But strengthen him that he can continue to preach your word, Lord God, and strengthen the saints, Lord God. How we appreciate our brother, Lord. We ask for healing for Elijah with battling cancer at 22 years old. Lord, you've done it before. [music] We've heard different testimonies around the message and even my own mother. Lord, you're able to heal cancer. So, Father, we [music] ask for healing in Jesus name. Lord, extend the man's life. I pray, Lord God. The young man, Lord God, give him hope, Lord God, for a future, [music] Lord God. Hallelujah. Lord, may they be good thoughts, Lord [music] God. Hallelujah, for the future. Lord, ultimately, Lord, your plan is the best plan. So, God, we make our requests [music] known unto you. bless our brother. We pray he's a message believer. [snorts] So, Father, Lord, just reveal yourself to him. Reveal your will to our [music] brother Elijah there, God, in Kansas, in Jesus Christ's name. Touch sister [music] uh Lena, Lord, God, we just pray, God, for uh the thyroid that it would be healed, Lord, in Jesus name. Lord, as the biopsy [music] comes up, Lord, strengthen Lena's faith, Austin's faith, Lord God, our faith to believe that all things [music] are possible, Lord, to them that believe. Hallelujah. Lord, our lives are in your hands, Lord God. [music] Hallelujah. Everything works together for good. All things work together for the good to them that love the Lord. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord God. And this will work for your glory. [music] So give our sister a healing touch in Jesus Christ's holy name. Hallelujah. Touch her as well, Lord, with a [music] pregnancy, Lord Jesus. Give her grace and strength. Father, we ask it, Lord. God, be with Chris's [music] nephew there in the hospital, Lord God. We just pray you'd have a swift recovery, Lord. that your Holy Spirit touch his body, [music] God, that he'll recover, Lord God. Lord, how we hate to go through these seasons of [music] cold and sickness, but Lord, your grace gives us mercy each and every time. And we [music] ask for mercy again. We ask for the healing power of the Holy Spirit to touch the young boy, Lord, for your glory. [music] That Chris would magnify your name. All of us would magnify your holy name about your mercy and [music] about your healing powers, Lord Jesus. So minister to the child, we pray in the holy name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. We ask [music] it. Father, we ask God for healing for Hannah. Lord, God, thank you for her her courage, Lord, as I prayed with her. Father, I just ask, [music] God, that the surgeons could find the problem, Lord, about this leakage. And Lord, bring healing to it tomorrow, Lord, at 4 p.m., [music] God, just give her courage, Lord, give the parents, Lord, courage as well, Lord God. We're trusting in Almighty God. [music] Hallelujah. Make a way, Lord God, that the child could be healed and not have this leaking anymore for the glory of God. That she [music] can enjoy school, enjoy being a child, Lord God. Hallelujah. And peace can come upon this wonderful family. God, I ask it. Remember the parents there, Lord God. [music] Be with Hannah and the surgeons, God. Thank you for this technology. Thank you for your healing powers, [music] Lord, through uh doctors doing their part. And then, Lord, you're the only one that can heal, Father. So God, we thank you. All praise and glory and honor [music] goes to thy name. And Lord, just like Luther, the physician, you used him, God, use these physicians, God, for your glory. Father God, we commit [music] this service into your hands, God. And I pray you bless the preaching of thy word and our our worship and our prayers, Lord God. Thank you again [music] for safe travel that we could be here, Lord. We ask for another wonderful week here, Lord, coming up. [music] God, give us grace, Lord, to do your will, Lord God. You'll continue to provide, Lord, all things, [music] God. May we continue to surrender to you, Lord, all of our lives, all of our [music] worship, all of our praise, God. We trust you with our lives. Bless this uh preaching of thy word and the singing [music] here in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Let's uh pick it up a little bit here by God's grace. Jesus, I'll never forget what you've done for me. again. Jesus, [music and singing] I'll never forget what you done for me. Jesus, I'll never forget how you [music] set me free. Jesus, [singing] I'll never forget how [music] you brought me out. [music] Never [singing] forget. And [music and singing] how can I forget what you've done for me? [music] How can [singing] I forget how you've set me free? How [music and singing] can I forget how you brought me out? [music] How can I forget no [music] ever? He's done so much for me that I cannot [music] tell [singing] it all. I cannot tell it all. No, I cannot tell it all. [music] He's done so much for me that I cannot tell [music and singing] it all. He has taken my sins [singing] away. Oh, he's been so good to me that I [singing] cannot tell it all. [music] I cannot tell it all. I cannot [singing] tell it all. He's [music] been so good to me that I cannot tell it all. He has taken my sins away. Bring [music and singing] up a well down in my soul. Bring up a well and make thee whole. Bring up [singing] a give to me and love abundantly. [music] How can I forget? &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; How can [music] I forget what you've done? How [music and singing] can I forget how you set me free? And how can I forget how you [singing] brought me? Thank you, Lord. Oh, how can I [music] forget your name? He's done well. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; He's done [music] so much for me that I cannot tell it all. [music] I cannot tell it all. Oh, I cannot tell it all. He's [music] done so much for me [singing] that I cannot tell it all. He has taken my sins away. Amen. I thank God. Hallelujah. Amen. And that's the best part. He took our sins away. Praise God. Amen. Let's take our Bibles here. Uh by God's grace, let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 16. I think by the help of the Lord, we'll finish the book today. It's been 30 sermons on this book. And uh it's been really wonderful. By God's grace, I trust you've enjoyed it. 1 Corinthians chapter 16. We'll just read verse one here. by the grace of God. I was thinking on this and know just what a book this is. What a church this was. And then I was just thinking again this morning, this is a church that baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Right? This is a church uh that believed God was one person, right? This is a book of Acts church. They had the right water baptism. They had faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. But they had a lot of problems just because of the sin nature. Now Paul will address it in the next book. He'll talk about the seal of the Holy Ghost. And so obviously, you know, Paul doubted some of these people were sealed by the Holy Ghost just like he doubted in Galatia that they had the new birth because they'd brought legalism into the the faith. And he called them fools because of that. Uh but still despite all this, Paul shows a lot of grace and a lot of love. And that's what we want to remember too. When people struggle in the church, we want to show them a lot of grace and a lot of love. Amen. Chapter 16 here, verse one. Let's just read verse one here. Then we can be seated here. Let's read it on three. One, two, three. Now, concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. May God add his blessing to the reading of the word. You can be seated. I have some notes here. We'll show here by God's grace. I just love how uh the previous chapter ended there uh as we looked at on Wednesday night. Thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Let's feel victorious today. Praise God. All victory is in Jesus. And because of that, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Amen. So, obviously, this was a large church. Remember, Jesus told Paul, I have many people in this city, and I don't know if they gathered in one church or just in numerous house churches there in Corinth. We don't we're not really told uh where they actually gathered and how many people there were, but there was many people saved in Corinth according to the Lord Jesus. And so he would encourage he would of course bring correction to all those that needed correction, but then he would encourage all the faithful, keep going, keep standing uh by the grace of God. And so here in chapter 16, he brings a close to the book. And hard to believe we're here at the end. We're here at this the ninth section here of the thoughts that CI Scoffield gives at least to outline this book. And we're looking at his closing instructions and greetings. And I just counted them up. I just I think I put 10 sins on here that he found in the church. I added one here in here. We saw the division because of uh some people liked some preachers better than others. Sexual morality. And I added this one. They weren't mourning over that. There were certain groups they they weren't sad about the sin in the church, right? So they they'd gotten so used to the sexual sin they didn't even mourn over it. The Bible said, Paul said they were puffed up about it. So again, just a really awful condition there. They were suing each other, getting drunk at the Lord's table. Uh the rich were not, you know, uh giving food to the poor at communion. Uh they were out of order with their spiritual gifts. And I think it's clear too now that I thought about it, you know, whim the women were asking questions out loud during the services. So they must have had some type of a big room and and the women would sit there and try to ask questions during the service. And Paul said, "Let your women ask questions at home. Ask your husbands at home." So there must have been some type of tradition in Corinth that the women could shout out during uh the religious services. And Paul tells them they're to be silent in the church. They're not supposed to preach the word of God and let them ask their questions at home. And that's how it would be, church. You know, that's how be, you know, imagine if I'm preaching and and there's uh uh adults in the back whispering and asking questions in the back, right? While I'm preaching, you know, we'd all be distracted, right? We'd all be uh we'd all be unable to focus on what was going on. But this is what was happening in the church, a book of Acts church that had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So, uh just immaturity, right? A lot of immaturity. Uh but uh God sent Paul to correct the immaturity. And then there were some that were saying there was no resurrection. Paul called them foolish as we saw on Wednesday night. And as we'll see today, they lack some generosity. And we'll actually see it even into the uh book of second Corinthians. As we'll see, they also suffered a lot of false teachers uh in the church as well. Now, I just want to lay this out because I've been learning this as well as I've been studying it. Paul actually wrote four letters to the Corinthians. We only got two of them because if you pay attention, you know, uh, to these words in 1 Corinthians 5:9, Paul said, "I wrote to you that you would not keep company with fornicators." So Paul had already written them one letter. Okay? And then they wrote back because Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, he said, "I'm going to address your questions from your letter." And it was about marriage. And he he said, "If you're burning, get married." Remember that? He talked about those who had been separated. So Paul already wrote one letter. We don't we don't have this letter. Uh we have Paul's second letter which we call first Corinthians because that's the first letter we have. And then Paul says when he's writing second Corinthians, he says he wrote another letter that brought them to tears because he cared so much about them. Um and he didn't uh he didn't he didn't really want to make them cry, but he knew he had to bring them to repentance. And so then then he writes the letter of second Corinthians. So, there's actually four letters uh that Paul writes unto them, and we're just getting two of them. Uh I think in heaven, we'll get to read all four. Praise God. We'll really know because remember down through the ages, we'll take an age and we'll look at God's kindness to the Corinthians. Praise God. God's kindness to the Akran saints, all of us. Amen. Or we'd say maybe the Leoian church age. will take an age where God will explain and maybe he'll put it up on his big uh television screen, you know, the heavenly screen, and we'll see how God was so faithful to us down through the ages. We'll see that he never left us. He never forsook us. So, just keep that in mind that there's uh there's there's different interactions with Paul and the Corinthians. Despite there only being two letters, Paul was interacting with them. Now um in verse one now concerning the collection of the saints as I've given order to the churches of Galatia even so do ye. So Paul gave an order as an apostle as the man that started the church he gave an order to collect money and he said do it on the first day of the week. Now we also know in acts chapter 20 the believers always met on the first day of the week. So this is one thing that separated the Christians from the Jews because the Jews would meet on Saturday, right? Because their Sabbath started Friday night and it went to Saturday night. That was their day. Okay? But our days basically start at 12:00 a.m., right? And go to the next 12 a.m. So our days are slightly different. But that immediately set Christians apart. They worshiped on Sunday because that's the day our Lord resurrected. And Jews would worship on Saturday. Now, there's nothing wrong with taking a day of rest like Charlie Kirk did. You know, he he uh he honored the the Saturday Sabbath, right? There's there's no there's no harm in doing that. I have a a friend named Dan Danny Finley. He does the same thing from Friday night to Saturday night. He shuts his phone down and he just reads and eats good food in his home with his wife and they have friends over. And that sounds like pretty good, right? Sounds pretty good. I don't know how I could do that though with nine children. Um and he and he and he expresses a lot of great uh victory in that uh maybe for him. And so that's a Christian liberty. You know, like the Bible says, one man will esteem one day holy, another man won't. But the Bible said just be fully persuaded in your own minds. The point we need to make is that there needs to be one day we rest and don't work. And that's Sunday for us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. We should physically rest Sunday and just give God the whole day. But in one way, we rest every day of the week &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is rest for the soul. That's in Hebrews 4. So, just keep your spot there. Let me read uh let's read that if you forgot about that. And good for the live streamers, too. I I just had a a sister email me this week saying she streams most of our services. So, uh because they don't have a pastor and we have numerous people that send us our tithes and they don't even go here. Uh they really help keep our church open by God's grace. It's quite gracious of God to do that. Hebrews 4. Let's go there. Uh verse one says, "Let us therefore fear less a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it." So there is a New Testament rest. It's the rest for the soul. Hallelujah. And um now let's go down here. I don't want to skip it. I didn't have it this written out down especially but I don't want to miss it. Let's just go to verse nine because we can clear clear clearly see it there. There remainth therefore a rest for the people of God. So Paul recognizes here the Old Testament had a rest. It was Saturday but there remains a greater rest than that. Just keeping Saturday uh like our Seventh Day Adventist friends like Master McCra used to be a Seventh Day Adventist. Just doing that that wasn't enough. God gave us something greater in the New Testament. For he that has entered into his rest, he hath also ceased from his own works as God did from his. So now we see the Christian rest is stopping your sinful life and it's resting in God's life. Right? We're doing the works of God. In other words, I've stopped living for the world like I used to when I was a sinner. I've ceased from that and now I'm doing the works of Christ. And then I love verse 11 and 12. Let us therefore labor to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. So it's only unbelief that's going to keep some from entering into the Holy Ghost New Testament rest. For the word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to dividing a sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. You know, I had this happen. I the Lord used me to discern someone's life on Monday night. Malachi when after he gave his testimony on Monday night, uh this young man came up and he said, uh he said, "Jesse, can you give me some psalms that would really help me? I'm really struggling with depression and things like that." And the very psalm I sent him later, he texted me and said, "That's the one I was looking for." He said, "My I was hungering in my heart for that one, and that's the one you sent me. Praise God." And so I told him, "That's that that's Hebrews 4:12." Uh Hebrews 4:12 shows how the word of God knows the thoughts and intents of your heart. And when that is revealed to you or when God gives you the desire of your heart, that's a sign that the living word is working in our midst. Hallelujah. So, uh we want to see that there that uh Christians worship on Sunday. Now, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, they they're against the Catholic Church, which is good in many ways, but just so you know, they believe the mark of the beast is worshiping on Sunday. And they believe that's what the Catholic Church is going to force everybody to take the mark, which is worshiping on Sunday. So, just so you know, um uh that that's that's their whole uh idea. That's their hypothesis about how the mark is going to come down, right? But we know brother Ram said with thus sayith the Lord. It's unionized religion is the mark of the beast. In other words, you have to join in with their unionized group. Religion is going to be like a union. You got to join the union of religion. And it's a uniting with the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestants. But we'll never do that because we're united to Christ. Hallelujah. We're not united to denomination or united in any other way. We're only united to Jesus Christ. Now Paul says uh I gave an order that we need to collect money and bring your money on the first day of the week as God has prospered you. So God doesn't ask us to give things we don't have. God only asks us to give what we do have. And he said when I come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. So Paul said, "You're going to write me a letter back, and you'll tell me the men that are going to carry this money to Jerusalem." All right. And verse four, "And if it be me that I go also, they shall go with me." So Paul ordered all numerous churches to to collect money and send it to Jerusalem because of the famine. Remember the famine that Agabus foretold? He said, "There'll be a great dir throughout the land." Agabus said that with thus sayeth the Lord. And it came to pass in Paul's day. And now that dirt had not reached Paul, right, in Galatia and Ephesus and uh Corinth, the dirt had not reached there. It was mainly there around Jerusalem. So Paul said, "Let's let's show our Jewish brethren some love and let's send them some money because they're really hurting right now and they need food and they need uh their necessities met." So he he gave an order. I order you to bring some free will offerings. Well, how would you feel if I did that today? Amen. How would you feel if uh uh your pastor did that or some other preacher said, "I feel ordered and I I order you by the Holy Spirit to bring some offerings." Amen. But this was Paul was an apostle. They knew that he had seen Jesus. Hallelujah. He had the testimony. He had the miracles. He had the reputation that he met Jesus. So Paul could give those orders. He started the church. So they trusted him by his experience with Christ. Hallelujah. And Paul said, 'I'm willing to go even uh with your messengers to Jerusalem if needed. If you want me to go with them to make sure the money gets there, I'll go with them. So Paul had a a very willing spirit to make sure the people knew their money was being used the right way. Hallelujah. Now verse five. Now I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia, for I do pass through Macedonia, and it may be that I will abide yay. Now notice he's using may, right? May. We'll see later in the second or the in the fourth letter, which is the second letter to the Corinthians, that Paul had to change his plans. He said, but notice he uses may and if the Lord willing. And it may be that I will abide yay in winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whethersoever I go. So that's how the old days were with travel. If you got stuck one place in winter, you're there all winter, right? You're not traveling in winter in those days. The roads and the vehicles weren't good enough. And Paul says, if I go to you and it's winter time, I'll have to stay there. Now, I like how Paul says this, I'm going to come to you. Because some of them had pridefully said that Paul would not come to them anymore. Remember they said that Paul would just write really harsh letters, but he wouldn't come to see them face to face. But Paul said, "No, I'm going to come talk to you face to face." Because some of them were saying, "Well, Paul can rebuke us by letter, but he won't come rebuke us to our face." Well, we find out later he does. He writes about it in the second letter. And remember, there was a click in the church that did not accept Paul, right? That's how you have it. And you know, some most churches have a click where they don't go along with the pastor. Maybe they don't go around with some preachers. They don't go along. They don't go along with the song service. You know, there was a couple years ago that there was a certain group at another church, not our church, but another church. They didn't like how the song service was being run. And so, they expressed numerous uh times about their their desire for it to change. And when it didn't change, they just up and left. You know, you always have you just have clicks sometimes of people that want things run their way. Now, if there's a sin, then then it's not addressed. Well, then yes, I would leave, too. If there was a sin and it wasn't addressed, right? But now, you know, uh we just don't want to uh we just don't want to make a click about something, right? We just don't want to make a a fuss about something if we just have a little difference on something and it's not a scriptural difference or there's not a good reason we should have a difference. Okay? So, uh I I think our church is pretty good with that by God's grace and we're thankful. Like I said, I'm very thankful for that that we don't have those 10 sins going on in our church. Praise God. And we have the same Lord Jesus Christ baptism. Amen. The same gospel and same revelation, the same mysteries finished by the grace of God. We're thankful for that. Uh but Paul still wants to come see them. And we know he does come see them as we'll get to in the next book. Verse seven, for I will not see you now by the way, but I trust to Terry a while with you if the Lord permits. So Paul was a very mature believer. He said, uh, I'll stay with you if God is willing. And that's what we want to remember to always say. Well, next year I'll do this if God is willing. &gt;&gt; Right? That shows maturity. It shows like you, it shows that you understand you can't plan out the future. You're doing everything by God's grace. So Paul was very mature when he spoke about future events. if the Lord's willing or by God's grace, if God will give me grace, I'll do this or that. Verse eight, but I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. So, this is this is important to know. Paul wrote this letter while he was at Ephesus. And if you know the book of Acts, well, then you can kind of see the time period when he wrote this letter. And uh so we'll look at that here in the scripture by God's grace. Verse nine, for a great door and effectual which is a powerful door or an active door is open unto me and there are many adversaries. So Paul was there in Ephesus when he wrote to the church in Corenth. And remember how it all started? 12 people receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That that's a great open door. Amen. Hallelujah. You get 12 saints that are on fire filled with the Holy Ghost. That's a great start to a church. Hallelujah. Even brother Ram said that was the candlestick that John wrote about. Remember that was the candlestick um that if they didn't keep their first love, God would take away their candlestick. &gt;&gt; God would take the church out of Ephesus if they failed to repent. And history says a lot of them failed to repent. So the church was scattered and the believers left Ephesus after I think it was 20ome odd years if I'm not mistaken. But the move of Ephesus started right with 12 receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He preached there for three years according to Acts 20:31. And remember Paul cried on all their necks when he left. They were all crying because they knew he was going to Rome. They'd never see him again. Uh at least on this side by by God's grace. But right now they're with him in glory. Amen. They'll they saw Paul again. They're seeing Paul right now. Praise God. But it still broke their hearts to know that I'll never see him in flesh the rest of my days. Bye. And church. Now, we get this understanding that when God opens a door, there might be adversaries or there might not be. Now, everyone's going to have trials and trouble, but some adversaries will be greater than others. And so Paul says there's going to be many there was many adversaries in Ephesus, but yet God was with him. And remember, Jesus himself had to come to Paul to tell him stay in Corinth. Yeah. Stay in Corinth. preach there. Let's read that. Let's go. Let's hit that here. Acts 18. I think that would be helpful for you to see. In other words, I want you to see that. It's Acts 18. Because there might be a time that you're fearful. There might be a time you feel like running away from your problems. And if you do, cry out to God and God will show you what to do. &gt;&gt; Because remember when uh the Roman government was going to kill all the Christians, I'm sorry, all the Jews in Rome. The Bible said they left Rome and then they came back when they got a new emperor. Okay? So, there's times God does scatter us, right? Because of awful conditions, maybe fearful conditions. But then there's times God wants us to stay despite fearful conditions. Uh verse 9, Acts 18:9, and this is Paul founding the church in Corenth. Verse 9 says, "Then spake the Lord to Paul in the in night by a vision, be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace." So Paul was afraid to speak in Corenth, right? But Paul God or Jesus tells him, "Don't be afraid. Keep preaching the word of God." Verse 10. Now, how how can he have courage? Because Jesus is with him. How can you have courage because Jesus is with you? And no man shall set on thee to hurt thee, for I have much people in this city. and that he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them. So this was when Paul started the church. This was before Paul Paul wrote the first of those four letters. So everybody see that he wrote four letters but Paul founded it here in Acts 18. And after he left he wrote the first letter then the second letter the third letter and then he wrote the fourth letter after that. And so what did he do? He stayed there a year, six, 18 months teaching the word of God among them. So now church, now you could understand if you're ever fearful, should I do this or fearful, should I do do that? Should I move? Should I stay here? Should I go somewhere else? Whenever you're fear fearful, cry out to God. And God, if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, he'll show you whether to stay or go from your fear. And he'll give you grace to overcome your fears. Hallelujah. So I think that's important to see there. Uh and then Paul when he went to Ephesus, God called it a or he called it a great door. That was a powerful active open door to him and he'd have many adversaries. Now in Akran, I don't I don't know. I'd say we maybe have not had many adversaries. We've had a few adversaries in Akran, but I wouldn't say many because Paul gives us a list. Look at this list of Paul's uh adversaries out of Acts chapter 19 and 20. Uh he had to face people's hearts who were hardened by unbelief. Hard-hearted people. Now, we've had to face that. Uh spiritual conflicts. Remember that big economic persecution and riot. Remember Paul uh cast a demon out of the the woman there and it and it caused their her owners there to get upset because they were going to lose money. Uh and it caused a great riot. Remember for two hours they shouted, "Great is Diana. Great is Diana." They had such a a big riot there and Paul was his life was threatened. Now our lives have never been threat threatened for being Christians, have they? So that's why I said we might have faced some adversary, but we haven't faced many adversaries. Brother Chris, &gt;&gt; let me see, brother. Yes. Let me see. I thought it was, but I could be wrong. Let me see. Yeah, brother. Yeah. Uh, it might not be. Let me check. I thought it was, but I could be wrong on that one, brother. I remember the Bible said he was grieved. So, let me look up grieved in his spirit. Oh, it's Acts 16. So, no brother, I got that wrong. So, thank you for that. Really helped uh by God's grace. That was Acts chapter 16. It was verse 18. Yeah, this is a different uh he did rebuke. Oh, yeah. Evil spirits uh did he did deal with evil spirits here and exorcist. Let's read that Acts. Yeah, we might read the Acts 19:13. Then certain of the Vagabond Jews, exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth." Okay? These are the seven sons ofKeva. Okay? And they tried to cast out devils. Those devils knew Paul. They knew Jesus, but they didn't know the seven sons ofKeva. And when people heard about that, the Bible said great fear fell upon them. So that's verse 17. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus. Okay. Oh yeah. And also Paul Yeah. Uh yeah. Let's go back up to verse 12. A lot of his handkerchiefs were laid on people. They took handkerchiefs from his body, laid them on people, and demons uh evil spirits went out from them. So people got disease or healed from demon powers. So devils were cast out just by the cloths of Paul's body, you know, from his body laying on sick people and demonpossessed people. So, good question, bro. Yes, good question. Um, and then verse 18. And many that believe came and confessed and shued their deeds. Now, I love verse 19 because they they throw all their magical arts books in a big pile and they burn it. So, again, shows how many people were delivered from spirits of witchcraft. Verse 19. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men. And they counted the price of them and found at 50,000 pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. Hallelujah. So good, good question, brother. Good. Let's give them to class. Amen. So the other woman was in uh I'm already forgetting that one. Uh what was it? Yeah, chapter 16. That's right. Yes. I didn't turn enough pages. Yeah, Philippi. That was in Philippi. Yes. By God's grace. And then um in Ephesus, they cast out demons with the prayer cloths. Demons came out just by laying them on uh the uh sick and the demon-possessed. So, thank you, brother. And then he had a near-death experience. And also, Ephesus is where he fought the beast. Remember we preached on that last week. He would be Paul was put into a coliseum and had to fight off beasts. So, we know by God's grace he didn't die, right? God gave him favor. And of course, the emotional suffering when they left each other, that was what we're talking about. They were crying on the Christian brothers were crying on his neck when they accompanied him to the boat where he was going to sail towards Rome. So, he said many adversaries, right? There was many trials. My goodness, wrestling animals, uh calls for his life to be uh threatened and killed. Uh and so we've had adversity in Akran, but nothing like that. But remember, brother Ram says, "With thus sayith the Lord, the same persecution in Rome will come to the United States someday. We don't know if we have to live to see it or not. But either way, God's grace will give us power for that hour." Right? God's grace, if God gave Paul grace, God will give us grace if we have to go through that. Uh because God is faithful. Amen. Now, I just thought I want to look at this thought. I just thought saw the scripture about open doors and uh these these Christian brothers gave wrote a commentary in the 1800s and they showed like four different verses about open doors in the Bible. Uh the Bible said there's a door of hope. The Bible says there's a door of faith. The Bible says there's an open door and the Bible said there's a door of utterance. So the reason I go through that is just for so you and I we'll see opportunities in our lives as open doors. So I feel like Malachi got an open door to share his testimony there, right? And that has opened up friendships, right, with other individuals. Hallelujah. And each one of us whenever we get an opportunity to whether it's to testify, preach, or even sing, that's an open door. God has given us a a channel or an opportunity to share the love of Jesus Christ. It's open doors. And I just thought I would read the I just studied a little bit on the the the door of hope this morning. In Hosea, God said he was going to give Israel a door of hope. And she sh she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she come up out of the land of Egypt. Now the door of hope was in the valley of Acor which was the same valley. It was near the Jordan River uh where Achen and his family were swallowed up. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, not swallowed up. They were stoned there. That's right. Stoned. And so God told Israel many years later, I'm going to turn this place of destruction and judgment. I'm going to turn this into a place of mercy and restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you know, the valley of Acor, in other words, it had a negative connotation for all these years. Oh, judgment, judgment. But God tells Israel in the days of Hosea, I'm gonna make this a valley of hope. In other words, hallelujah. So God's door of hope was Israel taking the idols out of their mouths. In other words, saying worshiping the wrong thing and renewing God's covenant among them and making them a faithful wife rather than a disobedient wife. So we see a place of judgment can become a place of mercy which is just like Ephesus which was just like Corinth. Beforehand they were filthy cities but the grace of God comes to them and saves men and women makes them saints. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now God has taken a filthy place and at least cleaned out a portion of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Akan used to have a Akran used to be a place with no message church but now there's a message church. Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, God's given hope in a very sinful city. That's what we see God did with Ephesus. That's what God did with Corinth. God does it with Akran. God does it with Napoleon. God does it with Albian. God did it in Sheffield. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so God specializes in turning bad situations into good ones. We could have a bad marriage, but God can turn it good. We could have children that go against God, but then they turn to following God. &gt;&gt; We could have a church situation that was bad. I I wrote the wrong word there. The church the church situation would have been bad, but then it turns into good. &gt;&gt; Work situations, you name it. Businesses, whatever uh you know, any of your endeavors, any of your talents, it it could uh start as something bad, but then God can change into something good. &gt;&gt; God specializes in that. Hallelujah. Now verse 10 he says now if Timothy has come to Corenth see that he may be you or be with you without fear. So Paul knew there was people at Corenth that would try to intimidate anyone associated with him. And so Paul says if he comes don't let people put him in a state of fear like they're going to hurt or reject Timothy. make sure he feels love that he's welcomed at your church for he workketh the work of the Lord as I also do. So apparently there must have been some people at Corinth that would try to intimidate the preachers. Hallelujah. Tell the preachers what to preach, right? And then there were even some people that would despise anyone associated with Paul. Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me. For I look for him with the brethren. Hallelujah. So Paul knew there might be people that would mistreat anyone associated. They despise anyone associated with Paul. And Paul said, "Make sure he's given a peaceful welcome when he comes to the church." Hallelujah. Now, what again, what a what an awful situation this church was. Paul knew it's possible there could be some people that would intimidate anyone associated with Paul. How sad. What a sad condition that would be. So Paul says, in other words, give him love, brotherly kindness. Don't give him harshness. And we love Timothy, don't we? He was Paul's spiritual son in the gospel. And no one was more likeminded to Paul than Timothy. Yet we'd say amongst some message people, he was a hybrid because he his parents were from two different nationalities. Right? Now, we wouldn't say that, but deceived message people would. They would say, "Well, he's not fully Jew or he's not fully Greek, and he's he's from a mixed marriage or something like that." That's only what a carnal person would say. &gt;&gt; So, I love this. I love how God put it there in the scripture. That it doesn't matter your parents what nationalities they were. It matters that God is your spiritual parent. Hallelujah. And so, you you could be of mixed uh nationalities. You could be from a mixed marriage. And think of that. You could be from a mixed natural marriage but still be most likeminded as the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; So that's why I love Timothy. He's such a wonderful example. And Paul Paul was able to recognize, wow, he's he's got parents from different nations, yet he's still the one who's most focused on the message of the hour. I take courage from that church. I don't know about you, but I take courage from that. Praise God. Because uh I I'm I'm not associated with William Brandham. I never met him. My parents didn't know him. My parents were basically uh not faithful to church, you know, most of growing up most of my life there. But even out of that, God can bring redemption out of a family maybe that doesn't look right, doesn't seem right to other people. I want to be most likeminded all the Bible writers and brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And I think you want that as well. Shouldn't every preacher want that? Hallelujah. To be most likeminded as the authors of the Bible. So I take courage from that. I hope you take courage from that as well. &gt;&gt; That it doesn't matter. Your past doesn't matter. What matters is your relationship with Jesus right now. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And as touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren. So Paul was hoping the Apollos could come back. Remember, he'd already preached there and a lot of them loved Apollos. He said, "But his will was not at all to come at this time. He will come when he shall have convenient time or an opportunity to to come at the right time. Now, you remember Apollos, right? He was an eloquent preacher. He never stuttered. Probably he never spit. You know, he was probably just so perfectly eloquent. And we're thankful for eloquent preachers. I'm not making fun of them. I love eloquent preachers. I love somebody that can just deliver it. There's no stuttering and there's no confusion. They don't forget things. They just know exactly what they're going to say and they say it. Hallelujah. I love preachers like that. I'll never be one of those, but I love preachers like that. Amen. Um, and he was mighty, but this is something we can all I can strive to be. I can strive to be mighty in the scripture. In other words, to to give myself to finding the word of God, knowing the word of God, quoting the word of God, being able to rightly divide the word of God as best as I possibly can. That's what I strive to do. And remember, if some had pridefully gravitated towards Apollos and then they would say at church, "Well, I wish Apollos would come. I I'd rather have him preach than Peter. I'd rather have Apollos than Paul come." Pastor, why don't you invite Apollos back? We get all these other preachers too too much, you know? And I'm a follower of Apollos because he's the most clear speaker. No doubt he was. No doubt he was. But it it it shouldn't take that shouldn't cause brothers to fight against other brothers or sisters. Right now, I like here what Paul says too. You know, Paul didn't condemn Apollos's decision not to come to Corenth at that season. And church, this is a a principle I've actually used a lot down through the years, ever since 2013. That was my last trip to South America. I had to make a decision. They kept inviting me back, but I had to make a decision. And I've been been invited to India. I've been been invited to Africa, different places. And I just tell them, I'm sorry I can't come now. I'll try to come at a convenient season. I've got to come at a time where there's it's the right opportunity to come. And the reason is this is of course because of my family. Um I feel like I should stay with my family rather than travel in evangelism. Uh numerous preachers have told me stay with your family [clears throat] especially especially during the early years while your children are young and even teenage years. Uh because I've had a couple preachers warn me, you know, they told me I one one in particular said, "I've left my children so much that I think it caused some of them not to believe." and they started hanging around with a lot of uh young people that got them into porn and movies and worldliness and girls wearing pants and makeup and uh it's important uh so to me this scripture always stuck out to me. I have to make sure when I do something uh that I'm truly called to do it and I know it's God's time and season for me to do it. Hallelujah. And you know, another opportunity, another example of this is I won't invite preachers to come during the winter time, you know, if they live far away because I don't want them to slip on the ice, right? I don't want them to I don't want them to have to cancel their visit because of snow or ice. So, I try to invite maybe brothers only uh from really close locations to come in the wintertime. But I like how Paul was, you know, Paul didn't condemn Apollos and say, "Well, he didn't want to come and he should have came." He understood that there's a right time and season for all the ministry to be done. Now he starts bringing this down to a close church here by God's grace. Now he starts a new thought here. Now isn't this interesting church? You know uh he begins closing the letter and he says, "Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men and be strong." He gives four uh four we'd say commissions in one simple verse. But this is powerful advice considering there are nine or 10 sin problems. I think I added one. Uh so don't pay attention to the nine there. I think I added 10 there. So Paul gives advice, watch, which means give strict attention to the your church and how the the devil might try to get into the church. other words, just just like when we're driving on the ice out here, right? You really got to pay a lot of attention while you're driving on ice. I can't look at the billboards. I can't look at that nice that lawn or that yard or that that that business. You got to say, "Right, I have your eyes right on the road, right? Somebody might stop right in front of you, right? Then you got to slam on your brakes. You go slide in the snow." So, it's a good reminder even as I was driving today, give strict attention to the church. In other words, all of us here and those at home need to watch what's going on in the church. Are any evil spirits trying to get into the church? Remember, brother Random said, u Satan won't let your church stay happy. Remember he said that in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He said, "You're happy now." He said, "But Satan won't let you stay that way." He said either he'll inject somebody with poison injection and then send them into the church or he'll go inside the church and inject someone with poison and try to take the love and the joy out of the church. Now, we've just seen that this year. But we went we went through numerous years where there's just all this love and all this joy, which is wonderful. I took a picture. I might share with the church uh and maybe I'll put it up uh I'll put it up maybe on Wednesday night or something like that. But back in 2017, you know, there was so much joy and revival. I don't know if everybody remembers me sharing this picture. When we first got back into this sanctuary, we were I could just feel the revival and I would take pictures like this and every hand in the whole church was raised up during song service and people were shouting, "Brother Andy was the song leader." Now, you guys might not remember that, might remember that, but there was such a a season of joy and victory and revival. Uh, and I I would take I would just sit back as a pastor and take pictures that like, man, what a what a time of victory. What a time. You know, some of these people, I could tell their stories. They didn't have home churches and God brought them here and they were just on fire. You know, they uh uh and some of them had just left churches and um some of them had had their marriages restored. Some people in here were just uh recently coming the message within a couple years. And so a lot of people had their first love when we took those pictures and then time happens and then adversity comes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so this is awesome advice. This is powerful advice for all of us because we're going to go through times when oh my everything's it's easy to serve God. It's wonderful to serve God. Everybody's on fire, but then we're going to go through some times where there's a lot of adversity and difficulty. So, this this picture, I just found that on the online yesterday and took a screenshot like that. So, encap encapsulates how churches go through different times and seasons. But in any time and season, this is what we need to do. Watch and give strict attention to the two spirits in the framework of the church. And then stand fast in the faith. Continue. In other words, continue standing in the faith. Don't lay down, right? Don't remember the series we preach on, we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Don't let the devil wrestle you down and try to choke out your testimony for God. So stand right. Don't get wrestled down where you have nothing to testify about. You have no victory in your life. Don't get wrestled down. Stand for the faith. Watch for the enemy. And then he says, "Quit, you like men." And that's not something we'd say uh today. But in those days, it meant be brave like a man. Okay? So don't Yep. You can't be fearful amongst evil spirits or people going through problems. You got to bravely do it. And what's the brave way? Go talk to them one- on- one. That's the brave way. Don't talk to somebody else about somebody else's problem. You go talk to that person if you're concerned about that person's problems. That's bravery. That's real Christian bravery. And then he says, "Be strong." So keep strengthening. Keep working out spiritually. Hallelujah. You might want to do it naturally, too. Amen. It's helped me a little bit by God's grace. A little exercise profits a little. Praise God. You get a little bit of profit. But look at that. It's a four-fold uh encouragement. Watch, stand, be brave, be strong. And this was spoken to a church with 10 sins in it, right? 10 sinful situations that had to get worked through. So Paul is talking to those who are strong, keep being strong. Try, in other words, try to hold this church together because this church has a lot of problems. And church, if you're honest, this h this this this will be helpful in your marriage, right? This will be helpful in your home life. This will be helpful with your family that's not in the message. &gt;&gt; Do all of this, right? Give strict attention to what are the spirits working in my family? My brothers, my sisters, my mother, my grandparents. What spirits are working around here? Help me to stand in the faith. Help me to be brave. Help me to get stronger. Hallelujah. Verse 14. Is it any surprise Paul brings love back into this? He's gone through all their problems and it's like circling back. This is all about love. Let all thing all your things be done with charity. And we saw remember charity can bear all things. &gt;&gt; Charity can suffer through anything, right? It won't quit. It won't give up. If anything can get through a trial, it is the love of God that can get you through a trial. And remember I think six times brother Ram said it in his 1957 uh Sunday school message on book of Corinthians book of correction charity is your anchor. So as all the storms come through this church or any church the anchor that will hold you is the love of God that will keep you from that will keep your ship from getting capsized and sinking. Right? The love of God. Hallelujah. So our anchor is the love of God. Verse 15, I beseech you. Now this word means to beg or to summon you to give you a charge or a commission. I beseech you brethren, you know the house of Stfanis that it is the first fruits of Aaya and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints. All right. All right. Now, this is the only time the word addicted is used in the whole Bible. Hallelujah. Now, another word for it is stronghold. Right? Somebody people can have strongholds or addictions in their human spirits or in their bodies uh possession, demon possession or oppression. But here Paul gives a good example of being addicted. And this is the kind of addiction we want to have church. Hallelujah. Paul says remember the house of Stfanis. This must have been a wonderful man of God because he became addicted to serving the body of Christ. Now the modern English definition of addiction is unable to stop or I'm dependent on that. So Stfanis and his house were unable to stop helping the the church members. So that's what you and I need. We need this attitude where I'm just going to keep helping. I'm not going to stop helping my brother. I'm not going to stop helping my sister. Hallelujah. I've been addicted to the ministry of the saints. And it's awesome. So, so it's awesome to see despite having all these problems, there were some faithful saints that were addicted to serving. I'll say like this, the love of God had made them addicted to serving the saints. &gt;&gt; Right? Because we see in verse 14, what is it? It's love. Love causes you to be addicted to serving the saints. That's why you don't quit this church and go somewhere else. Well, I'll quit pastoring. I'll go somewhere else. The love of God makes you addicted and faithful to serving the family of God where God's called you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 16. So now Paul says that ye submit yourselves unto such the house of Stfanis and to everyone that helpeth with us and labor. Hallelujah. So Paul says there's this family in the church. They're addicted to serving the saints. And Paul says you should all follow their example. Amen. So see church every family uh every believer should be known for doing something right everybody should have a ministry. Tabith Tabatha was known for making alms which were making coats and garments. Hallelujah. uh the faithful widows there in Ephesus according to Paul and Timothy they were known because they raised children they lodge strangers they wash the saints feet and they relieve the afflicted and more hallelujah uh the Bible says we should be hospitable and we should provide the necessities of the saints so you should be known as someone who's likes to host people. We should be known as that. We like to host them or we like to provide for them. Hallelujah. We should all be known for having some type of a ministry that's helping out the saints. Hallelujah. No matter how small it is, church, no matter how small it is, maybe having a small group Bible study, small group prayer, right? singing song specials, helping at the church with the the technology team. Everybody's got a ministry about how they can help other people better worship the Lord. Now, most of us have most of our necessities met, but every now and then we have people who need food, clothes, their rent paid, their bills paid, and so we try to step in and help out by the grace of God. That's what we're called to do. That that's what every Christian should do. He said he said uh he told the Corinthians submit to the house of Stfanis because they have this addiction to helping the saints. &gt;&gt; In other words, see which family in the churches serve the rest of the church and just follow help them out. &gt;&gt; And even in Rome, remember Phoebe now she wasn't a deaconist like they say. They got that wrong. There's no such thing as a deaconess. A deacon can only be the husband of one wife. But she was known for securing many. Paul said, "Help her in her business because she's a secure of many." So my sister Phoebe really stood out. She would help out those that were sick, afflicted, needed food, clothes, help somebody out. She was known for that. Just like the house of Stfanis was known for helping out the saints, being addicted to being hospitable. So I want to encourage and challenge our church. You know what are you known for? Who are you known for helping out? What what have you done to help out? You should be known for helping out somebody in the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like I was even telling brother Chris, you know how I appreciate brother Chris coming so he can lock the door when we need it, you know, or he can go open the door if somebody needs it. That's super helpful, you know, just finding a place uh just finding a position to to be helpful to help the saints. Praise God. Being willing to bring people to church, right? I got three open seats or I got four open seats in my car or I've got six in my van. You know, who needs a ride to church? That's so helpful. And that's what Christians should be known for. How can I help out the body of Christ? Or maybe you're the one that always remembers somebody's birthday. Or maybe you're the one that always wants to be hospitable and and do a carry and lunch and organize that. Just be known. We should be known for the love of God that we have wanting to help out the saints and meet their needs. Now, this is really hard to read. So, I'm sorry. I got this from Chat GTP because I heard a preacher say it and then I said, "Go search the internet." A lot of uh nonprofit organizations were actually founded by Christians. In other words, Christians are known for helping people out. So, you might have heard of Samaritan's Purse. That was started by a Christian. Uh Franklin Graham, he's Billy Graham's son. I think he runs that now. Now, I know Billy Graham got a lot of false doctrine, but the point is Christians are donating millions of dollars. And church, remember when uh was it North Carolina had the hurricane last year? I think it was last year. Samaritan's Purse was one of the first ones there to bring generators in, water bottles, food. Remember, even Elon Musk sent his satellites and gave them free internet access. And some of the people were actually saved through that, right? Because they they didn't have internet access and they were stranded. And so, look at that. I mean, that's a good that's a good deed. Wow. I didn't I forgot about that. Amen. And so God sees that. Now works don't save us. &gt;&gt; But as Christians, when we're saved, we want to help out other people. And Paul said, "This house of Stfanis, they're known for ministering to the saints." He said, "All of you should join in with them." The Salvation Army, that was started by a preacher, William Booth. He was a preacher. Hallelujah. See, they pres they provide disaster relief, medical relief, clean water, rebuilding, preaching the gospel. They share the gospel with people. Uh they provide poverty relief, shelter, disaster, spiritual care. The YMCA was actually now now it's not, but it was started by Christians to help the youth to give community welfare to people, disaster support, operation blessing, volunteers of America. Now, I I know Compassion International uh they uh we sponsor a child through them. We send money to a child in Uganda. Oh, no, I'm sorry, Rwanda. And it gives him and his family food every month and then they write letters back. Now, I hope it's going with the right with the right motive and objective. I mean, I'm not for sure. I'm just trusting it is. And if not, God sees my heart, right? God sees my heart. You can't outgive God. God will never let any man God will never owe man or God will never owe a man anything. If God sees your heart and is pure, God will reward you for any giving. And then God will make those people suffer who were lying and stealing. Uh I worked for Habitat for Humanity on two of my spring break trips down to Florida when I was in college. We just worked a few hours at this house that they it was under construction. I I got a few pictures. I was just cutting I had a scroll saw. I was just cutting some boards. I was uh cleaning out the house, you know, just doing little things, nailing down. I put a few nails in the in some boards, you know, not like Malachi, but just doing a little whatever little work I could handle as a college student. But that was started by a Christian. And then the Red Cross uh were started by Christians. Now, of course, they're mainly woke and political today, but I just want to give you an example. Like Christians are known for their kindness and generosity and for helping out people during hard times. Now Paul says, "I'm glad of the coming of Stfanis." So Stfanis left his home, right, to go bring uh the letter from the church of Corinth to Paul where Paul was at Ephesus. So he left his house that was addicted to the serving of the saints and he came and delivered this letter from the the church at Corinth to Paul at Ephesus and also fortunat aus I can't say that exactly right for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. Okay. Now, I don't think Paul's rebuking them here in this case, but uh verse 18 says, "For they have refreshed my spirit and yours." So, Paul said, "Because they were always helping people out, they refresh them." So, anytime you help somebody out, when they need it, it brings refreshing to their life, right? whether you need a visit, whether you need a visit in the hospital, uh whether you need food or uh your your rent paid or bills paid or something like that. He said, "They've refreshed my spirit and yours, and therefore acknowledge ye them that are such." So Paul says, "Make sure you point out and acknowledge these people." All right? So, uh so the Bible tells us, right? What did Jesus say? Don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing. Right? So, there's a time and season for that. But there's also a time where the Bible says, "Be a city on a hill and let the whole world see your good deeds that they might glorify your father which is in heaven." And now Paul is saying, "Acknowledge them because they've refreshed my spirit." Okay? So be in other words, remember this letter was read in front of the whole church. So the whole church was going to know these brothers refresh our spirits. These brothers did a good work. And Stefanis's house, they're really given to hospitality. They really serve people. You should all follow his house. See, there's going to come time from the pulpit. There may come times from the pulpit here. Maybe it's brother Cam or me or some other preacher, maybe brother Benerrod. He'll point out certain people in the church that are doing good things. And we shouldn't get jealous of that. We should learn from that. Because that's what they did in the early church. They acknowledge, here's the people that are really ministering to the saints. Help them out. Hallelujah. And again, that's what refreshes people. What refreshes people is helping them out and ministering to their needs. As Paul said, I was refreshed by these brothers because they traveled so far. They brought your letter and they refreshed my spirit and they refreshed your spirit back in Corenth and acknowledge that. Make sure you point that out. These brother have a special ministry in refreshing people, helping them out, ministering to the needs of the saints. Pretty awesome, right? The book of Acts church is pretty awesome, isn't it? Now, when we think of it, we just think of miracles, miracles, miracles, dead being raised, paralyzed being raised. But this is also part of it, too. Verse 19, we're almost done. My the churches of Asia salute you. Aquilla and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their house. So see, in those days, most churches gathered in homes, right? They didn't have a lot of big buildings like we have uh today or big rooms. So Aquilla and Priscilla sent their greetings to the church in Corinth. through Paul and all the churches in Asia such as uh Ephesus, Galatia, Thessalonica, and Rome. And uh 1 Corinthians 16:20, all the brethren greet you. Greet one another with an holy kiss. So all the saints, so you know, you'll hear brother Kim say, you know, I send greetings from the church and you'll hear when I go places, I send greetings from the saints in Akan, right? That's why we do that because that's what they did in the early church. Oh yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh wow. Right. So that's wrong, right? Because we know there's more the lips are are important part of reproduction, male and female, right? So good. Yeah, good point. I didn't know that. My goodness. Now, some people say in the Mediterranean, brother, that the men still kiss each other on the cheek. You know, they go like this and this and um some people say they kiss on the neck. Uh but we definitely stay away from the lips. Praise God. Uh because that's unholy, right? It's got to be a holy thing. Uh and so good. I'm glad you caught that. Yeah. So, a lot of people misunderstand the scripture. Of course, their life proves it, right? Their life proves it. Uh they deny the word of God in so many areas. They add to the word of God, like they add the caps and everything like that. uh they add their whole like most Amish have their own books outside the Bible, right? That they have to follow all these laws. So they're legalists. So whenever you have one false doctrine, if you don't clean it out, it will produce more false doctrines. That's where you get their false doctrine on the unholy kiss. Yes, sir. Very good. Yep. That's this letter. This letter. Hallelujah. Verse 21. The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. Now to understand this church, you can see here that uh Paul wrote his own name at the end of the letter to confirm that he wrote it. Uh remember Paul wrote in large letters to the Galatian church and I got the I got the Bible verses up here if you want to research it on your own. You'll see that remember uh Terseius wrote the letter to the Romans for Paul because his eyes had gotten so bad. Terseius had to write it and then Paul would sign his name at the end in really big letters. because his eyes were in such bad condition. And he says this, if you look up those verses, Paul said he signed his name at the end to the Corinthians, to the Colossians, and the Thessalonicans. He couldn't even write with his own eyes. So, he has to end it with his signature at the end. And remember, the Galatians said they would have cut out their own eyes and given them to Paul because Paul had such a bad eye condition. Now, what about all these people that say, "Oh, God wants to heal all your sicknesses. The first prophet of God, he didn't get his healed, right?" So, it just shows they're unbalanced in the word of God, right? They're preaching a different gospel than what Paul preached. Now, that church, that's the amazing part, Brother Chris. Paul would pray for somebody with bad eyes and then they get healed and he wouldn't. Imagine that. That's why church, I've seen preachers, brother Austin, I've seen preachers that are disabled and they are paralyzed preaching from a wheelchair and yet God can still answer their prayers, but God keeps them in a wheelchair. So that that's why church, we never want to judge people harshly, right? Or too harshly without really researching like now why are you in this condition? Is it because of sin or is God keeping you humble? So that's how Paul was. Remember Paul in in Paul's later ministry, he traveled with Luke. In other words, he tra when he would come preach, he'd bring a a doctor with him to come preach. Oh, there's Paul. He's got his doctor with him to make sure he he don't run into things, right? You don't bump into things, try to nurse him back to health. So if if brother Benerod comes in a few weeks and he's suffer a little bit and bring some medication, well, praise the Lord. See, it's God who allows these things in our lives. And and with Paul, it was to keep him humble. But we don't know all the reasons that God allows other people to suffer and not heal them. It might be because of unconfessed sin, but it might not be. It might just be for humility or some other purpose. Or maybe that's the sickness that's going to lead to their death. And remember, I I told y'all about Brother Keith Randolph passing away. Remember? Well, he preached for us so many times, such a blessing. And he told me on the text, he said, "Brother Jesse, I think I'm going to come out of here and preach again." Well, guess what? He never got out, but he wanted to, right? So, that sickness eventually led to him going home to be with the Lord, right? And it wasn't, as far as we know, it wasn't anything wrong with his life. He hoped to get out of it, but God used it. Somehow, God still got glory out of that by God's grace. &gt;&gt; And church, we don't judge other people because we don't know how we're going to leave this world &gt;&gt; if God carries. &gt;&gt; Right? I was thinking about that how brother Brandham, you know, died through a car accident. What about Mphibichef church? He was dropped as a baby. He was paralyzed as a baby and then he spent the rest of his life paralyzed. And people look at him and say, "Oh, he's just a paralyzed man." And oh, what an awful accident. That shows he's not right with God. But we never get that in the whole rest of the scripture. He was right with God. And then David lets him sit at the king's table to end his life. You know, accidents happen. God just allows accidents to happen, right? And we got to really, especially with brother Brandham, you know, I'm talking talking about people who attack brother Brandham. They're attacking the way he died. But look at Mib Mphibicheth, you know, look at how Elisha died. Elisha died of a sickness. He had double the miracles Elijah had. You'd think he'd go in the rapture. He didn't. He died. He did twice the miracles as Elijah. What? And with each case, you can't judge somebody necessarily how they die or accidents happening in their lives. You have to look at their life that they live for Jesus Christ. And so you look at Paul and say, "That preacher, that's a prophet." And he can't even see. He's got to write his name real big on a letter and it looks like baby writing or it looks like a child's writing. That's God hiding himself in simplicity. Hallelujah. That's God hiding himself in humility. Because remember church, when you're weak, you're also what? &gt;&gt; Strong. That's when you're your strongest. When you realize how weak you are. And you got to fully depend on the Lord. And this eye trouble was perhaps his thorn in his flesh. He said in 2 Corinthians 12:7. So you and I can't let our physical limitations stop the work of God in our lives. Paul could have said, "Well, I got bad eye trouble. I'm not going to write any more letters or I'm not going to travel anymore. No, church. He kept he kept going. He kept writing letters. He kept traveling. &gt;&gt; Just because a physical limitation makes it hard doesn't mean you quit. &gt;&gt; You keep doing what God called you to do. &gt;&gt; We humbly serve God's purpose. No matter how hard it is, &gt;&gt; it wasn't easy for Paul to write letters. It wasn't easy for him to travel, but he kept doing the word of God. In other words, let's not look for excuses to stop doing what God's called us to do. Let's do it. Hallelujah. Let's be strong. Quit you like men. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch. Stand therefore in the faith. Hallelujah. Paul's such a mighty example of this. Here we come. Come down to the last few verses here. Now, how long how long have I been preaching? I didn't set my timer. Over an hour. Really? Okay. Hard to believe that. Mercy. Doesn't seem like that. Now, over the years, you might have heard people say Marinatha, right? Like you hear different denominations. There's al also a Marinatha church. I've heard of that. Oh, yeah. It's right down the road. Yes. Amen. That's right. That's why I thought about it, but I forgot it was close. And I always wonder where does that come from? It comes from Paul's letter. Now, Paul is finishing up this letter to the Corinthians, and he says, "If any man love not or if any man hates the Lord Jesus, let him be ananthemma marinatha. Now the word ananthemma means accursed. In other words, Paul says, "If any man not loves not the Lord Jesus, he's cursed. Come Lord Jesus." In other words, come Lord Jesus. Whether people love him, whether people hate him, Jesus is coming back. Hallelujah. And it seemed like there were some people in the church that didn't like Jesus, right? They because you know one reason they don't like Jesus if they don't like he who Jesus sent. Amen. Right. And most people that don't like brother Brandham I have a have a hard time believing they actually love Jesus. If they don't like brother Brandham. Hallelujah. Because the same thing is true with Paul. People didn't like Paul in the church. They didn't want Paul to come back. They doubted him. They he's not going to come back. And Paul realizes, see, they if they hate me, they probably hate Jesus. But either way, come Lord Jesus. May Jesus return for his bride. So you'll hear saints say Marinatha. It just means come Lord Jesus, come. Either way, come Lord Jesus. It's like during co people would say Marinatha, right? We got masks on. We're wondering what's going to happen, who's going to die. And some people said, "Well, just come, Lord Jesus." My this is such an awful condition. We want you to come back, Jesus. And church they've been saying that since the days of Corenth believes believers have been saying Marinatha come Lord Jesus like John said come quickly. So he ends the letter by saying if you do not love Jesus you're cursed. He said but come Lord Jesus. But he's not done. I love that he's not done. [clears throat] Just so you know, anathema means a cursed to bind under a great curse. That's the definition. Just so you know. Last two verses. Hallelujah. We made it to the end. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. So what does he leave them with? The same thing he started them with. Grace. Verse three, Paul gives grace to the Corinthians. So he starts it and ends it the same way. Grace. And remember, grace is unmmerited favor. It is just God's favor given to you and I, and we don't even deserve it. &gt;&gt; Uh, does the church in Corinth deserve God's grace? No. They got a lot of problems. Do we deserve God's grace? No. We've got problems, too. Hallelujah. That's why we want to look at it. That we've all got problems. Yet, we can still be a book of Acts church. I have started by a prophet and started by supernatural means. And God has numerous people in this city that are saved. We got the right baptism and we understand the word of God. The mystery of God's been revealed. Our hearts are turned back to the apostolic fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we still got problems. We still need God's grace. And the very last verse, he says, "My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. So be it." Hallelujah. Amen. So we are we learn church, Paul wants his love to be with the church as well. And we learn love is corrected because Paul didn't Paul didn't uh ignore their sins. Paul called them out in the letter. He said, 'I heard from the house of Khloe, there's divisions among you. Right? I heard some man is sleeping with his stepmom and some of you aren't even sad about it. I heard some women are shouting out questions during the meeting and trying to preach. And I heard there's just unlimited tongues interpretations and people are walking in feeling like they're barbarians. They don't even know what's being spoken. Stop it. &gt;&gt; Clean it up. &gt;&gt; And yet I love you. &gt;&gt; Because that's what a real Christian does. &gt;&gt; A real Christian is able to tell you where they disagree with you, right? Or where you're wrong and still love you. &gt;&gt; So, right. So you you can say that you can tell somebody you're wrong on this, but I still love you and God has grace on you. Praise God. Because that's what Paul does. Even if it hurts, a Christian will say that, "I truly love you. May God's grace be upon you." But these areas you got to clean up in your life. And then if you truly love them, you'll accept the correction over time, right? Because we're not always ready to give up our or overcome our battles right at the moment. It's called out if we're all honest. Amen. And then we'll stay with the family of God. We won't get upset and leave them because charity is the greatest gift. And charity is the bond or glue that holds our church together. And church is the glue that will hold your marriage and your family together. That's why uh some people can stay so faithful, you know, to their local church. I can see how a pastor, you know, can stay at a church 30, 40, 50 years because the same love I need to keep my family and my marriage together is the same love we need to keep the church together. I've been married over 22 years, right? I'll be pastoring this church in 20 years coming up in June. How can you stay there 20 years through the ups and the lows? Because love holds me together with the people. &gt;&gt; Love is the glue that holds me together with everybody. Love keeps us together through the good times, through the mountain tops, right? Through the valleys. It's love that holds us together. And if you have love, Paul says, above everything else, he told the Colossians, put on love because it's the bond, and I wrote the wrong word. It's the not body, it's the bond of perfectness. So, other words, love will keep everything together perfectly. Love will help us to stay united. Paul told the Ephesians, "With all loneliness of mind, all longsuffering, forebear one another." In other words, put up with each other in love. Keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. He says, "Love, when you speak it, love will help you grow up into all things, and every believer will supply what the other one has need of." He says, "Gss are useless without love, but with love, gifts are powerful, and love holds on. Love bears all things. Love never fails." And he says, "Love will fulfill the whole law and will never work ill to its neighbor." That's what love does. Hallelujah. Now, I'm going to stop right there. I might preach this on Wednesday. Let's stand to our feet and Malachi can come here by the grace of God. Well, I'm excited as a pastor. I finished that series. Amen. After 30 sermons. Hallelujah. It's awesome to get through that. Don't you love just going through the Bible like that slowly? I just love it. I love I love comparing this verse with that verse and this quote with that quote. It's such a blessing by God's grace. And how many uh believe that the message for this book is clearly about charity, right? It's clearly about love. Love. The Bible says love will cover over a multitude of sin. Hallelujah. This church had a multitude of sin. I mean, big- time sin. Sins I've never seen in Akran. I've never seen anybody walk in here drunk. As far as I know, no one's ever had that sexual immorality in our church like it they had in their church. So far, as by God's grace, no one's ever sued anybody in here. But yet, we still have problems. So if love kept that church together, love can keep our church together. Hallelujah. Let's have a word of prayer. Father God, we thank you for today. God, thank you for bringing us to the end of this series, Lord God. What a blessing, God. Hallelujah. Thank you for the bond of love, Lord Jesus. Lord, as I look at that picture from 2017 and I saw all those couples [music] and families on fire, fresh young believers in the message, Lord, it makes me happy [music] to see, Lord, what a beautiful season that was. And Lord, it makes me happy, Lord, even today to look out and see those [music] saints that could be here. Also to know that numerous saints are live streaming the services. It made me happy last Sunday to see all the [music] saints when brother Cam was here and brother Cam sure enjoyed the fellowship and the worship commented about it as well. Makes me happy to see the saints who stay bonded together through your [music] love through charity. Lord I just pray your love would bind us together [music] Lord God more and more Lord Jesus. Lord, may we addict ourselves to serving one another. How could I serve [music] my brother? How can I serve my sister? Let every person be known for some type of a ministry. As we've said [music] it many times before, what gifts do we have? What ministries do we have? And God, may we [music] be faithful to those ministries. Lord, may each person find their place in the body [music] of Christ. I ask you, Lord God. Lord, it's true. Love [music] can bear all things. Love can hope all things. Love can endure all things. As a pastor, love has endured over [music] 22 years in my marriage. As a pastor here, love has endured almost 20 years. Lord God, with my job as a teacher, Lord, love has endured over [music] 23 classes, I believe. Lord, love just [music] endures and it works no ill toward its neighbor, Lord God. Lord, [music] may we put on the bond of love today, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord, your love kept this church together [music] despite all the 10 sins we saw in Corenth. Lord, we have sins in our church, too. We're not perfect, Lord God. But may your love help us to confess our sins, [music] Lord. Live true one to another, Lord Jesus. Then your spirit will move amongst us, Lord God, for your glory, Lord God. Do great things, [music] God. Great and mighty things that we don't know about. Hallelujah. You've done it before. You'll do it again, Lord God. So strengthen us here today, Lord God. Bless those that faithfully came out to the house of the Lord and [music] bless those that stayed home, Lord God. Staying safe, Lord. Hallelujah. Let your spirit be with them in their homes, Lord God, this beautiful Sunday [music] that we have, Lord God. Father, all this wisdom in the books of the Bible, Lord, all this teaching, [music] Lord, that's thus sayeth the Lord, I pray we could apply it, Lord, incrementally to our lives. we'd go from grace to grace, [music] from glory to glory. Hallelujah. Let the peace of God rule our hearts through the love of God. I ask [music] all these things, all these blessings upon our church in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, "Amen." Let's thank God for today. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your love, oh God. Thank you, Lord God. I love you, Lord Jesus. Amen. I came to worship. Let's sing that. Hallelujah.
