89 verse 34 tonight as you may have saw on the title I'd like to go back to the prove all things series just oddly you know I was in study this week and started looking at the absolute again and and then today I listen to look at that again here tonight by God's grace renew Psalms 89 34 and then we'll read our memory verse I'm sister Naomi Philippians four seven and eight praise God we appreciate God's grace his love his presence his mercy his long service my covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips Philippians four seven eight let's go there and we'll read all these words together on these two verses four seven and eight flippy ins four seven eight as we read it as we meditate on this scripture let's ask the Lord to write it upon their hearts and memory flippy ins four seven and eight let's read it on three one two through Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a need on your heart let's make it known to the Lord here every father we love you tonight we're gathered on this beautiful Wednesday night Lord God seeing Lord this beautiful change of season we're grateful for this weather Lord and the warmth and now Lord we're thankful for the warmth of your Holy Spirit your great Amen god bless yours being seen in Frank so by God's grace this week as I was preparing and you know just studying every day all throughout the morning I just kind of got on the topic of after laying of just a scriptural foundation I want to just go through numerous quotes from brother Branham just to solidify but it was always dealing with God Christ the Bible and divine things and never one time did brother Branham say my tapes are the absolute or did he ever place them on equal equal inspiration as the Bible Lord I believe that's one great sin today in my humble opinion it's idolatry to make every word any man said other than Christ thus saith the Lord so I want to just lay that little foundation here tonight by God's grace and just kind of focus in on this topic here now remember there's the false movement of the the tape church movement and they say everything brother Ram says is thus saith the Lord and he says my mess he said this message has to be my absolute and we'll get to that in a little bit but we know it depends what we mean by the app by the message if we said the message is my absolutely depends what you mean by the message if you mean every word on the 11-hundred so tapes a brother branham then that would not be we could say amen to that praise God so we want to focus on that tonight as the Lord will help us so there's a great confusion amongst that movement and I think I'll just start just with a couple very simple quotes just to kind of give you a foundation here and we'll get to it later now these are two in the absolute he said if you're absolute is some organization or some sensation or something else besides the person of Jesus Christ you'll come to the same portion of shame only worse if your absolute is not Jesus Christ he said upon this absolute I'll build my church upon Christ the word praise God so the absolute is a person it is the supernatural divine person of Jesus Christ here's another quote from March 4th 63 the absolute he said that's what's the matter in the Christian faith today is God here's another one and then we'll move on to some other thoughts but in January 27 63 in the absolute where the RAM said now if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute praise God so again again it's very important to lay down these foundational quotes along with the scriptures that we've read for our text how God can't break his covenant he can't change anything that's gone out of his lips because his word he a collection of mp3 files we can't say it's a stack of paper books that are copies of William branham's sermons it's one person kind of gifts in 1963 brother Branham says Webster says an absolute is perfect in itself that means it has no heirs it's unlimited in its power it's primarily an ultimate unlimited in its power perfect in itself he said really is the ultimate praise God so to be absolute you have to have unlimited power praise God and brother Ram plainly says this in 1949 I have no power within myself to do anything praise God Saints I have no power so no one is the absolute other than the person of Jesus Christ later in 1964 persevere brother Graham says the same remember I have no power to heal I don't have power you don't have any power none of us does to show how to be the absolute you have to have full unlimited power and the only one that has that is Jesus Christ now here's a modern Webster's dictionary definition freaked me from imperfection perfect praise God it means free from mixture pure praise God and so this reminds a scripture in I believe it's Psalms where the Bible said God's Word is purified seven times praise God proverbs 30 every word of God is pure praise the Lord see brother Branham says there's mix-ups on his tapes but absolute is free from mixture praise God he said we always be careful what you're listening to because so much of it is the human side praise God so I want to just lay that down here and I did get a letter back from Jefferson every word on the tapes or the absolute and here's what the tape or here's what I'm quoting what the that one of the letters said I quote it must be all or nothing I have to believe everything on the tape is thus saith the Lord and the absolute of the token for our day I must unquestioning beliefs that's very dangerous it's a it's a false doctrine they did a false little quotation and they they try to put fear upon the people this is why I'm bringing this out because the Jeffersonville movement this weekend is you know shutting in and they're listening to their tapes and they have their schedules of tapes and that you're only abraham's royal seed if you believe every word on the tape is the stay at the Lord now that's that same spirit was in Jesus Christ will live among that every word will be punctuated with a Amen they believe it whom it takes that quote and they say that it applies to every word on the tape the word which was Christ was put on the outside knocking at the door trying to get some cooperation from somewhere to come in and make him I've known and so C and then brother Adam says that's when he says the truth liar they'll believe the whole thing because it's the Word of God so if you take this quote in context brother Brad was talking about the Bible this holy book right here praise God this is the absolute the scripture the word which is Christ it's the Word of God now this is inspired that's inspired the whole thing is inspired by the Holy Spirit so once again we see the leadership in jeffersonville misinterpreting the Word of God to their people but not to the Bride of Christ praise God amen so I quotes very quickly here brother random said he was not infallible we already heard to be absolute you have to be infallible unlimited second Ram said they're mixed up on his tapes he said look in the Bible for me beautiful words well Ram said prophets are not infallible people and most of these are direct quotes the RAM sent prophets make mistakes and every prophet made their mistakes but Lydia why don't you read 24 Malachi 25 this just is a very simple scripture and it shows how God doesn't need anyone god is complete God is perfect God doesn't need you and I necessarily to do anything he's gracious and he gives us works to do Ephesians 2:10 is clear about that he's ordained works that we should do but really God is completing himself and I know we're a part of God right but it's not that God needs a man a human man or woman to accomplish anything it's his plan that will be accomplished because he himself wrote the plan and he will bring it to pass and he'll use man but he doesn't have to have them okay so acts 17:24 Lydia verse 25 neither's worshipped with men's hands seeing he giveth to all wife and rest in all things so Paul's good so whatever is the absolute is unlimited in its power and we know Jesus Christ is the absolute and that's true because he will be the standard everyone is judged by so Romans 2:16 whenever your education a man thing so that it so that if we're born again we don't come to the judgment praise God as far as the white throne judgment will go to the judgment seat for rewards Paul cause at the judgment seat of Christ we won't come to the white throne judgment but we'll be sitting with him with Christ on his throne in his throne at the white throne judgment praise God now the jeffersonville movement also uses a quote where brother Branham says if you have answers he said look on the tape but then they'll and they'll misinterpret that and say see all of our answers are on the tapes but let me tell you there's other quotes and so see that's what false movements always do no matter if it's from Jeffersonville or New York or any country Europe Africa Australia New Zealand Philippines any false movement misinterprets quotes and they contradict other quotes so here's some other quotes or brother Graham says he doesn't have all the answers services is the end time 62 but I haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers I've tried to be honest and to tell you what was the truth and I can only tell you as he God tells me another one why I'm against organized religion when you hear a prophet rising up that's got all the answers to every gimmick that you can bring up remember he's not a prophet so brother Branham has to warn the people if you see somebody who says it says their prophet and they got every answer to everything he said that's not a prophet in questions and answers on this seals in 1963 they asked brother Branham about his Moses and Elijah the literal men or not and he says I don't know he says if I don't know I'm just gonna tell you I don't know I don't know all the answers folks so on tape brother Ram says many times I don't have all the answers yet the church or the tape church movement will still try to propagate that idea that all the answers are on the tapes see they're trying to make the tapes the absolutely unlimited in power but they're not there a faithful recording right of God's prophet and we thank God for that and they're pointing to the absolute praise God but all the tapes and every word are not the absolute because the absolute is a divine eternal person praise God all right so I want to make sure I bring that out because that's another quote that's often misinterpreted okay and also to go along with this jeffersonville misquoted that quote that said this is inspired that's not inspired well brother Brandon plainly says there's times where God is speaking on the tapes and there's times where he's just speaking in his own human side his own human opinion okay and I we went through this one with 1977 of my brother Graham said this is not the Lord this is me talking making a prediction about 1977 total annihilation by 1977 brother Ram plainly says this is not the Lord this is me here's another one in the very quote where brother Graham says I I become God's voice to you he said if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might been resented but I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration see I felt bad about the first time but it repeated it so both man makes it plain the first time he says I'm God's voice to you he said it wasn't under inspiration he felt bad about it he said but the second time he said it it was right it was under inspiration so see Church we have to take that approach we have to take that approach to our dreams some of them are under inspiration some of them are not praise God we must take that approach as we listen to brother Branham as we listen to preachers right as the pastor and the Evangelist and the fivefold ministry we have to be careful what's under inspiration and what's not we have to be very careful now with the Prophet it's it's very simple most the time he'll actually say thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord and then the other times if he doesn't say that we have to take it back look in the Bible if it's in the Bible then we're gonna believe it's thus saith the Lord because it's got it has Bible has a Bible foundation as a Bible ty Post has a Bible absolute praise God amen praise the Lord all right now let me just go through quickly this sermon I listen to I'm just going to give you some highlights from the message I listen to today this is from December 1963 so I wanted to let I had a choice there's four sermons brother BAM preaches called the absolute and I looked at it I thought wow didn't listen the one that was after the seals because I wanted to see what he said so let me just give you a brief overview of it program starts by with by looking at Paul's life and brother Graham said Paul's experience he was astonished Jew Hebrew Hebrew Pharisee of Pharisees he was zealous for the law he said but Paul's experience of meeting Christ on the Damascus Road gave him an absolute he said something he can look back the rest of his life and give him an absolute okay so now we get the idea that we have to look at all these quotes and sometimes we have to use understanding so that experience was an absolute for Paul so in other words Paul met the absolute and that experience praise God and that's what every Christian should have any Christian that's born again when they meet Jesus Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit that experience becomes absolute because they met the person of the absolute praise God hallelujah but you know that the hard part is we all seen people that say they met the absolute and then they fall away from the from the Word of God well that proves they never met the absolute Amen hallelujah your life and then program goes on to say that because Paul met the absolute he had a christ-centered life and brother man said his Christ and her life was his absolute amen praise God in other words being born again having the eternal one inside of him guiding and directing his life that was the absolute to him praise God so brother Graham spends a lot of time on Paul in this sermon and then he starts giving examples of absolutes in life like a anchor on a ship when in the storms the shipments down the anchor the RAM said the anchor is the absolute and then he has this beautiful quote he said and a born-again Christian is tied to Christ and the Bible is the anchor so you and I are the ship right we're God like we had an awful storm last night we're getting tossed in the storm right but our anchor rod Ram says are the Bible is the anchor it's the thing we're tied to amen praise God we're tied to Christ and the Bible is our anchor so brother Graham says that rock on the bottom of the the sea is Christ the Bible's our anchor and we're the ship praise God amen hallelujah praise God thank the Lord then he says Christ is your North Star and the Holy Spirit is your compass so see there's multiple symbolisms or images that brother Branham uses here he said the Holy Spirit will always point you to the word he said which is Christ he said the Holy Spirit only points to the word praise God and then brother Branham said a woman named Emily Post was the absolute for table manners he said if she said you got to eat your beans with a butter knife then you better do that because she was the absolute that's a different definition of absolute just means a final say right that's the one brother Branham uses of course Emily Post is not unlimited in power right we know that so brother Branham starts using the word absolute in a little different way than his definition it just kind of means like the final say or the one who has the authority he says Adolf Hitler was the absolute for Germany Egypt's absolute was Pharaoh he said but they all fail and come to dust because they're man-made absolutes and he says the Supreme Court is this nation's absolute he said the king or queen maybe another nations absolute he said the umpire is absolute at a baseball game number of the RAM starts feeling good he starts going through the example he said I feel real good right now he said there's got to be something that's final I'm so glad that oh now there's somebody who can say it's a sin or it's not a sin I'm so glad of that I'm glad for an absolute so nomogram start showing how the Bible and Jesus Christ is the absolute because there are limited in power and they tell you what sin is and what sin is not and brother man tells us it's a sin to make him infallible he calls it tommyrot awful things it's a sin to make brother branham the absolute now we'll get to the one quote there's one quote where brother Branham says you brethren kind of look to me as your absolute kind of but in all these quotes of brother Branham in scriptures you'll never say where the Bible says God is kind of our absolute you'll never find any quote where Jesus is kind of or a little bit of our absolute you never find quotes like that so gotta be we have to be very careful what we do at that one particular quote and we'll go to that in just a few moments here so buh-bam says when God says anything that's the way it is no need of arguing about it that's what it is and that's the Christians absolute absolute if he's a Christian God said do it this way that's the way it's got to be done no arguing he said well say it ain't nothing about it God said so that settles it that's the absolute of the real believer yeah so see the the the Jeffersonville movement is saying preacher stop preaching right play the tapes they got to catch the vision they got to play the tape so they say so see but the absolute is the Word of God Jesus said go you know all the world teach all nations preached to all nations baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the revelation of the Bible right so they they can never change that no movement they can try to but they'll never change God's Word on that so see that settles it for the real believer the real believer will never try to change God's Word they'll just accept God's Word now here's a beautiful quote well around then goes into traffic signal how's that a traffic signal is the absolute he said then we get a traffic jam of everybody he said everybody wants to be their own absolutely he says o worthy absolute I love this quote brother Branham says it very plainly God is the absolute for more beautiful words God is the absolute praise God so when brother have said the person of Jesus Christ is the absolute the Bible is the absolute we know what it means God is the ultimate God is the unlimited of power but he reveals himself he's the invisible he reveals himself through a visible son Jesus Christ who then gives us a witness of his character in the Bible praise God and that Bible was written by the unlimited one praise the Lord and so see we can all see that and agree on that if we have eyes to see and ears to hear tonight he said let let every absolute other than mine be a lie mine is truth oh my so see when they say the tapes are the absolute that's a I gods absolute is his word that's truth praise God he said so there is a absolute to Christianity he said that's the end of all arguments the Bible said so there must be an absolute in everything hallelujah all right I thought that was beautiful then brother M goes in his personal testimonies at the end of this he said when he first got saved the seventh-day preacher tried to bring him into his church and the Baptist he said I'm so glad God showed him it wasn't the church that was the absolute it was the word then brother Ram said I found out I took God's absolute God's Word and then he read in the Bible that Jesus is the word praise God but man said upon this absolutely I'll build my church so in other words upon this rock so what is the absolute the rock the revelation of who Jesus Christ is hallelujah so that's again II that's again getting into how the baptism of the Holy Ghost is our absolute in our soul right but it's God it's God's eternal sphere unlimited sphere unlimited power in our soul upon this absolute I'll build my church upon the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll build my church praise God number of the rammstein revelation 22 8 9 says I'm sorry 18 and 19 says you cannot add or take one word away he said that's the absolute and then you'll you'll see in a few moments here brother brand will bring out different scriptures like Hebrews 13:8 he says is the absolute revelation 22:18 and 19 is the absolute the man brings out all these different scriptures that are the absolutes and so see that the the Jeffersonville movement is taking away the Bible so you can't take one word away from the absolute and they're taking preachers out that's taking words away that's taken away from the absolute the brother Branham said he's always been the oddball he saw visions he preached serpent seed predestination but God had a purpose he said for saving him and that was to do his ministry and to know that the word is the absolute and he knows nothing other than Jesus Christ and him crucified hey amen that's the season we're getting into the season where the absolute was crucified for us died for us that we could trust only in the absolute praise God hallelujah and then he closes by saying I'm not gonna make an altar call he said let's make a call of recon secretion and rededication he said let's take Jesus as our absolute praise God now I want to take just about 10 more minutes it's already 8 o'clock so I got about 20 or 25 more minutes I want to take a few minutes here and I want to read direct quotes from brother Adams for sermon I'm sorry I want to take direct quotes from every time brother Ram said my absolute there was 29 I'm sorry there was 32 times I believe yeah brother Ram said those exact words my absolute there was 2029 he said your absolute and I just want to go through some of these I just want to hammer this down Church there's no doubt in our hearts and minds we're thankful for the tapes the tapes point to the absolute just like tonight I'm making a tape right I'm making a recording but my recording is not the absolute it's pointing you and I to the absolute Amen it's pointing you to Jesus Christ praise God and just like just like we understand the same thing is true of Paul right if any man could have said you know by deception he was the absolute it would have been Paul because Paul said if you add one word or take one word away from what I wrote your he said you're cursed right but Paul also put though we or an angel so Paul put himself in there showing how Paul was not the absolute it was the revelation that was the absolute praise God amen and I have scriptures where Paul says he is not perfect in other words he's not the absolute he's not the the unlimited and power person yet he wrote he wrote about the absolute praise God but not every word Paul said was the absolute same thing with brother Branham Philippians 3:12 let's read that video to get that yeah Linnea will read Philippians 3:12 and when you read us listen please Paul says he's not perfect but he's following one who is perfect amen Paul's out the absolute but he's following the absolute same thing with brother branham he's not the absolute but he's following it and then as he said then we follow his teachings as they line up with the word but we test every one to make sure it's in the Word of God okay Philippians 3:12 a men Paul said don't add one thing or take one thing away your curse but here you said listen I'm not perfect I'm not the absolute but I'm pointing you to one who is the Lord Jesus Christ praise God okay you know what since we're on that thought let's go back I 1st Corinthians 11 please one let's just read that quote and then we'll get to these other ones here there's one quote where you know the false churches might be able to say or false doctrines and churches might be able to say brother Branham said he was the absolute but let's read it and get a good understanding this is from church order 63 it was a meeting with just brother Branham and brothers and leaders in the church at the brand tabernacle and he was saying how he's the head of that church he said because somebody's got to be the head around here and he's laying out the groundwork or the rules for the gifts of the Holy Spirit especially speaking in tongues and prophesying in Brandon Tabernacle okay so boom Ram says he said but if you get to man you got two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible so notice this quote by the Rams laying down rules he said we got to have an absolute can I have two men one man he said but my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word he says and I want I know you are brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute Sabri I'm just says my absolute is the word but you brothers are looking to me kind of he said to be your absolute and then brother man quotes this beautiful scripture it's 1st Corinthians 11:1 now can you read that for us ok so brother bible quotes that scripture he said he said as long so listen listen he said I'm your absolute as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scripture follow me as I follow Christ amen so in other words when God sends as a prophet we follow his teachings but we line all them up by the Bible if not then who is the white horse writer is it the Antichrist or was it the whole spirit his brother Graham said both I thought I came across another one where brother man just made a slip-up he says I spoke thus saith the Lord that America has last chance in 1946 but in other places he said that she had a last chance in 1956 and so there's a little slip-up there he just quoted the wrong one which one was it was it 46 or 56 and so see we just allow a man to make those mistakes and we take everything back to the Word of God now Paul knew the brothers would follow him but Paul still said he was a wretched man in Romans 7:24 he said I do that which is evil sometimes Romans 7 19 and if you Evo you can't be unlimited in power because your sin separates you from the a holy one the unlimited one praise God and Paul even says not every word I said was thus saith the Lord 1st Corinthians 7:10 says that we won't read that just for times sake I want you to also know church were to follow brother rams teachings and line them all up with the Word of God but the Bible also says follow Holy Ghost filled churches first Thessalonians 2 13 and 14 I'll read 14 for ye brethren became followers of the Churches of God which are in Judea are in Christ Jesus see that's why we can look to wonderful churches like Sheffield Albion brother cams brother Brooks's I hate to leave anyone out you know we can look to churches that we know have people that are born-again pastors that are born-again and we can follow examples that are godly in their churches so we follow the absolute Jesus Christ and the Prophet and other churches we follow we looked we looked at them and as long as they're doing things that follow the absolute Jesus Christ then we can we can also do those things Peter said that we are to follow Jesus Christ as well in 1st Peter 2:21 he said Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps praise God here's one thing we can't do this is what I believe the jeffersonville movement is done 2nd Peter 1:16 he says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables that's what I believe that's a fable when they say the tapes are the absolute that's a fable the tapes mention the absolute the tapes point to the absolute but not every word on there is the absolute that's a fable which a Greek word is an invention that's a man-made invention because brother brand never said my tapes are the absolute and I hope that helps everybody by God's grace so that is the one quote people may stumble out a little bit now I'm gonna gotta go real quick here so everybody take a deep breath here I want to go quickly through these four sermons brother Branham preached called the absolute and I just want to go like machine-gun fire brother Craig used to always say that so I always had that stuck about mine he said I go scripture after Scripture but this time it's gonna be cool after quote after quote but they're all saying the same thing Jesus Christ is the absolute the word is the absolute thus saith the Lord is the absolute the revelation is the absolute so I want you to see all these these are all on December 30th 1962 brother Branham said my absolute he is so wonderful notice he didn't say my tapes are so wonderful or they are so wonderful he said he is so wonderful program said of for palmas rock I'll put my absolute he said spiritual revelation of who he is of knowing so again the spiritual revelation is your absolute right you've got a revelation it's the Word of God it's the said Lord that word is unlimited it's powerful all powerful praise God he said God will love me that's my absolute so here brother BAM said God's love is his absolute praise God he said can't rest on an arm of flesh you got to rest on the word what God said dude I hope God's love is your absolute tonight I know it isn't our church praise God it's preached that way we got to receive an Amen every one of us but I mean I've said if I'd die in my tracks my absolute is Jesus Christ amen I love that one brother Graham said when he got saved and he was in the woods and he nailed that paper on the tree he said what was it he said I met he said that's where I met God he said what was it I heard my soul and a haven arrest that settled it there that was my absolute there I found something not some mythical some idea I had talked with the man I had talked with that man that told me never to drink smoke or do anything else that would defile myself he said yes sir he was the one so see the Holy Spirit he met in the woods was the absolute praise God God's Spirit is the absolute hey man we can we can meet it right now praise God amen you can meet him in your in your prayer closet you can meet him in the church you can meet him right now in your living room praise God he's the absolute Amen the unlimited one he goes on to say Christ is my absolute he is my absolute he said God he is my absolute he's always the absolute a man so he's the oh there's no other absolute there's one absolute he's always the absence I'll never see where he says my tapes and my opinions and my human side is the absolute he'll never say that now move to the second sermon January 27th 1963 he said the Word of God Christ my absolute and of course I'm just shortening these I spent hours today just going through all the my absolute quotes now I know that that was an absolute that that word could not change it's been my absolute here brother Branham says revelation 22 that he said I knew that could not change it's been my absolute so now he's quoting individual scriptures he said a long ago I taken Christ for my absolute the absolute has to be eternal unlimited and power boat man said I'm tied to that word let every man's word be alive but mine be truth that was my absolute from 30 years ago or better I'm still in that same word and there I want to live and die that being my absolute that's where I want to live and die to church amen but God's Word is my absolute praise God he said Christ he's our absolute there can be no other praise God I read that one earlier praise God he says but I'm determined in my heart I'll never back on that word I'll stay right there that's my absolute brother branham here's a beautiful brother ram quotes the rapture scripture 1st Thessalonians 4 they which are dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive will meet them together in the clouds the RAM said what a promise what a absolute that is to believe in Christ to have my heart say amen to every word his book that I know the Holy Spirit compass it guides me to us absolute his North Star he is my absolute praise God now brother brother mantle quotes Matthew 24 where Jesus said heaven earth will pass away my words and ever passed away he says put your heart right on God's Word heaven earth will pass away but that shall never pass away that's the absolute again the world the scripture read in Psalms a night at the beginning I'll never break the Covenant I'll never alter the words that come out of my mouth the Word of God is the absolute little absent Jesus Christ he said it isn't the Baptist churches say me it was Jesus Christ say me he's my ultimate he's a my stand he's my absolute he's my typos amen praise God here he says Hebrews 13:8 don't you see the same God is right among us proving himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's my absolute hallelujah well Graham said my absolutely is the Word of God that word now here's a beautiful one brother Ram said that's my absolute brother in this word thus saith the Lord praise God so now anytime there's a thus saith the Lord that's an absolute it's a promise it's an eternal word and that word is unlimited and power because it's part of God amen now moving on to the third sermon this is from December 63 I'm sorry this is from a this is just once more Lord yeah yeah so this is the morning sir I'm sorry no this is the evening service from December 1st 63 Rams quoting John chapter 4 he said he that can receive my words and believe on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come to the judgment but it's passed from death unto life that's good enough for me right there that's my absolute that's my absolute he promised it so every promise of God is part of his absolute now in the sermon here mm-hmm here's another one yeah there's a different services to the fourth sermon I'm gonna go quickly here he said my words or God's words or promises he said that's my absolute he said Jesus Christ by his word he is my absolute but brother hams talking and said he's at ya he's quoting Psalms 23 yea though I walk through the shadow Valley the shadow of death I'll fear no evil you are my absolute amen he's my absolute he said the holy spirit stirs me to that promise he's my absolute he's my aw anything outside of that nothing to my arms I bring I know nothing else besides Christ he said he said that's my absolute praise God but man says the Word of Living God the Holy Spirit he says your absolute is in him so now he says your absolute is in God it's the life of God praise the Lord oh here's a new one I haven't mentioned this one program says the pillar of fire is the absolute he said when I seen that pillar of fire like Paul the road to Damascus I know that was God's absolute Amen so god every manifestation of God genuine manifestation is the absolute praise God it's the absolute though it was a paradox he said sure it was for the pillar of fire to hang up there in the sky and papers and everything taken the picture of it amen he says the brother Rams doing the prayer line he says I'm checking my absolute Lord if there's anything in me besides the i-word take it out Haman he said Jesus Christ let's take Jesus Christ our absolute he is my absolute on December 30th 1960 he said Christ the Holy Spirit his word is my absolute he is my absolute Christ Christ is the absolute over and over and over again Christ is my absolute here and then in 1964 possessing the gates of his enemies that says last time he says my absolute he said we need an absolute Christ he said the word is the app my absolute God's Word is my absolute praise God okay now that was wonderful I hope you enjoyed that I think we just spent 10 minutes on that by God's grace not not too long all right now let me do one more here Christ the mystery of God revealed the other grams getting ready to pray now remember this was a very long sermon if you remember I think it was three and a half hours I preached it a couple years ago before brother Graham prays that he said I got a quite a bunch of scriptures here rather he says questions we said scriptures and then he prays he says God were holding to your unchanging hand their absolute the word okay and then he says help us lord as we read the word he says and may as you gave us the vision some two years ago store up the food fine healthy-looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle may we receive a whole barrel full of that granite Lord or a tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us a steini strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead granite father so I want to bring a balance here at this last quote brother branham said the tapes have a tape below or their the tapes have a load of promises right a load of scriptures so the tapes have part of the absolute they have promises of the absolute but remember he said that the tapes might reveal now anyone that knows the Bible knows only God can reveal the Word of God Jesus says only the father can reveal so see tapes just like it's just like a natural letter just like a Bible it's just like a plain Bible right but a tape the Bible has no mistakes but a tape can have mistakes so a tape is just something that holds part of the absolute but the Holy spirt had come and make that live praise God just like a table could only hold so many vegetables is like a tape can only hold so many promises of God but it can't hold all of them right but the Holy Spirit the one that is that he is the absolute he comes and quickens those promises that are mentioned on the tapes praise God hallelujah because jesus said no man can reveal this but the father no man can reveal what's on the tape except the father so the father is the absolute praise God the Holy Spirit is the absolute God Jesus the word is our absolute the revelation the pillar fire is the absolute praise God all right okay I hope that was a blessing by God's grace well we have the musician come here to the piano thank you man okay Church if you have any questions about any of those quotes or if you like any I don't oftentimes brother Jose likes quotes if you need any of those quotes let me know remember let's go back to some of those statements every word was the say the Lord it must be all or nothing and that's not true those things are just not true Church the messages from Jeffersonville are coming by the spirit of fear brother Branham said have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear and I just showed you that example they sent out that email this week if you don't believe every word on the tape is the absolute or thus saith the Lord you're not Abraham's true seed they will say if the people don't do what they say they are if they leave then destruction will follow but they're saying today you'll get the coronavirus or you're gonna be lost with the world if you don't do like we do he said there are false prophets for a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ see they're binding people to tapes or books we have to bind people to a Living God to the absolute one who is unlimited in power one who's infinite praise God and he won't a true leader won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says Amen praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah might remember there's only one absolute there's no other absolute and there's always Christ is always the absolute amen thank you lord hallelujah okay I think I'll stop right there I just want to make sure I got all those thoughts and sure it's just like with you know writing the book I preach it and I wait for more inspiration to come so I can see how the inspiration has come tonight Lord willing we'll take that tomorrow and write it out this would be the next video I make Lord willing we'll be on the absolute but let's just pray now to the Holy Spirit and let's ask the absolute to guide us here and if we have a need if you saw have a need
