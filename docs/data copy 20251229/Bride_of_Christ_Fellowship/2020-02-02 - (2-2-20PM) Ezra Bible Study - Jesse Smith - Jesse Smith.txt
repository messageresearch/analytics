this word here tonight we'll break into your people Nonna's refresh your hearts as we worship we serve you and learn from your great word in Jesus Christ he's investing our mind was real estate I know I said I'll sit down but you know since we have a lot of people here tonight I think I'll just stay here at the pulpit I'll try to keep it short by God's grace pot I'll need the children's help reading the scripture so anyone who's got your Bible and you like to read I may call upon you so let me know if you don't want to read too I don't want to force anybody to read them I like to you know last week we had just a nice little confirmation on one of brother Troy's messages so he was preaching a little bit about Ezra and zerubabbel and then after service you know sister Karen and we're talking and she's like brother Jesse I just read Ezra and Nehemiah this week and she said I wonder how it types to us and I said well praise the Lord I preached on that you know back in 2013 and so I explained a little bit but I thought you know we just go over that again you know so I think I'd like to just go over this briefly tonight and just do a little Bible study on it and so if you got your Bible go to Ezra here and well look at that it's a beautiful story it's one of the one of the most I should say helpful series I ever preached because it helped me place together like the chronological order of the Old Testament and as you'll see a lot of this deals with the hunt this is all foreshadowing the 144,000 so you see a lot of that now brother Adam doesn't mention a few things about as you'll see about grace grace the headstone grace grace so we kind of see that and our day a little bit but when I preach it I saw a lot of it was it was like a foreshadowing of the great Millennial temple so I think we'll see it here tonight as as a more willing as we open our hearts to the Lord I'm sure he'll help us here but let's go to Ezra a chapter one and one thing you know Cara and I were talking about was just the emphasis of Ezra I'm sorry and zoomable Ezra Nehemiah the emphasis on re-establishing the house of God and she was saying how brother Jesse that's really opened my eyes to how important it is for to be ready for every church service and I thought well that's it I said Laurie I really meant a lot to me because that's what I got out of it when I preached it you know their emphasis on building a physical house is not so important for us it's building the spiritual house which is the Holy Ghost getting in others getting people saved feel what the Holy Ghost getting their gifts and in their places and their positions getting the spiritual house build up so that we can minister and help one another by God's grace so Ezra chapter 1 let's read verse 1 now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout Oz Kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus king of Persia the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth yea charge me to build him in house of Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem we is in Judah and bill bill the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourned has let the men of his place help him with silver with gold and with goods and with the beasts beside the free were offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem that's all read verse five together ready one two three then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all them whose spirit God had raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem Amen thank God as best in dream his word may be seated so this is just a beautiful beautiful story I think I'll just start by you know saying again what a great confirmation we had with sister Karen a brother Troy preaching that that's really a wonderful confirmation so she was reading it all week saying what does this mean was this mean and then the brother preached honest that was a great vindication now just a little bit of background this story Ezra Nehemiah Esther well kinda asked her to not not really gonna look at that one's an eye but Ezra Nehemiah and zoobel all their three men the three main main men in the restoration of Israel back to the promised land remember they got kicked out in Jeremiah Jeremiah told them because of their idolatry and their wickedness and so God kicked him out and he said seventy years remember Hannah and I come around said it's gonna be too right Jeremiah said that's funny he said amen he said the way we'll know is which one will come to pass right and then we know what happened Hannah and I had died that same year he died that same year but Jeremiah lived on and it was seventy years so right about the time seventy years come up was when Daniel was pranks he can God but also then God at that time Daniel was a different location God moved on the heart of a Persian heathen King right Cyrus and Cyrus says God has spoken to me in other words holy spirits anointed me to do my part to help God's Word be fulfilled right and that's that's like how we could say like Trump or Obama or Bush whoever it is God can use them even if they're and don't have the right faith God can use anybody he wants right Nebuchadnezzar was a tool a servant in the hand of God but yet he was prideful you know he worshiped himself you know he thought he was all highly exalted so God had to make him like lowly like a beast like an animal for seven years to get him to see it's not about you it's about God's Word right it's about prophecy so this story Ezra and Nehemiah and also Haggai Zechariah and Malachi all those are about the same time period so would it be nice if we had a Bible that was in chronological order would that be nice you can buy them you can buy them I found actually a chronological order so Daniel I'll just read it briefly Daniel 10 to 12 then Ezra one two three Ezra four to six Psalms 137 Haggai Zechariah Esther and then back to Ezra 7 and 10 Nehemiah lamentations like if you line it up that's the order that they go through so in other words God had different people all over the time all over the place right and delivering the Word of God God was ministering to all those people and all trying to get them to serve the Lord but then also see the restoration back in Israel now he had to do that Church we know he had to do that because he had to send his son Jesus Christ praise God so it's all pointing together to send like what Malachi look we're talking about he's got to come suddenly to his temple praise God remember Malachi said that Jesus he's at my messenger I'll suddenly come to my temple that was Christ coming suddenly right right there to the temple of Herod and so all these work together but we follow three main men's aru Bible Ezra and Nehemiah these are the three men and this is Israel returning to the land after 70 years of Babylonian captivity of course there's a Syrian captivity there's different captivity there and this fulfills the prophecy we saw of Jeremiah now there's at least a three-fold restoration so this is what I was trying to share her sister care a little bit they first reached once they got back they restored the altar which was blood second was the temple which is like the worship next was the law ezra brought in the law after that and the last thing was the wall so that's my brother branham when he if you listen to the restoration of ride tree he references this because he's he's using again the force he's sitting them sometimes there's three sometimes there's four right there's sometimes there's three sometimes four you got to use in the right way but this story looks like a four right looks like a four if you have the blood you know the whole temple you have the word restored and then you have the walls restored and if I could you know I think there's a little bit of type here and let me uh let me just go back to the Proverbs if you would hear this scripture just come to my mind I didn't really have a prayer yeah proverbs 25 if you could who's got to Bible children you got to go out there Lydia proverbs 25 could you do it twenty-eight can you read that whenever you're ready Lydia yeah so I was looking at this even as a spiritual application here the last thing that's restored is the wall and the Bible says it's like a mind so I'm gonna apply this to like spiritual maturity but hey men when you and I and when the Bride of Christ you know when we get real mature well we'll be overcoming in mind battles like you know like the Bible said like immature people are tossed by every wind of doctrine but when you really get established in the gospel those winds of doctrine don't move you right like we're not moved by the jeffersonville thing no like I said I have questions and other things you know things I've never heard before those will kind of shake you up but but they're out of it I like what this you know it goes from blood to the temple to the law the word and then restoring the walls or giving them this protection and it's like Paul says be transformed in the renewing of your mind okay so that's one way I explain this sister Karen just briefly and I think Wendy might even stay in there too and I said that I said it's a beautiful picture how we need the blood the first thing they establishes get the blood of Christ amen get forgiven get the blood flowing amen get that get the people forgiven praise God and then build the house of God and then they bring the Nezzer brought the law and then protect yourselves be so firm and and established and protected that nobody can break down and harm you praise God you're strong you've got a law you rule over your own spirit you're not tossed by every wind of doctrine but you're strong in the faith all right maokai you ready buddy all right let's look at a wine I just going to order with my children will the start the oldest and go down Lydia is always so good about that you know it's my first job right there Yeah right brother bang firstborn you know you got to be right there any other firstborns in here nature yeah Lily wait it's your turn next year pretty soon yeah so I was looking at like that it's it's a restoration that we can learn right the first thing we need to get is do is get saved right we need the blood of Jesus Christ and then God will just reach to restore more build it back up build it back up until finally we can be so mature we're transformed day by day not just once in a while but every day were transformed to Christ image that's why I think this is a beautiful type but mainly it applies 144 thousand but like I said I'm there's a lot of gems or a lot of nuggets we can pull out here for us and shine them up and say my that's beautiful I can see how that applies to my life okay now as run we're in ezra here okay Malachi let's see I like to but before I go here Zuba bowl here is let's go to chapter 2 Malachi Ezra 2 1 yeah can you read verses 1 and 2 buddy to chapter 2 1 knit 1 & 2 now these are the children of the prophets that went up out of the captivity of those which have been carried away who Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away into Babylon and came again to Jerusalem and Judah everyone into a city which came was really before Joshua Nehemiah Sariah Rita Leia Mordecai Bill shun this part alright so buddy Caesar will run their Zoo rule means descending from Babylon see the Babel like the rubra bull the bull about the bull that's like Babel so his name means I was born or I'm descending from Babylon so he was a child or he was a man but he was a when he was a child he was B was born in Babylon and his name name means I'm from Babylon and Church he was one and his this is what the history says he was one of 42,000 Jews that was willing across the desert from Babylon back to Israel so I think that I think the number I don't have it in front of me but I thought it I could be wrong I thought was a hundred a couple hundred thousand a couple hundred thousand Jews got taken over to Babylon and when the King said God's anointed me who wants to go back only a small fraction wanted to go back see and that's how it is today only a small fraction of church members really want Christ right only only a small number of people I come to church really want to labor for God because both bang there was nothing there everything was burnt down they burnt you know it was burnt down to the ground by Nebuchadnezzar nothing's left there's nothing to build apart like when we walked in here it was pretty dirty but there was walls and we painted the walls Lydian children remember that Karen scrub the floors and everybody you know find a little spot here to help out when you I think he painted some yeah that's right you painted this room that's right but see we had so much more advantage because we had a building they had nothing so if this was really asking who wants the labor for the kingdom of God and a small little group led by a zerubabbel raises up now what's beautiful Church that I'll encourage you look in chapter 2 in verse 36 so goes through all the lists in verse 36 it shows the priests in verse 40 it shows the Levites verse 41 it shows the singers brother Amen and Malachi and all of our singers sister Wendy sister Naomi all of our songs special singers yeah banger your songs special singer aren't you BAE I'm just kidding man see his name wouldn't be in the singer sexy right neither would mine see but look God has a place for everybody can you see that and now the beautiful thing is you know we it's hardly a meant for us to read this all these names at John but it shows God is keeping track of you and I hey man God is not gonna forget you if your names on his book amen if you're not sure repent and get right with God then for sure your names on the book Alleluia because he said he will not turn away 1 no man can pluck them out of my father's hand that's what I love about that it's hard to read sister Wendy I know him for me too I have a hard time Reena but it shows how mindful God is that he sees the singers he sees the priests the preachers the Levites he sees everybody and we all got to be in our position praise God it's beautiful now if you notice though back in verse 2 there's a couple Nehemiah's the nehemiah we know didn't come till quite a while after Ezra so you can see in verse 2 is then which came with zoobel Joshua Nehemiah that's a different Nehemiah than the one who builds the wall just so you know there's a lot of years in here that pass so for example Ezra didn't come till 60 years after zerubabbel okay so zoomable was the leader of the first group to come back okay and then 60 years after him then Ezra came okay but there's a lot that happened in there in these chapters let me set the time of your side I'm starting to feel good to you so then you see Solomon's servants in verse 55 yeah then you see a returning priests and everything in the rest of the chapter all right now what's interesting in chapter 2 verse 62 there's a group which cannot find their names in the genealogy and so's ruble keeps them out of the priesthood that's how important is that your name on the book praise God we're not talking our natural book now we're talking about spiritual book the book of life if your name's not there if your name's not in the book of life there's no eternal life the name has to remain because it says these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood so no matter what they said if their names aren't on the records they're not serving in that capacity as that's how it is with us if our name's not in the Lamb's Book of Life we won't be in the bride but if our names in there we're in the bride praise God how do you know but man says this is how you know as we listened to it last night a home church should remember in the first seal brother Branham says how do you know he said when you hear the word you just want to do it right away that's how you know hey man he said you'll be so happy to do it you just can't wait to do it amen that's how you know there has to be a difference between the wise and the foolish version the wise can't wait to keep the word hallelujah yeah so verse 64 says 42 and thousand came back three hundred and threescore so out of the hundreds of thousands only a fraction came now they all give their substance can case you how are you able to read I know you got a Bible okay yeah could you do verse 68 I just read 68 and 69 and just some really just some beautiful words here [Music] hey man I just want to bring that verse 69 they gave after their ability I want to say the church God's not asking you do something you don't have God's I ask you to give something that you don't have he he wants to see you give from your ability praise God now Paul talks about you know the physical giving you know in 2nd Corinthians 10 I believe it is but I'm talking about even spiritual - you know we shouldn't we God's not asking us to do something that we can't do we just have to be willing to give it and you know I'm just finishing up Exodus and I saw the same thing when Moses about the tabernacle the Bible said they had so much to left over they had to tell the people stop giving to church you know stop stop we got enough I just finished it Exodus 29 no I'm sorry 39 38 39 there was they were so willing to do anything for God and that's what we got we got to be willing to do all we can for Christ so after your ability now chapter 3 is when the altar is set up so there there there and in the second year they start building the altar so they're there a year they get their tent set up they kind of get used to the rubbish and everything laying around but it's in their second year of ministry they erect the altar and lay the foundation of the temple okay so this is chapter 3 the altar is set up and then they establish the reestablish some worship praise God now I'm gonna go ahead and read verse 2 and 3 then stood up joshua the son of josedech and his brethren the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereupon as is written the law of Moses the man of God and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto Lord even burnt offerings morning and evening and that's what I read it recently this week when God told Aaron he said every morning you offer a sacrifice lamb and incense blood and prayer right forgiveness and prayer morning and night hey Lord forgive me for my sins and know God offer up a prayer to God every morning every night praise God like when you share with me one time about the do when is the due in the morning and in the evening what are you gonna have your sweet times to the Lord well hopefully all throughout the day but definitely the morning and definitely the evening but you got to take time to enjoy it praise God it's a good point so morning and evening and then they start keeping the TAT the Feast of the Tabernacles in verse 4 praise God alright so that's the next chapter there chapter 3 they get the they get the altar and the Foundation's laid now if you notice verse 4 I'm sorry chapter 4 this is when the adversity starts coming so it searches like they get they're really enthusiastic at the beginning but then God allows tests right God allows tests so you can have a testimony there's no test if there's no test there's no testimony right now I'd like to let's look at this here real quick actually just go back to chapter 3 I don't want to forget this here's one thing I want to in chapter 3 we see that this rebuilding is actually speaking of the Millennial temple okay so go to chapter 3 verse 10 Haven can you read hon do you got your back for there oh you hit well it's okay I know where my Mormon says Wendy can you read a few sister Wendy can you read 10 and 11 in chapter 3 10 and 11 with trumpets and the Levites with the Sun they stood with symbols to praise the Lord after the organist David king of Israel and they sang together by the horse in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever Israel and all the people shouted with great shout when they praise the Lord because of foundation of the house of the Lord was late amen so in verse three they finished the altar and then in verse eleven they finished the foundation okay and we just saw remember children we just thought are across the road member they finished the foundation a couple months ago now we saw that were like oh they got a pretty good start but when Israel laid the foundation of their temple they shout and said hallelujah praise God we got the foundation we're getting started here and it's a great thing they had a great shout but look at verse 12 and 13 when a man can you read 12 brother 3:12 when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes well with a loud voice and many sounded a lot for joy verse 30 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off so you got the older generation like oh this is such a small tiny temple this isn't anything like we had but the young people that never had a church were like we got a charge praise God we're doing to suffer the kingdom of God but the old generation instead of enjoying it they got discouraged but can you blame them they didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't they didn't know what God was doing and so see that shows that that the older generation was was seeking something as great as Solomon but it wasn't for that that wasn't for them that at that time that was gonna be in the Millenium praise God so they had their minds thinking like oh this is gonna be a great a solemn and and God wasn't doing that God was doing a smaller thing right God wasn't doing as a great thing he was doing a smaller thing and they should have rejoiced they shouldn't rejoice because God was doing a great thing brother bang they they had been the slaves right for 70 years they've been either land but now they're back and they got the foundation laid they all have been happy let's see it's a pre figure there's gonna be a great temple one day praise God hey man and gods son how to do the son of David will sit on the throne in that Millennial temple and a rule with a rod of iron amen are they within all nations will flow into Israel for judgments praise God that's actually that's absolutely scriptural court and Isaiah and other scriptures we have now a little more unsuitable chapter for the adversaries come now a new king raises up named artaxerxes okay and the adversaries lie to artaxerxes and say all the jews won't pay tolls if you don't let them or if you let him build a house they're not going to pay you and the King believed him and so they shut down in verse in chapter 4 17 to 22 our deserts he sends a decree and stops them from building the house so they're in the midst of revival and then discouragement comes Lydia can you do verses 23 and 24 in chapter 4 he's gone I remember that when Troy was here Troy was right as far as we he and I both had the history the Bible Dictionary says they shut him down for 16 years 16 years they were all there all revival mode for a couple years they got the altar they got a foundation and then Satan got in there and tried to fight against him and he shut him down for 16 years at the end of that 16 years God raised up two prophets look at chapter 5 and rebukes them there so it looks like to me Church they should have fought against those guys and kept trying to rebuild the temple because God rebukes him in Haggai and Zechariah now I go to the chapter 5 verse 1 then the prophets Hagee I the Prophet and Zechariah the son of Odin to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel even unto them then rose up zerubabbel so you've been sitting down for 16 years then he rose up the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of josedech and began to build the house of God which I drew some and with them which I'm sorry were the prophets of God helping them I like that the prophets then just preach they were right there on the front lines let's bill what can I do where can i or can I help out where can I paint where can I clean what trash can I take out what bathroom can I clean what can I do see they're right there what to do their part everybody had to play a part and everybody was willing to help praise God now keep your place there I'm gonna get my Bible what's this called to Bible string where they call this thing that where they call that thing this yeah the book mark that's it right there ribbon or Brook mark leave your Bible ribbon there let's go to Aggie I can remember the name of that thing bookmark Aggie I so for 16 years I sit around doing nothing but actually they were doing something Haggai rebukes him because they're focusing on their house rather than God's house remember he we read it last week now verse 2 this people say the time has not come the time that the Lord's house should be rebuilt so once the government said I'm shutting you guys down you guys can't build everybody got discouraged it must not be the Lord's time but what had just happened gotta just put it on Cyrus's heart to let them build and so now another King comes in and shuts it down I think it must not be God's time but God was trying to show them you got to be willing to fight for his Victory's praise God like Joshua you got to do something to God said the whole lands yours but you got to go fight God was showing them you got a I want to see your faith I want to see you overcome with you the faith of God now look he says in verse three then came the word Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house house lie waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of God consider your ways this is where this is what he read last week here in other words were trying to save money but your your wallets full of holes then he verse 8 go up under the mountain and bring wood and build the house I'll take pleasure in it and I'll be glorified saith the Lord you look for much and lo it came a little and when you bought it home I did blow upon it why say at the Lord of Hosts because of my house that has laid waste and ye run every man unto his own house this is the point I was making I think I shared this with Amen one time when we first moved into this church right here I'm I told bang to my house needed a lot of work I think I told her a man lived in my house for a couple of months so he knows what but I put this house first before I fixed my up my own and so I put all the money on my tie I painted many of these walls and you know we went to the store and and made all the purchases here my whole focus was to get this house established first and then I got this house established first and then I felt the leading of the Lord once we knew Genevieve was on the way then I felt the Lina Lord to work on our house and and it worked out good with the builders plan and we got some loans there and everything worked out perfectly and it would just reminded me of this that God if God's doing something we've got to put God's house first and our house second it has to make your house nice for your kids yeah we should do that but first make God's house a good place praise God put your focus on God's house because that's what was that was the trouble they are running from the house of God rather than focusing on the house of God and then memory verse 11 there was a drought so God held back the rains because they were not focused on rebuilding the house of God because of persecution or legal trouble all right who's up is Lydia maokai okay can you go to Hagee i won Lilya verse twelve read twelve and thirteen I know it's a lot but let's make a guy the Lord's messenger and the Lord's message or do the people say I Amen praise God so I like that the Lord's messenger brother Branham in the Lord's message I like that but a man was God's messenger in the message right the message so is Hagee i he was the Lord the messenger in the Lord's message is the message of your hour right and like this in verse 14 the Lord stirred him up so that means they were discouraged zoomable was discouraged he got part of the victory but he hadn't seen the whole church built yet but it took two prophets by the bank prophesying and when they prophesied it stirred the people up to do something for God and that's the way the word should be for us all the time we should get word after service after service and it should stir us up praise God Amen I know there's a time and season for everything right I wish there's more signs and wonders and miracles I wish there's more Souls being saved by God knows I pray for I was praying for this morning I pray for it all the time but I know God's got a time in season four at all but one thing we can do is we can receive the word God sends us faithfully and let it stir sup for the next week and for the next few days and keep stirred up by the word of God that's something we can do because if the word is being preached it's not there just to fall on dead ground right it's there to be quickened by the Holy Spirit the seed of God's Word is to be quickened by the Holy Spirit and we can do that we can allow God to do that and look and they the spear of all around at finishing 14 at the end and they came and did the work of the house of the Lord of Hosts their God pray God okay now in Chapter two we see this again emphasized about the Millennial temple so let's go to sister Wendy says winning Chapter two can you read three and four please is it not in your eyes in comparison it's nothing yet now be strong go through the whole set the void and be strong Oh Joe Joshua son of John said amen see God's saying like remember you older people you saw Solomon's house but he said don't worry about it don't worry about the size of the house amen don't worry about the size of the church praise God just know that I'm with you praise God that's encouragement we have today but Amen can you read five and six please yeah once in a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and amen now look he prophesized Christ in verse seven and I will shake all the nations and the desire of all nations amen shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of hosts now that wasn't actually speaking in that physical house right because it was going to be built and then destroyed and built and destroyed Oh destroyed he's talking about the Millennial house the silver is mine the gold is mine verse eight said the Lord hosts I hear his verse tonight the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and this place will I give peace say at the Lord of hosts amen he's saying in Jerusalem in Jerusalem the desire of all nations will come Jesus Christ amen and Jesus did bring peace but he's when he came the first time but when he comes the second time for the 144,000 the glory of that one be be greater than a glory of all of them praise God because it be no more sin of the land praise God in Christ will rule this nation he'll rule this world praise God he'll rule everything the desire of all nations praise God the glory of the latter house be greater than the former there cried all we want Solomon's day we want so I was they and gods like I'm gonna do some way greater than that brings God a man I'm gonna restart with the Millennial temple hallelujah see so this is I mean these are small little books this is a two chapter book but it's so powerful like we're still waiting for these things to be fulfilled right now praise God and we're so close say men closer than we've ever been so I wanted to make sure you saw those there now go to Zechariah for Zechariah this is the next book over is that cry for now most of you know this now in verse three I've been through this before but and verse 3 God has to encourage Joshua the high priests and he shows them in heaven where Josh was in heaven standing by God and Satan's right there and Satan's accusing Joshua and God God shows the vision to Zechariah to give to Joshua that keep if you keep the Word of God I'll take all your sinful garments away and I'll give you a white garments amen you and he said if you keep the Word of God you will be a pleasing servant unto me that's in chapter 3 it's a beautiful story of what happens in heaven now if that happened with him and job it has happened with us right and he said you got to keep the way of the Lord yeah so go to verse Zechariah three Lydia can you read huh Zechariah three can you read verses one and two hundred a men now if you read down here says he's gonna rebuke Satan he's gonna put a garment on him clean garment and put a mitre on his head that's the high priest mark mitre in other words they're not having Church but God is saying I'm gonna forgive you and if you keep the word you're gonna be dressed and all the high priest garment and you're gonna start fulfilling your purpose in life amen right if you just believe the Prophet you're gonna be dressed and you're gonna be ready to serve God in your position I'm gonna restore worship in Mike in my city praise God he said if you keep the word of the Lord it's in verse seven the angel said in John was saying thus saith the Lord of Hosts if thou will walk in my ways and if thou keep my charge then thou shall also keep them judge my house and shall also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by ah if he just obeys God Word and believe that he's forgiving in heaven and trust in God God will establish him he'll know he's in the perfect will of God amen man that's beautiful and then a verse chapter 4 you know the vision of the two olive trees right well they represent Haggai and Zechariah but they also represent Moses and Elijah right they do because that's what it speaks up in revelation 11 but remember in verse 6 then the answer is speaking to me saying this is the word Lord under who's the rubra bull Sosa's rouble hasn't worked for 16 years he's got encouraged that guy he said give that guy an encouraging word not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts they can hey it's gonna be through the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah that your spirit will be stirred up and you can finish the house of God all we got now is that we just got a foundation we're not finished yet praise God and he's saying the preaching of these prophets is gonna stir you up amen has helped you finish the house amen Peleg in verse seven who art Thou O great mountain so he they saw this huge mountain of political pressure right artaxerxes and his decrees and all these soldiers were there keeping them from building and to see th the sea to Zerubbabel it was a mountain a church what is your big problem today what and what's your mouth what's my mountain they're mounted with soldiers saying you can't build right here they're mount was a piece of paper where the king said you can't build what's your Mountain sometimes you make our mountains way too big and we don't realize God sounds rouble what's your Mountain who arced out great Mel before rule thou shalt become a plane amen and he shall bring forth the headstone he was the same one that laid the cornerstone a team ahead zoobel laid the cornerstone and the prophet said the same one that laid the cornerstone is the same one that's gonna lay the headstone and it's going to come forth with shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen hallelujah thank the Lord but a man said see that he said why did they put the headstone of the pyramid because the headstone was rejected when it come I'm sorry why did they not put the headset on the Pyramid of Giza because the headstone was rejected but now according to prophecy there will come the headstone and I want you to notice that when the headstone comes the prints that's going to cry out the message will cry out grace grace for it's by grace you're saved not by works lest any man should boast so see the men fail brother amen they got discouraged they gave in to political pressure and so God is showing them grace grace came by Zechariah and grace came by Hagi I even had two prophets that give them grace grace Amon in other words repent obey the Word of God and God will finish the work that he started praise God that'll encourage this church it's by grace verse 9 says the hands of zoobel had laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish him amen and I shall know the Lord of Hosts has sent me to help you now like this who hath despised the day of small things all those people where they ain't men they're like we're just a small little church you guys are nothing compared to what we used to me when we were first in a message I'm just gonna bring it to our day is it that's what the old people were said you guys think you're so great and gods like why would you just despise the day of small things I'm in this it's gonna look smaller it's gonna look weaker but yet I'm still with you I want you to be encouraged I want you to be strengthened want you to finish and establish the worship amen how do I know it's a day of small things that's what we got today a day of small things it's a smaller church less and less people being saved all the time fewer fewer will be that find it we have a today as small things but God is with us amen that's right then that's how we can see how applies to our life because we can see it's a day of small things as far as small number okay all right good so that's a pretty good start and give me I got a couple minutes on here give me ten more minutes here by God's grace all right now go back if you would here we hit Zechariah and Haggai are let's go back to Ezra hope you got your Bible ribbon there your bookmark what's the name of that again okay gotcha I thought Chapter five Ezra fine now in verse three the governor who was set up by the Persian king his name's tat and I he sees them building again after sixteen years into verse threes like who have commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall verse five says but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews that they could not cause them to cease praise God hey man they were so stirred up by these prophets that even the governor's couldn't stop him down they couldn't stop him see this proves light like Moses if God's with you all those Egyptian servants couldn't kill Moses cuz God would God send them there and all those servants of Pat and I and all of his soldiers they couldn't stop the builders because God was with them praise God and if God's with us we won't be able to be stopped praise God who keep doing the Word of God preaching the Word of God living it spreading it doing all we can if God is with us praise God Amen because the eye of their God is upon them hallelujah now here is where the temple is finished go to chapter six in chapter 6 a new leader raises up so we went from cyrus artaxerxes and now to darius that all sound familiar right from the days of daniel darius now he's helped supports it yeah he confirms the decree of Cyrus that's right yeah he that's right he finds the scroll of Cyrus that's right hey man I forgot about that bye and then he starts supporting it now first let's go 6 13 where I'm at Lydia is it your turn I don't know either go ahead sweetie sir Lydia 613 so did obeying the prophets help them out yes the Bible said they prospered and we can apply that because 2nd John says I would that you prosper in health even as your soul prospers right and then Chronicle says if you honor God's prophets God will honor you right so we can learn from that if we honor our brother his message the Word of God that he taught no no as we saw not every idea not every you know personal opinion a brother branham but honor the word that brother Ram brought God will prop Russ and I'm a living example of that are you - is your life prospering it ought to you know less you're going through like a job situation or something like that so we should see their lives prospered through the preaching of the word the prophets and they build it and they finished it praise God so Zuba was there to lay that last stone that headstone I wonder if I was rounded or pointed but he used the same one that laid the cornerstone and he lays the head so never shouting grace grace God gave us grace to finish this work amen hallelujah now verse 16 the children Israel the priests and the Levites in the rest the children of the captivity kept the dedication in this house of God with joy and offered at the dedication the house have got a hundred bullets there's a hundred bullocks my goodness I can't imagine how much blood that would be can you imagine it 2,000 Rams 2,000 revs I don't even know what $2,000 looks like little in 2000 Rams I'm sorry 200 yeah thank you 400 lambs and for a sin offering for all Israel 12 he goads accorded a number of the tribes of Israel and they set the leave of the priests in their divisions the Levites in their courses for the service of God which was at Jerusalem as is written in the Book of Moses now look they're trying to restore David's worship that's what we're trying to restore the book of Acts worship amen see there's so many are so many applicable types it's a smaller thing it's a smaller work is not as big as the zoo the street you know but we're trying to restore what they had the beginning praise God this would be smaller it's gonna be despised we said don't get discouraged about size just keep working for the kingdom of God amen and then they restore the Passover in at the end of chapter 6 now for those you who know chapter 7 begins Ezra so verses or chapters 1 to 6 is 0 bible and then Ezra fast-forward 60 years and now you have Azra coming back and Ezra is a teacher of the law so he's back at Babylon and he just raised enough you know and he's just learning the Word of God and he gets a opportunity to go back to Jerusalem that's going on a 7 verse 9 Wendy could you read Ezra 7 90/10 please good and of his thought upon him or as her had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it teach an issue status and that beautiful Ezra had prepared his heart not just to seek God but to do it we could all grain a we can all gain a great lesson right there how many read your Bible everything you read your Bible how many pray every day now how many ready to do it every day now that's a whole new thing right there that's the Azra as I said I prepare my heart I know the word and I'm gonna do the word now one thing I didn't did you catch that and verse nine it was a four month trip can you imagine starting now for your homeland sister Naomi and trying to go back to Ghana four months later so February March April meant you get there in May you get there in two days right and one day there is your plane ride right but four months he had to travel all the way back to his homeland four months but he was prepared in his heart the Bible says he was already scribe in verse six Ezra went up from Babylon for he was already scribe in the law of Moses so all those years in Babylon he prepared study the word study the word that's what I tell you children and even you adults you brothers to God might raise you up to be preachers someday now I got a night raised to be a preacher something you don't know what God is gonna do with you but keep that word in your heart read the word obey the word live the word be ready because Bible says be ready instant in season and out of season amen that's what Azra he didn't know if it's gonna be him or not he didn't know he just kept his heart ready always be ready right like we said this morning always be ready to give an answer Lord willing I'm gonna debate that guy and that's why I got a I got to go through these and I appreciate you listening to me it really helps me I appreciate sharing the comments afterwards I got to have a Bible answer for everything because my dad said God won't do anything outside the Bible he could but he won't so anything that happened in whether his ministry there has to be some Bible example for it because brother answered God won't leave the Bible and he won't have an ER shall pass away my were never best way so as I said there I don't have to understand everything but I got to have proof about why God would do something like that okay so I appreciate that here I go again I just get on the spirit of preaching okay now let's close with a couple more things here I want to just lay this in okay so 60 years later Ezra comes and let me just show you where can I just show you where maokai fits in here okay now Nehemiah comes 14 years after Ezra so now you got it Zuma Bowl 60 years after him Ezra 14 years after Ezra comes Nehemiah and he's the one he's like he's like he's praying oh god kind of he said Oh King can I go see the ha I've heard about the walls broken down and the King goes yeah go ahead and he gets there and he rides through the the city at night and he starts weeping and crying because all the walls are down the temples there but the walls are broken down and he built that thing as fast as he could the Bible said they fought with one hand and they bill with the other can you imagine get off me devil but they're building get out that's that's that's how enthused they were about the work of God but let me show you where Malachi fits in so I'm closing with us go to Nehemiah 13 6 here's where Malachi comes in because all these prophets are so closely connected Ezra Nehemiah Haggai Zechariah Malachi so according to this Bible Dictionary in Nehemiah 13 6 all right just a moment ok so yeah so the walls are already finished the yeah I'm almost the walls get finished in chapter 12 they dedicate the walls in chapter 12 now 13 verse 6 they start cleaning out the temple again so even though they're so encouraged they got the wall up the people back slid in the church they and I got to go back and clean up the church they just when they built it what less than what 80 years ago and the people are working on the Sabbath they're intermarrying these heathen don't believe the word they're selling money like the moneychangers with Jesus it's all that stuff and so once they once Nehemiah he's so encouraged he got the walls up that he got I got to go back and clean out the beginning again see judgment begins at the house of God always judgment begins right here with you and I but if we obey it will bypass the judgment later the Nehemiah thirteen six now this is when they were stealing some money to here not thirteen six but in all this time was I not in Jerusalem for in the two and thirty at 30th year of artaxerxes king of Babylon came I under the king and after certain days obtained I leave of the king so there's about two years Nehemiah left after getting the walls done he went back to king artaxerxes and history says during that time Malachi comes in and preaches he's the last prophet he's the last prophet before Jesus Christ comes right before John the Baptist and most you know the book of Malachi but if you go down to Nehemiah 3:10 Lydia you got your Bible now okay oh yeah okay Lydia Matt Nehemiah 1310 and can you read that then consider the reason why is the house of God forsaken and I gather them together and set them in their place and then look at verse 12 then they brought all the tithes of the corn the new wine right in the oil and does that sound familiar if you run the reference in your Scofield Bible where does it take you Malachi 3 so let's stand with a sinner of feet and clothes right there so it's beautiful while Nehemiah is not there God sends Malachi there to preach to them and say you've robbed the house of God with your tithes and offerings and nobody nobody says anything about it two years there in Nehemiah comes back he's not ever seen people aren't paying their tithes and offerings in here and the people repent and they because all the Levites are out there working so see the people when Nehemiah was gone they disobeyed Malachi but then when God's man gets back Nehemiah he brings up the same thing and said we got to support the house of God now you all you do a great job paying your tithes offerings god bless you so do I paid my ties yesterday but uh but look I just want to see how it fits together when there was no met that meant no man they're like Nehemiah God send in Malachi you know Malachi means my messenger remember Hagee I was the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message God said one more he said my messengers going there to try to warn those people before I send John the Baptist's in Jesus Christ so Malachi 3 7 now Church you can know how it kind of I hope this helps does this help you can see how it's just beautiful stories to understand the Old Testament because all these guys are thinking what who are these guys preaching to it's all that that returning group that returning small little group God was doing something small but he's preparing them to receive the Christ and then that was all prefigure of preparing receiving the Son of David in the Millennium the glory of the latter will be greater than the former praise God Malachi 3 7 even from the days of your fathers are you going away from my ordinances I've not kept them returned unto me and I'll return them to you say the Lord of Hosts but you say we're and shall we return will a man Rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee and tithes and offerings your curse with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation but the Amen you were saying about the storehouse tonight I thought that's some indication right there bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there should not be room enough to receive it alright let's have our musicians come praise God now I just I didn't get to all of it but I hope you can see it now Zorua bow first then Ezra well I guess you could say servile Haggai Zechariah then 60 years later Ezra and then 14 years later Nehemiah Nehemiah comes rebuilds the walls he's got to go back and then Malachi comes in and gives him thus saith the Lord then Nehemiah comes back you know that guy did he broke up those marriages the Bible said he ripped out their beards can you imagine a preacher doing that he rips out their beers rip out their hair he in other words he just does anything to try to get them obey the Word of God I was at the right spirit probably not I never seen Jesus ripping out people's hair although he was whipping him you know whipping the animals things not hurt the animals but trying to clean out the house of God hope that's a blessing Church and each one's ruble and Ezra brought a wave of people back they were bringing people back to restore God's worship do you think God's interested in worship absolutely you think God wants people to act like that at the beginning absolutely he wants it to be restored that's why we're here tonight let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer God is a great restorer how many babies a great Redeemer a great restorer he's so great Church he wants it restored so bad he'll even anoint heathen kings to do his purpose raise god don't have to be a Christian like I believe that with Donald Trump perhaps maybe honey no he's the Christian but God's using him to protect Israel got to use anybody but we want to be the faithful servants that hear the prophecy of this hour through God's prophet and we want to prosper in God's ways by obeying the Word of God how many raise your hand say yes Lord let that be me let me prosper by obeying the Word of God Heavenly Father Lord my hands are up Lord but I see it I see you're prospering hand each shot I get you just pour out more grace each problem you always raise up an answer Lord your merciful dear God and Lord I know this you keep your word you I may not understand it I may not be able to explain it but I know you keep your word you're faithful to it and Lord your word proves all things right or bless us tonight Lord our hands are up we want to prosper we want to keep your word it's a small thing it's a small age of small believers where there's less and less fewer and fewer but Lord you're with us thank you lord god you're with us and the Lord dear God that we know because we couldn't stand on our own without your help dear Gandhi proving you're with us that's us here tonight in your God may the people receive all the word they have need of may they give a card in their ability Lord God we're not talking money we're just talking given of ourselves and to you a year gone on an earlier we might positionally be placed back together as a body a bride a spiritual body of believers each one in their position doing the will of God we will not despise the day of small things thank you for being with us [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]
