this series here tonight on the uh the mystery of the church as the bride and maybe we'll just read the scripture proverbs 31 and i just pulled up that text i was looking here april's jose's month and they uh naomi your month is in may for a memory verse if you want to you don't have to uh karen was june brother amen was july hua was august brenda was september steve in october and i'll probably put the blands in there i was gonna live in malachi but i might put the blands in there you know because they're adults and everything you're close son i just thought i'd you know honor the adults you know but if they don't want to then you're next so proverbs 31 let's go there by god's grace i'd like to finish this uh series we'll see if we can do that tonight uh preach about 45 minutes we'll see how that goes a beautiful beautiful chapter here with a wonderful scripture here verse 10 let's just read verse 10 notice how this proverbs 31 woman she is above all women there's none like this proverbs 31 woman we know a perfect type of the bride of jesus christ then you know after we read this then we'll just we'll read brother vangs uh just memory verse just so i keep in the habit of it so i don't forget i don't want to end up forgetting so proverbs 31 10. let's read that together on three one two three who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies praise god let's go to ecclesiastes we're really close to ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. let's read that together especially our young people let's remember the lord as you're young here on three one two three remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the near ears draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them amen let's have one more word of prayer let's have a need if you have a need on your heart let's just lift it up to the lord here heavenly father we just come reverently lord faithfully routinely lord as jesus did lord the scripture says jesus custom was to be in the synagogue on the sabbath so lord our custom is as often as we can to be in the house of the lord and we know lord there's no disappointments when we come to the house of god with faith so lord we come here with faith tonight lord we come with that trust that assurance that revelation that something will be said lord to bless us to strengthen us lord to help us to give us a little more grace and strength on the journey lord god and so god we're thankful for that lord we know your word can never fail lord god may we edify one another lord god and strengthen one another use me and use each person lord god to bless one another and father i just pray god you give me insight wisdom lord on this subject here tonight give me new thoughts lord if it be your will new things old old things father god treasures new and old let thy will be done bless those live-streaming lord god that have taken time out lord to to listen especially bless those that have pressed the right to the house of god here tonight lord god we know where two or three are gathered there you are in the midst thank you that you're here jesus we're trusting in you you're the guest of honor we put you first god we humble ourselves and father let your spirit have lord his way today father god none of us are anything at all we're just trusting in you or we're trying to use our gifts to yield to you lord god that you would uh speak something lord or answer some prayer father god minister to some need we pray we know you'll do it and we trust you to do it in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god we'll try to finish this thought and we may take one more service we'll see how it goes last time we ended with priscilla you know we ended with those lists of the women that were great testimonies that we could learn from like abigail bathsheba mary anna mary magdalene samaritan woman mary of bethany and then the priscilla we ended that with uh the last time we were gathered together on a wednesday night so let's look at this proverbs 31 woman i'm going to review a little bit when i preach on this uh about three years ago and then we'll uh we'll try to bring it down to a close there notice the bible said her value is far above rubies i did that online search a single carrot of a ruby was worth two million dollars for a single carrot okay and so this woman's value is far above two million dollars amen she has such a great value and the bible said who can find it right so these kind of women are hard to find as well praise god a proverbs 30 woman you're not going to find her just any old church right let alone any old business or any old home she's extremely hard to find this we're talking of course natural but ultimately pointing to the spiritual godly woman the bride of jesus christ she's just not found anywhere and her price is so great you could put millions if not of billions of dollars on it right such a great value for a real christian and woman course we know the bride was so valuable that god gave the greatest thing he could innocent blood that was the greatest gift he could give in payment to purchase back his fallen church his fallen people sending his own son so valuable he sent his holy sinless son to pay her price her ransom as we saw and give a receipt that the price has been paid amen thank the lord for that far above far above millions of dollars is this woman's value she's she's so much like the shulamite remember the shulamite from song of solomon she kept saying that she was he kept saying that she was the fairest of all in fact if you got your bible let's just read that real quick song of solomon uh one verse eight i was listening to brother brandon preach today and he let brother neville read he let all the preachers read and it was nice to hear that you know i kind of let our our little ones read here song of solomon 1 8 and song of solomon uh 5 9. song of solomon 1 8 she was uh shulamite was unlike any other song of solomon 1 8 says if thou know not o thou fairest among women so there we see she's fairest among women that's the first witness we get a second witness in song of psalm 5 verse 9. thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with i'm sorry that was 4-9 that's good though she ravishes his heart that's right that's good 5 9 though what is thy beloved more than another beloved o thou pharis among women so there's twice two witnesses that solomon says she's fair than all other women and then song of solomon 6 1 whither is thy beloved god o thou affairs among women so again it's three times she's called uh fairest among women so i'm going back to proverbs 31 here now actually you know i think i read the wrong verse for my text i want to read verse 29 so forgive me proverbs 31 29 it says many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all so there's where we see how this proverbs 31 woman this bride that the the mother wanted for king solomon she was going to be excelling all of them no doubt the shulamite i think it speaks to the same one if i'm not mistaken she excels all of them as we are saying as remember what job the bible said that god looked and and he told the devil he said he said job is the most righteous man of all of them so that means god has an order right god knows who has the most effort who's in other words who's yielding the most to grace because paul said he labored more than all when he said it wasn't me it was grace so it was paul's will that was yielded over to paul was able to yield more of his time more efforts to god's grace and remember grace is not spirit the bible said we must not we must obey the spirit of grace right those that crucify christ do despite the spirit of grace so we know the spirit of grace is the holy spirit amen hallelujah so paul said i i yield more to the holy spirit in other words paul walked more in the spirit than other brothers amen and god knew job did the same job walked in the spirit more than others and he walked the most in the spirit as a righteous man so church i don't know i don't want to be the lowest one walk in the spirit but i want to be up there some someplace kind of high i don't want to be a disgrace to my lord i don't want to disappoint my lord but i want to remember that the he that's forgiven much loveth much i want to remember how much i'm forgiven so i'll love god more and i'll surrender more to god's will praise god i don't want to be the lowest i i don't want to compete i don't want to compete for the highest but then paul says run the race like you're going to be the one that wins it amen praise god i didn't catch that till now so we ought to run against our flesh like we're going to be the only one to win the prize amen hallelujah and that's how this look at this that's how this woman ran that's how this woman ran her life right this proverbs 31 woman she excelled all the other ones praise god so she lived such a godly life that the holy spirit in solomon said my she's the most righteous of all of them amen what a team that would have been uh job and this proverbs 31 woman put them together that had been such a team now of course they weren't ordained to be married but what what a what an example what a compliment the holy spirit's giving here now this woman uh there's many virtuous women i love that name virtue right we love that name but there's one that excels all of them there's one that has the most virtue of all of them maybe that's our virtue jesus excels all of them so there's virtue virtue virtue but then there's the most virtuous of all that's the proverbs 31 woman praise god it must be the shulamite as well praise god many have done great this one excels all of them this speaks of jesus christ bride she's washed you don't have any spots amen she don't have any wrinkles that's how i like that's how i i like my shirts from the dry cleaners no wrinkles right honey i like no wrinkles right this bride has no spot and no wrinkle praise god nothing wrong with her she has no blemish she's perfect before the throne of god amen of course spiritual she's heaven's one blood washed great multitude from every nation the bible said she has a represent a representation from every single nation right from the u.s from ghana praise god from argentina from new zealand right uh from africa you name it you name every nation the united kingdom you start naming them uh guyana right god's everyone there's a bride member from each nation praise god and they're all standing there the same with their white garments on amen in their holiness in in the power of the holy spirit they're standing there with their palms the bible says and he's got one bride he's got one multitude and the bible says she serves him amen oh i'm gonna love that if i love serving jesus this much over here i'm gonna love heaven because i'm just gonna keep serving jesus more and more amen she serves jesus and she never leaves aside amen oh hallelujah you know we have to leave one another here you have to leave every sunday wednesday we get to leave each other's side right but we'll never leave jesus's side amen we'll be there i don't know they talk about going to other worlds i don't want to go really to another world unless jesus is there i don't that's just that's just my opinion you you can do what you want but i just want to hang around i just want to be with jesus amen i just want to be with my lord amen the one who died for me the one who's got all power the ones that got all wisdom one that can tell me they answered all my questions praise god she should never leave it now this woman is the culmination of the book of proverbs remember chapter one the bible said lady wisdom was walking through the streets crying out who will partake of my wisdom who will to partake of my wisdom and remember she said she'd pour out her wisdom on anyone who listened to her right that was proverbs 1 verses 20 21 22 23 and here in the final chapter you see you find the woman who listened to that original woman you find the young maiden who's going to marry solomon here must be the shoot of mine she heard that lady wisdom and she became wisdom praise god right the wisdom became embodied in a flesh body praise god the word became flesh that's what you and i are the word made flesh praise god not maybe our bodies but our souls our soul is the holy spirit right it's god's nature and that nature came out of god it's a part of god amen it's a part of the god and god is the word amen and the word as we obey it our flesh obeys the word of god and then we become the word and flesh praise god we're in other words we're manifesting god's promises for this day amen that's what that woman did back there my the most holy of all women the most valuable of all women that proverbs 31 woman she became all the wisdom she heard about oh may god help us help our little ones to do that praise god that everything they hear it'll just be written upon the tables of their heart and they'll grow up and they'll be a generation but maybe by god's grace that exceed our wisdom amen that exceed our understanding oh my hallelujah church i we can look back at it now we can look at all the message people that have gone on to be with the lord bless their hearts but we can see that our revelation has exceeded theirs i can see it at least the ones that i've known they all knew god sent a prophet they had healings and things but we've got a better understanding of the message right we don't compromise like maybe some of them did right we don't backslide like some of them did right we don't we don't put it off for another day we want to be the joshua joshua generation that takes all the promises amen right they knew the prophet we don't know the prophet right but we want to be the generation that takes the word of god and takes all possession of everything god wants us to have amen oh yes hallelujah like they didn't know what was the seals about what was this about you know they they kind of stumble on all these doctrines oh maybe the church ages ended and maybe the maybe the lamb's not on the mercy seat anymore maybe 1977 really did end it spiritually and so you know we're in the millennium now there's people that believe that there's really people that believe that yet they might have known brother branham or they might have seen the prayer line or they might have been in a meeting but they they never really crossed over here to the promises of god to possess every promise of god church may god help us to possess all those promises of god's faith god's virtue jesus's knowledge jesus temperance his patience his godliness his brother kindness and his charity amen and that all the gifts of the holy spirit will flow through our church how many believing for that i'm believing for that praise god i heard simon say they don't have them all operating nor do we but we got quite a few of them praise god is we went through the testimonies a few months ago you started naming those off you know we you see many of those operating which is a blessing praise god but they're all operated at god's will praise god now we have to pray for them and we have to do our part and we we've got to pray more for that we got to believe for the supernatural right we got to build up our most holy faith praying in the holy spirit praise god and then god will manifest more and more through those gifts but where other people have died and said there was no gifts anymore we don't need the gifts all i know is that we need more of the holy ghost amen and i know that means more gifts praise god hallelujah like i was preaching there on sunday morning it was the strangest one of the strangest sermons i ever preached uh you remember when i preached on the day stars risen in our hearts for easter a couple years ago well i was going to preach on god's receipt but i couldn't print them off i didn't have access to the printer and it was easter and it was too late you know i'm sorry i just preached that little thought and i just took a few thoughts and i preached i thought this is really strange and you know the people were kind of into it you know uh you know called the prayer line a couple people come up for prayer well in between services i'm in the office and we get a call and a brother says he live-streamed the sermon he said that sermon was completely for me he said i had an evil spirit on me he said all this darkness was on me he said while you were preaching the demons left me i repented of my sins i was weeping crying i got on my knees live streaming and then i went and called two or three people uh to make right all these complexes that i had because i preached on the darkness when light comes in the darkness has to flee and it happens like that light is the fastest thing known to man praise god right so the word of god the effects of the word of god is faster than anything else amen and when it shines in our hearts it ought to drive away uh any darkness you know a couple of people come up for prayer said it was for them but it was really nice to hear somebody that it was directly for them praise god and directly right to their situation the complexes they build up and uh really wonderful to hear that and the spirit kind of drove off evil spirits off this individual that's always a great blessing now you remember uh getting back to the prophetic one woman starting at verse 10 every verse starts with uh the first or the letter of the alphabet that's called an acrostic poem in hebrew so uh so the first letter uh i believe it was called aleph is what starts that the word who must be start with the first letter of the hebrew alphabet aleph and then the last verse verse 31 ends with the last hebrew letter tav so a left and then tav and so this shows the whole alphabet sums up the proverbs 31 woman she's completely wise she's completely godly right and it reminds us of jesus uh because jesus is called the alpha and omega he's the first and last letter of the greek alphabet so this woman is the hebrew alphabet right but this christ here he's the first and last of the greek alphabet we know it means the same thing alphabet right your language or any formation of the word hallelujah he's all of it praise god he he's from the beginning to the end amen and that's how this woman is she's from beginning to the end she's all of it in other words she has believed every word she's lived every word she's accepted every word amen you see her you see her uh throughout the whole language praise god you see her in everything beautiful right you see her at every every kind word every every good thought she's in all of that in other words god's plan is all about saving that woman amen his whole plan is to redeem his bride and bring her back to the garden of eden amen hallelujah give his son a bride jesus needs a bride and that's who he's redeeming today by god's grace from every age remember she's all beautiful head to toe according to solomon right and uh jesus jesus's bride will live all the word that's prophesied about her from the first prophecy to the last right so her entire being the bible says also speaking of her body the bible said jesus is going to preserve us blameless unto the day of the lord jesus christ her whole body spirit and soul is preserved blameless amen god's going to take care of every part of us amen aren't you glad he heals your body amen aren't you glad he delivers you from mind battles in your mind aren't you glad he seals your soul with his holy spirit amen see he's he's he's got a hedge about your whole being praise god all of it from the a to z to it amen remember this woman is a woman of prophecy right because in verse 1 of proverbs 31 verse 1 the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him this was a prophecy hallelujah this is a prophetic woman amen she was ordained to come church you were ordained for this age brother said there you couldn't come in any other age god placed you in this age amen god didn't want you in the old testament so we shouldn't uh be jealous of them right god didn't want you here on earth when jesus was here although we don't it's hard not to be jealous of them the things they got to see but god didn't want us here when brother branham was here god wanted us here at the end time amen so we had a special place a special position that we've got to fulfill just like this woman she's a woman of prophecy praise god and so see this proverbs 31 woman it's a prophecy that she's going to fulfill all the word of god and that's a prophecy of the bride of jesus she's going to fulfill and have total obedience to all the word of god she's going to keep all the commands of god amen now proverbs 31 traces the path of wisdom it goes from mother to child then child i'm sorry from mother to child then child uh to spouse and then to children right and then the community so that's the path that travels right mother the child the child raises up the king he married godly wife right and this godly uh wife is gonna train their children she's gonna impact the community and of course the king is going to impact the community amen church you never know like brother said you'll never know how many souls you impact till we make it over there somebody at the store like i had somebody literally remember when you got your uh debit card remember that woman uh she's like you know what this took like an hour to get lydia debit card like can't they do this any faster you know uh but she's like you know in the middle of it she just stopped she said you know you were a man she said a giant eagle a few years ago you were in a suit on a sunday she said i had a flat tire it was so cold i couldn't get it to pump she said you just stopped your big van she said you got out of your van and said you need help pumping that tire and i s and she said yeah she said you come over mr smith and pumped it for me and just left with a smile and said god bless you she said i want to thank you for that i never got a chance to thank you for i'm like i don't even remember doing that but everything matches the description sunday big van suit and tie glasses she said my hair and everything like that and here it is years later and she still remembers now she remembers what about god amen and that's just a natural uh that's just a natural act what about the things you do in secret that god always sees amen right i do that openly in public i got probably got my reward for that that's fine you know maybe maybe my reward is just lydia seeing you know her dad does nice things you know and i should do nice things too but you know god has greater rewards that's in your private prayer your prayer private giving amen you're whispering prayers to god all by yourself those things you do in secret god sees that and he's going to reward you richly praise god amen so see church we should impact the community and i guess our little humble ways never skip church though if you're gonna do that don't never skip church wait till after church then you can do some good acts for the community some volunteering for the community like i told you i take some of my ties and i send them to some food shelters you know because i don't really have time to go there i'd like to but when am i going to do that i guess i could do in the summer but i just got it's easier for me just to send the cash you're going to send the electronic cash you know you want to do good the community you know sometimes i'll pick up trash out here you know by the road just to kind of make our church look a little nicer little things like that but uh here we see how it travels it's got to start with the godly mother aren't you glad for your godly moms or any godly wisdom they gave you or godly fathers it's got to start there with the parents right and then it comes out of the child the child grows up with a marriage and then their their marriage impacts but a king especially impacts the whole nation and that's what that's why this was so important uh the mother was trying to get the king to see this is the kind of woman you got to choose you got to choose a godly woman right you got to choose a virtuous woman the bible said virtuous now that don't mean because he virtuous that don't mean she's popular it's probably the opposite she's not popular it don't mean she's rich remember the shulamite he found her out there shepherding and she was all you know sunburned by the skin or sun sunburned by the sun rather her skin was sunburned just you know being the virtuous doesn't mean you're the most popular or even the prettiest right to compare to worldly standards right by telling god's eyes you're beautiful praise god amen when modesty and holiness and and like brother man says you women that are godly you girls that are godly because of your purity he said you got something you have something on your face those worldly women can never have that countenance of the holy spirit right remember cain got the bad countenance when he left the friends of the lord you see most of these women out there that got an evil countenance but when you got the holy spirit in your life you've got a godly countless nobody can take it from you amen it's a beautiful countenance amen i'm gonna do it on time i keep forgetting i didn't set my timer going kind of slow but i guess that's okay i could go another week on this see he said she especially tells the the son to choose a godly wife a virtuous wife because he's going to influence the entire kingdom right like with the story of esther that's why you know that's why esther became queen was because bashi had to be put away because she was going to impact the whole kingdom right now our girls are never probably not going to grow up and be the wife of the president or the president the way things go now you wouldn't want to fulfill that prophecy you know you may not have some great you know place in society but you will impact your home and that's really what god wants you to do and ask can i say like this your church right think of our little sisters all looking up to our adult sisters right they see the ones that are really faithful they see the ones how they worship you know they see the ones that maybe don't you know ones that are on fire the ones that are backslidden they see that your life's speaking to them praise god amen you're living the life before them praise god they see jesus christ when they need a little help who they run to the mama dad's probably to do too much for him but the sisters could have a great impact on the children now remember church now this is a type because the bible says we're kings and priests unto god so this king has to make a big decision so does our spiritual kings and queens and thank god in america you sisters thank god our sisters ought to give god praise that you have a choice who you marry right some nations they don't have a choice you ought to thank god for that you have a choice and so it's your duty also to pray and make sure that's the right guy we know numerous people that i'm sure they wish they would have prayed more of course i'm looking at lydia moore she's getting older really looking at lydia make sure you pray i'll be praying with you that's for sure i'll be saying lydia let's come up to the altar here you better make sure because you have a uh you're both responsible in this case not just the dad and the you know the husband but the sister has a choice in this too and then the bible says remember you reign in life by one jesus christ amen the only way you're going to rule over sin is by being connected to christ being under the anointing of the holy spirit amen you're a kingdom priest but you only reign over these things when you're under the anointing under the leadership of the holy spirit when you're walking in the holy spirit when you walk in the flesh you're not under his leadership but when you walk in the holy spirit you're led by the holy spirit then you reign in this life then and you're like a commander praise god you're like a joshua you're like a general you're in control how many believe you're in control by the holy spirit amen the bible said under the holy spirit he said you're a master of every circumstance remember that he said when you're obedient to faith when you're walking in faith and under the holy spirit you're a master of every circumstance someone tries to deceive you someone tries to trick you you just wait there till the holy spirit gives you the right answer so you can kind of discern the situation you're not easily deceived right you're not easily tricked you don't just go around with the crowd right you just don't go along with the joke or you don't go along with the teasing right you don't go along with that because you're walking under the holy spirit you only want to say what father wants you to say amen you've got the mind of christ and jesus said i don't say anything except the father shows me first that's the mind of christ hallelujah so we reign in life this life by jesus christ see she's highly valued and she's praised because she's got two attributes she fears the lord and does good to her husband all the days of our life i'm gonna read this our closest relationships reveal our true spiritual conditions everyone knew this woman feared god her heavenly head because of the attitude and actions towards her earthly head her husband how did they know this woman was more virtuous because of how she treated her husband right christians who have spiritual treasure in their hearts or knowledge of jesus christ will also have the treasure of loving relationships in their home can you paul proverbs 15 verse 6 proverbs 15 verse 6 6 says in the house of the righteous is much treasure that's what the chapter i'm writing now right in this next family book here i'm writing chapter one's called family treasures i might name the book that too so see this is what the woman this is this is her main duty in life is to have such spiritual connection to christ that her she gathers so much treasure inside of her house right and we know the treasure though has to start in your heart because jesus said the good man from the good treasure of his heart speaks good words i remember that scripture the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart speaks evil words and he says every idle word will be given account of on the day of judgment in other words either got a evil storehouse or a good sore house oh thank god for a good storehouse when you've got good storehouse you speak good things amen you're not gonna tease your brother sister right you're not gonna curse somebody right you're not gonna say evil things when you've got good treasure in your heart good things come out of your mouth amen treasure something valuable amen something valuable comes out of our mouth amen we've got good treasure we're going to speak good words right so see the treasures can't get built up in the house until they get built up in our hearts and then come out of our mouths right like we were kind of laughing yesterday we were at the store at the grocery store uh genevieve looked over she was sitting in the car at aldi she looked over and said oh daddy get some flowers so pretty for mommy and so we got her some flowers and that was all her idea you know i thought well look at that there's a little treasure now those little flowers sit on the table and that little vase there that's a little treasure and where to start from genevieve's heart she saw the flowers thought of mommy spoke the word and then when he got home my wife was pretty happy about that that's just a simple example right just a real primitive example it started from the heart right and what you see goes down in your mind and it's got to start and then it creates a good treasure in the heart well our family should be complimenting one another in the home we should be building people up in the home not tearing down right now we can go to somebody tear somebody down we can get a treasure out of that by having them repent that's a treasure right and sometimes that rod or that wooden spoon that'll bring some treasure praise god right that'll bring treasure the treasure of repentance amen or i'll say this treasure of the fear of god i just found this scripture yesterday you pulled up isaiah 33 i thought you liked this one proverbs 33 6. i think you're gonna like this one i'm sorry isaiah 33 6. i'm sorry isaiah 33 6. sorry just kind of in a fast uh nervous mode i kind of want to get done i don't think i'm going to get done here well i might we'll see isaiah 33 6. look at this beautiful scripture i've never seen this one well i mean i read it numerous times i've never seen it like this and wisdom and knowledge what's proverbs about wisdom shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure now keep that up there see this coveted stuff is such they're so they're so unstable right one day they say this next day they do this there's so much instability but if we have the wisdom of god we're stable during this time in other words we can't be moved the devil can't shake us and make us doubt or fear we know exactly where we stand we're not worried about this kingdom we're worried about the kingdom of god amen right see you're you'll be stable in your generation in your times and have strength of salvation and like this what's your treasure the fear of the lord is your treasure amen how did this proverbs 31 woman get so much treasure in everything she did she feared the lord amen and if you fear god you'll fear his people right if you fear god you respect your brother you respect your sister you respect your mom you respect your dad you won't say anything evil you respect the pastor right you respect the ministers you respect your brother your sister if you fear god you'll love and respect you'll be careful how you act and the bible said that's a real treasure it's also the beginning of wisdom so wisdom must be a treasure as well what did this proverbs woman have she feared the lord and she loved her husband right she was good to her husband all the days of her life that's the bride she fears the lord and she's good to jesus amen he's real good to jesus amen because jesus lives inside of her soul praise god amen so see jesus wants us to treasure our relationships not really our financial gains right because the real treasure is a spiritual treasure the fear of the lord the respect that actually the word actually means terror right but we know that's different from the spirit of fear right there's a healthy fear we know right we we want that healthy fear right when the when the devil says go ahead and steal that go ahead and steal that but you've got to fear oh i don't want to get caught and i i wouldn't want to displease god that's a healthy fear right i don't want to go to jail that's a healthy fear you want that i know god would very be very displeased if this happened that's that's what you want you want to fear god that way but that's not the spirit of fear right the spirit of fear actually it causes you to accuse god because remember that remember the the men with the three talents the three sets of talents that one guy who had the one the bible said he buried his talent and then he feared god so he said well you know god's not fair he reaps where he doesn't sow and he's not just and he feared god that's why he hid it so see we don't have that spirit of fear we don't hide ourselves from the father we run to the father amen we don't we don't we don't take our problems somewhere else you know to a a witch doctor or something like that or or a woman who can read our poems we raise our palms to god amen we sacrifice and give worship and praise and we run to our heavenly father and of course we fear him with godly fear we know he can take our lives like this right and every now and then we get a reminder someone close to us will die and we get a reminder ah better fear lord i better i i better make sure i live my life to the fullest right every time we've had a funeral you know or someone someone we know passes away or just accidents like we had a few years ago i remember we prayed for that family you just it just shakes you up a little bit and it brings that fear of the lord like god has my number right he's going to pull it one of these days and i better be ready to meet the lord that's a healthy fear we want that fear that's a i say like that that's a loving fear that's a there's a loving fear now let me move on here now a holy ghost-filled bride member will manifest her love for christ through everyday actions blessing those in her home church and community now to me church of all the people i've seen fall away from the message to me the real holy ghost-filled saints are the ones who can live it in their homes right because that's always where they compromise whether it's a tv wearing pants uh adultery on their phones you know prostitution i mean that's it always starts there in their house but look at the proverbs 31 woman she's faithful all the time bless those moms they're up all night and they're the first ones to get the crying sick child you know that's what the bible says she's she's up all she's got her candle ready to go help out one of the kids while dad gets to sleep and you know lazy dad sometimes god have mercy on us but look at this she's she's ready at all times her love for god is proven through how she treats those in her family it starts there and this proverbs 31 shows shows her through all the seasons of her life right the newlywed the mother to the empty nest no doubt grandmother too i forgot that one i should have wrote that in the book but that's okay because remember the bible said to everything there's a season a time to every purpose under heaven amen her highest priority is her home life that should be our highest priority right our natural homes and then our home church our spiritual home i believe that her daily interactions prove she's a chaste virgin to christ because it also shapes the spiritual condition of the next generation see it's so important she loves her husband and she takes care of her their children who are going to be the next generation of believers right so here here's what she does in her house she's totally trustworthy with her husband and the family resources she won't lie she's trustworthy she takes initiative to work with her hands you have to you have to beg her to work right she's ready to do something with her hands and try to figure it out work it out with her hands she's ready to serve her family at all hours that's verse 15. yeah she rises also while it is at night and giveth meat to her household in a portion to her maidens she's ready at all hours to help everybody in the house she's shrewd in business so she's not wasteful she don't make silly transactions or investments she makes the right investments for the long-term care of her of her family she's healthy physically fit and she dresses in her best clothes that's versus 17 and 22. see that's why our sisters you know we can't let ourselves go right our brothers we can't let ourselves go that's how i was telling brother brooks i told him brother you're taking such good care of yourself he's all slim and trim he's 65 years old i said brother you are an example because i've noticed people that don't care of themselves they don't care for their spiritual lives either right because this is a temple if you're not taking care of this temple how are you going to take care of this temple you're not like eli eli and his sons they didn't take care of their own temples so they didn't take care of the temple of god they let the fire of god go out and let the light of god go out we got to let our light shine amen we got to care about our life we got to care about our bodies we got to care about our temples we got to take care of it it's a reflection of our attitude toward god's house right doesn't remember jesus said in the days of noah they were drunken right uh what's the other word drunkenness and there's other ones uh i can't think of it right now surf surfing yeah surfing sir fighting which is kind of like uh eating too much i think so jesus said that's how it's gonna be like the days of noah the day's a lot that's a it's a perfect example they're more concerned about the natural food than the spiritual food oh my that's why church we gotta fast we gotta get in the spiritual feast right we've gotta have a spiritual feast with the lord well we have too many natural feasts right especially in america we got to have spiritual feasts we have to know what jesus said that we might we have to know that feeling i want to live by every word i want to be the bread every word is like the bread that's my daily bread is the word of god amen hallelujah this is the kind of woman that is more virtuous than all the others she's ready to respond to help the poor that's verse 20. she's a shrewd planner now boy that i really feel there this woman really plans things out and she's alert not much of a planner verse 25 she said she's anointed with god's strength hey man let me read that strength and honor are her clothing glory she shall rejoice in time to come look she's always putting off celebrations for the future for herself now for herself oh you don't need to do that for my birthday honey no i'm not saying you have to do that it's nice to feel appreciated but you know the bible said she just shall celebrate and things to come right celebrating things that come but now remember church there is a there is a rejoicing to do at special events remember when the prodigal came home if the father was crying what do you think the mother was doing right if dad was out there if dad was the first one out there and run to meet uh the prodigal and weeping and crying what do you think mama was doing mama birthed him mama fed him right mama mama held him there right there nursed him all that what do you think mom did mom was probably weeping and crying she's probably the second one well she's probably busy taking care of all the other kids she probably was busy right just like the 31 woman busy with her hands shrewd planning you know but i imagine she felt the same what was she close with not only her best clothes natural but her spiritual clothes strength so that means she could have been she could have been learning from joshua too because joshua said only be strong and courageous see our sisters see you can be strong like joshua just because you're not a brother that don't mean you can can't be strong you can be just as strong god's going to raise up sisters on that day too and they're going to condemn those that wouldn't they're going to raise up as judges right and the bible said the queen of the south shall condemn that generation because she traveled across the desert for the wisdom the wisdom there it is wisdom of solomon and a greater than solomon is here amen you know that you know that we're raising little judges these little female judges here spiritual judges that's right your lives will testify when others say well i couldn't do it i couldn't cross the desert i couldn't i couldn't dress holy it was too hot to dress holy guess who god's going to raise up this generation amen god's going to raise him up he said raise up lydia raise up haven raise up cares raise up nature raise up virtue gonna raise up and testify that the word of god was right you stand for god's word no matter what we stand for god's word and what's in her mouth kindness verse 31 26 she opened her mouth with wisdom see what we don't need is foolishness right if we're going to say something foolish may god help it just to be limited right let's limit our foolish talking let may god help us to open up our mouths with wisdom and in her her tongue is the law of kindness she's so kind we got some really kind girls here don't we that should be that's the law of it right that's the that's the rule always say something kind all right nothing good to say don't say anything at all this is one this woman is way way more pleasing to god than all the other ones see what kind of a life she lives her testimony just keeps raising higher people just think more and more this kind of woman i know our sisters are listening too because they got their they're writing their notes down and they've shown me their notes and their eyes are on me this is the kind of testimony that that you want to build you want to build this kind of memorial before the lord all these attributes see not only should every christian mother strive to be like this even christian husbands right they got to be part of the bride too right so then we have to have some of these similar attributes husbands should love their wives in a way uh that are sacrificial right husbands have to sacrifice some of their selfish desires for their wife and for their children they've got to do that to benefit their family right that's what the scripture says he ought to love his wife as himself let's close with this proverbs 31 verse 28 after many long days after many long years i think of my mom after decades after many dirty diapers after many loads of dirty laundry after all the complaining i didn't like this supper no i wish it would have been this mom can you do this mom can you do that at the end of all of this at the end of the long trial there come a time when proverbs 31 verse 28 is fulfilled her children arise up and call her blessed children if you haven't told your mom what a blessing she is don't wait for mother's day although it's coming up don't wait for mother's day do it tonight right do it tomorrow tell mom tell your mom she's such a blessing to you raise up and call her blessed because she is trust me i've held some of you a little bit i've changed some of your diapers right i've changed some of your diapers now if i only change a few how much has mom changed you've seen it with zion right we ought to bless our mothers right her children rise up call her bless her husband also and he praises her right every time i get a chance i'll praise my wife tell her what a blessing she is i was doing that yesterday remember that i don't know if you guys heard that she was out trimming the tree i i was holding zion i said hey zion look at that wonderful woman out there look at that godly woman out there she's such a sweet beautiful woman out there i don't know if you guys heard that i did it like three or four times look at that blessing out there this tree is going to be more fruitful because your mother is trimming the trees the apple tree gotta raise up and call her blessed you know my mom had her 70th birthday that's where we got chronovirus that that wasn't a great blessing but um while we were there everybody all of our children went around the room and told why she was such a blessing in the presence of what was it 23 uh grandkids right so 23 grandkids there her six children plus their all their spouses were there so that's 12 plus 23. what's 12 plus right 23 35 12 plus 20 yeah 35. so 35 people were there and my mom was in the middle i got a picture of it at home i wish i would have brought it i should have didn't think about it but she turned 70 that uh that day and all of her children went around telling all the blessings that mom was for them and we even sang a song we sing that song from ray boltz now we know he's a sinner now but he had a song about thank you for giving to the lord i am a life that was changed i changed the lyrics the lord the night before the lord gave me the lyrics and i changed the lyrics to fit her life it was beautiful cam and i sang it yeah it became a nice segment and i thought wow what a and later i look back i thought well that was just fulfilled we just fulfilled this scripture right here the children raise up car blessed her husband also now of course dad but my dad did admit he should have been a better a better husband he did when i was talking to him now church what is this all for this is all appoint us the natural mother we talked all so much about our wonderful mothers right our blessed mothers but all this points to the bride of jesus christ the bible says the angels in heaven is going to call jesus bride blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection that's the bride's resurrection right the angels and all all heaven is going to gather together and say there she is jesus's bride look how blessed look how holy she is and church by god's grace we'll be standing there amongst the the elected believers right i'll be one of them the bible called it a sea of white a sea of multitude of white imagine i was flying up over the clouds a few days ago i was above the clouds virtue there remember god told job he said he said hey can you count all those clouds tell me how many clouds there are it was just a sea of white it was like look like you could just jump in that sea and go swimming all the clouds that's kind of like the bride of jesus christ she's just going to be covering this multitude of the space in heaven just the robes of white all the way around how many want to be one of them by god's grace let's stand to our feet the bible says blessed and holy is the bride member who will stand there by jesus on that day what's going to be our mission our mission is going to be to serve him and
