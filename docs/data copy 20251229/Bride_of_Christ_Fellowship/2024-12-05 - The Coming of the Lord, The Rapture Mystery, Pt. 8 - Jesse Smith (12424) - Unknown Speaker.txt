Lord so God we ask for your favor and give uh give your your people and and the Saints Lord God uh protection as we travel Lord Jesus especially to work in back and so Lord we just ask Lord you bless this word Lord God as we're looking at the the sermon your Prophet preached on the Rapture Lord God and we just ask God you give us attentiveness Lord God and spiritual understanding Lord God and help us help me tonight Lord to speak your word to rightly divide the word of Truth Lord God any man can open the book but only one God man can interpret and that's the Lord Jesus Christ as we say there's no preacher but Jesus we believe that so Lord bless our preaching here Lord God to magnify your holy name and we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen hallelujah if you want to take your Bibles we'll go to John Chapter 14 verse one this is text probably for my last part I think it's part eight I might have wrote part seven here in the uh YouTube description if that's the case I'm sorry it's actually part eight um of uh the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery Lord willing we'll be finishing up on brother Ram's sermon from 1965 of course we're just hitting the highlights and if I'm not mistaken it was December 4th 1965 so 59 years later here we are still uh enjoying the benefits and blessings of that sermon from God's Prophet so uh John chapter 14 I believe brother R read verses 1 to 7 we're not going to read all the way down there we'll just read verses one and two so John 14 14 1 and 2 and hopefully everybody had a good rest there on Sunday with one service actually we'll just do one one through four here by God's grace um it's not much reading there um our family can read verses three and four I'll read one and two myself then we'll read three and four together uh by God's grace John chapter 14 verse one says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God you believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you so let's read three and four family here ready 1 2 3 and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word hallelujah so this might seem like a strange text for the Rapture but as we'll get to hopefully by the end I'll try to watch the time here let me set a timer um the very sermon right after brother R preached uh the Rapture uh was called he I'm sorry things that are to be and this was his text and he said this was a good sermon topic to follow up the Rapture and of course you you can see why uh because Jesus tells us not to let our hearts be troubled he's going to prepare a place for us U that where he is we can be also so that's the hope of the Rapture right Jesus is coming back for his people to take them to be with him that's where they want to be they don't want to be left behind in this world they don't want to be a part of the Beast system uh or any world system really they want to be part of the kingdom of Jesus Christ the kingdom of God so a great message there uh brother R preached to follow uh the Rapture sermon so I'll be um Lord willing uh finishing the series hopefully tonight we'll see and then uh this sermon in particular will be heavy on quotes so just do your best to take some deep breaths and uh focus in spiritually and you can pray in your heart and ask the Lord to help you to really uh focus in on the quotes that I'll be reading from God's Prophet uh brother William brandom so there's like basically four last topics brother R uh covers that I can find as far as my highlights from his sermon um the prophecy about Los Angeles sinking and then he again tells the preview of the Bride now I'd like to read through that tonight because I just told it from memory and I might have got a few details mixed up so I want to read it here tonight then brother Ram tells us uh and then he offers the the church or the the listeners there not the church but the the Christians there uh at the hotel to move up into Christ if they want to be ready for the Rapture and then he gives a final altar call uh there's no altar there's no space for altar call there at that hotel so he said you got to go to the altar of your heart so those are the last four um topics and then um there are six quotes uh in the remaining sermons of that brother Brandon preached the remainder of his life uh those last we'd say three weeks of his life there's six quotes where he mentions the word rapture he never mentions shout voice Trump after this sermon at least on tape um about the Rapture so if we have time Lord willing we'll look at those briefly by God's grace okay so I want to start with this um brother R repeats this prophecy he says I I remember just my last message in California where I thought I'd never go back again when I predicted Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean thus saith the Lord it will she is done she's washed she's finished what hour I don't know when but it will be sunk right after that the earthquakes begin to jolt and bow he says so critics have uh you know criticized brother brandom that this hasn't come to pass yet but brother BR never put a timestamp on it um and so you know they're wrong to do that of course uh we know there's even Old Testament prophecies that still haven't come to pass like Isaiah's prophecy about the Rapture almost 3,000 years ago still waiting to come to pass so unless God puts a a Tim stamp on it then it's whenever God is going to do it that means God wants to do it at a time an unknown uh day and hour that no one 's aware of um and remember there's five earthquakes recorded in the Book of Revelation the first one is 612 under the Sixth Seal and this might be the earthquake of Los Angeles um Revelation 85 this is a higher possibility I think uh because it's after uh the reality form of the seventh seal happening the reality form of the seventh seal of course is the unknown day and hour of the Rapture of the Gentile bride the Holy Ghost filled bride um and there's earthquake right after that Rapture so that could be it um there's another Rapture a third Rapture in Revelation 1113 and in my opinion no this is not the LA earthquake this is the Jerusalem earthquake in the midst of Daniel's 70th and final week uh this this seems to be only taking place in Jerusalem I believe if I'm not mistaken a tenth part of the city fell I could be wrong on that actual fraction but it's some fraction like that a tenth of the city or something Falls there in Jerusalem the the fourth is in Revelation 11:19 this is a higher possibility this is in hail and earthquake after the seventh trumpet is sounded so that's a higher possibility there again just like the earthquake right after the seventh seal is opened in reality form now to me the most likely one is revelation 1618 uh because this is called the worst earthquake that ever was that hard it'd be hard for our human Minds if we've never seen uh maybe uh really devastating earthquakes if we' never seen it with our own eye it'd be hard for us to imagine a worse earthquake that would cause uh you know parts of the West Coast to fall into the ocean so that's why you know it seems like this would be the uh the LA earthquake it's during the seventh and final vial which are the final judgments poured out there in the Great Tribulation period before the battle of Armageddon so that's most likely but uh again brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord so we believe it'll come to pass we have a video with over six thus sayith the Lords that have I'm sorry six thus sayith the Lords that have come to pass a PR pastor friend of mine shared a a PDF document I think he has 10 thus sayith the Lord healings that came to pass I need to find that and I need to get to that I just sometimes forget uh to go get that but I like to make a video on that as well so it seems like there's at least 16 thus sayi the Lord's uh healing or prophecies that have come to pass and then remember there's six thus say the Lords about the New Testament mysteries of God six out of the 12 that have been fulfilled as well so uh we brother Ram has a perfect record with thus sayith the Lord now uh brother Ram says this he goes to the next paragraph he said the same voice that that said uh Los Angeles is going to sink he said is the same voice that said judgment will strike the West Coast in March of 1964 ban was out hunting he had another experience there was men uh there with him that were Witnesses brother R said thus sayi the Lord judgment will strike the West Coast he said two days after that in March of of 1964 on Good Friday Alaska almost sunk so you can easily type in Google duck ducko whatever you want type in 1964 Alaska earthquake it's the second uh most devastating earthquake ever recorded in Alaskan history so uh if you want to look into that uh brother Ram believ that was the Fulfillment of what the Lord told him judgment was going to strike the West Coast there now in the next paragraph yeah he said that the same Gody that said Los Angeles is doomed she's finished I don't know when I can't tell you and then brother random brings us up I want to bring this thought I want to read this brother said I look back in scripture after he prophesied about La sinking um or La being doomed and sinking he said Jesus said capernium capernium how of you that exalted yourself rather up into heaven shall be brought down into hell for if the mighty works that have been done in you had been done in Sodom it's stand today and about 150 years from there Sodom had already in the then capernium is in the water to today now a lot of critics of brother Ram criticize him for this brother ramam said capernium was in the water now anyone can go on YouTube or search and the ruins of capernium are still above water today so some people criticize brother brandham it's my humble opinion uh brother Bram just didn't realize capernium was in Ruins and not underwater it doesn't matter because brother Ram never said thus sayith the Lord capernium is in the water brother Ram just thought he's trying to remember the scripture from Matthew 11 so have your Bible you can get to Matthew 11 um Jesus said in Matthew 11:33 and thou capernium which art exalted unto Heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works which had been done in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained unto this day so Jesus says capernium will be brought down to Hell so it's likely Jesus meant just the civilization would be destroyed which it is it's in Ruins today that the biblical uh portion of it is in Ruins today it likely means he means the leaders and all the unbelief all the unbelieving Sinners will be brought down will be lost that's that's basically what it it looks like it means there from the Lord Jesus Jesus never said it it would go under the water God bless you um Jesus never said anything on that he said brought down to Hell so um you know many people misunderstand this okay so that's why we want to read it from the scripture but I say to you in verse 24 that it should be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of Jud Jud M than for thee so capernium must have saw many mighty miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ so again we you can see capernium is not underwater today at least that section uh of the biblical ruins there they're still available you can see it and visit it um so it seems like brother Ram just was confused or in his memory he had misunderstood something um but it doesn't matter because that part wasn't thus sayith the Lord the thus sayith the Lord part was about the earthquake in LA um so it's plain to see that now he goes on to say that same spirit of God that said all these things and done all these things it said oh City Capernaum who called yourself by the name of Los of angels Los Angeles you've how you've exalted yourself into heaven and the Very root and seat of Satan you've exalted yourself preachers it's a graveyard for them and that's true La has a lot ofh Prosperity preachers which is it's a spiritual graveyard good men go there and die like rats what Havoc you that call by the name of angels if the mighty Works have been done in Sodom that's been done in you it stood today but your hour has come brother says you watch and see if it ain't I'm a false prophet that's a very powerful statement to make see there she is she's laying there so he's talking about the City of Angels he's not talking about capernium he's talking about the City of Angels so we still stand behind that prophecy just as these other prophecies brother said the United States Church would be dancing to rock and roll thus sayith the Lord in 1965 um and here we saw it started happening around the year 2000 where mega churches now have rock and roll Services essentially U and they cut uh they cut out all the uh standards all the Holiness standards you can smoke drink women can cut their hair wear sexy clothes all these prophecies brother gave us according to the vision have come to pass we've seen that come to pass and all the healings that he prophesied there on that video have come to pass as well so in other words brother mam is very trustworthy as a prophet of God a genuine true prophet of God now let's look at the preview of the Bride here now this is I tried my best to remember the story here from I'd listen to this I've gone to this sermon numerous times of course preaching this uh eight part series on this sermon brother Ram said I remember that night I seen the preview of the Bride I stood there I seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision they said the preview of the Bride I seen her go by they come on this side and went around so it's a group of beautifully dressed women holy holy dressed women he said then I heard it coming up churches from the other side there come the Asian Church you talk about filth here come the European Church oh my and then I heard a rock and roll coming it was Miss America the church and she didn't have on any clothes she had papers like newspapers gray holding in front of her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church and I stood there in his presence and I thought oh God as a minister if that's the best we could do oh you know how you feel I I thought oh God hide me if I could just get away from here if all that we've done and that's what we have to produce if that's what and then when then women passed by all doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair painted faces Now isn't that what the churches are today it's totally fulfilled and as they passed by like that supposed to be virgins to Christ and when she passed by like that I turn my head you know with this holding in front of me it was disgraceful the back of them and there they was going like that I turned my head to weeping like that and I said I couldn't stand it here here I am a minister of the church and that's what I produced for him I said oh God I can't look let me die let me fade away so being in the presence of that filth brother Ram said let me die let me uh let me fade away but as soon as it went out he said they drop off I just heard the sound as it went away then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that saintly bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was at the beginning all correctly dressed their H their hair hanging way down the back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word right and we're not all the word right only Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodly uh fullness of the word he was the word made flesh but we have a portion of the word because we have a portion of the Holy Ghost and God is the word his spirit is the word so she was the word they look like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed by they seem to pass by instead of going down they started going up Rapture I noticed one of one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line I screamed stay in line the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line like that so there's a more detailed telling when I tried to tell it a few weeks ago so hope that was a blessing by the God's grace so we can see right before the Rapture there could be some people trying to get out of line bride members even and the and brother R's voice will be shouting stay in line so that's what I believe the fivefold ministry is preaching today stay in line stay with the word um stay obedient to the commands of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ from the Bible now uh brother Ram says next thought here so now we're getting into uh his closing here it's just got a few more thoughts about moving up into Christ brother says I wonder could it already be passed could the bride already be called is that what we're going through today so again brother Ram you know numerous times he's trying to get the people to see the lateness of the hour of course with their life as now we see 59 years later with their life no one's guaranteed tomorrow so that's what brother RAM does as a preacher many preachers still do it today it doesn't matter what Church you go to just trying to get the people to grasp uh the lateness of the hour no man knows the day or the hour of of the coming of the Lord so in other words be ready and we saw brother do this in uh Souls uh that are in prisoned now you know they're praying at the end oh God uh let my children get in uh if if time if there's no more time he's quoting you know Revelation 10 I believe that means uh there's no more delay time would be no more right I believe there was no more delay till God would fulfill Revelation 10 1-7 that's what I believe uh about that particular scripture time would be no more and then the book would be brought down and then it be eaten by John and taken all around the world I believe that seems to be like the most spiritual um explanation of that scripture not that time ended because of course we're still keeping time right people are still getting saved the shout brother's message is still going around the world so it seems to be the most spiritual uh understanding of that scripture brother Ram said she has to be molded and made in the image of Christ Christ is the word there cannot be one thing added he talks about uh a woman can't have a hand like a man and then the other hand like a paw of a dog it's got to be exactly the word of God he is the word the bride is part of the bridegroom the woman is part of the husband because she's taken out of the husband Eve was a part of Adam from his side so is the bride not taken from denomination thank God for that uh but taken from the bosom of the word of God God for this day what a beautiful uh statement that is taken from the bosom of the word so the heart of Christ right the bride's taken from the heart of Christ and the bride should be a bride after the heart of Christ so he's uh brother Ram's now speaking he says he's singing When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there talking about the Rapture he said it's been spoken it should come to pass it will come to pass he said people no one wants to die no one wants to be lost let me tell you whatever you do I don't care how well you go to church how loyal you are to church that's fine nothing against that and I thank God for loyal church members by God's grace you should do that you should go to church you do that keep on going to church but whatever just throw away your traditions and move right up into Christ because it's going to sound one of these days and you're going to be caught with the mark of the beast on you and not know what it is until it's too late that's exactly right so of course people that would be caught with a mark of the beast they'd already been deceived right anyone caught with the mark of the beast would have never been predestinated to be saved they would have been the ones that blasphemed the Holy Ghost so brother R makes it plain to the people there they could be sitting amongst uh bride members there but then take the mark of the beast that fits judas's scariot right he was right there amongst 11 elect plus the Lord Jesus Christ himself and yet we would say he take the mark of the beast in other words he blasphemed the Holy Ghost and was lost maybe seemingly not even aware what he he was doing but of course he had been aware of selling out the Savior so brother Ram you know he just always brings it so seriously down to the individual no matter how secure some people think they are it's it's not about being just around the bride or around True Believers you got to be a True Believer yourself you got to have the Holy Ghost baptism yourself so brother Ram brings it down I love it to the uh the sacredness of the gospel and the individual having to answer to the Lord Jesus what did the individual do with the talent that the Lord Jesus Christ gave him so again he said throw away your traditions and move right up into Christ and recently with the Corinthian uh series we've been preaching on Traditions that they had right sexual immorality suing people getting drunk at the Lord's table of course people thinking they're uh better than others so prideful Spirits um you know people uh worshiping preachers people criticizing preachers uh divisions envying all these Spirits all all these are just traditions of men that need to be uh cast down they need to be repented of and brother manam said get rid of all those traditions and move up into Christ of course Christ is the Holy Ghost Christ is the life of God it's a Spirit-filled and spirit-led life then brother Ram says God bless you um I've kept them too long here he says the offering that you took for me uh take it to pay the hotel on the overtime that he kept it he said I got about eight or 10 more pages on the Rapture there but I just didn't have time to get it God bless you and I if voice of God has has that I plead with you again let me see those other eight or nine 10 pages I think I showed you five pages five pages they've released we'd love to see those other Pages brother B says then do you love the Lord Jesus let's stand now reverently and they start singing uh is nations are breaking the day of redemption is near then brother sings I love him because he first loved me and he says you want to make the Rapture how many here is interested in making the Rapture say God I want to make it with all my heart and they sing hold to God's unchanging hand okay now he gives the altar call so here we are at the altar call this last part before the the final prayer he said with heads bowed uh bowing our heads to the dust from which we were brought he says knowing that you got a soul in there that has to answer to God if you feel that you're not just ready for the Rapture if it would come tonight and you'd want to be remembered in prayer just raise your hand we have no place to make an altar call your altar is in your heart anyhow raise your hand God bless you my feel that I'm not ready brother brandham I really I want to be a Christian I've tried to be but there's always something missing I know that I'm not just where I should be so even individuals tonight let's think about our lives towards the end of this sermon I'm already uh I'm only 20 minutes in now by God's grace but by the end of it you want to be thinking about is anything missing in my life for the Christian Life examine your life be ready tonight at the end of this sermon be ready when you go to sleep be ready for the coming of the Lord have all sins uh confessed all sins over come go to bed thinking about the Lord thinking about the word of God um any thoughts that have stirred you uh recently in the word of God do that he says have he said oh God have mercy I raise my hand be merciful to me 20 year30 hands up in this hotel already in this little group more is going up so this is how think how a prophet would end the last within the last month before he passed away how would he end a sermon on the Rapture when he's in a in a assembly they're are gathering in a hotel with only Christians uh he offers a prayer for them just to look at their life and say is anything missing do I feel like I'm not ready to go in the Rapture would anything hinder me from going and he asked them to raise their hand and brother bam offers this prayer I'll read the prayer it's a short prayer dear God you know what's behind that hand down there under the heart I pray dear God there's only one thing I'm responsible for that's to tell the truth and dear God they want to be saved they want to really they don't want this something that's just some emotion some work up some denominational system some Creed some some Dogma that's been added they understand father that takes the pure unadulterated word of God everything else will pass away even heavens and earth but it won't and if we be that word the Earth will pass away from beneath us but we can never pass away because we are that word the Bride of the groom I pray for each one that you'll Grant to them Father is my sincere prayer then brother Braham said father excuse me this kind of goes with the quotes I ended with last Wednesday night where brother ranom prayed God forgive us of our mistakes and may the Holy Ghost give understanding to the people uh in the in the areas where where I made mistakes in my sermon so I put a video about that about that uh I put a video out about that this week hopefully that was a blessing to see how a genuine Prophet would pray he'd pray Lord if I made any mistake let the Holy Spirit correct the people and how the how's the Holy Spirit going to correct the people pointing them back to the word of God and he says somehow or another a great Holy Spirit splice them together now splice means to join or connect by interweaving together so brother R said excuse me Father for being so nervous here saying words broke up and cut up splice them together Holy Spirit in your own Divine Way deliver them to the hearts of the people from my heart and the motive and objective that was in my heart I have towards you won't you and Save which can be saved draw to you Lord and may we be ready for that rapturing hour that's soon at hand for I ask it in Jesus name amen then he dismisses now the chairman of the convention and that's the end of that wonderful sermon uh from 1965 so again looking at some of the highlights there brother looked at remember scoffers Revelation election types of the Rapture shout voice Trump um and then he closed with these uh ideas here about uh the Los Angeles prophecy the preview of the Bride moving up into Christ and an altar call uh for people that didn't feel ready to get ready uh by the grace of God okay so yeah looks like I have time to go over those six quotes here so there's six quotes where brother says Rapture after this Rapture sermon from 1965 and again he never said anything about the shout Voice or Trump that I can find uh during these last few sermons okay so the next the the very next day brother Ram was in California so he traveled from Arizona Yuma to California I don't know how to say that Rialto I'm not sure how to say that California brother R said last night I spoke on the subject of the Rapture that might seem uh to be a strange subject to speak on at a banquet but most everyone there was Christians he said now tonight I want to speak on things that are to be speaking last night on The Rapture so tonight I want to speak on this subject that it might tie together with last night's message now there's going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future Jesus here in John 14 talked about he's gone ahead to prepare a place for us let not your hearts be troubled he said you believe in God believe also in me okay so brother man preach a sermon things that are to be I'm not going to go through um even the highlights of this but I just want you to see that he was trying to tie this thought in in John chapter 14 with the Rapture Jesus is going to prepare a place for us that he's going to come back can get us with the Rapture right the meeting in the air and then take us to these Mansions or we'd say uh first the marriage supper of the Lamb the meeting in the air marriage supper of the Lamb of course then we have the Millennium uh and then Millennium will build houses here and then the future home was would I believe would be where these Mansions would be the future home there at after the great white Throne judgment now brother man mentions the Rapture a second time in this sermon things that are to be uh he again ties in um or he talks about how the Rapture is pre-planned by God um he says that great church that he established on the day of Pentecost he sent the Holy Ghost they had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt into the earth into the Dark Age to bring again in the age of Luther and come out the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for the last day day so brother talking about the first four Church ages that were kind of dying out right uh and all the martyrdom but then in the fifth sixth and seventh age God was restoring ing through Luther Wesley and God's Prophet Elijah brother brandham therefore the bride and the Rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned so brother man preaches us things that are to be in other words God's already got it all planned out after the Rapture God's got everything planned out even throughout the church age everything has been planned out in other words so the people don't have to worry the people don't have to be afraid like said don't let your heart fear so we can take that as encouragement tonight Saints here in akan and of course around the world don't fear when we see things uh shake up I even saw today it seemed like the French government was having issues you know and um they ousted their leader macron or whatever his name was just things look like they're shaking up all the time when we feel that coming on us we got to just breathe the Holy Name of Jesus in prayer and ask God to help us not to fear help us to trust God in the midst of storms trials as we said on Sunday the uncertainty remember we're not founded on the shifting Sands of Life uh we're founded on the The Rock the revelation of Jesus Christ that's doing his commands keeping his commands so B said God made it that way he's gone to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared this hour is prepared God knew the the snow would come God knew uh we could get up to two inches of of snow there there tonight in akan so we want to stay off the roads his great for knowledge tells him all these things by for knowledge okay so we see there's two mentions of the Rapture now we go to the very next night uh he's in San Bernardino I think I'm saying that right California he mentions the Rapture again and brother mam gives this familiar illustration we've been uh dealing with it repeatedly about the wheat plant uh right Luther Wesley uh we can even add Azu in there and then Elijah uh is in the seed the wheat plant eventually produces a mature seed so brother Ram goes through this uh he says uh it must produce exactly like it did in the days of Pentecost he said but you get to a place each one gets starchy gets off they can't receive new revelation they're settled down there they are there they die and the life goes right through that and goes on to make the wheat and when the wheat comes that life that's traveled through that wheat the resurrection brings the whole thing out yes brings up for the Rapture so brother says like the life of God is coming up into the seed and the life of God is bringing the church up into higher truth we can plainly see that with Martin Luther maybe I need to preach a sermon on just him and all the all the humanity that was still in his uh Ministry although a mighty man of God although probably the most famous Christian perhaps in the last 2,000 years since the apostles um one of the most impactful Christians to ever live but yet uh he was blinded to some of the things uh that had not been restored such as the godhead um infant baptisms uh you know living a holy life of course smoking drinking alcohol things like that sanctification issues he wasn't uh didn't didn't have the revelation of that but God still was bringing life through that right he brought the church out of the Dark Ages he brought the church out of the Roman Catholic Church into a greater light uh but we know life is keeping uh life is continuing to increase and now we can see we should have uh the full life of the Apostles as far as obeying the commands of God the the Revelation the power the love of the Apostles all those things our hearts are turned back to the apostolic fathers brother BR says then gets into his ministry this ministry started first with Divine Healing performing Miracles and if God let it go through an ordinary church just like we already had then it wasn't God again a very beautiful scriptural point if brother Ram's Ministry pointed people to denomination or back to domination it wouldn't fit the pattern John the Baptist called the people out of uh the Pharisee religion the sadducee religion he actually called them even physically out to the Wilderness to be baptized and he called those other denominations brood of vipers right uh so any true Ministry of God will call the people out of uh the popular denominational ministries of that day same thing with Jesus you after John went off the scene Jesus called them um of their father the devil those Pharisees Sadducees he gave him all the woses in Matthew 23 U same thing with Martin Luther John Wesley isusa Street they all came out of those denominations so same thing with brother randam another proof brother Rand was a genuine prophet of God he didn't point the people back to the dead denominational systems he pointed them uh uh to an independent uh spiritual brother man calls it organism a living organism of the Life of Christ Hallelujah okay um now we're still in the sermon modern events brother R mentioned this uh now here we get into a good quote on the bride age now some people have heard this quote bride age and they made it this strange Doctrine they made it something totally different um than what brother Ram intends it to do so let's listen here as brother R reads it we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age so think of Aza we're not in the zza Revival anymore we can plainly see it so we're not living in the Methodist age we're not living in another age I'm sorry we're living in another age we're living up here to the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it ready for the Rapture so even ausri it wasn't calling people out to a Rapture it was restoring the gifts now they had some remember we preached on that last year they had some false ideas like oh we shouldn't have we shouldn't get married we shouldn't have children because the Rapture is so close right so they had that that those false understandings there brother Ram said they didn't have the former Reign yet they didn't have the teaching Reign yet on noomen preachers and so many other topics uh the Malachi 4 Ministry uh predestination there were so many even even the correct operation of gifts we see at the end of William Seymour's life he finally understood the evidence is not tongues it's a Christian Life Like We Believe the full Christian Life uh that the Holy Ghost should produce in a believer's life so brother Ram says uh we are up here in the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it ready for the Rapture that's the age that we're living in now to my honest opinion that's the exact truth now brother man doesn't cite any scriptures right so all these people that have their false ideas about the bright age they're venturing without Authority they're presuming they don't have any scriptures brother just saying uh that the he even said it the Revival of aus stre is over right they when did they turn it down everybody knows 1956 right 50 years from 1906 they turn it down so brother R's making a point here now we're in the calling out of the Bride we're not calling people just to gifts we're not calling people to just emotion or uh even even dedication we're calling people to The Full Experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we rejoice in all the gifts we rejoice in all the the doctrine we rejoice in the the the full restoration of the book of Acts Church Hallelujah now we know there's still more power to come we believe that brother Ram said it's rapturing faith is that final anointing there during the time of the squeeze that will be poured out upon the Bride of Jesus Christ we believe that we can see we need more power uh but we've we're thankful for the power we have seen and for the love of God and uh the doctrine that we have we're thankful for all these things that we have from the early church but we know there's more to come because it's prophesied in Joel 2 uh 23-26 so again we take away all the mysticism from some people about or uh the misunderstanding of the Bride age to me it just seems like it's this time since 56 1956 on where okay they uh zus Street had their chance to repent they didn't they turn it down right even America they turned it down they took the rock and roll of Elvis from 1956 and we can see where they're at today but since then God's been calling out a bride through the ministry of the seventh Church age messenger the seventh angel the Elijah the fourth Elijah anointing God's been calling out and making a bride ready and as I said last week even in uh Junction City Ohio God is still calling out a bride Hallelujah 17 baptized last year more baptized course in uh other churches like Lime Ohio and different places around the area they've been baptized the shout is still going out people are still hearing the shout get ready the bridegroom comes right they're still getting ready for the Rapture so the shout I believe is still going uh around the world we can see it plainly so I believe the bride age is this this baptism of the Holy Ghost experience since uh the Asuza Pentecost movement this uh Revival turn down uh God's Prophet uh brother brand a 50-year Revival they turn it down so God is now calling out the bride with the former Reign and looking for the latter rain once once the Full Gospel has been preached to Every Nation as Jesus said in Matthew 24 the gospel must be preached to Every Nation then the end will come not every nation has fully heard the message of the hour so it's our duty to do that God can use this video um God can use whatever he wants to get the gospel to be heard by every nation that way um there's no excuses you know when the tribulation happens there's no excuses there's there's no one that wanted to be in the Rapture that that's not included in the Rapture all those who want to be the Rapture will be included Hallelujah now it goes on to say and this is a book of Prophecy its Believers are commanded are to honor and read it and believe it's author for every word that's written in there must come to pass so it behooves us to continue to read the Bible as I told you I've been reading through uh Ezekiel and enjoying it uh very much so uh everything that's been promised has to come to pass because it is Jesus Christ in each age the same yesterday it was Jesus Christ was in Noah it was Jesus Christ in Moses in other words the Holy Ghost right the logos it was Jesus Christ in David Hallelujah it was Jesus Christ and Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's Jesus Christ among his people today doing the things that he promised he would do in this age it's Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said but the church has become so starchy so far away like the brother here said the church has become the same way till they've got to have something to shake us back to the word now if if you're in the in the message baptized with the Holy Ghost you have been shaken back to the word but I think all of us can say in our sometimes in our minds we get we get tired so we need a shaking of our human Spirits right that's where it can apply to us God Shake us up we saw that happen when the brothers came in from Pennsylvania really shook us up right people down at the altar for an hour and a half two hours maybe longer that's good we need shakings of our human Spirit that's called the renewal of our minds that's called a transformed Spirit that's that's called A Renewed Spirit as Paul said be renewed day by day but there's times we get a special renewing we need that he said how is how how is it going to do it it's got to come according to God's Own plan it cannot it cannot come by laymen it will not come by businessmen it cannot come by Churches God has laid down his plan so God has laid down his plan to shake the bride to get them ready so if your life's being shaken praise God may it shake uh even says that in Hebrews chapter 12 God's going to shake all things so we have to expect God's going to shake Us in other words to let go of anything that we feel like is important and uh just get ready for the coming of the Lord if it's in our day by the grace of God all right now this this this shows to me the uh the insincerity of preachers that would say there's nothing left to be fulfilled brother Ram says this whole book has to be fulfilled right Isaiah 25:8 has not been fulfilled there's things that need to be fulfilled earthquakes and I'm back to Matthew 24 earthquakes pestilence says Wars rumors of wars so every war that's going on now is a fulfillment of the prophecy that Jesus gave so it's insincere for people to say there's nothing left to be fulfilled we see the Jews coming back Nations haven't heard the message um and the end can't come until these scriptures are fulfilled okay now uh in this sermon I got a couple more quotes here then we're almost done brother man breaks into this thought of with uh animal or human reproduction uh he he breaks into the thought of one in a mill ion so brother Ram talks about when uh male and female reproduce there's millions of germs but there's only one egg um and brother Bram applies that um to the Rapture he says one out of a million this is in modern events made near made clear by prophecy he also used this in the Rapture sermon again uh from a few days before this was preached this was January 6 so in January 4th I'm sorry December 6th so December 4th brother Brandon preached that as well he says what if it be that way tonight so it's not thus sayith the lord it's just a a thought interesting thought that seems to fit there's 500 million supposed to be I think Christians in the world about that figure just a round figure if the Rapture would come tonight in the living going there' only be 500 people well there's that many missing any day almost that can't be counted for the bride will be taken away and we'd wonder what it's all about and the people going right on preaching saying they're getting this or that or the other and look what a deception that would be say if it would be that I don't say it is notice brother saying brother man saying I'm not saying this is I don't know I'm No Authority on that God's a judge of that but look how easy it could happen in all figures and things how it could be proven okay so we get this this illustration of hero of a very small one ordained a life out of millions and brother B's drawing that that's how the Rapture is going to be remember two in a bed one taken two out in the field one taken uh two grounding at the Mill one left one taken and then of course we know 1 Thessalonians 5 uh the day comes as a thief in the night right the Rapture comes as a thief in the night the world won't be looking for it the foolish Virgin uh necessarily won't be looking for it it'll be the the Bride of Jesus Christ looking for it now currently what's interesting the Wikipedia says Uh there's only two to four million message Believers so if we apply it to that only two or four would go in the Rapture one out of a million but brother Adam uh he used that he used all of Catholicism to get his number of 500 million and all of his um Protestants so Catholicism plus plus Protestants he called it Christendom which is the whole group of people that are claiming to be Christians he said 500 million now I looked it up today now apparently this is from 2019 there's 2.5 billion uh professors of Christianity from 2019 so one out of a million would be 2,500 um so if we use that same number brother Ram's you know saying one out of a million and we know there's 8 billion people in the world today so you know 2,500 out of 8 billion would be a very very small number so uh we know uh the Holy Ghost filled uh bride will be in the Rapture she'll be a small group uh Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road that even leads to salvation but even a fewer uh fewer amount of people will go in the rapture we know that and also we get the type there of uh interesting we with the type of the the the foolish vergins right uh five wise five foolish so we get a we get a 50% right uh but of course that's not a specific number but you get a point not everyone who claims to uh hear the bridegroom coming hear the Rapture call not everyone uh is going to be ready for it only a certain group who have extra oil are going to be ready for it so we get that lesson we want to take that lesson we want to make sure our lives have the oil of the Holy Spirit and of course that's power it's a change life um It's Supernatural signs wonders and miracles we're thankful for the testimonies we've had these last few months of God healing people and even uh hearing our humble prayers you know with certain situations in the church God being very gracious and merciful to us and even that Wednesday night where we spoke uh we spoke to the evil spirit you we we rebuke Satan and ask uh God to restore something there in the church and God heard us the very next day so again we're just thankful for the grace of God that God would allow us to speak his word and uh and God would honor it of course it all lines up with God's perfect will not our will we don't speak things by our own will only by the will of God but again we also have to know that the bride will have the right Doctrine 2 John 1 ver9 whosoever transgress this and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son so surely the bride will have the right Doctrine she'll have power of the spoken word she'll have the uh the character she have the love of God as well that's an important part of this uh character of the Bride of Jesus Christ okay one more quote here I'm sorry I'll do two more quotes and then we'll be finish up here uh the last time brother man mentions the raptures in leadership this is the last full sermon before uh he passed away he has one recording after that but it's just like his uh instructions on communion a shorter I think it's 35 or 40 minutes if I'm not mistaken so leadership is actually the last full sermon and so let's just hear what's the last thing brother Brown said about the Rapture when he used the word rapture he's closing the sermon he says while we have our heads bowed I want to ask you a question do you really look at yourself to God and do you feel that you're not where you ought to be at this hour cause because the Rapture could happen at any time see It'll come he said I made the statement a while ago there only be about 500 people in the Rapture that's living they'll be changed why taking all chrisom together Catholic and all there's only 500 million people see claims Christianity and one out of a million would be 500 people there's not there's that many people missing every day across the world they can't even account for them so see It'll come you won't even know it people go on preaching See it'll all be passed then he uses the scripture where the disciples said isn't Elijah supposed to come and Jesus said he's already come and you didn't know it that's speaking of John the Baptist but of course he said Elijah shall come and restore All Things We believe that was the ministry of God's Prophet brother Brandon so he says if you know you're not right with God and you like to be remembered to God that God would set your heart right with him would you just humbly now in this very still moment raise your hands I don't care who you are would you do it you'll say I'll raise my hands to God God bless you God bless you he said I ask in Christ's name he says are you looking into the mirror of God's word so that's what the Book of James says uh God's word is a mirror so we look into the word of God we see what kind of lives we should live and we shouldn't forget that when we take our eyes off the Bible go about our day we should remember we're Holy Ghost filled Christians we should believe God's word we should uh call out cry out to God in prayer that God would Minister to the needs of the body of Christ around the world or whoever uh we're in contact with by the grace of God now the last quote I want to read um is brother Ram's word to the church I was praying this morning and this quick quote kind of came to my mind so I'm at I'm at 45 minutes here so that's good time there so brother R told this to the church it's at towards the beginning of his sermon Christ The Mystery of God revealed I don't know if you remember Saints but uh Jim schum read this to us uh two novembers ago in 2013 when he was here preaching you know I've heard him many times use this quote over the years such an encouragement but let's listen to this here as we finish up here love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make him his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it with anything else talking about criticism right we talked about how that was one of the spirits that battled the the Church of Corinth it's the one that I think battled our church the most so I preached on love recently with we can understand all the Mysteries but do we have charity so I thought this would be a good thing as I was praying this kind of came to me this morning so I just want to read it don't have nothing to do with it anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman whoever it is just pray for them and stick with one another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that you said the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all so that's what we have to do we have to continue to pray together stick stick together through hard times you know Satan's not going to let everything remain happy and joyful and and uh Victory all the time uh God has to allow us to be tested any church that's not being tested is not a true church so just something to keep in mind about the love of God don't never Clan among or talk or make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline the church how we behave oursel in the Church of God how we come together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder good reminder there if God's in our hearts we want to be with the Saints I know snow keeps us away from that on a night like this but hopefully it motivates us we should have good weather at least on the weekends we can gather together on Sunday we ought to be really motivated and really excited through the love of God to be together again uh next time we can gather I'll read that again if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray and so see so see prayer makes you love your brother and sisters forgive them pray for them want to spend time with it because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love love one for another that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have that root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life so that's again but Rams emphasizing in critical Spirits bitterness can't let any of that get in our lives it takes the Christ right out of our minds appear that poison acids he calls it of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here or bride of Christ Fellowship here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up take the Buckle as the brother testified and a minister here the other night about having the Buckle seeing in the vision just take the buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up and move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say things say nice things about one another and then God will bless you so church I just want to read that may God bless you we're going to call Malachi to the piano here let's have a word of Prayer so let's uh let's ask what brother random asked do we feel like we're ready for the Rapture do we feel like our heart is right with God is there anything in our life that we think uh might hinder our walk with god let's take a few moments here tonight and examine ourselves we're so thankful for this message on the Rapture what a beautiful message uh from God's Prophet uh brother Ram so so so much applies to our lives today even prophecy like I said he repeated that prophecy about Los Angeles in there so many things about uh the future the Rapture and even the scoffers the scoffing condition of this day oh how could there be a Rapture how could God ever change bodies in the moment twinkle of an eye because he's God he spoke this whole universe into existence if he created it he can redeem it he can call for it um nothing is too hard for our god so let's examine our hearts here as we pray let's bow our our our heads here and close our eyes and I'm going to do like brother brandom if you feel you're not ready and you want to be ready you feel like there's anything you need to make right there in the privacy of your home just lift your hand to God and say God I don't feel like I'm ready there's things in my life I need to get cleaned up just raise your hand there God will see those hands even if you're listening to this on the arcave God's spirit is outside of [Music] time God's got this Rapture all pre-planned everything is pre-planned you listening to the sermon all the way to the end church members or anyone still listening to the end it's all pre-planned by God you want your life to be ready so God sees your hand ra said we don't even have an altar there at the hotel anyways your heart is your altar friends let's keep looking for the rapture we don't know the day of the hour let's always be ready let's remember though we're standing on the Rock of Ages we're standing on the Lord Jesus Christ there's going to come rains there's going to come winds floods when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will set up a standard against it because we're on the Rock The Rock of Revelation the enemy will beat against our houses our lives but we will not fall we'll stand on God's word reminded me of Ephesians 6 having done all to stand Saints let's make sure we got on the full armor of God the belt of Truth is the ready mind the breastplate of righteousness is Christ's righteousness protecting your heart the helmet of salvation I know I'm saved the feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel I'm ready to take the gospel ready to do what you want me to do I got the shield of Faith extinguishes every fiery Dart and lie of Satan Revelation extinguishes all those lies from Satan and we have the sword of the spirit to say it is written get behind me Satan it is written in the name of Jesus Christ so father Lord you saw the hands that were raised Lord God May every person be ready Lord I would just humbly believe if there's 500 or 2,500 whatever the number is I believe we could be one of them Lord God because we believe the truth youve transformed Our
