second Peter 1 verse 6 for the Jose I don't know if you heard this morning's message but if you have any mission or your desires let me know sometime you know pray about it like if you want to send message books somewhere or copies of any book just pray about it go to Nicaragua keep it on your heart hopefully by God's grace we'll get through this okay thank you I appreciate you sharing that God is perfect you know his timing is perfect he's never been late the rapture will be late praise God and there won't be one empty seat at the marriage supper of the Lamb amen he said make sure my house is full and it will be pulled by God's grace thank you so just it's nice to see that there's support there and you know brother BAM said the world is not won by money right but then there are times where people need support and you know Jesus had women following him just giving him money food and susana was one of them Mary Magdalene was one of them and it's not won by money but money is Avenue God uses so we're thankful and God will work everything out in his time and season as we said on Wednesday we just need more patience for his content so let's go to 2nd Peter 1 verse 6 the mystery of godliness restored to man let's just read in verse 6 then we'll be seated here verse 6 let's read it together on three one two three and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness may God as blessings three was work you may be seated I appreciate the feedback this week had numerous people tell me how much they enjoyed the temperance sermons helping people with their diet and just taking care of their body I appreciate that it really helped me I mean this week I think I'm letting one ice cream treat this this is what I think it was on Thursday night but I turned it down I mean I honesty jerks I'll just under such an anointing I didn't even bother me you know some sweets and even temptations that go out to eat you know places that probably shouldn't eat I really felt the anointing of God and I fixed my breakfast with you know hard-boiled eggs and getting though no healthy fats and things like that so I felt good and I appreciate the feedback for those people that it helped it's an anointing when you have the anointing of God on you you can curb the sensual passions of the flesh right that's what it's for you can switch over there I just have one little picture I want to show as we look at godliness now tonight then Wednesday we looked at patients that was a wonderful time in the Lord just an encouragement you know to know that just because you have one moment of impatience that doesn't mean God gets rid of you like Abraham he was the Bible said the Bible just recorded his good things in Romans right he was strong in faith giving God glory patient for 25 years and so yeah now tonight as we look to godliness it's a dual it's a dual meaning there's in other words there's two kinds of godliness just like there's two kinds of faith faith is a is your first anointing but then there's the fruit of faith and we saw that a few weeks ago so godliness is the same it's a step here but then there's a state of godliness which is another word just to say fruitful or state of fruitfulness a state of Christian maturity but this this evening we'll look at Lord willing you know this this this at this anointing you you receive before you're born again so let me get to my other notes here I just wanna make sure I mentioned this from this morning from this morning's message just a reminder that we always want to have one mind God will continue to bless us as we focus on one thing the gospel so every day when we go to work remember it's about the gospel every day in our whole we got to remember it all about the gospel and as we meditate upon the Word of God God will further the gospel in our lives and I'm thankful for that by God's grace so I just want to make sure we emphasize that and our words will always tell what's on our mind right because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks yeah so we have to mate and that's one that's the one thing we have control over the words that come out of our mouth the condition of our mind and our thinking in our affections that's one thing we can always always control by the grace of the Lord the freemore agency so I want to look at godliness tonight and then I want to share a little bit about my experiences with cultural integration you know as we're seeing a lot of the racial problems it's a very small group of course in America but with all the riots and everything a lot of people are a lot of people just don't have the love of Jesus if they just had the love of Jesus they wouldn't feel hatred toward any group any racial group but it's all about the love of Jesus well I just start with that I think I'll just start with that then we'll get the Gallinas this I don't forget let me set my time or two you know I'm sharing this from my perspective everybody has a different perspective so here's my perspective I grew up and as you can tell uh sister Brenda want a nice tan she had there but you know I get a little tan myself you know and I have numerous pictures from my childhood you know for my summertime I would get really really dark really dark like darker than Jose right now I've you really dark I can get really dark you get a much darker brother okay we just can't see it right so coming from my perspective you know I was raised in a very white community you know all the three communities I was raised and we're very high in just Caucasian you know I'm sure it's probably the opposite you know to like Ghana where most people were black right in Ghana you know brother Graham there was times he was hunting in Africa and he tells it on date black people would see him and they would scream because he was the first white person they ever saw there's numerous testimonies and so that that's the natural reaction right to humans when we see someone different than us and uh you know I'll be honest you know growing up we didn't have hardly any black people in our communities and so the first time we would see them I would be nervous because I was just all we saw was white people white people white people that's just common right and as we saw like in brother branham's life you know even with him visiting Africa and so I think really the first time I had a real relationship with a black person was the the coach who recruited me to play football he's a big tall man he's probably six foot two his name's Paul winters he was a running back for Akron and he came to my house you know he visited me he came to him with numerous football games and I I had and and then came to my track meets and my mom just fell in love with him like he was just a nice guy and you know he treated us so well and and so when I signed with Acker my mom was really happy and uh and she said she told Paul she said take care of Jessie you know she drops me off and leaves me and he's the only person I knew in Akron when she dropped me off in the fall of 1999 but when I came to college most of the football players were black and it was a whole new thing for me and I had to learn just you know I was just a nervous person I was already a nervous person and so being around you know different races and then there was you know Indians on the team there was I think I might have been the only Spanish looking one but going back to my childhood I got so dark that a couple of my friends would call me the n-word they would call me and I would go home cry because I got so dark and so I kind of felt like a minority that was half I was half white and you know half Spanish or Mexican what everyone's say we're still not sure in our and our family situation I mean I have my DNA test showed you know I got some Spanish then I got some you know Mexico yeah Mexican he's you know family that came from Mexico but IRA meant so I some of my early memories in fact this might be funny but my dad called me he said you're my only black son my dad would joke all the time because I could get really really dark and so growing up like I remember just being teased because they people thought I was black because I could get so dark in the summertime and so I could I could relate to you know I can relate to people teasing you because your skin color because I experienced it as I would have been 2nd or 3rd or 4th grade just calling me names like that and then as I got older people call me the S word for a Mexican it's SP I see I got called that silent so all throughout my life I've been kind of teased and discriminated against and so I always had a heart for people I felt bad when people got mistreated because I knew what that was like I was just different from most of the white kids in our in our community but once I got to college it was I was the minority again because most the team was black and I didn't have any trouble with that I was just a nervous at first and so you know uh as but I loved everybody anyway like I just I love people I never had a hard time loving anybody it was just knowing like knowing the boundaries like I don't want to disrespect anybody I don't want to make any jokes about anybody any class of people and so I had to learn I just had I just always kept quiet until I felt like I knew a people's background so I didn't say anything bad against them right and I just I'd better to not say anything then say anything at all right but if you know you're really I didn't really have a whole lot of close friends on the football team a few but not really and so my really my closest friend became brother bro he became my real first close black friend you know and so much and it's interesting the first when we come in the message the first person that we we consider our pastor was a black man because once I became a Christian I you know even before I never had any trouble with it and so the Holy Spirit you know working on a person's heart will take any of those feelings away as far as like your your any any pride that would exalt well I'm better than this person if you're a sinner if you're honest sinner you know we're all sinners say we need to be saved by grace we all fall short of the glory of God so that was my kind of integration we just with other cultures because I grew up in a really white culture and then but where I was the minority I was the one people would make fun of and I go to college of the minority there at least on the football team and then even in my college classes I was I was the only guy in the in the classes because I was a teacher with little kids and so it was always women only and me and so I was a minority there too by the nineties I love kids yeah I still do this yeah they I love my job I'm glad I get to do Bible clubs and you know cheer about Jesus I just love kids and I love education like I was telling van you know I love having the whole summer off bulb innings out right now yes I it's a blessing to have the summers off and there's just so many benefits to being a school teacher I mean at one time I know this brother Brooks told me I was his best friend he ever had in his whole life here's a man that grew up in an african-american community right in the south and through the blood of Jesus Christ his best friends become a mixture I'm a half-breed I guess that's a like that in other words his best friendship came from a man who was half white and half Spanish or half Mexican I thought that was just such a good it was just a good example of the Holy Spirit of how God doesn't look at skin color you know God looks at the blood of Jesus Christ amen and he wants to say every skin color that's my brother man calls it revelation seven he said will it be that bouquet bride he called it I love that I love that phrase God has a bouquet of all the different colors and they're all beautiful and that's his bouquet bride so and even today you know I don't witness a lot of discrimination I don't and even in a school I think Copley has like I think it's only 5% minority group you know so again it's mostly white but I love our black kids just like our white kids I mean they're all kids to me they're all wonderful beautiful kids and so I'm just letting you know you know that's where where I come from and so I was never exposed to racism you know I was never of my parents never looked down upon anybody and never said any evil things I just know that we got teased you know we were the ones that got teased if anybody got teased it was our family so I have a lot of heart my heart goes out you know to the the black men who've been killed by the police officers my heart goes out to them and racism is always wrong it's always wrong and so I pray I hope you pray I hope you pray for reform to be made in the police system but God knows we need police officers praise God we certainly need them every time that there's been an emergency who do you call the cops and so I just want to just share those few words that's about all I want to say just let you know that I have a burden for people that get mistreated because I was mistreated I was never beat up I was never hurt or punched but I was laughed at made fun of I was the I was the one people were joking about I was the different one growing up all right like I said I loved all the guys on the team I love my coaches and and then today I love all of all the races and I love how Wendy says we always have like a multi-national Church here such a small church but almost every part of the the world is represented here I love it God has just he's great you know he's he's great and and I'll say this if I ever offended anybody with anything I ever said about race forgive me because I never would ever want to do that it's like I said I know what it's like to go home crying numerous times my parents asked me why you crying I said look that the boys called me this n-word you know I didn't even know what did that you know I just I just knew it was wrong so that's why you know I'm thankful that we have a multi-national Church here it just it's glorious and I thank the Lord for all the all the people but again our prayers should be God you know changed some laws but change hearts that's the biggest thing change hearts that that hearts will come to know Jesus Christ cuz when you know Jesus Christ you don't have any any evil feelings toward anybody you know you're no better than anybody else and everybody deserves God's grace alright so um sorry about that let's go to that okay so if you have any questions about you know the current events or anything like that you know you can feel free to ask me about them I'll give you my thoughts on them so I make sure I get everything okay alright so so get a godliness for a few minutes here tonight now to accept godliness Church you have to reject ereference FDJ reject ear evidence and it's specifically targeted towards sinners because remember on the statue perfect man godliness is being like God and that's specifically to sinners because brotherly kindness is kind of specifically to your church family the last thing God gives you before you gives you the Holy Ghost is kindness to your church family praise God that's why a lot of people that you know divide churches or split churches it shows they never had this they never had brotherly kindness if they're so selfish that they only are kind to themselves they only care about themselves it shows they never had this to begin with because you can't have that and be born again so you know yeah I'm sorry you have to have that to be born again you can't have that and divide God's family all right so a leanest is a it's a it's a I call it here in the book the devotion needed to be like God on God's Way or the reverence or devotion in other word for reverence so it's the reverence needed to be just like God on God's Way ok so again there's two types of godliness this is what I believe from Scripture is a godliness here and then there's a godliness where Paul says godliness with contentment is great gain now look the Bible calls it great now this they say this this godliness can't be greater than the charity baptism of the Holy Ghost if the batch atole ghost you know was was hidden for 2,000 years and it's the greatest thing that could the greatest gift you could receive well then how can this be greater than that it can't be so godly this has to be a higher mature form of Christianity it's on the same level of just being fruitful being faithful it's the highest level of Christianity I just put some more words like Paul said I'd kept the faith now there's another way to use faith other than just the first anointing I fought a good fight so it's a it's a victor who's won the battle praise God who's one who's overcome the enemy after years and years of battles praise God so in other words this is this is a higher form of godliness it means it's completely loyal and obedient now not sinlessness but it's a mature level of daily loyalty and obedience to the commands of God the church this only happens you and I will do our best we will please God our best all the after we suffer a lot you're only going to get here by suffering as we saw this morning Paul said I want you to believe God but you also have to suffer for God that was his prayer Jesus the Bible said you all know but Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered so we can expect this we can expect suffering in our lives some degree and it's different for everybody now that'd be interesting to see in the next few weeks as we listen to your testimonies what was your greatest suffering in your life it'd be interesting to see what God brought you through because I'm sure to be a little different like we looked at brother Branham member his greatest suffering was being left all alone out in Arizona with no preachers inviting him I just feeling all alone out there but see God had told him to walk with me you'll walk alone and thank God amen so he said that was his greatest suffering was out in the desert of Arizona so see Church you you and I we'll get there we'll get to this state of godliness and will please God the best will be our best form of a Christian after we suffer but we've got to go through the sufferings and that's how you get there Jesus became more obedient more and more beating never sinned but he became orbited as he suffered the Bible says he had to learn how to obey God praise God he said I do always those things that please him all the sufferings allowed him to please God more and more as time went on praise God it's a lot of maturity how many want to grow a maturity praise God it's the only way we're going to do it is through suffering now I want to move to this thought here notice how it's the sixth one I think I've mentioned this before one two three four five six so five grace we need grace and patience six is godliness and this is significant because in Genesis one man is made on the sixth day and he was created sinless so Adam was made on the sixth day and he was immediately like God that's why the anointing of the Holy Spirit that's why six is a good number because it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit on a man or woman to be godly and so what was Adam doing once he was on earth he had dominion he had control as he could church that's what God once in our life he wants us to have control over the enemy right that's that's the part of godliness that is ours we've got to start taking control notice this is you you you you you you you you you you you and now with patience you start have to be patient with others right temperance is where it's you you you you've got to control yourself but now with patience now I got to be patient with brother Jesse now I got to be godly to my neighbors so it starts with you building up you focusing on you you you you you right and then it builds out to other people and so with godliness now it's you being anointed to start taking dominion over yourself over your own life in other words right you have to start taking dominion because remember we're trying to go back to what Adam US Adam was a son of God who was anoint of the Holy Spirit he didn't sin he had dominion he had control he had the he had the choice praise God he had the authority from God as a lowercase God on the earth right amen and so see that is that is our example that six is the example of godliness that we need to apply to our life today it's God's desire for you and I to take dominion over our lives that's what godliness is you start taking dominion over your life and how you treat others Romans 5:17 says you reign in life by one Jesus Christ see you rain not yeah we don't want to rain in the next slide but geez just wants to see people rain right now in this life amen he wants to see people with Dominion in this life and how you doing got a star that flashing you gotta gotta got to be temperate you can't let this guy reign and tell you what to do and this this flesh determine how your weeks gonna go can I say like that as most weeks you don't lay around and you're suffering and sick all week right your body's usually healthy you normally healthy you don't got to determine you got to determine by the holy spirit that you're gonna bring this into subjection and you're gonna have a good week serving the Lord Amen Alleluia you have to reign over it praise God so what do you reign over demonic powers and temptations Paul says we wrestle against principalities powers the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen what do we roll over the demons that live around us the demons that hover over Northeast Ohio right we have to rule over those things that's our calling in life to reign in life by Jesus Christ your enemies are these unseen dena makaan sorry oh yeah denominational but also demonic influences and you defeat them through the whole armor of God as you cast down the imaginations as we saw on Wednesday night again we looked at that bringing it into obedience to the Word of God I know this is familiar just but let's let's think about our week did we rain this week do we reign over the flesh or to the flesh reign over us right I'll say like this you determined it yeah whether you got the victory or you got you were defeated it was your choice see because God gives us that free more agency and if we can get just that start with that anointing and build it up and continuing to keep that anointing on you and if you're patient then he'll give it he gives us anointing of godliness of being just like God wrote Amos says it's just like God it's a devotion or reverence is being reverent at all times praise God remember Church those demons will flee if you just quote God's Word through your lips and refuse him and turn down his temptation he has to flee eventually how many can be a witness of that you've been tempted tend attendant for this is you continually say no no no pretty soon you don't feel it anymore Ray's gonna that's right same thing with the Lord Jesus keep refusing to keep refusing it and then you will begin to subdue demonic powers and reign over sin the flesh the world and Satan early appraised God thank the Lord reigning in life so this deals with Dominion as we get into godliness now you start God starts giving you a little bit of independence but we have said the bride is an independent woman independent from Satan a man she's depend upon God but she's independent from the demonic powers of darkness praise God that's right church so reigning over sin the flesh the world Satan I've had so many people over the years come into my classroom and they say I just did usually the recess monitors which is funny because they go from one room to the next and the kids are like and they come to my class and they're a little more a little more under control it's just this year a numerous recess martyrs come in and they tell me they said there's something special about your class and I always say this is Jesus I said it's all about Jesus yeah yeah see cos you're a creator right you have dominion over the over your life right and that's what I do I try to by God's grace pray and just create the atmosphere your creator and that they don't visit I like coming in your room or and the other women are there Christians they go to church you know but see it's a it's it's you and I taking God's Word refusing so I've got to refuse anger I've got to refuse temptations to be bitter against teachers and anyone else who might hurt my feelings children yeah they spit on me over the years they kicked me they yelled at me they've called me a bad teacher but I know I'm a good one by God's grace by God's grace so you know we have to turn down any temptation if to refuse those and rule over it we gotta create a good atmosphere praise God I've had even the you know some of the leaders in our districts who superintendents and assistant superintendents email me over the years and say thank you for being a leader as a teacher you know one one year I had a super assistant superintendent come in and he just watched my room for 30 minutes and he's like he said you were doing a fantastic job he said you need to we wish all the teachers in the district were like you or something like something along those lines and I just said it was God's grace but it's creating that atmosphere you and I have the power to create the atmosphere so let's do it praise God right if you're a creator let's create pretty Scotty today let's create it have dominion cuz you're taught to read over it praise God now looking like this I look at like God is like a father right he'll slowly give you ownership over something like I used to let my children mow the grass but I would they're really busy now in learning so I just mowed the grass but the first few times I'd kind of watch them and give them a little more independence I'm sure my wife she probably sees it most with cooking right she teaches the little younger ones to cook and then pretty soon now in case you can do breakfast all by yourself you know she's real good with the knife they're never cut herself by God's grace it's just that same idea I believe with the same thing is with God as we stay faithful to God God just you give us all the direction at the beginning but then he slowly gives us so he steps away so that we can make decisions by what he's already taught us it has to be that way right it's adoption it has to be that way praise God and like brother Brandon even got to that spot where remember the Lord told him he said do I have to push you through a pipe every time does God have to push us through a pipe every time to do something right it shouldn't be that way he says what about your victory I thought the angel urgent what about your faith see not that not that you make a decision without is leading but you would pray and ask for his leading and then when the time comes where you have to make a decision you make the best decision you can based upon the Word of God not according to this flesh what this guy was with the desires of God that's what I I can see by God's grace I see it all the time preaching I don't feel that every time to preach a sermon like I don't in fact any brother amens come up to me as so many times he's a great servant I'm like before hand I was like I don't know Lorna I just don't know see it but what's the Holy Spirit gets in here for he's God and people start calling it the Word of God gets delivered to those that are hungry for praise God and you just learn to trust God you just learn well this is my channel this is my position Here I am I'm at my post of duty I'm waiting on the Lord and the Lord comes when we hire them to come praise God that's right so see Church this is God giving us the dominion over our lives the number six you get anointed you take Dominion praise God you rule over it do I have to move you every time you move is what the angel told brother branham do I need to move you every time before you do something I don't want to know what the Lord have to say that right in other words we want to know what God wants to be done progessive the bride will know what he wants done with the word amen she'll know what the word says praise God like beggin I were talking there with the missionary he said Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature praise God there's some sort that's the general Commission so we just asked the Lord God guide us with this opportunity that we have to reach those who need to hear it we know fewer and fewer people are going to receive it we know that but it doesn't it doesn't take away our responsibility to give them a chance to hear it so this is six this is a godliness anointing of being just like God in reverent just like God now brother Branham in the stature of a man he goes to Matthew five go to Matthew 5:43 brother Branham specifically says you're godly like God says so in other words you treat sinners like God does and this is this is the main thought with godliness that I've even found through scripture Matthew 5:43 you have heard that have been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven that's how you do it very very simple how can I believe sing about a chat via a child of God this morning when that beautiful son I'm a child of it then we see that song I'm a child of God yes I am how do you know you're a child of God because you love your enemies you bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that's how you know your childhood God that's why sure I don't get if I said god bless you two people and they don't even look you know they don't even look like they deserve God and blessing I don't care because I know I'm supposed to bless those people that are my enemies I don't worry about that now if they blasting the Holy Ghost I'd have to pray about that right you know we have to pray about that we don't want to do that if they're beyond but only God knows that they're beyond this is the point of return right only God knows love your enemies bless them that curse you you're good to them that hate you then you'll be the children of your father this is mature stuff here this isn't like I'm just trying to get victory over my cigarette addiction that's this is beyond that that's your own battle I just got to get victory over this no you gotta you gotta love the person that hates you you're gonna say good things about the person that cursed you this is deeper right it's deeper than just getting victory over that bottle of alcohols much it's much greater it's a greater anointing praise God to desire good to desire God's blessings upon them that do evil let me just say like this for even though even that cop that shot the guy administer the minister not shot well yeah I was Atlanta but they I mean think about that as much as we despise those actions by those cops that did evil if we take that love them bless them do good to them pray for them we pray for them pray he's done I mean we would think that would be an enemy of the world right think about the Jews that crucify Jesus Jesus had divine love praise God he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing this is godliness so see godliness T is all about how you treat sinners and unbelievers or enemies cuz your enemies can be even Christians right but they can be of the synagogue of Satan right so this is what God requires to be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect love to bless do good pray for your enemies praise God for you maketh his Sun to rise on the evil we're back to Matthew 5 and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye not goodness do not even the publicans the same and if he salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so Jesus calls perfection or completion when you love those who don't love you you return good for those people that do you evil praise God and this is a greater anointing of the Holy Spirit how many need that anointing yeah absolutely we all need it remember like Bob and me you know you lied to the IRS different things you know you'll fall short in little areas but then God asked you repent God or bring that strength right back he'll bring it right back so see when you garner with godliness you start becoming like God and you hope everybody gets saved you know everybody won't but you're hoping they do Peter says God is not willing that any should perish Paul says he God wishes all men to be saved in the scripture I loved Ezekiel 33 11 it says as I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live terney turning from her evil ways for why will you die o house of Israel look at that father's heart he said why don't you turn turn I don't have pleasure in the wicked perish for I want to see the wicked turn to God no I was sharing with brother bang as well you know one of the brothers I think in Minnesota if I'm not mistaken he's a pastor he does a huge prison ministry and they get led they send message books they just send it in there every year I think last year they sent a thousand or maybe more and they get letters all the time of sinners that are in prison that gets saved in prison now they're they're in there for life but if they have faith in God's Word they're saved praise God and God and this this to me this shows the heart of God you see people and people that did they deserve a chance at the gospel no they probably murdered somebody's probably stole they robbed a bank they raped somebody they did too awful evil wicked things but yet there's still hearts of godly people that want to give them a chance to repent and go to heaven these people don't deserve it we would think but God doesn't delight in the death of the wicked according to the scripture I want to read go to Roman's 9 1 let's read this here because this is important verse one I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost then I have a great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart why why did he have sorrow why did a Holy Ghost filled Saint like Paul a missionary have sorrow because verse 3 for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ overcame who is over all God blessed forever amen so see how many believe Paul had godliness he was so much like God that he said he wishes I wish I could be cursed I wish I could see me destroyed so that Israel might be saved what godliness that is just like Jesus he took the curse that we might be saying amen of course we would never want to be cursed we never want to be sin sinners but we so badly want to see people accept God's grace and and walk in the truth that we would ourselves feel like we'd be willing to be a curse so that other people could be blessed this is real godliness this is like the heart of God God doesn't enjoy when the sinners dying heaviness and sorrow and heart now listen Church I think do you understand how many times you drive down the road and have sorrow and heaviness of heart for them the beggar you know he's a drug addict right we talked about that daily that's our that's on the heart our neighbors you know they might be evil people how often do we have heaviness and hardness just this this this burden heart for the beggar how about for the nomination they worship Mary and know they you have their prayer beads and they they continue to live in sin we should have a we should have a heaviness of heart for people shouldn't we know let me be totally honest I always feel it no well when I really start down getting down to thinking about that don't you feel that church don't you feel that let these people are lost and it's something I can do is there anything I can do see godliness makes you feel for them now Paul that looked under this is interesting Paul had a burn for them but Jesus told him don't go to them he said go to the Gentiles and that's in that striking yeah this burden it a burden for this this this say like this this racial group of people alright this certain race had a verb to this race but yet he wasn't called to go to them somebody else had to go to him Peter right more saints like that James James and Peter pillars in the church my goodness Steven remember when he was stoned he asked Jesus lay not this sin to their charge when Jews stoned him to death he said Lord lay it not to their charge don't let it be on their account that's real godliness right there that is true godliness and then Jesus uttered to all of his mockers Father forgive them for they know not what they do not goodness true godliness go to Ezekiel 9 verse 1 let's go back over this here with sigh and cry for the abominations remember Church because of the iniquity abounding the love of many shall wax cold what that means is we're not gonna see many people with godliness that really love people today it's gonna be hard it's gonna be rare very rare to find people that have this heart like Paul that they care so much about the loss that they'll do something about it I think the last time I really felt like that was when we had Victoria I was telling her they Amen about that so when we had Victoria I was so burned I just want to see my family so I uh I took a well how they say like this I came here to the church and I mailed out about 40 church age books and I mailed uh tracts to everybody on my mom's side I think I just used my ties to do it you know just to give them a chance and I didn't hear back from one of them other than one of them said oh they're really nicely and professionally done now you know I'll be honest I was hurt I was expecting more but all's I could do all's I can do is act upon the burden in my heart what moved me to send it to my family members some of them in married three times sometime were married three times what what I saw I realized that's not the normal Jessie that doesn't care right that's not the that's not the flesh man that's the soul man praise God that's the godliness part of me which I know I've got a portion of it praise God but that was the godliness part of me when to come out where God is good even those that may not deserve it and so recently I can see that in my life that was you know what 44 years ago because Victoria's now for reaching out to people that have heard it but are not living it heard it but not living it xico 9 verse 1 he cried also my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand this is see 594 it's about 600 years before Christ this would be fulfilled almost 700 years later at Titus AD 70 and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied toward the north and every man a slaughtering weapon his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by a side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the Lord of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the riders in corn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city go through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof so only the men and women that were sighing and crying that hated the sin only they got marked by the Holy Spirit verse 5 and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity verse 6 lay under the other other Lee old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he sent unto them to file the house and build the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and I was left that I fell upon my face and cried and said O Lord God wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of the fury upon Jerusalem so this made Ezekiel cry seeing God just save a few faithful prayer warriors and then everybody else was going to suffer judgment this made the Prophet cry verse 10 and as for me I'm sorry go to verse 9 then he said the iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is great now remember iniquity is purposeful sinning it is transgressing with knowledge of the transgression in other words you know it's wrong you still do it so God lets Ezekiel know these people knew better he said the iniquity house of Israel is exceeding great so they've been they in other words they'd heard it time and time and time they've heard it over and over and over but still the sins that it didn't cause him to change and they didn't cry about it and pray about it anymore these are people that did not pray about the awful sins that were being done in the city in other words these were people the people that got slain they were ones that were not like God because God can't look at sin and not feel sad about it praise God mercy Jesus it's such a strange agent I think it just lay out to see if you know there's no persecution on us there's so many financial things we could do and you know it's just such a strange age but we have to be burdened about the sin in the city we have to have a burden about our families that are living in sin he said it's exceeding great the iniquity is exceeding great they knew it over and over again is so great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the Lord had forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not they say Oh God left the earth there's no God God doesn't care what I'm doing God doesn't see what I'm doing but they're workers of iniquity they knew better but they said Oh God's out here God oh I don't feel the anointing anymore there's no more Holy Spirit and yet there was the whole time it was right in the church praying for the sinners amen that's where they know anything was amen it was right there in the church building of Sian crying against the abominations of the city verse 10 and he asked for me also mine I shall not neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the ink corn by side reported the matter saying I've done as thou hast commanded me this was fulfilled in 70 AD some people believe it was fulfilled in Zedekiah's day but I think I think it more applies to the New Testament with Jesus warning them he warned them he said when you see the armies he said compass about Israel he said run into the hills right he said don't go back to your house and try to get you just run to the hills he said don't spare any because if they really had godliness they would have been in church praise God if they really had a desire to serve God they would have been the house of God sad about the sins going on the city right God told his ego there's no excuse these people are exceedingly full of iniquity they've heard it time and time again they failed to repent so see Church when you have godliness it will separate you from fellowship with sinners because you despised their choices it burdens you and it also makes you weep inside in your private prayers and your church prayers because you're so burdened and concerned about other people's destinies that you're crying and pleading with God to show mercy on the disobedient and on the unholy that's why I'm gonna song was very fitting Hosanna that's very fitting break my heart for what breaks God's heart let me have a broken heart about it now you remember the story I need to find the message you haven't found it yet but one of the brothers walked up to brother Branham and one time it said he said if the coming of the Lord is so near why you out there hunting and he was rebuking brother Branham you know brother Graham said he said I'd go out there because if I didn't I would go crazy worrying about all the needs of the of the world remember he'd been to India the poorest nation he said he cried and wept and he gave every single thing and still they're running up and he told the brothers that I've got to go up there I also go crazy worrying about all the problems all the sinners out there isn't that the MOT same for you I'll be honest I battle condemnation all the time for their bank if I don't witness to the grocery store lady I feeI bad a condemnation like God help me Jesus you know I don't give my book away to somebody I feel bad like oh god I want to see them say God have mercy on me but if I have that all the time I'll go crazy I'll let the enemy condemn me for not doing enough right yeah I sit here and preach service after service and and get thousands I think we're at 960 thousand views on our YouTube channel that's just my channel then we have the church channel people are hearing it but see we would up we want to make sure we have the burden right we don't want to lose the burden but we can't go crazy either and be all condemned all the time so that's why I love it so where's your answer come in the house of God and praying for them praise God because that's what fits the scripture they sighed and cried for the abominations I can't force people to come but God may God hear my prayers that some might come praise God praise God now what do you think about let me get off on another tangent here what do you think about all the message people that use quotes about this to say this was Kovan 19 now anything about that remember there was message people showing to you they were using quotes or program uses and said they were twisting the quotes to make it say that everybody's going to die from Kovan unless you got the baptism the Holy Ghost come on here we are what march/april made you three months later amen see and uh it's instantly as soon as I saw them I knew those quotes are mistaken they've they've taken those quotes out of context now here we are three months later and we believe good Saints like brother Andy sighs who had covet 19 he's a real man of God we believe and so CY we just gotta we have to be able to we have to rightly divide the word of God prove all things hold fast that which is good try every spirit whether it be of God see that was the spirit of fear trying to get people to be fearful fearful fearful the the purpose of the scripture is to pray for sinners praise not to be sobered with sin that it drives you to more prayer amen that's the purpose of the scripture not to scare people but to get people to pray and intercede and be a king and priest unto God amen this isn't my notes we go to Luke Bemis Luke 16 yeah no it's not Luke 16 it's Luke 18 Luke 18:1 sorry Oh Genevieve took some real good pictures there oh it's going on Facebook tonight you know they steal my phone and then I don't know what they're taking pictures the funniest one there when they do themselves you know Genovese tried to do a selfie and it just gets that like the top of her head like that those are my favorite Luke 18:1 and he spoke a pair of unto them to this end so what's the purpose of this that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was an acidic judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow trouble with me I will avenge her less by her continual coming she where me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them now be honest errs I don't cry every day I might look like it because I cry almost every Sunday but I don't cry every single day but Jesus when he's describing that he said they're often crying so I think the Lord for that cry day and night unto them though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily thank the Lord praise God doesn't seem speedily to us right but it's speedily to God nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth so this connects fake with endtime prayer life right or your prayer life is connected to faith at the end time so those people that keep knocking the key pray they're still burned about abortion I'm gonna keep the hammer on that one they're still burned about murders and and unjust acts of violence there's still concern discern still saying God have mercy God have a grace upon these sinners the people that stay burning about it are the ones that have genuine faith jesus said sir he uses the same words cry day and night sign cry day and night and this was the end of this parable is so we'll always pray and not to faint I keep mention this but Keysha how many letters you think you sent to ad and Emily take a guess in four years how many think he's maybe a couple a year for a while you did get for the one and then it was then it got further and further in between so I was mentioning my cousin Adam on Wednesday with patience how I had to be honest I just didn't think he was gonna be saved he was so addicted to drugs I thought in my own human thinking I don't even see how it can be saved but God is my witness we prayed this altar numerous times and I wept for his soul and when I had given up God was still working praise God God was using that little heart of love over there acacia you know I saw him and his wife they came to my Sunday service my preaching appointment and she said I was talking to I just said Joey I said I really appreciate your faith just stay with that and let him come back and she said she said yeah she said it's all God because he had abandoned them for drugs he'd abandoned the two kids and the family and she said she has many friends like saying to her how can forgive him after all he's done in his time with the drug dealers all these things she said it was just the grace of God and she starts to cry and enters that you just did something for me because I remember praying for him where he's God I remember crying for the abominations that word km and simon everybody was invest in these prayers hi we know brother Randy Burton yeah some of us know right now he's a preacher in Texas well way before he got married his wife was out in the world I went out to preach for brother Brooks when they first started the church it must have been 2008 2007 long time ago I didn't have well this gray hair I got now when I preached on the Holy Ghost and Randy's mother-in-law came up to the altar it's in the hotel room is a little bit bigger than this one and she said my daughter's gone astray can you pray for her and she started weeping and I think we sat down on the the hotel chairs and we just prayed and by the Holy Spirit I said God has heard your prayer I can't imagine he's saying that basically like prophecy I said God has heard your prayer I said because you're sighing and crying glory praise God I would say that every time I cried but I did that time and I remember weeping and crying with her it must have been about maybe five years later I came back to the church and there she was sitting there her daughter got saved had come out of the world we're looking all holy and then a couple years after that she got married to brother Randy by God's grace praise God hallelujah and anyone when ice went back and preached you know I agreed her mom and said look what God did God heard your sighing and crying for the abominations see for most people spiritual things don't get real enough it's like some fable we're telling it's not a fable it's a reality praise God these things are real and when we so see that's why people don't get emotional enough because it's not real enough to them but see when it gets real the Bible says you'll sigh and cry because you're anointed that way praise God amen you're anointed by God leanness so you love the sinner you love the backside of praise God you love them because you have the anointing to do it hallelujah we're in the house of God amen that's what the scripture says remember Peter said judgment begins to the house of God so I've seen that one Adam Lindsay Adam other one Beth sister barb that was the other one that's about 2009 there's my hour so bear with me to me so 5 minute timer here we were at our other church on mo drive the second one on mojo not the first one the second one and we had that oh my that was quite a sanctuary my goodness I can't even believe I run that out now thinking about it I [Laughter] guess I just fit our nature I guess you're just old-fashioned [Laughter] bang why'd you let me rent that out I'm just kidding buddy we just needed a place you know anyways we had Jim schumake preach brother amen and Beth and Simon I was I was their pastor at that time hard to believe the man who introduced to me the message I was at best God has God has got a great sense of humor what Jim just preach on sighing and crying for the bomber nations and there was only two people that came up no Beth might've been the only one that came up for prayer and she come up and I still remember this day we just paid her and church I saw the tears drop down on her eyes down to the floor she was just praying she said brother Jim pray for my sister barbash you'll get saved and come in the message oh ha they're just a few years later for they event she started Beth and Simon started witnessing to her she's starting to come into church and one of the services I preached got delivered from cigarettes at that sermon it's on the testimony you can look it up it's on Vimeo Vimeo and so I've seen at least three cases where Saints have sighed and cried for the abominations and God has moved on the scene and God has saved Souls Church and I just saved them but I believe filled some of them with the Holy Ghost amen because they're solid they're faithful they're right in the Word of God amen desiring more and more of the Word of God now with this anointing Church you have the ability to either show mercy or pronounced judgment with this anointing of godliness right because you become like God you can either grant mercy to people like brother Branham everybody grab mercy on the couple making love it was a test was he to show mercy or judgment well godliness instead of having the heart of man he had the heart of God in that situation God wanted to show mercy to them the Bible said be slow to anger praise God godliness you'll be slow to anger just as God is slow to anger Jesus said blessed are the judgmental for they shall obtain judgment no blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy mercy God have mercy on their souls God have mercy on their bodies see this is the anointing of the Holy Spirit mercy Jesus was harsh and judgmental towards certain sinners of course but we recognize his mercy and forgiveness that's what we love him and that's what we admire him for His mercy and forgiveness go to second Timothy we'll close to this one 2nd Timothy 4 14 through 18 here's Paul he's got the anointing of the Holy Ghost I like going over some of these many men because I forget some of the testimonies that God has done there's no greater miracle than a saved soul yeah that's right you know and imagine having mothers cry and sisters cry just wanted to see and then God answers all that's that's that's real rejoicing right there pays God cuz you know you can't save anybody that's to be in God's what God has to give the increased praise god I thank the Lord for His grace 2nd Timothy 4 14 through 18 now notice just I think it's beautiful this was just quickened to me by the Holy Spirit in a matter of just five little sentence five verses Paul switches from judgment on some but mercy on others the only way he would know how to do this would he be in constant prayer in contact with the Holy Spirit how can this person be curse this will be blessed this will be blessed that one blessed that one cursed how can he know through constant prayer through the leadership of the Holy Spirit how can we know by staying in prayer by sighing and crying for the abominations than in the city Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord reward him according to his works that's judgment judgment God and let Paul know that man's under judgment verse 15 of whom be thou we're also see you where that man he must been beyond the point of no return he must have a reprobate mind be aware of that guy stay away from that guy why did he say go witness to him because he had the anointing on him the anointing told him stay away from that guy he's reprobate mind because he did Paul much evil of whom be thou we're also free had greatly withstood our words at my first answer no man stood with me but all meant for cyka me my I pray God that it may be not laid to their charge look he's here here here's gonna merci he just announced judgment on one man but then said God be merciful to the rest of them you know a lot of these churches the preachers are the ones that are backslidden the preachers are the workers of iniquity may God be merciful to those congregations the preachers hold him there with itching words and that's what what Paul says right here all men for Sikkim but I'm praying God don't lay it to their charge notwithstanding the Lord stood with me praise God so even though all men for second price is right there with him praise God and strengthen me hey that's what you need well you're rejecting you know what you need you feel alone you need the Friends of God say Lord come stand with me I feel alone show me that I'm not alone amen stand with me praise God that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen praise God let's stand to our feet scripture says God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he ha he will he hardeneth but the scripture says he delighteth in mercy see when you have godliness you have more mercy towards sinners than you used to praise God a lot more mercy you can be even though everybody for sakes you can say you can so say God have mercy on them brother bang how many times have I preached at the CMA Church I think they had me about three to three or four times they Eve invited me out to special events Mirman one time went up to Lake Erie and near it is near Lake Erie and brother Richard Sanchez was there you remember that they have me preached at their conventions they're kind of like conventions or getaways and I appreciate that and my prayer is God be merciful to those wonderful people because they at least had me come for each praise God and look we got some of them out of there first God thank the Lord Amen sister ooh god bless you praise God got at least a couple on there I don't know if you were there any man that's what I'm saying you come out of it you too you know that she was there so we thank the Lord for that now how many would say Lord anoint me with a portion of godliness that I can be reverent I can be devoted and I can be merciful like God is merciful and how many say God help me to sigh and cry for the abominations help me to have faith at the end time that when you return you'll see my faith praise God let's have the musicians come let's sing you got something okay good [Music] you gotta show me with this example with my cousin Adam that God hears prayers he's reminded me after Lindsay after barb now Adam God's reminding me of the power of crying out sighing and crying for the abominations that be done the city praise God let's have a word of Prayer raise your hand [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there are many [Music] are nice it is nice out there [Music] I want [Music] heroes who have fallen to the ground this is an emergency I didn't love the stakes for the lost and Lud's need were crying for their comeback crying for their comeback and I've got you it was stressed out to me [Music] [Music] [Music] let's see [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] father [Music] [Music]
