that stand here I like to go to let's go to Hebrews five I kind of left off there a couple weeks ago let's look at this thought on hearing and I won't need to I don't need to slide still later on Malachi so I'm not we'll just do the scriptures for now and I don't I don't I don't have a slideshow for this one didn't have time to prepare that so I want to go tea brews Chapter five this is like part four of the worship series I just did a little small series here on worship at least right now Hebrews chapter five and just update their on the voting we got fourteen people to vote to didn't turn them in today and then there's three there so we have five voting or voters left here by God's grace so those are due by next Sunday so hopefully we'll be able to nonce the results there by God's grace next I won't be here but I guess we have to have an announce it may be next Sunday well I'll talk to you better about that by God's grace they're just new next Sunday then we'll have to tally them up I'll leave my office so you can tell him up if you need to you brother by God's grace we'll talk about that he Hebrews chapter 5 here Hebrews chapter five yes verse eleven verse eleven Hebrews 5:11 like look at da love hearing tonight and we want to be able to be people that can hear the word of God but I want to just show the scriptures about hearing because Jesus mentions it numerous times Paul mentions it here this was the spirit that was on the pharisees sadducees anyone that rejected christ in his date this was what was on them they heard all of it but they didn't hear it so that natural hearing were not spiritual hearing so I want to show through the scripture here the lack of the ability to hear the word of God and then we can thank God at the and I'll show you some some interesting things here are some really good things at the end about how blessed we should feel because we can hear the word of God thank God for that amen Hebrews five verse 11 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing I was talking to Hebrew Christians I'm not sure where we're not told where this letter was sent to but it's Hebrew Christians and they were already dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers I'm sorry this might be - you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become as such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen let's just have one more word of Prayer as we approach the word haven't father we're thankful for this word father we want to be those that are in our position we want to be those that can hear the Word of God that can teach others so help us Lord to have ears that hear father and Lord I know we're looking at the the the one slice the one side of the slice tonight but Lord we'll end by looking at Lord the other side which we're grateful to be on that side father help us Lord Jesus to rightly divide your word I'm trusting all my trust is in you lord I need you this hour that people need you or as we said this morning help us remember our moral littleness Lord God a little we are how how quickly we can make a mistake if we're not spiritually on guard at every moment help us Lord and we'll give all the glory to you Lord for the vocation you've given us in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen god bless she's being seated praise God and just so you know I think the livestream I think Malachi told me I messed it up this morning so it was on my it was on my regular YouTube account and not the church YouTube so if you want to go back and listen this morning's message they have to go on my personal account I put it on the wrong account so I don't know if that impacts anybody but I know people that might be live-streaming tonight if they wanted to hear this morning's message they have to go on my personal YouTube account just so just a small detail there I just want to share that by God's grace okay so let's start here write in Hebrews 5 and I want to take all this I want to take most of time and show the scriptures of how all the scriptures about dull of hearing and then I want to close by showing how Jesus told us that we can hear the word of God so I want to start with that and I think it would be a real blessing to yell I got a lot of good quotes here and I think you'll like that it could be encouraged here okay so Hebrews 10 I'm sorry he was 5:11 pardon me now we start off here now in verse 11 here Paul says he has more to say about Melchizedek because look at verse 10 called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek and then he says in verse 11 we have of whom we have many things to say and are hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing so Paul said he'd like to tell them more about Melchizedek but they're not ready for they're not ready for the teaching on Melchizedek and isn't it striking that brother Branham came in 1965 right before he goes off the scene in February of 65 and he preaches who is this Melchizedek amen he said there's two schools of thought most people think he was either made up or he was the actual real priests you know just like a regular man priests but the Prophet goes back to the scripture and shows that he was without mother without father without beginning of days without ending of life showing us that it was God Himself God in a body was Melchizedek amen so but they did this church couldn't handle that because they were dull of hearing now the dull means sluggish slow dull so a slow to understanding of course the ear means understanding spiritually you hear it with a natural ear but understanding it spiritually they were slow to understand what he was what Paul was actually saying and now here's another indicator we ended a couple weeks ago a couple Sundays ago ended with this thought verse 12 for when I'm sorry for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God let me finish that scripture and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat now the word unskillful means inexperienced in teaching the Word of God so the the believers these Hebrew believers were inexperienced with teaching God's Word they couldn't teach it in a deep way they could only teach it in a very simple way they'd have much experience to teach the Word of God now the meat let's go to verse 14 but first but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age now meat means nourishment or food in the Greek so strong nourishment or strong word word it's got some real nourishment to us belongs to them that are a full age even those by who by who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil okay now use means habit or practice so those who can handle the strong meat of the word have habits to exer stand or perceive right and wrong amen so in other words mature Christians have such strong senses they can sense evil and they can sense good like I said this morning like when that person said oh the greatest privilege of my life was to meet brother Branham I had a sense I had a strong sense I had their strong sense that's not right that's wrong to exalt brother Branham to the same place as god that's wrong that's idolatry remember idolatry means your name gets removed off the book of life I remember that we were preach on that in the Sardis Church age oh we need to we need to have a spiritual exercise going on tonight praise God that we can exercise and be full mature Christians to be able to pick up on things that are right and pick up on things that are wrong okay now the elementary principles are in chapter 6 verses 1 to 3 so let's go read that Hebrews 6 1 2 3 and and I think as we just look at these briefly you'll see this is what Paul saying Paul saying you have any move past the six elementary foundational principles he said so how can we go into other things deeper things more mature things you have to have these six things first and then you can go in to deeper things and let's see I think I think number one I think the first one is the most important one I think you all agree as we look at this let's look at verse 1 chapter 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of here's the four very first one repentance from dead works that's the first one second one faith toward God verse two of the doctrine of baptisms that's number three okay in verse two and verse two and of laying out of hands that's number four laying on of hands number five the resurrection of the Dead which of course we knows there's two resurrections rapture and the second resurrection two white throne judgment and number six which is in verse three I'm sorry number six is in verse two and of eternal judgment now notice eternal judgment it didn't say eternal fire right or eternal burning it didn't say eternal burning because you can't burn eternally without eternal life so see the Bible is perfectly accurate we have to make sure we say just what it says so did you catch that six things now look just let look at the first one a little bit the very first foundational principle for someone who's going to be a beginner babe in Christ is to learn how to repent from their dead works okay now think about that a moment people that fall away for the message or people that fall away from Christ what happened was they never repented in the first place right they never like they could be baptized in Jesus Christ's name acts 2:38 but if they never repented and really died to their love of sin they're gonna be like a pig that goes back to the Waller right they're gonna be a dog that goes back to its vomit because they never repented they never died for to the love of sin and so the very first one at lists is the one most people never get past which is a genuine repentance amen we see a genuine repentance is a full death to self it's fully selling out to taking up a cross and following him daily and see that's where most people fall they they never even get to first base with God we'd say they never get to this first foundational principle of repenting from their dead works how do you know brother Jess because they go back and do the same works they used to do right they go back to the same thing and that's why so it's so important to get people just to repent of their initial dead works because they can't go on to perfection which would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost completion they can't even go on to that until they get these six things first okay so see that that's why that's why repentance is so crucial because it's the very foundation of becoming a Christian you have to feel sorry for your work have to be like like Zacchaeus and say if I send I'll make it right with anybody I know if I stole I'll give you four times more than what I stole that's a real sincere heart amen willing to make up and and try to make all their wrongs try to right amen now second thing faith towards God so you have to have a revelation towards God do they have like brother Branham said they have an intellectual conception or commandment like Cain or I know I've got a sacrifice I guess I'll just bring fruit did they have an intellectual conception or do they have a revelation of what glory like Abel had he had a revelation of God's will amen third thing baptisms noticed baptisms there's multiple baptisms there's a water baptism which brother branham says is for fellowship and then there's a spirit baptism which is for the Holy Ghost okay so they have to understand that they have to understand that there's two baptisms the water and spirit now the fourth one is laying on of hands see divine healing is in the foundation divine healing is a foundational doctrine that we have to know it that we need to know that if someone's sick you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if not God's got a reason for or this person's in sin or both people are in sin but God has a reason for we need to know that God wants us to lay hands on the sick they shall recover because that's one of the signs go you therefore and these signs shall follow them that believe number five the resurrection of the Dead they have to know that that everybody who lives is going to have to be resurrected they have to meet their maker amen God is going to resurrect Adolf Hitler God's got resurrect you name it any man who gets died any woman that's died Cleopatra Julius Caesar God's gonna resurrect all them and they have to answer for the deeds they've done this flesh and then six if like we said eternal judgment the judgment against Judas will last eternally everybody understand that but he will not burn eternally that judgment God's decision you're a son of perdition you're separated from my presence that judgment will last eternally but he himself will cease to exist at some point because he doesn't have eternal life remember eternal means you never had a beginning never had an ending if hell had a beginning it has to have an ending amen it has to because it had a beginning oh that's why you and I if we have eternal life the Holy Spirit showed we were in the mind of God already and when God shares that life with us and that life is housing a brand-new body and eternal body then we live eternally amen that's the grass the promise of the gospel what a promise we have glory now does that help this is helped by God's grace these Christians were dull of hearing they should have been teaching deeper things of God but Paul said we need to go back and teach repentance all over again we got to go teach you the two baptisms again we've got to teach you a leg on of hands we have teaches these things all over again because they got slow to here they couldn't understand who is this Melchizedek imagine that they couldn't understand marriage and divorce they couldn't understand these deeper mysteries because they just got tired of hearing slow to understand all right now that's the first one on the dole of hearing let me read you a quote and go to Hebrews chapter 10 where brother Branham talks about me preaching join here what brother Graham said was me preaching it's in Hebrews chapter 10 brother Graham calls this meat preaching I got the quote for you it's from the CEO of the Christ 1955 that's look at some meat preaching all right and I believe it's verse I believe it's verse 29 so just go to 29 oh no it's verse 26 yeah 26 which I think 26 27 28 29 all go together here let's look at this quote here yeah he calls this strong me he calls Hebrews 10 strong meat and he starts with verse 26 now let's read verse 26 so we kind of get the idea what he's talking about for if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin the RAM said that is me preaching amen look but look at 27 but a certain fearful looking for the judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses now look at verse 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace amen what are we talking about we're talking about this twelve twelve spies eleven of them taste of the promised land 12 of them tasted right and then ten of them came back and said we can't do it we're talking about Judas who went into the promised land and got the anointing of the Holy Spirit but then and sold it out and went to hell right that's me preaching according to our prophet I'm glad we preached it here amen that's why many times Church I've got a labor down on the the difference between the wise virgin the foolish virgin I've got a major on that hammer on that why what's drawing me to do that the Holy Spirit is because the Prophet said this is spiritual meat amen so that we really examine our lives and we really can examine ourselves and see are we in the faith or are we not see because the real Christian wants to know a real Christian has that tension I want to be right I want to be I want to go in the rapture I don't want to play Church I want to serve God amen they got that tension am i pleasing to God where's some people just come to church our church any church and they're just going through the motions they're not coming to hear and so what happens their ears get dull of hearing they can't after a while just don't want to understand and don't care to understand because if they didn't know if they want to understand they come ask me or they come ask cam or Simon or brother Cragar brother Brooks whoever's here they come to ask us if they wanted to know right now let me read the quote this is like I said the seal of the Christ Jesus said whosoever speak of the word against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness in this world or the world to come in other words you Pharisees the Holy Spirit is in the world now so it's loose to every believer so you'll be forgiven of it but one day that Holy Spirit's are coming and then let that generation say something against it and call the very same works of the devil they'll never be forgiven in this world or the world to come all right he said there it is Paul picks it up over in Hebrews 10 listen here I like this he said if we just believe or sin and what is sin but unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already if we just believe wilfully after we've received a knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but a fearful looking to the judgment the fiery indignation which shall devour the adversary so Paul saying if you sin wilfully you are looking at the fires of hell the burning fires of the lake fire if you know the truth but then you still live contrary to it you're getting very close to burning in the lake of fire and brother Ram says this is me preaching he says it next he said awful strong isn't it but that's what we need hey man hallelujah that's what we need we need strong si we need meat preaching right we got to get down to really are people really receiving the Word of God are they really were shipping God or not he said if we have served the Lord you Christians all these years it's time we are getting off a milk diet hallelujah time we were able to eat some strong meat he says glory the strong meat is here for us and the Holy Spirit will feed it to us if we'll only open up and let him do it we have said now to reject the truth when it's presented then your ears are sealed like the all right from the Old Testament that slave does who want to go free he goes that gets down to the altar or go down the temple and he gets that earring in his ear he said you'll turn away from God but be very religious like Simon preached last Sunday night the east gate remember Cain moved to the eastern gate eat the eastern side of the Garden of Eden so eastern gate represents where God's people are but Satan goes there to try to copy God's people he's very religious but man said the scripture said heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God true spray per drape I'm sorry trucebreakers false accusers incontinent despised are good having a form of godliness he said all the forms very fundamental the forms of godliness but denying of from such turn away amen so that my friends is me preaching if someone hears the word and sends willfully there only remains fire and judgment for them and they trodden under foot the Son of God they do despite they do out visit what the Bible says rather than what the Bible says he said that's what we need we need me preaching amen all right hope that was a help by God's grace I got a couple more quotes on this here where brother man talks about texts that are me preaching okay here's another one how many ever heard the message trying to God a service without doing his will brother random said that's me preaching so let me read that to you you ought to be encouraged if you're feasting on that you ought to be encouraged I can eat on the meat of the word because why church because he was a genuine child of God David was but he got too emotional right he got emotional he tried to bring the Word of God to pass without staying with the word and the same thing had happened to us we is so enthusiastic we can get so excited if we're not careful we have to make that to examine everything we do by the Word of God that's me preaching right because what to do it caused a man to die Uzziah it caused Uzziah he reached out and tried to grab a hold of that cart and to study the car and brother branham said he did it with a kind heart he cut he tries to study the cart but because he broke the word God said you can't break my word and the innocent man died right there because a man David didn't examine the word first that's my glad we can look at the word first amen we should hear the preaching first look at the word read the Bible do that first then make your decision after you've made sure everything lines up with the word of God Amen all right now Bourbon says this and trying to got a service November 27th 65 he said David never consulted it in the day I'm sorry Saul never consulted it in his day because saw back slid so they never consulted the Ark at all the Covenant in the days of saw because he backs it and got away from God so David quickly with inspiration I noticed it's a very treacherous text if you don't get it right and I feel that the hour is coming where we should be men instead of babies uh-huh we should have strong meat instead of milk hallelujah praise God we can hear preaching like trying to do God a service which I preached two years ago in 2015 when we can handle strong preaching like that then we know we're feasting on the Word of God so see what we're saying strong preaching is really getting down deeper and seeing who is really obeying and who's not who's examined their lives by the word and who's not living the word I want to be one that examines my life and obeys all the word because that is the meat of the word being able to discern is this the Word of God or is this a false spirit being able to discern that's what we need in this hour the Prophet said all right here's another example brother Brad Marie's Hebrews five about milk and meat and then he says this he I'll quote him exactly this is from Hebrews chapter five and six part one from 1957 he says if you give a baby strong me you kill it that's the reason so many people say I don't believe that and walk away they're still babies they can't they just can't understand they can't grasp the truth that kills them he said great mighty things the church should know today but you can't teach it they they stumble over it they don't know what to do amen hallelujah now let me keep going I think there's a more quote to this he said Paul speaking the Hebrew group he says but the deep spiritual mystery the church is still blinded to it he said when you ought to be teachers you're still a babe and I know now look what he look what he brings us to he brings it to church attendance about being a mature Christian he said oh I know there's many that rise up and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher and brother have said when you get that idea you're just wrong for why did the Holy Spirit set teachers in the church is if he was going to be the teacher see first apostles past prophets pastors evangelists and teachers the Holy Spirit sets in the church so that he can teach through that teacher all right and then he says strong me belong attended a full age he said know what's right and what's wrong by the discernment amen so our Christian discernment remember discernment is being able to judge we must judge is this the right attitude is this the right doctrine is this the right move is this the right approach that's what being a mature Christian is discerning right from wrong hey man hallelujah brother Graham says this now this is my last one he's praying and says Oh our Heavenly Father God there's many wait were children straying from God they've never been able to rise above just a little Church joining somewhere yet they love you now look he compares it to the army we have a veteran brother Adam in here he said in the great army there'll always be a private if they keep the way they are now but they're in the army but oh god what's the reward we want to be majors and Generals he said as Paul said when you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you Father we pray tonight you'll bless each one of them bring them up the ladder just a little higher tonight give them some sort of a new experience tonight that they'll know you've blessed them I like that thought that's a good thought when you say God take me up the ladder give him give me an experience where I can go from being younger in Christ so I can feel like I'm more mature in Christ maybe I feel young in Christ God give me an experience where I can go a little higher I don't want to be a babe I want to be more mature in Christ so the prophets said we don't have to you always don't want to be a private we got to come up the ladder well then what does it take to go up the ladder does it take tests promotions ok fitness I've got to stay spiritually exercise for emotions who promote you is it like the other higher ranks okay I like that amen the Bible said pastors right the presbytery the leaders will lay hands on promote right the presbyterian lay hands and odain gifts and the churches I like that so you got to be faithful you got to work hard amen you got to stay in the faith I like that by God's grace wonderful ok that's the first thought there let me go to the next thought here now I wrote down when I got here I got I got three more or sorry three portions of scripture about the dangers of dull hearing I got three more the first danger of not hearing the Word of God is what we already read in Hebrews five you should have been a teacher you should have been up the road but you're not there that's the first that's the first danger of having a dull hearing and now church that's something you and I that that was something that God would have to show us individually like I should be higher in God but I'm not I don't want to make people feel bad it's between you and God I'm not the one I don't want to feel bad but we have to see God and we have to find out are we where we need to be with God or should we be higher if we feel like God has revealed we should have we should be more than a private we should be more than just this mall rank then we need to go to God and say God forgive me I've been dull of hearing help me to hear the word of God so I can go up the ladder I can go up the ladder I can be more spiritually mature I can go past repentance and laying on of hands and baptism I can go beyond that that's the first danger of not hearing the word the right way is you will not become what God has called you to become okay here's a really good thought let's go to Matthew 13 this is a good thought from the Lord Jesus here about being dull of hearing this is probably one we're most familiar with Matthew 13 15 and this is what I taught at Bible Club on Thursday I said children I said how many ever heard this before like nobody raised their hand out of like 70 or 80 kids no one had heard that God hides himself from the wise and prudent hides I said I told the churn I said you like hide and seek they said yeah I said well guess what God likes hide and seek - he said it is the glory of God to hide something okay God loves to hide because he wants to see who's gonna come find me I think there's a story about that a person a child who went playing hide and seek and they got sad because nobody came looking for him would that be so sad well that's how God is God's like come seek me in my word and all these churches just go to church and they don't and they don't go home and study they don't go home and pray and gods like come come find me I'm in the secret place I'm in the closet I'm in the secret place but they don't go and find God my striking thought so I know that I know that the children got a good new lesson on Thursday because I preach that and they never heard that before that God loves to play hide and seek and the reason he does ads because the people or the RAM says he says it right here he actually used this word they're not interested enough in God see they're so interested in other things like I said we can name a million worldly things they're interested in other things rather than God's Word this is the reason Matthew 13 15 remember this was prophesied in verse 14 it says that Isaiah prophesied of this condition dull of hearing that they're just slow to actually hear what the preachers saying or the or the Bible verse 15 for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing slow of hearing and they have eyes I'm sorry and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them Wow do you see what goes along look at the benefits this is powerful look at the benefits that go along with being able to hear the word of God did you get that if you can actually hear the word of God look at the benefits you understand the Word of God in your heart you get converted and you get healed amen so see the Pharisees never had this they never could be understanding the word they couldn't be healed and they couldn't be converted because their ears were dull of hearing they just didn't want to understand they just they wanted their denomination more and they don't want to apply that preached in their lives they'd rather have their money system and they'd rather have their support systems and they just want to keep their tradition going but I say God break up any tradition we have and let's get back to the Holy Ghost amen whooping - that we're all open to that look how faithful you all to come tonight we all want the power the Holy Ghost we want Jesus Christ to move that's why we're here tonight amen we don't have we don't have this attitude like I said I'm willing to be voted out I think I'm gonna be voted in again but I'm willing to get voted out just so we can have the truth I'm because we want to we want the truth of God and we want to be right with God that's how sincere we should be God destroy our tradition destroy our thinking give us clean hearts purify us right convert us heal us we just want ears that can hear the word of God no holds barred we say used to say that in the world no holds barred you know just just enough no rules that we don't want any rules of our own we just want God's Word amen I think I think you understand that we should be dead verse 15 now look what program says about this and this is why actually let's read verse 10 and the Sipos came and said why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said and then because it is given to you to know the mysteries the king of heaven but to them it is not given they asked Jesus why are you speaking in parables and he said because it's for you to understand and to them it's not given now look how brother branham explains us like I said earlier he said it's because he used parables because they're plain simple lessons and the people would lose their interest can you imagine that brother Adam sister sisters can you imagine that God knew they wouldn't be interested so God is this you simple common parables to bore them okay this is God's this is God hiding himself God's foreknowledge knowing they're really not that interested in the gospel so I'm just going to give them simple parables so they just so they won't hear this is God's character the co-brother mem says this isn't here you him 1957 God's wrote it in riddles and parables so that he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babes such as would learn Jesus thank the Father for doing that is that right that's what I showed the children the Bible said Jesus rejoiced and said thank you God that you hid this from the wise and prudent Jesus sad for those can I say like this he wasn't sad for those serpentine in one way do you understand what I'm saying like yes God wants all people to be safe but another way Jesus is like yes Lord you've hid it from them and you're only giving it to those who really can become humble like children amen so you got to see both sides of the slice like we said earlier he rejoiced in it you know but then he wants all to be same width of both sides of the slice and then he says this because you don't know God like reading a newspaper it's a spiritual revelation now here's where that word interest comes in and it's revealed to them who are interested in learning it so see that proves the Pharisees and Sadducees and all these sinners they were not really interested in the Word of God so Jesus told them parables simple stories just common everyday stories right here's another quote to back this up brother Branham said he purposely told parables to confuse them that's what the brother man said Jesus told parables to confuse the wise in other words the haughty and the self-righteous and we don't want to be self-righteous he purposely confused them Church listen what he said but we want to take a new route on this tonight another way around because every word of God dovetails together there's no contradiction in God's word I'd like to see the scripture that contradicts itself that cannot be straightened by the same scripture it is written surely in parables because it's purposely did that way to confuse the wise and the prudent that God might reveal it to babes such as would learned everybody understand that God told parables on purpose to confuse the wise and the prudent and I said this a few weeks ago but I want you to think about this again brother Branham said if Jesus was here today he would still preach baptize them in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost I have to find that quote for you brother Branham said that why would he why would he do that he did that because he's hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent he's purposely laying out there to confuse him because what's behind what's the real motive behind these serpent seeds heart it's self gratification it's lust it's selfishness I know that's kind of hard for our minds that's the real motivation behind it let me give an example I can go on Facebook on any time there's a high state football game and all these preachers and church members are on their faces painted jerseys on beers in their hand and they all as far as many as I know all of them they've all been baptized Father Son Holy Ghost and you see that can everybody see that that Jesus laid it out there on purpose and they're Lutheran there you name it they're independent you know they're they're Baptists I can show you all my friends like this and when if they're brought to the Lord Jesus Christ how many would come to that baptism how many would forsake their fathers and only goes you see Satan hides behind that father son Holy Ghost so they can live selfish lives so they can live worldly lives are you with me tonight by God's grace you see that that's the mystery behind this Jesus said it on purpose to see because they he knew they weren't really interested so he speaks in a parable he speaks in plain speech and then he even speaks in ways that might confuse because he knows the wise and the prudent the prideful they don't really want the truth they just want to be able to have religion like Cain Cain had religion but he rejected the revelation he rejected the blood he rejected the Holy Ghost but I said Holy Ghost fall fresh on me amen followed them I saw my spirit my body taken full control me lever every fiber of my being be dedicated to the Holy Ghost amen you see this this is striking to me he did it on purpose to confuse them see this is the side of God's love that is the sovereign part of God's love where God knows who's gonna choose it and who's not he already knows so because of that he purposely confuses the Pharisees today he purposely confuses denominations and even message church members but everybody that's really in the message is born-again now because the message is Christ I'm just saying people go to message churches that are not really out there to serve God they just want to have religion but they still want to remain in sin and Jesus said they're dull of hearing so I'm gonna tell them simple parables they'll confuse them that's striking to me let's go to John chapter 8 I want to make sure I hit this Scripture if you never heard this one where Jesus says you cannot hear my word it just kind of came to me it's not even in my notes yeah John 8:43 okay yeah let's go to verse 842 John 8:42 jesus said to them if God we're your father you would love me that's why I say they your father you'll love the preaching of the message for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me now verse 43 why do you not understand my speech they stalking the Pharisees if you read in the earlier chapter even because you cannot hear my word they heard it they they heard the parables they heard the literal words but they didn't obey what he said they had dull ears too slow to believe that remember they wouldn't been better they wouldn't be baptized under the forerunner John they wouldn't even believe Elijah how they gonna believe the God of Elijah right and if we can't believe brother Branham how are we gonna believe Jesus Christ see we got to hear God's prophet first and then we'll receive Jesus Christ because he spoke of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ set this Elijah in this hour amen verse 44 he just lays it out recently I had a youtube person say oh you know your video on makeup is to condemning and Jesus never condemned anybody I said what about John 8:44 he says you are of your father the devil I mean people just they have this love preaching doctrine like love they got to all confuse it's all perversion love is keeping the Word of God and I got this this perverted idea and they're not even hearing with the heart because they're not converted they don't understand and they're not healed so they're not healed from their sins they still have since they never repented in the first place so they'll continue to live in sin he said yer of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh the life speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not see that they couldn't hear heart but they could hear with their ears all the all the work that Jesus said they didn't want to obey it now that's pretty simple but I just want to lay that out there okay so another I just showed you two conditions now two dangers the first danger is you're not a teacher you're not a leader you're not where you should be in Christ the second danger as it says right here you'll you'll miss the plainness of the parables you'll miss the revelation of the mystery that's the danger they're slow of hearing is missing the revelation I think I got two more scriptures you let's go to acts 28 27 here's the next one yeah acts 28 27 so not only does Jesus quote as a ax but now st. Paul quotes Isaiah acts 28 27 we want to have ears that can hear amen we don't want dull ears we want to be able to hear what the Spirit saying amen acts 28 27 but Adam you wanna read that for me sir understand with their heart and should be converted and I Amen oh that's not exactly like what we read in Matthew 13 pause now he's inviting people into his house this is his apartment here in acts 28 he was bringing them in and teaching them anyone that would come here him yeah that was in verse 30 he would dwelt in a house two whole years in a hired house and received all that came so Paul's basically have in house Bible studies but he even as he's doing house Bible studies he's seeing how people are coming in and they're hearing but they don't hear look at verse 28 but be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of God is sent into the Gentiles and they will hear it so Paul's saying Jews can't hear it they rejected it but now the Gentiles are hearing it so there's a third thing the third danger we have to hear the word of God while it's our season to hear the word of God or else we'll be dull of hearing amen now I think I got one more okay you know what brother Graham said is the way to get rid of dull hearing if we feel dull but the bram said is to have a personal experience in prayer that burns out the dullness so let me read you this quote if I can here let me read you this this is from what I'm sorry I got two quotes here let me see oh yeah this is from a personal experience with God 1954 he said what the church needs tonight is to stop studying so much theology and get down to the altar and pray until a personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives you a new vision that's what people don't do enough either of us pray and say God renew my vision help me to see what's really going on in my life how many people do you know that actually do that let me see what what is my life really like what am i producing in my life that's what will bring a person from dullness to real hearing that's what the Prophet says and then he says if you're light you can be like the rod of Aaron's rod that budded every sinner I don't care how dull how black what your life has been in the prints of Jesus Christ you'll live again and blue and bring forth opossums nursed of the Spirit amen hallelujah but Rev says you God you haven't left your people it's your people that's left you we become so dull and sense bound to we count upon our senses for all things so we have to count on the spiritual sense amen the spiritual sense of faith what is they telling me faith tells me God's Word is right now here's the thing Bob Arum said this he said so many things are dulling the senses of people today over in the midst of all that in spite of every dulling and every voices in the world today some of them are pleasure voices some of them are sinful voices to lure the people but in spite of every bit of that the truth of God still remains key that will hear my voice let him come after me and deny himself see brother Branham says it's like voices the way people get dull of hearing as they let too many voices in right they don't hear God's voice you don't hear the voice of the word or the voice of the five foot ministry they hear all these other voices rather than the voice they're supposed to hear amen I got a couple more things here and I'll try to finish up soon I told my wife an hour because I want to wear myself out but I mentioned something remember when I mentioned about brother Ram said he said a log will write rule rot twice as fast in water I remember that quote okay let me read this this is how can I overcome we'll look at a few scriptures now while you're waiting let's go to them back to Matthew 13:20 brother band said this is rodding this is or riding or withering he said our synonymous Matthew 13:20 let's go there okay now Malka you can switch over now I want to I want to show that chart I'd use this chart quite often I want to show this chart of the four kinds of believers here yeah okay so the prophet of God said these are the you have saved and lost you have the believer your three kinds of believers believer make your unbeliever then brother Branham in the church age book says there's another class of believer there's foolish virgin and wise virgin so now you have these four three kinds of leaders in four classes of these fourth four classes all the way down through the Bible and we're looking at this right here the good ground the thority ground the stony ground the wayside groan brother Branham said that the stony ground is the one that had joy for a while but then after a while they withered away because they didn't have the ground they'd have the moisture of the dirt okay so this quote about someone who rots twice as fast brother Branham and the Bible teaches us it has to be this Judas a make believer thank God we're not riding away amen amen thank God we still love the Word of God and we're not riding away and don't see any more fruits and we're going old and angry and everything like that we can be we can be happy we're gonna be full of joy full of peace that's the Christian walk amen the fruits of the spirit but this is what he says here is those that rot now I'm gonna switch back over here these quotes are gonna be super tiny but I just wanted to show you that this isn't how can I overcome so I'm sorry this is just so small I really don't want you have to look at that but it's so small anyways you don't look at it but you probably will because it's hard not to look at it and later to see you had it coming to her now we see then knowing this is the lair of seen age knowing this age needs a sharp rebuke from God and he's a sharper Buch and when our clergy gets so soft and dodi like some age grandfather to his grandchildren every what they do is perfect it's been said so much that God is such a good God until they try to make God just a big dodi grandfather you see he's not he's a father a father right system correction and love is always corrective love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's still corrects a real mother will correct her children a real dad will correct if you just get softened Dodie said I was crossing the old log the other day down a wash or what's called a hollow and I jump on this log on the outside look good look like big old beech log but when I jumped on it Oh a great big chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and OD I said that's the way the Christians are becoming they've been dead and sin and trespasses so long till they become Dodi now how can a Christian be dead in sins and trespasses because they never repented they never got past the dead works right we just saw in Hebrews chapter six he said they how they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means he said I begin to think of this text then overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition see and it made it worse than ever when it late in the branch where the water was and there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian and let the life of God go from him experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such is going on he wrought ins twice as quick right under that condition now what is that that's Matthew 13:20 so let's go there notice the word joy brother Adam says join time so I'm sorry again that's so smart and they have time to really put these quotes on there the joy but they have said they can experience the joy of serving Christ there is the joy of serving Christ but then fall away and rot twice as quick it has to be scriptural right but whatever brother ham says if it's right it has to be in the scripture so Matthew 13:20 but he that received the seed in the stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it but what happens yet hath he no root in himself he dearth but awhile for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended amen now it seems like I miss in the withering part where did I miss that it's verse yeah there it is verse six go back to verse six thirteen six sorry this is the withering part that's why I said withering and rotting is synonymous at least in the scripture that's what brother I was talking about a log that will rot twice as fast just like a plant that will wither twice as fast same thing they both die they both have no life in them amen verse six and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away all right so now we know what this means brother Rams always when we're hearing this about rotting twice as a message church or where the message towers that scripture because that's what happened to Judas can you imagine he was around Jesus my wife and I were talking about this not all the disciples were there from the very beginning of Jesus ministry so not all disciples were with him three and a half years I just learned that today I didn't even know that that's how I looked it up in the scripture it's exactly right so I don't know how long Judas was there but Judas the whole time he was with Jesus he had some good moments old taught in church he was riding away Heidi no because gonna come down to the end he just rotted away and committed suicide like he he sold out the word he had no life in him he didn't he was a log that sat there around the mess of the hour and rotted away until that thief's heart ate him alive it killed the very life of God we said that in Sector when I remember the four insects is that insect this ate away until there was no life and all there was was old death he looked like a strong log on the outside but if he stepped on him he broke in half does every understand that and this is me preaching this is down to the meed amen if you sin willfully after having a knowledge of truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin that's meat preaching so see that ties it with the four kinds of grounds remember I'm said that since it was a stony ground or one that had joy he said that's Catholic or that's the denominational spirit because they say I'm Peter up on this rock I'll build my church brother Adam said the stony represents that denominational idea right that mother harlot anyone who's a joint apart that mother harlot or that mother harlot system has a stony heart because for a while they rejoice in it but then they sell it out for the things of the world so rotten in the scripture cornice quo rotten is the same as wither now here's these last scriptures I want to read and then well I wanted to go a little bit further I really pretty short this morning darkness I really did I'll try to go fast I'll go fast go fast I'll set a timer give me temperament I'll try to shorten it a little bit once I get going I want to finish the thought you know and okay so here's rottenness in the bible i found some good scriptures I know it's so small forgive me mercy proverbs 12 for a virtuous woman is a crowned her husband but she that make of the shame is his rottenness and his bone so a characterless woman think about the church the church is a woman a church without any character of real Bible character is rottenness in the bones of Jesus I say like that right he's just dead to him right it's a dead church so that's why he's on the outside trying to get back in cuz she's dead she's no longer the voice of God she's rotting she has no character propers 14:30 a sound heart is the life of the flesh I'm sorry that's probably close to me I keep bumping it forgive me I just want everybody to hear you know it's whenever to be able to hear so forgive me a sound heart is the life of the flesh but Envy is the rottenness of bones so people that are jealous or people that are Envy the heart condition that envies somebody else they're starting to rot so see every Christian should be so happy for every other Christian I'm so happy for you I'm so happy for it I'm so happy for you I'm so happy we shouldn't Envy each other we should just be happy if there's anything good in my life Jesus put it there anyway had nothing to do with me you can be happy for me I'll be happy for you we should have no Envy no jealousy no bitterness at all because that's rottenness sober man says remember he said some people like Judas they rot around the waters of the life they rot in the fastest because they're right by the message of the hour and this scripture the Jews were despising God's Word so God said you're rotting therefore as fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumed the chaff so their roots shall be as rottenness and their blossoms shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts and despise the word of the Holy One of Israel so people start despising the preaching spies in God's thus saith the Lord the Bible said they're rotting already at the roots they're dying ok now my last thought I want to show this ok I've gone pretty hard on the dullness feel like I had to [Music] yeah yeah here's the closing close of this yeah this is my last thought okay let's go back to Matthew 13 16 I think yeah I think we're ready there yeah I meant through 1360 so right after Jesus says I'm gonna teach parables to purposely he said purposely confused them and he said because they're not interested in other words he's gonna bore them Jesus is gonna tell simple parable stories to bore them because they're really not interested in the gospel and Jesus rejoiced about that he said thank you Lord for hiding it and the eyes that's just striking to me because it's a different side of God that it takes faith to understand because it's sovereign it's just his sovereign just like when Jesus said can you imagine that she said I don't pray for the world does that make you so sad that makes you want to cry but yet he said it because he had foreknowledge of who would be saved and who be lost so Jesus isn't going to cry over tears he's not gonna pray for tears but you and I don't know who the tears are I remember the Bible said God does not even delight in the death of the wicked God doesn't love to see them go to hell but at the same time he's not gonna pray and waste his time praying for tears that he know are never gonna be wheat that's that's me preaching right there let's be preaching huh Matthew 13 16 he said but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear looking for 17 this is what struck me this morning for verily I say to you that many apostles and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them amen now this is my question according to the Thompson chain Jesus spoke Matthew 13 in the second year of his ministry now this makes sense because Jesus telling them your eyes you've heard things that people just wanted to hear you've been around me long enough to hear some of these things and I thought well I need to go through and see what all that Jesus preached leading up to Matthew 13 why did what preaching had they heard that everybody had wanted to hear for all these about 4000 years it's pretty striking so let's do that let me know I'm closing with this I I will close with this cuz I got five minutes perfect in the back of my Bible I have a Thompson shame bag when I first came to message my brother Simon bought me at Thompson chamber who has a who has the Thompson chain bob was anyhow just my wife and I they are tremendous study Bibles if you don't have when they're expensive though you're gonna pay a hundred bucks for what assignment bought me when I first came in the message so I went back and looked at this is called the tree of Jesus life and it just goes through the whole history of his life but just a visual the the thing I want to show you is this this is the key to the tree of Jesus life the first part is about how Christ existed eternally because he was in the mind of God he was God the prophecies of Christ and then it goes to Christ's childhood and then it starts year one of his ministry now here's what I wonder I want to zoom into this so you can see this remember Jesus said he said blessed are your eyes you've seen and heard things that others have desired to see but haven't seen now let's see what they saw what did they hear about Jesus that everybody wanted to hear here's what they heard well first of all they saw water made to wine they miracles that they'd heard about right that they knew the Messiah would do and they got to see things that other people never got to see sorry and then what'd he do he cleaned up the temple this is chronological order of his ministry the first year of his ministry he gets baptized wilderness he testimony about John the Baptist he enrolls he only enrolled five of the disciples in his first year then he made water to wine he had the first Passover he cleansed the temple in the first year and this one like right here this is the preaching that all they wanted to hear the discourse on the new birth remember John chapter three what do they say they say we know your teacher said from God you couldn't do all these things these miracles unless God was with you and what is beginning to do he begins to teach them about the new birth and Colossians 1 said that Christ in you and the hope of glory was hidden God before the foundation of the world aim bless your eyes blessed are your ears for you heard things that people have longed to hear glory next he talks about the waters of life that's in John 4 yeah he talked about the waters with the the Samaritan woman then they have the revival in Samaritan then he heals the no woman's son then John gets in prison then he retires the Galilee then he has a discourse at Nazareth now let me go finishing year 1 and I'm sorry that was your 1 now this is year 2 they've put this in order chronologically and then he gets rejected in Nazareth he removes to Capernaum then he calls for more disciples so he called five disciples then four more in a second year and then he has the draught of fishes the miracle fishes then the demon demon demon iock is healed Domanick I can't I don't how to say that demon Ike then Peters mother-in-law is healed and then the lepers healed and then the paralytic is healed then Matthews called the tax collector is called in the second year of Jesus ministry then he has the second Passover then there's the man heals the pool bethesda then he has the discourse on the divinity of God then he has discourse on the Sabbath then he heals the withered hand of the leper the Pharisees oppose him many are here to Galilee the 12th then he ordains the twelve in the second year and then he preaches the Sermon on the Mount hey man hallelujah where he says you've been told that now shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you even to think about it you've already committed it in your heart this is a very brother brother who said this is where Christ became the law giver the anti-type of Moses amen Moses brought the law but Jesus brought the real law of God this he said blessed are your eyes for you heard me preach on the new birth you've heard me preach the Sermon on the Mount now you know what prayer is now you know how to pray now you know how to give alms amen glory now you know what murder is it's even anger any anger that doesn't have anything to back it up and then he has any reason to be angry said it's the same as murder this is what men had desired to hear for all the ages and he said blessed are your eyes for you see less turn are your ears for you here let's stand to our feet by God's grace I could go on as you see there's a lot of things Jesus did and then were in John it said he did so much that even though all the books of the world couldn't contain it but isn't that beautiful Church don't you love that he said blessed of your eyes for they hear prophets he said righteous men have desired to see the things you've seen all these miracles and here are the things you've heard but he said blessed are yours because you've heard them amen what a blessing we have today to be able to read these words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and there goes my timer praise the Lord all right how many happy bean house of Lord tonight I hope that was a blessing to you the dough of hearing see we are on the other side we have ears that are blessed we've heard the word of God and now we just must keep the Word of God we must not let me come dull to us where we don't understand it anymore where we don't want to act upon it we've got to act upon all the word
