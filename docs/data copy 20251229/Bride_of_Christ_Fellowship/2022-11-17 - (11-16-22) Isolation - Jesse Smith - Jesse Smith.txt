========================================

isolation you know we'll look at Lord willing look at I kind of find three types of isolation in the scripture and uh uh I think we'll look at different ones I think they'll be very familiar you know as we look at them I trust to be a help and a blessing tonight let's read this one on Three this course the sinful one this is when we isolate ourselves you know through sin but let's read this on three one two three through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and inter-metalith with all wisdom of course this is a lustful desire if you look it up in the Hebrew and intermetalith means to fight against so fight against all wisdom like this kind of person you know Church we've all been there right we've all let's all say Amen can we sometimes when we're choosing to be isolated through our own sin the the wisdom is right there in front of us like we know what to do but we fight against it we disobey it anyway right I mean this is clear I think any all of us should be able to relate to this one here we know the right way but we fight again we resist the right way um but thank God there's Grace Hallelujah Luke 5 15 and 16. let's read that Luke 5 15 and 16. I'm going to try to watch the time I've been kind of battling the cold this week 60 kids were out in our school one day you know it's a flu is kind of going around so uh I hope you're eating a lot of vitamin C by God's grace so I've been chugging it this week by God's grace Luke 5 15 and 16. now here's the best kind of isolation praise God when you get along with Jesus Hallelujah of course Jesus models it by going along with the father I'm going to read 15 and then we'll read 16 together but so much the more went there a Fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities let's read this on three one two three and he withdrew himself into the Wilderness and prayed may God as a blessing to read his word you may be seated God bless you it's good to be back with you I surely missed you this weekend and but again thanks for recording that I appreciate that that was really great by the grace of God oh it's okay man that's okay that's all right God knows your heart right if you could stand you would stand God knows your heart appreciate that Chris of course you appreciate that yeah I definitely missed everybody and uh you know but I preached I was there I preached a message called um what was it uh yeah defending the gospel message and just showed how we're defending brother Bam's message and how we have to defend the message Paul defended the message and I showed I showed when you fight against the message you take evil spirits and of course I preached all that here before so like when when when they say oh it's okay to have women preachers they've taken a spirit of Jezebel The Jezebel spirit which is a dominating spirit right when they say uh God's three persons they take an idolatrous Spirit they become idolaters okay when they uh make lies about brother Graham they take a lying Spirit on them so I just showed I just showed seven simple examples Saints these people have seven demons on them if they you know if they that's at least seven demons that's just what they admit right but by God's grace we're free Hallelujah we we can live free he whom Jesus has set free is free indeed I come here tonight I'm free in Jesus name I don't care if there's only two people here if I'm free Hallelujah then I'm happy praise God hallelujah that's what we really need we need freedom in the Holy Spirit praise God so uh yeah I try not to bring anything new when I go to churches you know of course and if I would I'd preach it right here oh yeah I do have some slides here by God's grace so the purpose you know is uh you know after I listen to brother amen's message and then after I was thinking about the number of people I prayed for at other churches I thought well it seems like a lot of people feel isolated and I thought well I can relate to that I mean we all can relate to that you know we feel isolated the enemy isolates us and I thought well I'd like to preach on that and uh it's been a while I think since I preached on it I mean when we preached the Mighty Man series you know I uh I looked at scriptures to help you overcome not feeling alone so that that would be something on the similar line so so four souls not not none in our assembly have recently confessed secret sins now as I shared sexual secret sins okay to me and three of them have reported Victory so I was really happy about that because I told them I said I said if you don't have an accountability partner you need to get an accountability partner I said if you do that on your phone you need to get rid of your phone I don't know they didn't tell me if they did that or not but if they are a slave to those things on the phone they need to be strong enough and get rid of that phone I don't care I need it for my job I need it for my job nonsense you need eternal life or a new job is that right what are you going to do well make an excuse on the day of judgment well lord it's okay I was allowed to do it because I had to have a job no God's Jehovah Jireh if you take a stand God will stand for you praise God hallelujah so I don't know how far they've gone but I know we should go to any lengths to please God how many believe that let's go to Every length we can to please the Lord Jesus Christ and so I felt inspired Again by Brother the amen or other amen had mentioned it kind of and I'll get to it a little bit but he kind of mentioned I think at the beginning of the message where he was saying sometimes we're afraid to uh show our real selves right sometimes we're afraid to let people know how we're doing right or maybe what I should say what we're struggling with right and that's true I mean that's no doubt true um you know some battles lost or some battles last longer than others praise God and you know so when you're going through a longer battle you know sometimes it's helpful to reach out to someone for prayer and I appreciate that testimony brother you know that's what he gave at the end there and I've had to do that too on numerous occasions you know so we'll look into that but that's kind of inspired me inspired me I was like oh that's a great point I like to like look at that a little bit by God's grace um so let's look at how Webster's Dictionary defined isolation I think it's funny you quarantine because of the covet you know quarantine sermon tonight uh it means to set apart from others or to quarantine so and of course we know during during that time I'd heard different preachers preach on the idea of quarantining you know a spiritual um but it's a reality you know like like this year we have you know the the class I have was the first class that didn't have any preschool and so this class is a tough class I'll just say it like that because I know some people may be listening this is a tough class I've never had a class like this in 19 years but see they were separated from learning they were separated from peers how many their parents do you think Faithfully taught them when there was no preschool how many things just sat him in front of uh screens probably a lot and of course I've talked to different people too they've seen it on other levels of Education different teachers I've talked to um that people are just different now they're just different because that two years if people took the wrong Spirit during that time they actually isolated themselves and really it was just really them and Satan right if they isolate themselves from friends and and lost out on a lot of those Ben those beneficial relationships it was just them and the devil and the Devil comes to kill you steal from you and destroy you so some of them went through two years of Destruction and breaking down of any love they felt uh any peace they had any enjoyment in life I mean remember the suicide rates were so high during covet it's because of isolation Satan was isolating them and separating them from others because it's just like it's just like the Bible says the church the body of Christ is a body and everyone needs the other one we all need each other I need you and you need me right as long as this is your home Church you know if it's not your own church then you don't need us right you you need your home Church it's just like a body same thing we see in the natural like everybody needs to belong to something yeah everybody needs to everybody gets inspired through other people but when they're quarantined or separate or isolated Satan just takes from them destroys them he breaks them down Satan's not building them up he's breaking them down Hallelujah but when you say attached to real Christians and positive people and and you know the the word of God you get built up praise God you don't get weaker you get stronger praise God and so isolate means to select from others I like this this is really good here for the spiritual part to separate from another substance has to obtain Pure or in a free state Hallelujah that's a good one that's what I like right there I was reading I'm like I was thinking I was thinking like all these isolation definitions going to be evil evil evil and the second one's good I'm like oh this is beautiful praise God so God like Barbara said God's God's a segregationist right God has to separate true from false amen good from Evil Hallelujah live from truth amen God has to always separate them Hallelujah he's a he's a separator right like oil and water don't mix amen right lies and Truth don't mix God has to separate them God has to isolate one from the other praise God hallelujah and so we see it in the scripture now there's there's likely more okay so it's a you know you know me uh I I I I don't know a whole lot but um I know there's at least three there's probably more than three but we're going to go through these through the order you know um I'm sorry just a little tight first we can be isolated by our own sinful choosing our own sin isolates us from God as far as his anointing his influence we're never forsaken by God sinner or Saint right you know I mean God is merciful God's gracious right but we isolate ourselves when we choose to sin okay like brother amen was saying with afraid right fear is not a good example he's a good example fear isolates people why can't talk to people I gotta I gotta pretend like nothing's wrong okay that's fear it's you it's your own choice to do that you don't have to do that I don't have to do that we don't have to be that way but sometimes we choose that way right and they they start from worse to better by God's grace second we can be uh isolated from God for the purpose of being tested and that's just of course of his influence okay but uh and then like the example we gave with Jesus we can be isolated with God that's the one we want to do by God's grace Hallelujah Now Dave you get this one right all the other ones will be taken care of real quick or you may have like a year-long test like Bernie was saying or or job months long test or other tests can last a long time but if you get this one right you can endure all the others for sure I love this even though God allows at least three kinds of isolation we are never forsaken he said I will never let's all say never ready never that means not once not once will God ever forsake you and say I don't want nothing to do with you I don't care about brother Jesse I don't care about sister so and so or brother so-and-so God will never say that in other words God always cares amen Hallelujah and he's never going to get tired of you another thing about that think about how many times I sin every day every month and God never gets tired of me ah that's Divine love Hallelujah think about all the times we fall short and the mistakes we make and uh our questions our doubts our fears all these things we go through and God never says I've given them enough now we we give up on people but God never gives up on us amen I've given up on people I've told them not to come back to church now just a few I've given up on this right and I was Vindicated you know as time went by because they never came to repent and the Bible says that it's the Bible says separate yourself from them right don't let the leaven and if you let the leaven in eleven's all Church I've given up right now I know in a sense God can give up as if somebody crosses the line of mercy and judgment but the point is the point for the believer is that when you surrender to Jesus he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you because he foreknew you praise God and that's what I'm going to preach on Sunday at the Baptist Church Lord willing thankful to be chosen in Christ so I want to do a Thanksgiving message uh and we're thankful that he chose us in him before the foundation was I want to take the the Baptist people back before the foundation of the world like we get to do so many times right a preacher will say before the foundation days you know when I came in the message that was the loudest thing you shouted on you know but now you know time's going on and we just needs some fresh stuff you know so that I used to always shot on that before the foundation of the Wild um so you know but God he saw us and we can see now now that we're in the truth now that we're in the Bible truth of the message of the hour we can see how God chose us before the foundation world we can see how other people have turned it down but somehow it spoke to our hearts the Bible speaks to our heart and we want to obey all the word of God we can see oh my whole life was set up for this I was born for this I'd walk through snow for this amen hallelujah thank God Amen hallelujah or you're 12 years old uh talking about the Holy Ghost falling on you at your home Church you know and and fasting at 12 years old for the Holy Ghost you know there's something different about us praise God we are different God had everything ordained he and by foreknowledge he knew who would choose him and then because of four knowledge he could predetermine the events of your life so you could travel from Arizona and come to Ohio and hear about Jesus amen amen or for me God could take me away from my family from one side of the state to the other and finally get isolate me oh there it is amen isolate me so I'm away from every influence so now God can influence me and I can get saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost and Pastor our church amen Hallelujah you had to isolate me I was telling that to somebody the other maybe last month or something like that I was like I don't remember who it was now but I was saying I said God had this I feel like Abraham my wife and I feel like Abraham and Sarah God called us away from all of our family I miss my mom I cry when I don't get to be with my mom sometimes you know I miss my brothers but I see why God had to do it God had to separate us so we could serve the Lord praise God so God knows there was some other influence over there or my wife and I we could not have had as much Unity we could not she and I could not have served the Lord as well had we stayed over there so God separate us God isolated us amen so what are we honey we're isolated with God by God's grace Hallelujah now uh by our own sinful choosing at times we choose to isolate ourselves right we call this mind battles right uh what was I made a joke a couple years ago about mine battles oh yeah someone asked you how you're doing I'm just biting the battles brother Jesse you know we kind of know what that means now you know either it's a hard test from the Lord or we put ourselves in isolation right that's good right and so you know in the Hebrew this you know this verse we read this was our text see it's it's a it's a desire when we have a lustful desire and we go after it we separate ourselves we isolate ourself right and we seek and inner mentalism with or we fight against or contend with all wisdom in other words I mean the answer is so clear we can fix this so easily but we just go totally against it because of our own lusts right yeah our own uh like brother Branham even with the critical spirit I always go back to that because you can see it plainly in brother Brown's life all the wisdom of the world would have told him uh not to isolate himself well there it is again I didn't even mean to say that he was going to go isolate himself but standing in the Gap was going to go isolate himself and said if they won't hear my preaching just let him let him have not have no fellowship with me I'll just go up there with my wife and we'll move up in the mountains and when God gives me without saying Lord I'll come Thunder down and I'll give him thou saith the Lord I'll go back up see he was going to isolate himself by his own sin but what did God do God came and rescued himself from himself and in that quote George brother said it was a selfish thing because he wanted to go hunting and the church said selfish see through a desire what through your own desire he wanted to go hunting he was already discouraged the people aren't receiving my message oh but there's going to be some people that would receive his message that's you and me amen hallelujah amen but see it's a lust now even that case a lust after sports right hunting is a sport for the rest of I'm glad God gave me a sport so that's why we can't let football become a idol you know basketball and baseball and softball uh but see though you know when we get in this sinful condition when we're disobeying the word of God I'll say like this we get in the permissive will of God then we'll we'll go to any lengths not to do what's right so we can get our own way right this was I love this word by the University of teaching about that was really good I want to look at this a little more here and so that's where we get and that's what he was mentioning with afraid you know we can't be afraid to be honest okay you can't be afraid to be honest now um isolation has always been Satan's tactic start at the Garden of Eden you know what do you do it seems like Adam wasn't there if Adam was there then that's a big shame on Adam right it doesn't seem like Adam was there um but where was he he should have been there he had dominion over the whole garden right we've recently that's been a fresh thought to me like wow what was he doing um but remember Satan's attack of deception on Eve in Genesis was diminish the vision of God okay your vision of God diminish that well God's not so great anymore this is this might be not so good anymore diminish the Vengeance of God oh God's not you're surely not going to die distort the voice of God did God really say that and then decide to be void of God you can touch it you partake of it it's okay just just totally go against God so see Satan isolates us the same exact way does he not hey brother Jesse said amen same way same way oh it's okay and oh it's okay you to have that you know it's okay just you're tired or whatever struggling you you know you need to you need to do that but what did Satan do he isolated Eve and in that isolation she fell right and then and then Satan isolated Adam right Adam thought forgot about for some reason he forgot about the presence of God he knew God was going to come down and walk with him but you know he knew God was going to come down to Fellowship but he forgot about that and he let himself be isolated you know with his wife away from God so we see that this is Satan's tactic always to isolate people away from the truth or away from God or away from uh the word of God will say like that now you don't have to read all this I just threw all these ideas in here yeah I mean really I want to preach this because the numerous people had come to me and uh they're lusting after other people or phones things on phones and all these things but brother amen to mentioned it's the fear of people thinking less of us but we have to get but yeah but here's what I want to get to but see we're all going to sin but we've got to get rid of our sin in other words like I want to come to church happy every time if I possibly can and the only way I can be happy is either pretend or confess my sins amen hallelujah and if I confess my sin then I know that God forgave me Hallelujah that's why I lay up here many times and try to get right with God and you know I I don't want sin in my life I want to overcome it praise God so we have to pray and ask God to help us to hate this and that's what I was telling the people that were in their secret sins with sexual sin I said you've got to hate this if you hate like I say like if you hate trash stinky trash if you hate the smell of skunks you're going to get away from it if you hate the the presence of sin you're going to get away from it you've got to learn to hate it and see it for what it is now imagine that Satan tricks us into thinking skunk smells good Satan deceives us into thinking sin is good and the church said that's because nothing good dwells in your flesh Hallelujah it's easy to deceive your flesh because nothing good dwells in your flesh and when we get our mind off the word of God and we get our mind away from the soul the nature of the Soul trying to influence us then yeah we can be tempted by things in the mind in the mind and the flesh uh then I said then we can deal with it alone with Jesus now yeah that's what we need to do when we have sins we got to ask God God help me to hate this and then Lord I'm drawing nigh to you and I want you to deal with my sin I want you to forgive me if not church we need to get someone else's help and that's where where they even gave a good testimony that and we all have those testimonies like when I need help I usually go to my best friend my wife that's what I usually do when I need help we get to we have a date every week on Friday Lord willing and uh that's right you just get to talk to my wife I get to talk about all my deepest struggles okay you got to have somebody praise God and then there's certain Brothers I can talk to but amen about you know things I I need help with and pray have him pray for me praise God and different brothers or sisters you're close with different sisters in the Lord you can talk to and confide in and they'll pray for you praise God that's a wonderful thing uh but if we can't overcome it ourselves and we need to get someone's help confess our faults one to another and that may help us Church there is power in telling somebody about a fault there's so much power because now you're not alone praise God you know you don't feel isolated like I'm the only one who knows and I uh in church you know and if you trust that person like brothers saying if you trust them with love you know they're not going to go spread it around because honestly they got the same problems you got Hallelujah Church let's be honest here tonight let's not act like we're holy or something like that like all holy all the time my soul is Holy but my mind and body is not always holy if they're honest they can say yeah brother sister I I can relate to that I've been through that or I know somebody who's been through that now remember Church sin is never good and we can never condone it like if somebody so like when we if we confess our fault to somebody we can't expect them to say oh it's okay that you're what that you're watching porn it's not okay or it's okay uh that you're stealing from the bank it's not okay we're gonna go to jail you can't condone it okay and you know none of us here you know or battle those thank God you know uh but we can definitely support them through our efforts with prayer and help them battle against sin and eventually they will overcome it because they're Overcomers amen that's what Jesus calls to me praise God he's an overcometh praise God he's rewarding us praise God overcome he's to go through a test and then to be the Victor Hallelujah leave some knockout punches Hallelujah like we preached a few weeks ago amen Mighty Men Mighty women need knockout scriptures Hallelujah like get thee behind me Satan amen hallelujah or Jesus forgive me of my sin forgive me in my struggle I'm coming to you help me to hate this get thee behind me Satan in Jesus name so you know that's the beautiful part about marriage it's built in many times that you can talk to someone about your deepest struggles because guess what they see your deepest struggles they wake up next to their deepest struggles right Hallelujah are they going to bed next to their deepest struggles and that's why the Bible says confess your faults before the sun goes down right so we so we don't feel isolated when we go to bed right we don't want to be isolated like the devil's beating us up and you're condemned you're condemned you're condemned um you don't want to go to bed like that you want to go to bed with Grace you want to go to bed you go go to bed with confidence that God's heard your prayer and you know you're forgiven praise God sometimes I got to do that church sometimes I don't feel I don't sometimes I don't even feel what the Bible's saying so I just got to lay open my bible and I just gotta like rub the Bible just that's what it says it says that I am forgiven praise God he his mercies are new every day praise God I mean just gotta like get past the human thoughts and the feelings and just believe and just say I believe what the word of God says hallelujah that's casting down all imaginations Hallelujah now this may be a repeat here yeah sometimes you don't want to be afraid to confess our faults one to another and we should do that if needed now what I mean by that it's not always needed if you're over you're able to overcome your sin alone but we're all going to have ties when we need to share something with somebody else and we don't want to become like Jerusalem because this is what Satan does he isolates us and it's like everywhere you turn you just feel condemnation I feel condemnation I feel a condemnation I'm guilty every time you think you just feel bad all day right all day because you're isolated it seems like you're just surrounded by criticism or sort of surrounded by failures but you're not a failure praise God hallelujah you're more than the Conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah like they say I'm not a victim I'm a Victor Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm not a victim Jesus was the victim so I don't have to be praise God Amen he was the victim so I don't have to be a victim I'm the Overcomer Hallelujah I'm the benefactor I'm the one who benefits from the will of the one who died amen I've got my inheritance him I want to give somebody a high five I got my inheritance Hallelujah come on front row front row sister Hallelujah I've got my inheritance because the the one who made the Covenant died and now I possess all those blessings Hallelujah amen I've got the inheritance every spiritual blessing hope that's okay I'll give you a high five I just thought I needed one praise God Amen that's what the Romans did in 1866 they started uh surrounding but it wasn't until think about this it wasn't until 70 A.D at the time of Passover that they actually completely surrounded Jerusalem and they would not let anybody in or anybody out and that's when they really started starved them out now in 66 A.D they would let people come in but wouldn't tell them they're not letting them out can you imagine that they let people come in with goods and water food but nobody got out starting in 66 A.D so 60 60 70 69 five years but remember every Christian was out of that City by that time hallelujah amen now that was last months it was uh April May June July August those last five months right at Passover maybe March was in there too the last five or six months uh Britannica says Joe Joseph says the Romans encircled the city with the wall to cut off supplies to the city completely and thereby Drive the Jews to starvation doesn't that does that sound familiar Satan makes us feel like we're so hungry for the word of God like we haven't had a good experience with God in so long see what's that caused by isolation right it's been so long since I had a good experience with the lord it's been so long since I really felt close to God why you're isolated right you let yourself Jerusalem let themselves get isolated they didn't have the power to drive the enemy away but that's not in our case we have the power to drive our enemy away we don't have to be surrounded amen it may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by Christ Hallelujah like Elijah said amen we don't have to be surrounded Church by the enemy we can be surrounded by Jesus really we are we're true saints of God hallelujah we'll overcome eventually by the grace of God now look I keep always forget which one it was it's Elisha Elisha proved the Angels were surrounding God's prophets right and Jesus could have called now Jesus was surrounded by the Angels I'm not sure if they were right there or not but he could have called 12 Legions of angels to be surrounded by them in other words he had reinforcements the devil didn't have him the devil didn't have him tied down he tied himself down he was isil he isolated himself away from God so we he didn't so God didn't have to isolate himself away from us he isolated himself from God so we don't have to be isolated from God Amen is that what the Bible said the servant of the man of God was risen early gone forth Behold a host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servants unto him alas my master how should we do does that sound familiar how are we going to make it through 2022. how are we going to make it through this this crisis are we going to make it through coven how are we going to make it sound familiar right how are we gonna make it how am I ever gonna I'll get over this how am I ever gonna get out of this oh my God give us eyes like a prophet amen and he answered fear not ah I love those first words Angel say it uh the prophet says it Jesus says it all these Mighty wonderful Christians all these Messengers from God always begin with don't fear they always begin but stop being afraid Don't Be Afraid God is here hallelujah ah and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see God open our eyes tonight that we can see God open our eyes that we can see the blessing of God in our lives especially since we're coming to Thanksgiving open our eyes that we can see we don't we're not alone we're not we're not forsaken hallelujah we're not lacking really anything Hallelujah God open our eyes to see the spiritual reality that they saw and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain fix your mouth Mountain full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about who Elisha not gehaza Elisha the man of God and doesn't the Bible say God has an angel encamped around those who fear God how many fear God you respect God if you respect God there's an angel around your life there's an angel with me I've never seen him but I know I've been protected from Death a couple times I should have been died numerous times especially car accidents yes sir you can see them on YouTube and everything it's on just something strange will happen and someone will be spared at the very last moment I've seen him and of course I've seen in my life too it's God sending his messenger God has his Angel there the Bible says they're sent to The Heirs of Salvation that means we we will inherit eternal life amen eternal life is ours hallelujah thank God Amen now I thought this before service I thought well these two men Samson and the prodigal they isolated themselves in their sin but notice how merciful god was to them Church Even in our deepest mistakes God is going to come to us God's not going to give up on you when you're struggling I don't care how low you get I don't care if your eyes get poked out I don't care if you're eating pig food like the prodigal if you are God's child God is going to stoop low enough to bring you out of that trial because God is going to bring you out of isolation God knows you're an heir of Salvation God knows your real desire is to serve him so God is going to stoop down and God is going to rescue you praise God because God is rich in Mercy hallelujah amen and he will not forsake his own hallelujah oh thank God if you and I won't forsake our own our own children our own nieces and nephews how much more will God not forsake his children praise God Glory so see Church Even in our own sinful isolation it ain't always a bad thing because that might be the place where you hit rock bottom and you turn back to God oh glory amen that's where brother Hammond is in his uh again into standing in the Gap servant he hit rock bottom I'm leaving now and who came to him the angel Lord came to him he said do that and your wife will leave you if you move up in the mountains your wife will leave You Who Came see it's not always a bad thing because we're all human we all got to be tested with these trials we all got to go through the fires amen but the fires will refine you the fires will isolate you from your human sinful nature and the fires will reveal what you're really made out of Amen now you know we're made of silver and we're not made of silver we're made of gold Hallelujah the most valuable metal the most valuable thing the most valuable substance in in all of all of the universe is the spirit of God that's all you're made out of Amen that's that's what the Bible says I was chosen in Christ praise God the seed of God in Me cannot sin it cannot sin the seeds of God the gold of God in you it's deity it cannot sin that's the real you praise God Glory like I said if time goes on Jesse Smith's body will stay here but that's not the real Jesse Smith the real Jesse Smith is the spirit of God the spirit of God In My Soul praise God that's the real one that's the real you see you get to be on speaking terms when you get to that lower spot then you start talking to Jesus before just talking about your sins and your desires your lusts right talking about all that I don't have to do the wise thing I want to do I want to do my thing and yet Jesus Stoops to our lowest State when we choose the wrong path Jesus comes gets us out of the wrong path and brings us to the right path that's Mercy praise God that's Mercy that's what his Mercy did for me yeah sorry I kind of already said these things that's actually just a repeat so that's that we gave you the imagery of The Siege That's what Satan likes to do he likes to call all of his resources right social media he'll call that he'll isolate you on social media you'll get text messages right you'll get bombarded with text messages evil ones I'm talking about you'll hear the Evil news right yo uh somebody mistreats you in the home somebody mistreat you on the job somebody misreach on school it's bombarded by all this all this negativity you bombarded and he isolates you and makes you feel like well I'm the only one going through this or I'm the only one that has struggles uh take a number or get behind me because I've got struggles too praise God get in the line amen well well so we all got to go talk to Jesus amen and we all got to work it out Hallelujah you're not the only one I'm not the only one the Saints down Through the Ages have overcome difficult trials we can overcome labor to see if we can do it because greater is he that's in you than he that's in later to say Amen Glory now this is the next kind sometimes God isolates us from that anointing in other words we don't feel God so much sometimes we feel god brother Chris and I'll shout and dance and scream I'll cry I'll sing Hallelujah I'll sing all the way home I'll sing it sing at home I'll dance I was dancing at home on Monday praise God I was dancing singing and worshiping on Monday I love to dance for Jesus but that's when I feel it praise God I don't always feel it though sometimes I don't feel like dancing somebody sometimes you don't feel like shouting yet if he isolates us from that anointing the feeling of it he still never forsakes us like here's four examples I don't I I'm not I'm sorry I did not get to the job when I just got to some of these remember in the business of the ambassadors of the prince of Babylon Hezekiah God left him look at that let's say God left him ready God left him God left him to try him now did God ever forsake Him no God's never forsaken anybody except Jesus forsaken is to leave and not care about like if you forsake your trash you leave in the trash can just leave it there so God never forgets about us God never has evil intentions for us right so like when you forsake some trash you don't want any more I don't want I have I just want that to go to the landfill you know you forsake it but if something's important to you like you might leave your phone somewhere well you're not going to forsake it well I don't need it you're going to go back and get it that's how it is with God Amen Hallelujah you know that's how it is with God you know God he now God though he leaves us though to test us how are we going to react because it's always going to be a lesson that where we can learn something out of that when God withdraws all the feelings and all the thoughts and all the anointing when God draws all that away then we're kind of left to ourselves and oh what have we learned uh what how are we going to react when we don't feel good how are we going to react when we don't feel like singing We don't feel like going to church we don't feel like singing We don't feel like clapping how are we going to react right and then that then that that is God showing us what's in our hearts right just like he did it that he might know oh that was it has a guy's heart amen see so God will withdraw he'll withdraw dreams we talked about that no more dreams or or no more uh no more inspiration like even for a preacher there will be times it's really hard for me to find inspiration like I don't even know what to preach I got inspiration today uh sometimes they'll withdraw you don't feel that but it reveals now what is in my heart what's left when I don't feel God what's left in my thoughts what's left in my habits what's left in my my mind what is left because I don't have that strong anointing on me you know that that excitement or that that the Zeal that sincerity now I'm just kind of left what's left in me that's what you find out and we all go through it every single one of us goes through it sometimes we do it to ourselves like we said uh I remember the one of brother Brandon where brother Adam said Lord you owe me understanding why you took that young woman's life after you saved her from drowning for two weeks brother said the sheet came down and he didn't hear from God so God was testing him but it showed brother random what was in his heart what was in his heart I'm sorry Lord I got prideful see your trials show you what's in your heart okay in other words Lord come back lord if you forgive me send back the Holy Spirit two weeks later God Did You Know see you get a Revival amen hallelujah all those six six types of revivals see God leaves those feelings God takes away the feelings and all the inspiration and all these things and you're just left with you and what what are you gonna do what are you going to yield to the holy spirit in your mind now he never leaves your soul if you're born again but the Mind goes back and the flesh just goes back to not having all that all that anointing on you that's what the Bible says to show you what is in your mind right what is in your emotions what is there left that needs to come out glory amen thank God Hallelujah David said my God my God why is Thou forsaken me now he thought he was but actually David was never forsaken he was actually speaking this of Christ why art thou so far from helping me anybody anybody ever felt like that you know for Asian I'll raise my hands up I'm like God how come you haven't helped me I feel like my help is so far away and from the words of my roaring I'm roaring God my my prayers are so loud it's like a roar where are you oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not in the night season and I'm not silent I'm crying I'm praying all the time I'm asking God about this service after service week after week where are you God hallelujah amen see we all have to go through that we all got to be tested to see what's really in our heart are the good things in our heart have we have we had enough character to trust God in the midst of the trials or we just serve God because it's easy because I got feelings for God what happens when you don't have feelings well I realize I got a growing God I got to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord boy time's fine Jeremiah this is what I preached on years ago Jeremiah said that he's alone and look he's alone and In Perpetual pain now that's a different thing you can be alone and not in so much pain but when you're alone and in pain that's the worst what's worse than that what could be worse than that I'm alone I have nobody and I'm also in pain what can be worse than that nothing okay I'm in a loan and all I have is hurt and pain and bitterness and and guilt and shame and and selflessness and worry and fret and fear that's all I have Jeremiah said I sat not in the Assembly of the mockers nor Rejoice I sat alone because of thy hand for thou has fill me with Indian Nation now look he's accusing God you fill me with Indian Nation well actually that was a good thing because it was righteous in the nation against the Sinners that was a good one but he says later he actually accuses God of deceiving him but look he sit alone Jeremiah is all alone because God moved him off how'd you like that how'd you like that you're all you're all in a comfortable place but God moves you across said no no you got to come over all alone I want you all over alone all by yourself it was God's hand that did that God said well I want to I want to pull my servant aside and I want to test him a little bit all by himself or all by herself now church we got to be careful when we're all alone say oh it's sister's fault it's brother's fault or if only it was it might not be any of their fault it might be God doing it Hallelujah come on Church it might be God doing it we can't blame other people well if only they would call me or if only they would text me why don't you text them maybe God's holding it back praise God did this God's hand moved him all by himself I sat alone I sat alone in church I said hello to my car I sat alone at work I sat alone because God had me sitting by myself that's how does it work I'm like the only male teacher there I always sit all by myself usually now sometimes some of those teachers have mercy on me they'll come sit by me you know I'm not a very friendly I'm not a very sociable person I should say like I'm friendly but I'm not sociable but but in the natural I sit alone all the time at work you know at the at the meetings sometimes it's embarrassing but I thought well at least Jesus said with me by God's grace I'm glad not to be friends of Sinners you know like I say like that he says why is my pain unending how come this pain never leaves me that's what a prophet said and my wound uncurable I feel like I can never get over this I'm all alone and I feel like this is a never-ending pain which refuses to be healed I can't get healed I just can't find the victory will thou be all together unto me as a liar and as Waters that fail now look Jeremiah's saying God you're like a liar to me look at that see church sometimes will say things we'll say things in such ignorance against God we will say such foolish things I'm guilty sometimes I've said foolish things to God and yet does God forgive us Church does God give us one more chance there's always another chance thank God there is always another chance there's always another chance I feel like God's lying to me I feel like God don't keep his word nope God does keep his word you just need to be alone for a while right God just wants us alone for a little bit for even thy Brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously against thee so his mom and Dad and brothers and sisters have all mistreated Jeremiah they've called a multitude after me not only that but they've sent people after me believe them not though they speak Fair words unto thee now look oh Lord thou has to see me and I was deceived as God deceive people Jeremiah thinks he does everybody thinks God deceived him as a prophet see here sometimes will say things it's not right how many believe God is gracious though but I like this though he says stronger than I that's prevailed I'm in derision daily everyone mocketh me doesn't sound like a very fun a fun experience to be a prophet you know church we all thank God we're not Prophets look what they've done to brother random right for since I spake I cried out I cried violence and spoil because the word Lord was made or approach unto me and a derision daily then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay praise God in other words he finally makes a decision I'm not preaching anymore I'm not testifying I'm not seen anymore but then all of a sudden the fire of God comes in and said okay I got to do it praise God I'm changing my plans amen I just made plans I'm no longer praying I'm no longer singing I'm no longer going to testify but then all of a sudden I just gotta testify hallelujah thank God amen for I heard the defaming of many and fear was on every side look fear he's isolated fears all around me everybody's against me the preachers are against me my dad's against me ever my whole family's against me fears everywhere Reports say they and we will report it all my familiars watch for my halting they couldn't wait perhaps he will be enticed and we'll Prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him I can't wait till he falls I can't wait till she falls that's what he heard all the time oh he's a real Prophet he's a real preacher he's a real Saint she's a real Christian yeah I bet she's a real message believer I can't wait till they fall but the Lord is with me ah as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutor shall stumble and they shall not Prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not Prosper their Everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten but O Lord of hosts that tries the righteous look he says I know what this is I'm going through a test I'm being tried Hallelujah that sees the rains in the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have I opened my cause sing unto the Lord Praise You the Lord for he has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers so he says start he said start testifying start singing Hallelujah start calling on God start asking God to move and just keep connecting to God don't be isolated from God run to God Amen praise God don't talk bad about God praise the Lord amen help me Jesus amen this sermon's for me too Church I need the sermon now look now what's interesting look at the next verse so let's see verse 13 now look at the next verse Jeremiah was going through some really bad roller coasters he just got done saying God's deceived me ah God's like a liar to me then he says fires in my bones Hallelujah I'm going to sing all day and the next paragraph is cursed to be the day wherein I was born that's just like job job had highs and lows right you and I got highs and lows maybe that's why we like Cedar Point so much right because that's like a it's an image of Our Lives okay you're missing out brother your whole life is there and I'm just kidding but look he's on the high low here he's in the real depths right now right curse now can you imagine that if I come up here you heard me praying before God I wish I never would have been born cursed a day in November 17th 1980. look that's what he was praying I wish I was I wish that day was curved life is so hard our church this ought to encourages us tonight that life is not so hard at least not yet we don't know what's going to happen this ought to encourage us Lord thank you for your blessings in my life I'm not cursing the day I was born thank you God for giving me a life thank you for giving me an opportunity to serve you thank you for giving me Grace in the land of the living thank you that you're my shepherd and you leave me beside Still Waters and I shall not lack amen the Lord is my shepherd amen I shall not what he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures he leads me by Still Waters he restores my my soul praise God aren't you glad he restores the church gives you a fresh start makes you feel life is worth living again because he lives let not the day where my mother bear me be blessed curse me the man who brought Tidings to my father saying a man child is born into the making him very glad he's he's wishing he was cursed right and then of course that's where I stopped it but I just want to show you that roller coaster ride you'll never think the same about Cedar Point will you Lydia now here's where we here's where we have to be church and I find this when I'm doing this I can get through my trials so much better when I choose to isolate and get along with God that's when I find the greatest victories now what happened church is people stop isolating with God at home and then they stop coming to church right that's usually what happens so Chris just so you know what we're we're worshiping here tonight this is not a show this is how we live at home right we don't act one way at church and act one way home we live the same way now you're going to see me make more mistakes at home for sure because you're you're there the whole time with me you know you see my ups and downs but it's a it's it's a it's a daily walk with God and I'm trying to bring this down to closer try to bring this down we want to be isolated with God because that's what Jesus did he isolated himself from others in order to pray he isolated himself to the father like our text said he purposely isolated himself to go pray he withdrew himself into the Wilderness and prayed I've got to leave I have to leave the bright lights of the city I gotta leave the noise of the crowd and I got to have some time in nature that's what Jesus said someone don't have the benefit of that but if you are struggling that'd be a good choice for you praise God Hallelujah I mean all those brothers that hunt you know I don't I don't like hunting but all of them say they just enjoy that time out in nature now that's fine as long as they're having communion with God I think that's a good thing I am kind of a little envious of that I'll admit you know I just don't see you when am I going to do that in the summertime I could do it but you really can't hunt in summer praise God so it just doesn't make any sense to me but the idea is leaving everything that's uh stressful and going to a place of peace now brother Adam gives this quote brother Ram uh God had to tell brother Branham in 1960. now I'm gonna I'm gonna skip down here program had a fever and missed some meetings and he was asking God about it and he said there he stood talking to me and Jesus said well you walk with two men he said to walk with me you'll walk alone he said I'd seen that so program had noticed this in his life and what was he doing he was catering to denominations to everything see somebody trying to tell you what to do and what not to do he says you've got to follow him so in this stage of his life brother Adam says I'm following too much denominational thoughts they're telling me what to do instead of me seeking God on what to do this is right before the church ages man right before the election of 60 where gfk got elected so what I'm trying to say is we don't cater denominations now I'm going there to witness on Sunday but I'm not going to cater to them and preach their Baptist message I'm going to preach the real message amen I'm going to lay in there you know with love of God you know I'm not going to compromise on what I believe but I was trying to bring it in a way that's wise as a serpent like that's what William told me last time he said he said there was such a wonderful message he said that was wise as a serpent harmless as a dove I said well thank you brother William I appreciate that Hallelujah and then they you know they texted me afterwards said it was such a wonderful time in the Lord and everything all the fellowship all the saints but I just want you to know brother Ram did not always like confrontation we don't have to like confrontation because brother Branham said this he said pray for me I'll pray for you together we might stand may God help us help us may there not be one of you here that'll ever fail and miss that great time coming speaking of the Rapture and future home and everything now I've been accused of a lot of things friends and a lot of things I'm guilty of now look at that I'm neglectful that's true I don't know why it is but somebody has to push me in the corner to make me fight I don't know that's a nature I've done things that I should not have done not willfully but I plundered at it and that's what's made me so afraid and seeing this and seeing in this this day that the day we're living at and you see now what I believe I want to hear from God if all possible before I make a move see because I don't want to fail him I want to be with him everywhere I want you to pray for me I just want you to see brother Adams I love Brothers humility right he says I'm guilty of not a few things church he said I'm guilty of a lot of things now if you're honest you would probably say Amen I'm guilty of a lot of things right I would say brother Jesse uh brother Jesse's guilty of a lot of things and let's be let's just let's be honest with it and we don't have to go brag on the devil we don't ever want to brag on the devil and tell people all of our faults but let's just be humble like that guy Giant Eagle eyewitness to all the time he's Catholic you know and he uh we were talking about things and I was talking about praying for people and he's like there's just a Halo up there on your head and I'm like no I said no I said and I said I almost started crying I said I sin every single day see people try to exalt us you know they only see the good side they don't see my bad side I said Jesus died you forgive me of all my sins I am nothing if you look at me you'll be disappointed if I'm your example you'll be disappointed Jesus Christ has to be your example don't follow me follow Christ praise God follow the Christ that I'm preaching yes yes but don't follow if you just follow me you'll be disappointed because I I'm neglectful there's things I'm guilty of right and I like what you'll notice this you know brother Ram says he brother Adam did not like confrontation all the time he did not like that he he would just and he says it in other sermons too uh he's just trying to make everybody happy right he was just trying to make the denominational people happy he's just trying his best so that's why you'll see in his sermons you'll see before God gives him certain Revelations he would be really kind and not bring up things he would not preach maybe harsh as he does other places because he didn't like that it wasn't in his it wasn't in his nature to want to just ball people out like he preached at the Four Square Church in California whose founder was a double married woman and brother man never bought out the woman Amy simple McPherson but Ram called her a gallant Soul she was married twice the program preached in her church after she died see what's he saying he said I'm not that type of person right I'm human how many how many humans we got in here today okay no hybrids in here okay thank God no AI people in here artificial intelligence clones in here laughs I just love this about brother random he was so humble he was so honest and so that should encourage us to be honest we're going to make mistakes there's things I'm neglectful about there's things you and I neglect we all neglect things we know how many know that you should probably take care of things but you just don't get around to it all the time yeah like cleaning my room my closet that's just and that those are the natural things what about the spiritual things which are actually more important I should have taken care of this I should have prayed about that I should have talked to that person instead of being isolated now Burlington preached on love I thought it was beautiful I thought wow listen brother even I'm like that's to hold the gospel right the end of every commandment you know we you know like we tell don't smoke and don't drink and don't women don't cut your hair men don't grow don't grow your hair out long men don't wear earrings the end of all this is what love out of a pure heart that's why we preach all these commandments so that we will love God with a pure heart and a good conscience and Faith that's real faith I can really have confidence in Christ because I'm not pretending I'm really living for Jesus with all my heart I'm really doing it with all my heart surrendering everything asking God to forgive me cleaning up my life as often as I possibly can this is that same new creature I'm going to read this if you got your Bible go to Galatians 6. that's right oh got that up there I ended a sermon with this a couple of weeks ago I think verse 15. Galatians 6 15. for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature so I ended with that the only thing that prevails in heaven is someone who becomes a new creature and church the beautiful part is we can be new every day I could have a new like like every time I leave the church I come back I always think oh here's a fresh start I can be a new preacher glory amen hallelujah I can be a new preacher today praise God I could not put people to sleep foreign and for me I can be more positive you know I can be I can be more patient I can be Stern when I need to be but I can be more patient more loving I can be more like this I can be more sincere I can be more sincere or I really care about everybody I don't lose that that sincerity the people don't become you don't become common to me where I I preached to them before I don't really care what I really want to care I really so I'm going to be a new creature in Christ Jesus well that's the same thing as this the end of everything the whole purpose of everything is so you can have the love of Jesus with a pure heart and every day we can have that how many believe we can have it every day you can have a pure heart every single day but we have to remain connected to the body of Christ we can't be disconnected or isolated from the body of Christ we're not going to read all these but God set the members every one of them in his body as it pleased him so we'll just use brother amen and myself God gave brother amen he's the part of the body that sings he's the tongue maybe or the vocal cords right I'm the preacher or whatever the part of that is you know I don't know is there all kind of Parts together but each one of you sisters is an important part of the body of Christ and we need everyone and God placed you and gave you those gifts because that's what he wanted you to be because he he thought oh Lydia in this way I make her with these gifts Malachi with these gifts maybe he's the hands huh piano that's that's going to please me because that's what I want him to be and he'll do that part the best that he possibly can if we were all song leaders or preachers where was the body be if we're all imagine if we're all preachers here we'd be all critic like as a preacher I'm constantly criticizing is that right you sure what about this what about that now I try to enter in as much as much as I can but if I'm really Loretta said a pre uh Pastor is supposed to be a suspicious person brother Brown said now I'm always going to amen the truth but I always got to go listen back to the sermons of the guest preachers and be like was that exactly right and my wife and I talked about was that exactly right I got to be that's good that's what God made me to be I'm supposed to feed you sheep food praise God but now are they many members yet one body so we are one body with many members but we need each other badly praise God now Christian gave me this example I was sharing it at uh Indiana you know it was our precious brother who's coming to preach he was one that was battling with well should I be a preacher can I be a preacher and a deacon and I'd told him I don't know I'll pray about it and that's when I talked to my wife I'm like oh yeah Philip was both a deacon and a preacher I called brother Brian up he was crying rejoicing and then that person that was attacking him stopped attacking him because the Brian had a scripture now the guy that was attacking him eventually died of cancer for attacking other people I don't know it seemed like it was connected I don't know I showed that to you uh maybe last year I think I showed that one of the letters he wrote oh shut off okay go look out there real quick just see if sometimes they steal the catalytic converters right out here the cops they make rounds out here they've told me when we were out there that one time and then people climb on the roof I don't know what they're trying to get on the roof is there gold up there or something is there I don't know Diamonds On The Roof somebody hide their box of diamonds up there I don't know but I just thought it was beautiful how my wife you know was telling me this and I remember her telling me in the van I'm like this such a beautiful example all those years ago you know um okay you know that inspired brother Brian to preach now brother Brian has come numerous times and God has healed people right God's he's blessed people he's spoken to our hearts you know and he spoke some people out of the church which was God removing leaven because they were criticizing me unfairly and they proved it by one of them repenting another one still hasn't but then brother Brian came this time last time and he gave a testimony about him being healed and the Holy Spirit put on my wife's Heart come up for prayer for her knee and brother brother Brian prayed the prayer of faith and then my wife was feeling so much better the next day and then a couple days later it's all gone all gone and so God used my wife to bless him and then God used him to bless my wife that's how it goes amen right God uses me to bless you God used you to bless me we just keep blessing each other over and over again and the church said I thought that's a beautiful example we just bless and encourage one another I'm trying to close I really am I didn't think I'd preached this long so love is the purpose of keeping all the commands already though see now Church the Lord strengthens you when you're isolated with him that's why it's so beautiful to be alone with God I love this Paul said he's he's almost ready to be crucified I'm sorry to be beheaded he said that my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me I pray that God I pray God that it be not laid to their charge but I love this now look at this at this uh at this uh court trial everybody left him all the preachers left him all the Christians he had nobody on his side he said but notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me church when you are all alone and you feel like everybody's deserted you just remind remind yourself that Jesus is with you and Jesus is going to strengthen you Hallelujah you're right keep telling yourself that just like that song says preach it to your soul I'm going to preach to my soul that it's already won praise God sometimes God wants to see God sometimes sometimes God leaves you to see if you'll do that will you preach that word to yourself will you really believe that we can all say we don't always do that but we can all say Amen on Wednesday night and Sunday morning but can we say it on Friday morning that's what that's what we need help that's what I need help with I need it we all need it I love this notwithstanding I was not alone God was with me and God strengthened me through it all and I love this the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and he will preserve me he'll keep me strong unto his Heavenly Kingdom because one day I'm have a seat in it praise God one day you're gonna have inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven he's going to preserve you to make sure it happens even if nobody stands with you he's standing with you to whom be glory forever and ever amen so last thing these are the last few verses here yeah last few last few church this is the whole point of uh Christianity as having daily fellowship with Christ every day Paul said now of course this is the scripture that tells us we must have more church as we see the Rapture approaching amen okay gather together more as you see that day approaching I love our Sunday night services I don't know about you even though we've been doing Sunday school I still love those very much we still get to meditate on the things of God get to encourage the Next Generation you know we're really doing it's really a wonderful work there now think about just thinking about this if a church has a Sunday school those the sisters are teaching them that's good but would you rather have the sisters or the pastor teaching them I just thought I'd get a little better amen than that though I'm just kidding I'm just kidding sisters eat good too don't get wrong but they're not pastors they're not preachers so it works out if nobody feels LED it totally works out that they get that time with the pastor go with me and with all of our adults who give the good insight and the good testimonies and the good scriptures and it just really works out good by God's grace now if you don't think you need this daily fellowship with Jesus and his people then you really don't know what you're up against if you think you can get by without daily talking with Jesus and daily confessing your sins you don't even you don't understand that all of hell is against you I've had people call me up recently about doubting the message and why are all these people around brother Branham such failures because that's where Satan is pointing all his guns you don't got a point at the Roman Catholic Church he's going to attack the people that were closest Martin Luther said I wish ten percent I wish 10 of my Converse were still here I wish 10 percent that's who Satan attacks the most is the people right around the truth so we better make sure we got the seal the Holy Ghost and I'm confident people have it here tonight by God's grace because you're still standing with the saith the Lord praise God the Bible I'm talking about the Bible and the statements wrote around made with thus saith the Lord in the Bible see we're up against the very Gates and councils of hell Satan is very smart he gets more powerful influence every day we will either destroy our enemy or enemy will destroy us somebody's going to die here it ain't gonna be me Hallelujah someone's going to get beaten it ain't going to be me it's gonna be the devil he's going to leave me for a season amen hallelujah praise God Amen he will lead me for a season I'll enjoy the blessings of Victory amen hallelujah I'm going to join the blessings of a battle one because that's what they did the Bible said they they daily stayed in the fellowship with the preachers they broke bread they prayed they went from house to house breaking bread and they ate their meat with gladness and singing this out we're gonna have that next week at our house you're welcome to come to our house and let's break some bread amen let's have some fellowship praise God Hallelujah they praise God had favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved see our weekly meetings are meant to stimulate every day fellowship with Christ Wednesday and Sunday is to encourage you to have time with God on Thursday Friday Saturday Tuesday and Monday praise God like ain't that great to be a Christian every day of the week the Bible said take heed church we are going to get evil Hearts unless we build each other up every day and you and you you've got to build yourself up every day every day we've got to build ourselves up or else our hearts are going to get hardened in other words every day water the seed water the seed if not it's going to dry out and get hard you that's what the Bible says exhort one another while it's called today you will partake of Christ if you hold the beginning of your confidence steadfast into the end see while it's today hear his voice have you heard God's voice today yes because you heard the word of God but see every day that's why I can put a good sermon on from Brother Brooks right I can put amen sermon on now Hallelujah and you can hear the voice of God speak to you when it comes to the word of God that's exactly right now I put this on here I thought about this I could send everybody a daily video every morning because we have group text right and that'd be encouraging for a while but there's going to be a day where you forget to check that check that text and there might be two days in a row or three days or four days when you don't watch my video now I could do that right I could do that so what do you need you need a you need to feel the pull of the Holy Spirit every single day drawing you into Fellowship you need to build that expectation that relationship with Christ where every day you want to feel his presence now what does the word exhort mean I'm closing musicians can come exhort one another daily encourage strengthen receive strength be comforted let's stand our feet yeah sorry to instruct and teach so every day we should instruct receive instruction and teaching from the Lord every single day and encourage one another as well when we can now if you if enough of you want it I'll do some daily text if you want to do that I went 177 days straight on Facebook posting I kept count I just saw the reminder the other day and I'm like okay I don't see much fruit to this so I'm going to stop oh and then they kick Trump off of Facebook so I got off of Facebook because I just want to make a stand against it now they're going down you see that that's good that's good so we had we had a little bit of impact on that by God's grace I still don't think Trump is safe I don't think Trump is a Christian I'm just making the point but the Bible says we should daily strengthen one another daily exhort one another in other words receive strength from somebody and of course receive strength from Jesus how many want Jesus's strength praise God how many want to be isolated with Christ amen now we're all going to go through the other isolations but how many want to be isolated with Jesus praise God that's our desire let's bow our heads here for a moment how many enjoyed the word of God tonight praise God I like preaching to you all more than anybody else thank

still love me are right here in this church today you see my good side you see my bad side the body of Christ that God's called me to is right here today Church before we pray if you're if you've isolated yourself in sin just ask God to forgive you and say God help me to hate this sin like that scripture says I'm just rejecting all the ways the wisdom of God I know the wisdom of God I'm just fighting against him may God help you foreign God's help some of you might feel like God has left you and you feel like you're being tested the thing to do like Jeremiah said is praise the Lord praise God when you know he's testing that no evil thought come out of your mouth and if you're not one of those then you're in that real sacred Place praise God versus you and Jesus that's what we want to be at as much as possible praise God there's going to be times where it feels like Where's God I've cried all day I've cried all night Where's God he's just testing you not Church which one are you in

isolations Dear God thank you Lord if we're in a sinful isolation God may you help us tonight Lord the to confess our sins may we learn to hate it whether it's pornography whether it's fear whether
