========================================

continue on this series I might finish it tonight we never know Colossians chapter 3 verse 20 is where we're going to pick up there by God's grace Colossians chapter 3 verse 20. I'm constantly torn I'd like to finish some series but I want to preach on some new thoughts and so I'm constantly torn and just got to pray and wait on God ask God to minister to us so trust the Lord I'll speak to you tonight by the grace of the Lord there's something to be said Church Justice goings slowly through the scripture wouldn't you say Amen to that there's something about that you know most sermons are not like that we're on the message in other places and just just so beautiful just go scripture by scripture and see what the holy spirit is saying to the church praise God oh it's a beautiful blessing and we're so thankful for God's love and it's God's grace Colossians chapter 3 verse 20. uh we'll just read 20 and 21 by God's grace and imagine we'll get down through into chapter four as well by the grace of God here tonight but I'd like to look at this here tonight Colossians 3 verse 20. let's all read 20 and 21 ready one two three children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged praise God let's have one more word of prayer if you know your heart let's make it on to God here tonight surely God sees all things God is so mindful God is so caring praise God we're in his family father God we just bow our hearts to you today God you saw the hands that were raised Lord I pray you'd speak to each and every need Lord God you saw the need behind that hand father we come here as a as an act of Lord worship father God pure religion the Bible says Lord is what we're seeking after here tonight God we're not gathered here in vain but we're gathered in confidence in the name of Jesus Christ and the power of Jesus Christ and the love of Jesus Christ and Lord you've given us the faith of Jesus Christ the lord I pray God you speak to us here tonight father God and let your word have preeminence Lord God I just love these moments of going through your scriptures Lord just reading them verse after verse and looking for the inspiration of the holy spirit so God we look for that tonight God I pray you ministered each and every need bless your people tonight those physical and those streaming Lord I think of brother Vang working tonight and sister Sia and I think brother amen Lord God brother Jose Lord I pray God you minister to all those Saints Lord God we love them God and we just pray your spirit could encourage them tonight Lord God just do something Lord wonderful them on the job Lord or at home wherever they are Lord Jesus I pray you God you'd meet their needs as well as ours here God will be grateful to leave this place and worship you and love you and we'll give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God all right praise the Lord so I don't have any slides here tonight just didn't have time I was going a different direction and I thought I kind of felt led to go back this direction so we'll preach out here by the grace of the Lord Colossians chapter 3 we're finishing up the chapter here we're coming down to this section and we looked at family last time and we're looking at here Christianity in the home praise God we want to look at that here tonight and then go down into chapter four we looked at chapters one and two and we've seen Paul's inspiration from the Holy Spirit he greeted the Saints in chapter one he prayed for the Saints this beautiful prayer say my same prayer I prayed for the Amish community we saw the Supreme deed of Jesus Christ in chapter one The Power of Jesus's cross in chapter one The Mystery of Christ in us the hope of glory at the end of chapter one praise God then in chapter two we saw the treasures all the treasures are in the mystery of the godhead in other words all the treasures in the Holy Spirit in Christ Jesus the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily like you've heard it said Jesus wasn't in the godhead the godhead was in him right trinitarian say Jesus is one member in the godhead but the godhead was in Jesus Hallelujah and then we saw how the Colossians would have to have to overcome enticing words that's very similar to what we're going through today we're not battling swords or and guns are not being you know jammed into our necks and making us try to recant Christianity but it's enticing words it's words that our friends and loved ones and hopefully not church members but sometimes people outside the faith will try to whisper things and and talk to us and deceive us and and uh and we've got to weigh all those words by the word of God and uh I just thought maybe I'd share a personal experience but maybe I'll say that for later uh after that after the enticing words you know they had to overcome philosophies and then Jewish legalism and that's things that we can relate to around the message you know some people are legalistic about things and if they don't if other churches don't do it their way they're not saved or they're not really messy Believers and we've got to constantly contend with that praise God we have enticing words Satan know either injecting to our minds or through other people and then we've got to overcome things that we hear and legalism uh and then the chapter two ended with overcoming mysticism you know you hear you hear about a lot people had dreams or people heard or talked to an angel now especially around the message people have dreams but all those dreams got to be taken back to the word of God and all these all these guys rising up now getting out of the preachers they rise up and say well I'm the great one to rise after brother Branham an angel spoke to me well let me look at your life for a few a few minutes here by God's grace let me let me examine what you're trying to tell us about that and and then we'll be able to exactly see where you stand on the word of God we'll be able to judge you by the fruits of your life praise God but uh overcoming these things was part of the Colossians battle again it wasn't it wasn't battling flesh and but in all reality Church it never is battling flesh and blood wherever your source of your problem is it's really never against that person or that that group it's the spirits that are behind it praise God and church that's what I love like even in any trial I can I can take my mind off what I see and I can just close my eyes or I can just look up to heaven say Jesus I know you're in charge of this situation I know if I go to you I go above all the trials right I go above all the doubts all the fears I know if I go to Christ I'm going to the highest Authority praise God and I know Jesus Will plead my case of the father praise God that's what the Bible says he makes intercession for us to the heavenly father how many believe your heavenly father really cares for you praise God really you really believe you're a child of God after singing about that twice tonight you're really a child of God praise God that means god your father hears all your prayers amen and he's going to minister according to his perfect will in your life praise God and now chapter three we looked at this in the first four verses our our Focus if we're risen like I preached there at brother cams for the resurrection service how many risen in Christ if you are resurrected in Christ like Jesus resurrected if you're resurrected in your soul and your body and your mind then set your affection on things above praise God focus on the Heavenly things and then verses 5 through 17 were specifics we need to mortifying Christian Living oh thank God we're saved by grace you had nothing to do with it and now but now you've got something to do with mortifying the desires of your flesh isn't it something salvation has nothing to do with you but everything after salvation has everything to do with you that's a good thought I never I never said like that before so I thank the holy spirit for that tonight salvation has nothing to do with you but sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Beyond has to do with you praise God because then didn't Peter say make your calling and election sure didn't Paul say approach your salvation with what fear and trembling so there's going to be times in our Christianity isn't that interesting there's gonna we're saved by grace we we should have joy we should have joy unspeakable fully Glory we can dance around here right like I told my barber he's like you guys dance around the church what is that like it's pretty awesome it's pretty freeing praise God but you know we can go from that and then and we're being so happy but then God will allow the trials of our life to bring us to a point where we are actually trembling God I really need your help in this situation or God am I saved or God am I Sanctified God am I filled with the Holy Ghost God am I going to live past this next week right we go from such wonderful moments to such trials so trials that shake us to our very core and so Paul says Paul says in everything be content for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus and everything give thanks for this is God's will there's going to be Mountaintop moments of shouting and dancing and rejoicing and crying out to God then there's going to be moments where you're shaking and you've got to really get down to your core and really say which direction am I going to go right we see it all the time people around the message they hang around but when they leave what happens when they leave when they left they came to a moment where they had to make a final decision on something and they made the wrong decision right because they they lead the word of God but we've got to be the people that when we come down and our lives are shaking us to our very core we choose to believe God's word anyway praise God whatever situation seems like it's falling apart or you question where is God in all this why is God allowed this to happen we got to have the faith to still choose to have hope in Jesus praise God because you're just saying that all your hopes in Jesus amen then we've got to trust his word praise God if all of our hopes in Christ now let's look at verse 20 here this is where we want to start there verse 20 says children obey your parents in all things and the children said Hallelujah all things now of course this refers to all Godly things right just like a wife is so to submit in all things well that doesn't mean sinful things it just means all good things right all things that would be reasonable and correct so we get a plain exhortation from Paul that children ought to obey the parents in all things and this reminded me of the Lord Jesus let's go to Luke chapter 2. you're familiar this this is one of the Just One of the Highlight scriptures for me in the last maybe five or ten years on the Lord Jesus and uh after he says in Luke 2 49 it must be about my father's business verse 51 so Luke 2 51. just some of this some of these powerful thoughts here that we can see and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart so from from the time Jesus was 12 to 30 we don't know anything really that he did other than he was a carpenter's son and all he did for those 18 years was just obey mom and dad that's all he did and obeying mom and dad gave him such favor that God blessed him was was such a tremendous life praise God I don't know how to say it but other than it was well pleasing to God Amen and so Jesus Christ live this example he obeyed his parents in all things now I I believe sometimes there was probably times he corrected his mom and dad don't you and his brothers and sisters at least remember he was one of at least seven because they named six they named they named six brothers and sisters and then it just says sisters right so these two sisters could have more sisters than that Four Brothers two sisters and then Jesus so there's at least seven in that family so I imagine Jesus was ever you know each day correcting people I'm sure he did it with a lot of Grace though I'm sure he wasn't driving out his family like you know he was the money changers you know but here where you see this this perfect example of Jesus obeying his parents in all things in verse 52 and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man now look at this formula I'm just going to call it a formula children if you obey obey your mom and dad and everything God's going to increase everything in your life God's going to give you more favor right with God in other words God's going to hear more of your prayers everybody listen all those children listen to me God's going to hear more of your prayers and then God's going to give you favor with your friends and your teachers and your pastor and your all the church friends praise God all the adults if you can respect and honor your parents God's going to give you favor everywhere you look Hallelujah what a promise and who's the example Jesus that's just a beautiful thought Jesus is the best example to the husband how to love his wife Jesus is the best example of the wise on how to submit to their husbands because Jesus admit to the father in all things all right so sisters you can still look to Jesus right dads you know husbands we can still look to Jesus and everything look how Jesus treats his church he gave himself for it praise God and so children you can look to Jesus on how you should submit to your parents right submit in All Things become subject to them and then God will give you more favor with God and then more favor with mankind with all the adults too I'll just say like that with God and with the adults beautiful beautiful scripture there of Jesus praise God he learned how to submit you know submission is not an easy thing when you want your way but somebody else wants their way that's when really find out what you're made of praise God right then we see your real colors if you got to grit your teeth and say fine fine or no maybe just maybe it's just a play no or maybe you'll argue just to get your way or maybe like at school they cry to get their own way sometimes those big alligator tears come out okay but here we see an example of Chris of Christ Christ is an example for all of our Christian children to submit and let the Lord have his way right remember the Bible says that in Ephesians the Bible says each one of you be subjects one to another right remember the example brother random gave he said when it came to the Branham Tabernacle he didn't want to have construction and build the brand and have construction on Branham Tabernacle but he looked at all the people and the majority of the people wanted it so he threw his vote in with theirs right so that's just a simple example of one way as an adult you could submit I don't like how the money's being used or I don't like how this I don't like how that well look sometimes look to other people praise God sometimes don't look to be the unless you're standing on God's word that's different but if it's just your opinion and it's just like a Christian Area Christian Liberty let's throw our opinion in with others praise God if it's not going to hurt anything amen I think that's a good example a brother ran there I don't really want to do the construction but then he does it and then and look later look later when he preaches Seven Seals he was glad because the church was larger everything was better The Acoustics were better everything worked out better over a hundred people were baptizing that week praise God so that's a great example of just throwing your opinion in you know just submitting to other people and then God works everything out for his glory Hallelujah so children let's hope let's learn to obey the parents in all things a good thing to memorize parents is yes Mom that's a good thing to memorize let that be quick to come out of your mouth yes ma'am or yes Dad right don't complain don't talk back don't ask questions let's all hear the children say yes Mom can you know all the children say that oh that's good that's right now let's hear yes Dad ready oh you guys are doing good praise God I just keep saying though the rest of the night praise God take it home with you do tomorrow too yes Dad yes ma'am because that's the way to please God submit to the ones who have authority over you now that's the way to get with favor favor with God now and later amen so children take let's take a lesson from the Lord Jesus Christ fathers Colossians 3 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged now let me look up some let me look at these Greek words here by God's grace so provoke means to stir up to stimulate to provoke or to excite of course this is in the not the good way like hey do you want to go get ice cream it's a different excitement than that this is the the bad excitement right so fathers don't provoke your children making them angry lest they be discouraged so discourage is the word broken in spirit disheartened now at church I don't know if I've ever been broken in spirit but I know a lot of people have they've just felt what I mean is hopeless they're hopeless and so Paul wrote to the fathers especially now don't let me wrong mothers can do that too mothers can make have the wrong Spirit on them and they could break a child's spirit and just make them feel hopeless but specifically God anoints Paul to tell that fathers don't provoke your children unless they be broken spirited so Dads Dads have a special assignment from God you need to encourage your children you need to build up your children and don't make fun of them or don't mock them or don't look down upon them don't break their spirits right like I was glad I got to tell malachite I'm proud of you son you got your license proud of you I don't tell you that enough man okay I'm proud of you Lydia I don't tell you that enough Casey I got to go through all Haven I don't tell you that enough Karis I don't tell you that enough I'm proud of you Victoria I'm proud of you Genevieve Mountain proudly where's Zion I'm sleep I'm proud of how Zion sleeps I'm proud of him too with everything he does too but one element especially dads need to do is not something it just it just gives the impression dads are are less loving right the is it's harder for dads to express love nobody's got to say Amen because we know it's all true right it's harder for dads to be loving and so dad's got to learn am I the only Dad here tonight I'm the only Dad here tonight I'm preaching to myself praise God all right Dad come on be loving praise God so I've got to find a way to encourage my children amen I gotta find a way uh to excite them in good ways and not excite them in bad ways now if they need a little correction then I'm just the one to do that praise God I want to be by God's grace mom too but so fathers need to take a lesson now remember the one or the one father that stood out to me out of all the fathers I preached on that as I was thinking about this was Eli the one father of an example let's not be like Eli right and Eli the Bible said he restrained not his sons from their sins so Eli had it in his power he could have removed his two sons from being priests but he didn't do it he let the the sons keep sinning he let the sons lead the people into sinning right you let them be lewd men and so this is another father's here I'll probably preach shorter on this section but it's my job as a dad it's the the jobs of the fathers to restrain their children of course moms do this too but this one case where the Bible speaking of father so I'll just focus on the fathers the fathers when they see their children getting on the line they've got to make a change how many times have I heard different preachers and different ones say as soon as I get home I'm going to make that change you know maybe the preachers are traveling or something and I hear them say as soon as I get home we're gonna make a change with my children I'm gonna make a change to the church there no really you know Dads Dads should be causing uh should be causing positive feelings right and yes dads have the power to change things most things right but they got to have the power to change to bring encouragement to the children praise God and I hope as a spiritual you know as a spiritual leader of the church I hope I'm bringing encouragement to each one of you by God's grace that's my prayer amen you know it's a delicate balance I mean I gotta I'm called to rebuke sin right I gotta rebuke sin uh but I I can't have a personal uh a personal problem against somebody like I can't I'm not supposed to isolate people right if I the Bible says if you've got to promise somebody go talk to them one-on-one and I Try by God's grace not to bring it up across the pulpit now people that don't come here anymore yeah I'll preach at them right across the pulpit because they're not here anymore and I want you to learn from their mistakes didn't Jesus say remember Lot's wife praise God amen here's an example of someone who wasn't there and so it's a great balance you know we've got to encourage our children and not break their spirits but mend their Broken Spirits right in their failures we got to say that's okay try again everybody fails daddy fails seems like I'm pretty good at coming up of examples of my failure so hopefully my children know that you know I I try to yeah I've had different talks with Malachi and Lydia and Acacia in the past and I've tried to share well you know here's what I did you know this was a really ashamed of this now compare what you did to what I did you can learn from my mistake too you know and then also Church you know you know Annoying all my mistakes it gives me wisdom on how to treat my children you know because I know how I was treated and uh and then I can show Grace now let me just give my mom a few props here you know I always give my mom a few props you know I was in I was in a car accident in high school I hit somebody rear-ended somebody you know my mom never got mad at me you know uh had to go stand before the judge I started talking the judge cut me off I was like well I was just tired you can't even get in the car if you're tired I can still I still got the uh I'm so provoked from that actually from all those years later I'm so discouraged from that maybe that's why I got my speeding ticket last week you know but uh you know I just you know I take that from my mom you know she would she would tell me when I was wrong but then she would just go on move on and so I've tried it you know I've taken that into my own parenting you know make a mistake we've got to talk about it then we just move on now of course there's different levels of mistakes and the worst the mistake the harsher the punishment but I do appreciate my mom for that you know I can't think of you know maybe that's the first example I thought of just I was expecting I was expecting anger but I got Grace she still paid my insurance you know she still did all that a single mom and so in my mother in my mom parented me I saw a lot of Grace so that's a word to the fathers there after the word to the children you know I want to look up another scripture here I go to Proverbs here if you would here this one has come into my mind here yes Proverbs 29 21 please remember I preached that Proverbs here that was the first year brother William came and I hardly use any program quotes and he's like do you even are you a message preacher you know are you leaving Brother Brad yes brother yes I'm just doing a little teaching series here straight through the Bible well I like that I like to know that I don't have to say brother and brother and brother and brother and brother random brother you know I like that I can say the Bible says the Bible says Jesus said Jesus said Jesus said I like that I can have a variety of messages there but that was a good question for our brother to ask there Proverbs 29 21 now look at this he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall haven't become a son at the length now think of Abraham and Eliezer Abraham had no Sons right and then once he got a son his next trusted person was Eliezer he sends Eliezer across the country to get a wife I don't know about you but who would you send to get a wife or husband for your child oh who here would I send to get a husband for Lydia I'll go myself [Laughter] no but you know look look at the confidence that he had in uh in Ellie easer a lot of confidence and here we get this idea here you know as as parents we got to be delicate with our children right we don't want to be harsh harsh harsh harsh harsh there are times to be harsh and there's different cultures right but we see here now this word now this word I actually maybe wouldn't use from the pulpit but it actually means to pamper it just means to bring up or treat though I like the word treat delicately I like that word delicate in other words church we want to be real careful how we respond to our children and then church we're all going to make mistakes so being a delicate parent is being able to say I'm sorry if I made a mistake that's one thing I hope my parents or my children see in me that I'm not perfect I make mistakes I want them to know I'm sorry when I make a mistake I didn't mean to do that in other words I want to make sure I say the right thing at the right time remember last Wednesday when I preached anyone remember last Wednesday when I preaching what remember the title spiritual yeah spiritual food give it to your class so that's what that's what we really want is parents I want to be able to say the right thing at the right time to Lydia or Malachi or Keisha or whoever needs it boy do I need God's help because a lot of times I don't feel like I don't have the right words to say you know the Bible says raise them up delicately or with a lot of wisdom in other words right so how do we get that well we got to pray for right the Bible said if you need Wisdom ask for it God will give it liberally praise God so just a beautiful it's a beautiful thing like you know a servant wouldn't be anything close as special as a family member but if you train up a servant and treat them like a child pretty soon they could they could take over as a child if you didn't have any children that's just a great thought there it's the idea in other words I'll say like this it's the idea of just being a well a well-trained parent right or a very concerned parent that's the idea like I I get scared when you know when I've seen people that won't read a book about having a better marriage I get nervous about that you mean you're going to spend all these years of 18 years at least as a parent and you're not going to even try to become better you're just going to go with the flow how's that going to work out you for you in any other occupation maybe I could take Austin's place tomorrow night at his job and let's see if I can just go with the flow and see if I can be the supervisor there and just run all the plates out and everything and see if I no you got to go through training what'd you do we could train him about two weeks what'd you do yeah so yeah so you had somebody there yeah but you still had training yeah yeah a month yeah a month and so you know I'm concerned like like I'm glad we're doing uh marriage counseling you know and that's how I tell the people I'm not going to marry unless I counsel you because I got to know that you've heard the truth you're accountable for it praise God you just don't walk into marriage oh it's all going to work out that's that's a really bad attitude I mean yeah I mean by God's grace but you can do something about it praise God and as a parent we can do something about it we can become a better parent so my next book I'm going to write is on parenting I got one chapter written but I kind of took a break I want to kind of get this next series done and I want to start writing on that by God's grace I go to Proverbs 15 1. this is what I taught at the middle school on Tuesday morning we were talking about you know how do you deal with problems in the middle school and this is a very familiar scripture but another good good reminder you know when voices raise when voices raised and I found this with some students I actually had to do this today I'm on the playground with some students I have to raise my voice other students I don't have to raise my voice so today unfortunately on the playground I had to raise my voice this boy was in my class last year and he just he wouldn't let it go and I finally said Michael and he's like okay I was like Michael say you're sorry sorry then he walks away I pleaded with him a couple times Michael so you're sorry Michael and finally I'm like Michael say you're sorry I tried the soft answer approach that didn't work now him his dad was in jail maybe that's why I had to raise my voice like that dad was in jail for a number of years but the Bible said a soft answer turns away wrath but Grievous words stir up anger now the Grievous means sorrowful or offensive words right painful hurting words so see we can say things loud and as long as they're not personal that's okay like I didn't say anything against Michael about his personal being today I just said you need to say sorry there was no wrath in it I wasn't I had nothing against the boy that's how we should be with our families right we shouldn't attack them personally we should attack their looks we shouldn't attack their intelligence right Church we shouldn't attack them personally right we ought to edify the family right we need to edify the family build the family up praise God praise him up but there has been so many times in my class somebody's young I'll just use another name well maybe I shouldn't use that name uh Martin I'll use Martin instead Martin Martin will raise his voice Mr Smith I'll say Martin it's almost like I'm there right now flashbacks post-traumatic stress syndrome oh my God and then he finally does and tell you to do that I didn't tell you to go there he's raising his voice but I'm bringing mine down and then he writes me pictures and says he loves me like he's the one that breaks the rules all the time Martin but then he's one of the writes on these pictures like he loves me because that is proof when you when you crack somebody that's proof you love them right love is corrective right we know that but not to stir up a personal battle against him or a personal attack not to bring them pain but just to bring them correction with love okay all right so we get some different ideas there on parenting for fathers and mothers um you know build them up right as fathers we don't want to discourage we want to encourage and let me say this too you know I was uh listening to a servant and they were just encouraging fathers fathers you know we've got to give your kids hugs right you got to tell them you love them oh yeah in fact we had brother Arley stay yeah let me share this yeah yeah brother Ali stay on Saturday night and he told me Sunday before I left he said thanks brother for letting me stay and he bought us an avocado he bought us some blackberries and he bought us some fish too just to say thanks for letting us let them stand like all right you have to do that he's a very sweet man but as we're leaving out there it's pouring down the rain you know I got the umbrellas out there he's like I just want to tell you I love you he said he said thanks for having me and he said I loved how you did your family bible time at night of course we do pray we do we read from the scripture or from my book because it's about the scripture ask questions and then we'll sing and then we pray and then we always give hugs and kisses good night and he said I especially loved how you did hugs and kisses he said in the Amish community we don't touch kids after they're four or five years old and my heart about saying imagine you're six years old my first graders are six and seven and they give me hugs all the time like there's one girl in my class I'll just call her Jennifer that's her name but she every day she's I check their spelling every morning I make them do their spelling words and handwriting and she'll just lean on me the whole time while she's waiting for me to grade it and I'm like thanks Jennifer some kids just need love like and Jennifer comes from a Muslim family where they probably don't get a lot of love unfortunately um but he said I really love that in the Amish community nobody's giving out hugs I think man well no wonder some of these guys going to go sow their wild seeds you know or whatever it's Wild Oats whatever they say no wonder they want to run away from home there's no love there and they come to church and it's all it's all legalism and dogmatic and there's no inspiration there's no love and church I'm not perfect at loving my children I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is that the love of Christ makes you want to love your children praise God so fathers and mothers hope those are a few words of encouragement tonight by God's grace Hallelujah verse 22 let's move on here servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh not with eye service that means service performed only under the Master's eye you only work hard when they're watching you everybody said now the thing about your sir your boss as men Pleasers right we don't want to be we don't want to be trying to get favor with men so the Bible says when we only work hard around our boss we're only trying to get favor with men so the opposite's true if we work hard without the boss we're trying to get favor with God trying to gain God's favor and it all goes back to this idea the real person you are is when you're all alone that's the real person you are and nobody's watching right that's why I love the Scripture it just shows it shows who really loves God right and I I think church we can all say I need to love God more how many could say that Amen to that yeah we all need to love God more but we really see who we are when we're all alone nobody watching us nobody checking up on us just us and the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so the Bible says obeyed all things even when no one's even when the Master's not watching with a singleness or a sincerity or an honesty of heart that's what that singleness of heart and honesty of heart because you again you fear God remember we looked at fear fear of God on Sunday a little bit just have this extreme uh adoration for God an extreme honor for God that's why you work hard for your boss now I've said it here when I'm at work I work as hard as I possibly can by God's grace but I don't go at home I don't go above and beyond it because I don't really have to I could but I'm not gonna I don't want to take away from my family my time with my family or my time with God all right so I just try to do all my work at school although great in there I just try to get everything done there so I can be free and don't have to worry about the problems every now and then I got you know things I got to do at home but I have to remember the Lord is there with me on the job as well church and the Lord's with you on your job as well diver tell you I go Joe when I worked at Gojo for that summer before I got my teaching job did I ever tell you I was with a new crew so what does the new crew do Emma the new crew goes to the uh the pallets and they got all these boxes of soap and they're just busted and broken and the when you're on the new when you're the new guy you got to go there and lift the boxes for eight hours you got to look through and see if there's leakers we're looking for leakers and you can see the blue soap the purple soap and you would throw all the leaker boxes on another pallet and got a stack them real neat right and all the good ones that aren't leaked oh it's a good box so I'm gonna take it over here I'm gonna put it on that palette so for eight hours I had to pick up the boxes look them eight hours now most of the new guys that get around there they start laughing and talking I just keep working and church I don't know how many times I look around the corner and the the boss the boss the supervisor would be peeking around the corner like this and each time I'm like thank God I'm working praise God all these people are taking breaks like it's so hard it's not really hard it's just monotonous and boring but by the end of that summer I only worked there uh May June July and August and by the fourth month I'd already got the the Tow Motor job and you weren't supposed to get that for like until you were hired in full time but because I just worked all the time without them I mean they were watching me but I've worked like they weren't watching me right I worked that they they uh what they call They promoted me early before I even had uh the status they let me they broke the rules to promote me that's a good example I could probably give you some bad examples from when I was a sinner by God's grace so when I was a sinner we worked in a landscaping crew and we would skip out on work for the afternoon and go watch a bad movie you know at the movie theater that's a bad example don't ever do that everybody does learn from my mistake don't do that but I was a sinner I never did that as a Christian praise God so we got to have the fear of God and church remember that God's watching us everywhere he's watching us everywhere and then verse 23 Colossians 3 23 whatsoever you do so it doesn't matter whether you're a teacher whether you're a student whatever you are do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men that hardly means with your your feelings your desires your affections I just had my uh superintendent tell me a couple weeks ago he's like every time I look at you you're always smiling Mr Smith it's like I got a lot to be thankful for praise God but people can see the heart for God right when you go to work or you wherever you wherever wherever you associate people will see your heart for God on your face right and and through your work ethic praise God so whatever you do put your heart and your emotions into it as to the Lord and not to men so Church there's a way you can work on the computer and do it for God right there's a way you can uh you can sort leaking boxes of soap and do it for God's glory see you can sing the whole time amen hallelujah you can think about the scriptures there's a way to honor God and work for God no matter what situation you're in or else Paul would not have said whatever you do do it for God praise God Hallelujah why because verse 24 tells us why knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance look you get a reward whatever you do you're going to get a reward isn't that something you can get a reward no matter what job you is you say brother brother Jesse my job is meaningless Jesus said you're going to get a reward how you work at your job you get a reward for you serve who who do you serve the Lord Christ and that's something you didn't say Lord Jesus Christ he just says Lord Christ that's the Lord and of course Christ is Messiah the anointed all right you serve the Lord Christ God so whatever you do put your heart into it you know like that you know Malachi and Lydia over there at that job and the bosses come and they tell me what a what a wonderful group of of workers they are and they said you got some more kids right they're all going to come work for us right I said oh yeah but you better raise the pain I didn't say that so you better raise him no I never said that if the price is right they'll come no but people see if you're putting your heart into your work or you're not putting your heart into your work so we want to be Christians that people can say oh I'm putting my putting my heart into this like we just had a Taekwondo Testament what the guy said about me he said I always learn something from your reports remember he said that Mr harion you know honestly I don't even really like doing reports for Taekwondo but I put I work on it like I'm working for the Lord now in that case there's a little bit of procrastination but I still get it done on time and he says he learns something new every time there's something I don't really enjoy but I work on it really hard I take the suggestions I do the best I can I try to get I try to get better at it so whatever you do put your heart into it as into the Lord because Church you shall receive award how many looking forward to the rewards praise God I'm looking forward to the rewards the greatest reward will be seeing Jesus Christ but after that the Bible says you do receive the reward of the inheritance there is a reward for being faithful remember if you're faithful with five talents you get 10 cities move over 10 cities praise God if you got two talents maybe you rule over four cities oh it's a blessing it's a blessing verse 25 finish in this chapter verse chapter 3. verse 25 but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there's no respect to persons I like this verse you know why you know why I like this verse because it basically puts you in two camps now this is this is awesome you're either doing right or wrong and the church said that ought to make somebody happy here tonight praise God now your degree of right God will judge that but really when it all boils down to it you're either doing right or wrong let's do what's right praise God serving Jesus right I'm loving Jesus I'm trying to forgive I'm trying to as a parent I'm trying to build up my children I'm trying to do all these things trying to love my husband love my wife whatever situation you're in do the good thing praise God do what's right do what's good let's not do what's wrong praise God let's fix the wrong as soon as we can praise God let's make it right Hallelujah that's why I like that verse because we're not told all the details about Rewards right we think we'll get them at the marriage supper of the Lamb right after the um right after you know the communion with Jesus and the uh where he he drinks of the Vine afresh with us we're not told all the details but we want to make sure we do what's right because we're going to have to we're going to reap what we're going to reap what we sow right and there's no respect to person with God think about that God's going to treat each one of us exactly the same exactly the same I remember we read that chapter uh in my book at home and it's one of the it's the parable of the pounds I think in the parable of the pounds everybody had the same amount of money well how what does that show that shows everybody is given a certain amount of opportunities in life right what do we all what do we all have that's the same we have a life so you and I we all have the same opportunities to glorify God with our life everybody here has a chance to pray in the morning and to pray at night I'm not going to leave that out everybody here has a Bible is that right amen I can read their Bible everybody has here somebody that they live with right so everybody has a a person at their home that they can show the love of Christ to and serve is that true yeah good nature and nature saying amen hallelujah see those are all equal we all have money right except for the real little ones all right we'll have money so we all have that equal opportunity we've all got money we've all got these all these are the same without it and we have to ask God Lord help me do what's right with all these things you've given to me that's the same we can all speak English some of us better than others right like not like me you mix words up and spit and stutter and all kinds of things like that making fun of myself is what I'm making fun of but we all have a chance to talk about Jesus how many people here can sing everybody can see we all have a chance to sing every day right who who here can't see who here can't live who here cannot lift their hands and praise God every day everybody can do that praise God we have a lot of things that are the same right and God's given us all the same opportunity let's make the most of it praise God Hallelujah there's no respect to persons with God everybody will be judges the same that's why diligence is such a great topic that's why I love diligence we can't earn salvation but after we get salvation then it's now it's diligence right now diligence every man the Bible said every man according to his labors Hallelujah we're all saved by grace God will never lose salvation we'll never lose the baptism Holy Ghost no God's never against us but after that we got free more agency and now we all have these same opportunities how many want to make the most of the opportunities praise God that's why you're in church tonight amen and God will bless you let me let me grow a few more verses on I kind of know where I want to end here let me set a little time right here all right chapter four that's a meaty scripture right there church whatever you do do it heartily as to the Lord knowing you get a reward of inheritance praise God with all your heart and I'm and I know church we all get tired I make I make fun of myself all the time I get tired there's things I don't want to do sometimes but that's why we're gathered here like this so we can we can have transform Minds so tomorrow we don't have to be too tired it really just doesn't keep us too long like last week well actually that was all your testimonies last week so it was all of our testimonies last week I should say we all kept ourselves up a little later last night but that was perfect that was beautiful beautiful time in the Lord Colossians 4 verse 1 Masters now okay now he dresses the master so he went from wives fathers children servants and now he goes into Masters now remember remember we preached on slavery and everything this is kind of like an indentured servant in the Roman system the leader of the house had life and death power over everybody the husband could have anybody killed and so Paul does Paul ever say you know if you're if if your wife mistreats her take her out does Paul ever say that you know if you're if your child doesn't obeying you get rid of them does Paul ever say that no he says he said don't discourage that in other words love them all right so Paul says Jesus Christ changes the total Dynamic of the home Hallelujah that's what I love I love how Arley can walk into my home and he knows it's a Christian Home praise God he was never there one time but he come one time and he says this house is different praise God then think about that then all the other Amish houses praise God think about that he's in his 50s and he steps in one message believer's home where they love Jesus Christ they love one another he said this is different than all the other average houses I've been in that's something Church that shocks me right now I wasn't even planning to say that that just shocks me now that Jesus Christ changes the dynamic completely praise God right the same thing's true for America I'm sure if you walk into most American Homes you'd see some things that we'd be shocked and embarrassed and wouldn't mention but then if they'd walk into our homes they'd see a different home too that's what first convinced me the message was right after the scriptures was I saw how David Llewellyn Craig Brewer Freddie boor and Dan boor all those guys live so holy as single men that were just a couple years older than me I was so shocked and like you guys don't have like Michael Jordan on your wall you don't have like swimsuit models on your wall they got pictures of Jesus on the wall they got the Hoffman head on their wall they got that picture of that woman who's he she's at her table praying she got her glasses off and she's got Bread on her plate and she's got her Bible open grown men I'm like these guys you're the biggest impersonators or these guys really got something I don't got it's the home life Glory church I love having good services but let's take that Spirit home with us praise God Amen Hallelujah I love to dance and praise God but let's take some Joy with us home amen so we can love our children love our spouses praise God love one another praise God let's do that then he finally addresses you Masters remember Paul was not called to end slavery right lots of people down Through the Ages were not called by God to end slavery but Abraham Lincoln was and he was faithful praise God so Paul wasn't called he was called to preach the gospel and transform the houses one by one by the power of the Holy Spirit Masters give unto your servants that is just an equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven praise God what a scripture how many people believe In fairness Paul says Masters be fair with everybody now what about parents should parents be fair should parents have favorites no they shouldn't right they shouldn't but Paul tells the master to be fair to all the servants because you have a master too remember remember that scripture in Malachi read a few weeks ago God told those husbands make sure you treat your wives right because I'm a witness between you and your spouse and your home and I'll pay you back that's what God told the Jewish husbands if you don't treat your wife right I'm going to pay you back in other words I'm going to chasten you I'm going to spank you see when the the leader of the home really has a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and then the parents do too of course the moms have a lot of responsibility but remember we're always under somebody else's leadership right no matter how great we are how much Authority we got all of us no matter what job we get or how many kids we got all of us are under a greater person praise God we all got to seek the continual leadership of the Holy Spirit amen constantly looking to God for leadership of the Holy Spirit like I'm just going to share I'll just share this story without naming the names this one I want to share earlier I didn't get to it somebody called me up yesterday and they're like brother Jesse do you want to move to a certain place and we can start a business together and uh tell the kids about it I'm like me are you talking are you talking to me I said I really like my house here I kind of I'm starting to like it now by God's grace uh I kind of like where I live you know but this person just introduces this thought I'm the leader of the home and like why don't you sell your home use that money and then buy this home for 378 thousand dollars which I don't have that kind of money and then we can start a business together and do all these things and I'm like I only had two I only had three words four words I'll pray about it I'm the dad right everybody's looking to me what are you guys do what are you gonna do I'll pray about it what else can I do oh they're giving me these ideas your children can start this business and the concern your children can do this business you can start a farm and all these things and I like the idea of living healthy but I'm not quite sure if I'm ready for that right now not sure if I want to trade in my tie for overalls and a straw hat I have straw in my mouth I'm not sure if I'm going to go from Pastor Jesse to Farmer Jesse I'm not sure if I want to do that yet but that's just an example of someone introduces the thought now is the thought introduced into my mind you're the leader of the home well what what do I say well I got to go to my master I got to go talk to my master because he's the one that gave me that house and I know he's the one that fixed my kitchen I told you the testimony about that I know he's the one that did that nobody can do that like that the church it always gives us a little spot it always gives us a reminder we need to be humble and realize we got somebody that's we're supposed to be in subjection to praise God we've got a master that we've got to answer to now think about that church I got to answer someday for my family but not only that but how I treated this church I got to answer how I treated each one of you and I'll be judged more harshly than you will boy I'm certainly shaking my shoes here it's not because it's cold that's the fear of the Lord we should have we should always have the fear of the Lord yeah fear the lord remember we have a master we have always have somebody higher than us who's who we have to answer to uh let me end with let's see verse two Colossians 4 verse two I want to bring this out you know even tonight as we were praying I was thinking about this verse the Bible said continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving so prayer involves watching giving strict attention to so you don't have a destructive Calamity suddenly overtaking isn't that something the Bible says if we don't pray something is going to overwhelm us if we don't pray we're not going to be able to be prepared for calamities that might come think about that prayer we have to continue in prayer so we're not basically Our Lives Spirit we're not left hopeless because of things that sometimes happen in life I really and then think about it what got what gets us through our hardest times prayer what prepares us for the hardest times prayer why did why do we blow up sometimes when things happen because we didn't pray right we missed that missed that time talking to Daddy I missed that time with my heavenly father so Paul's last words in this last chapter he talks to the Masters and says Don't Stop praying watch and also watching the same with Thanksgiving so constantly give thanks in your prayers thank you Lord for this thank you for this blessing thank you for the church thank you for your love thank you for this job thank you for everything you've given me thank you for answering my prayers amen continue in this don't stop continue praying it means to be instant to adhere to it means to be devoted to oh my Hallelujah Paul be devoted to prayer that's why I like to pray every every every time before surface keeps me devoted to prayer and then watching the same with Thanksgiving again think about this church here's the prophet messenger of the age this is the only letter he'd ever write you think about that remember all those brother-in books out there that moment you I'm gonna use yours real quick think about this what if this was the only message book you had well you better hope you get this one if it's only one you got it as all the major doctrines right in here but Paul had one letter to write to these people how's he going to end it what would he put in it if this is his only letter now I don't know if he knew it or not he remember he wrote two to Timothy wrote two to Corinthians you know what would you put in it he tells them to pray and pray with Thanksgiving pray with Thanksgiving that's why I like that when I felt like the Lord thank you I call her hun now because she lives with us you know she's like she's like mine uh tied for my oldest daughter how about that my twin daughters my twin my twin old is ours how about that hey you know but Paul tells him stay in prayer stay in prayer and watch and be thankful in prayer this is the only time the prophet would write them a letter verse 3. with all praying for us that God would open and with all means together so at the same time so praying at the same time also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which also I am in bonds now this verse means a lot to me lately because God opened a door to me in the Amish community and now I get to preach to people that actually want to hear the message they actually want to hear it you know along with you but I'm talking about like times I appreciate you know other churches remember when you just preach at the the Hmong youth meetings you remember that bang invited me or whoever was the president maybe it was was it coup I don't know somebody is either cooler van was when it must have been Coop because bang was already in our church yeah and somehow cool worked it out where brother Jesse could come preach them and I knew a couple people receiving them but I knew most of them weren't hearing it you know and that's okay they've got they've got their church and they've got their beliefs but here God has opened a door of utterance to the people that want to hear the mystery of Christ they want to hear it church I love when the word of God Comes Alive like this somebody was praying for me that a door I know I was praying for myself too but maybe all of you were praying for me or something but a door of utterance is now open where I get to utter the mystery of Christ and 17 Souls got baptized praise God I believe there's more on the way I do I believe that by God's grace I'm hoping trust him so Paul says Don't Stop praying and be thankful and pray for open doors for the ministry so the ministry can get into places it's never gotten to before Hallelujah you know I believe even those meetings at brother cams was an Open Door because we haven't had meetings like that for years and Simon just left me a message day he said that was such a tremendous time he said I still thank God for seeing those little kids dancing and singing and praising God he said I just he said that just overflows the joy of my heart Hallelujah it's a it's an Open Door and Jesus said if I open the door no man can close it if I close the door no man can open it praise God Sea church that's why we've got to keep praying got to keep praying God open more doors open more doors and why should we have open doors so we can speak the mystery of Christ I just love that word put a book on it or something the secret in other words Paul wanted open doors to share the secret of Christ all these secrets that are in the Bible I want to share God's secret don't touch if you like that don't you feel like you walk around all the time and you've got all these secrets you just wish people would ask you about I feel like that all the time like just somebody asked me about Jesus you know somebody just I got all these things hiding and I got all this all this Revelation don't you be like that sometimes you know I got all this Revelation I just wish somebody could listen to it praise God then when somebody does you feel bad it's like you offend them and they never want to talk to you again you know you believe that what happened in the Garden of Eden or you're not a trinitarian s and Paul was you know Paul was praying pray for us he was he's I tell you pray for us that we'll have an open door that we can speak the secret of Christ that I may make it manifest now is that something your own life can manifest the mystery The Secret of Christ right you can live such a Christian Life in front of people that they'll say Jesus Christ lives in that person isn't that the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory how we know that's the mystery amen what's the mystery that's been hidden down for the ages it's Jesus Christ Living in you praise God that should be our prayer Lord help me give me doors of utterance where I can speak the word of Christ and people can see me manifesting your spirit to them as I ought to now we can all be honest and say we don't always speak like we ought to we don't always testify like we ought to but we can pray God open doors so I can do it like I ought to let's say I know our feet musicians could come I'll stop right there we're already getting kind of late so we'll pick up there Lord willing and next time we'll see how it goes by God's grace on Sunday I'm enjoy the word of God tonight amen I appreciate that church and I know God does too Hallelujah whatever we do let's do it heartily Church unto God let's pray tonight here for open doors can we let's pray for more open doors I know Lena wants to see her family saved I know Austin wants to see his mom saved I'm sure sir and who want to see their mom fully committed somewhere some church worshiping God loving God worshiping the Lord I want to see my parents in the service of the Lord Hallelujah he said continue in prayer don't stop praying stop praying let's pray that the Lord will help us to have open doors and then we can manifest the love of Christ that's the mystery of God the Baptist the only ghost is the love of God you can manifest that to someone they'll see Christ appear in your life they'll see Christ appear in my life God's doing it with the Amish I know that God God's using me in that area but I think we all want that right we all want some open doors how many would say Amen to that day let's buy our heads for word of Prayer father God we thank you for your word tonight Lord I just love going verse by verse that's so rich your Bible never disappoints you to think this would be the only time this church he gives these children these fathers these servants these Masters he gives everyone such inspiring truths well I want to pray for the parents tonight nor God help me Lord God to encourage my children I'm sure all the parents who want to build up their spirit father help us to continue in prayer or I want to pray for the church our sisters the love of Jesus Pastor or be with our sisters our brothers it was doors with utterance the love of Jesus Christ or if it means we have to host it friend Lord God go out of our way to minister somebody God give us a door of utters Lord I pray that the Life of Christ can manifest Lord let us continue in these prayers father also help us about all of our hearts into our jobs our studies just remember you're always watching think of the reward that Joseph was all that foreign thank you I can worship you when I dance I just want to be thankful tonight foreign thank you Jesus Christ
