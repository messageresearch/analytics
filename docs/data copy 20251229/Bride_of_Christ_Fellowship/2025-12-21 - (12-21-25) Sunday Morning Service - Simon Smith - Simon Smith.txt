========================================

If God had not moved on me, &gt;&gt; where would I be? Saints, &gt;&gt; right before I heard this message, I was in denomination and I went and committed a what was it? The what's the lowest degree uh fourth degree misdemeanor [laughter] when I was in when I was going to church? Fourth degree misdemeanor. Come up to the judge. The judge like and I was like guilty of charged. [laughter] I confessed everything to him and he's like you're on two years probation blah blah. I was like, "Thank you, sir." He goes, "I don't want to see you again in here." He goes, "You will never see me here again." [laughter] [gasps] Right? I I gave him my word and I held my word. He did not. In fact, I don't even remember his name. So, let's let We're going to go leave that bygones. Right. But still in denomination. Didn't know I was doing wrong. Get caught in the wrong crowds. Still hang out in the wrong crowds and uh doing bad things, right? Still in denomination. My goodness. And if I was doing that in the denominational rankings, what if I would have stayed there? &gt;&gt; Because what? This thing's out of control. &gt;&gt; This thing's out of control. Look at all the look at all the pastors in the world, you know, that have been uh that have fallen in the last five years, &gt;&gt; 20 years, one year, right? So, uh and by the grace of God, he gave us the answer and that is receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he is the keeper. We can't keep ourselves, &gt;&gt; but he can keep us. Amen. So, I don't want to I'm not going to sing anymore. Thank you for musicians for all you do. And uh Toby there playing that bangy thing. And um we had one of those too at our home assembly and I think the young ones really like that thing. Was it called a cone or a stone? Cone. &gt;&gt; Coahone. &gt;&gt; Coahone. Okay. It was something I I could never remember it, but uh yeah. Yeah, they're absolutely gifts and callings. Absolutely gifted. Amen. Praise the Lord. Like I I like sometimes when they're clapping, I can't even keep a beat. But it takes a ability to keep a beat to play that thing, right? Sometimes I'll get on the wrong thing and I'm like, "Oh, God have mercy." You know, I don't know if Brother Jess ever heard our dad sing, but he ain't got it. [laughter] I don't think you can hit a tune or even a note. You know, I've heard it and I'm like, "Yeah, Dad. Yep. Stick stick with carpentry." Yes. And the skills skilled trades and what those sort of things. So uh but by God's grace um I had many sermons I was I was thinking all on this and this and brother Jess when he prayed kind of gave me like a direction there and uh we chose uh this by God's grace. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So if we could let's uh I want to give you greetings from Living Waters or yeah living Living Waters Tabernacle in the Point Ohio uh Pastor Cam and the saints there and uh once again we uh are thankful for the invitation and we trust this will be a blessing uh to you. might be simple um but if we could just really catch this and if we could express this the expression of this will change I believe everything right so let's uh stand for the reading of the word by God's grace and we'll start to Genesis 3 uh 1-7 then we'll [clears throat] jump to Proverbs 24:16 Genesis 3 and we'll read 1 through uh seven. And we've, you know, I've heard many services and sermons on this topic, and I'm sure your pastor, brother Jesse, has been teaching on these things as well. But we trust this will be a blessing. uh in Genesis 3:1 through7. Now the serpent was more subd than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree uh of the garden." And the woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, touch it, lest ye die. And the servant said to the woman, "Ye shall not ye shall not surely die. For the Lord doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes should be open, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat. So notice who committed the first uh sin right there, right? Was it Adam or was it Eve? Right? And she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. and the eyes of both them were naked were open and they knew that they were naked and they sued sewed fig uh leaves together and made themselves aprons. So let's turn to Proverbs 24. We trust you've all had a wonderful week and the Lord um he's mindful getting us through these cold cold weeks here the cold weather and um Proverbs 24 verse 16 for a just man fallth seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Let's say a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, we love you Lord. We thank you for this day. We thank you for your grace and mercy, Lord. We thank you for all that you've done, Lord God, and in our lives, God. How you've kept us, Lord. Lord, [clears throat] you've shown yourself mighty, God. Lord, you've helped us through this week, God. You helped us, Lord, up to this time, Lord. You've been you have kept your watchful eye upon us, Lord, every day of our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, and we believe, Lord, it's not for uh uh because of anything we've done, but Lord, for what you've done on Calvary, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just ask God, you be with Lord, these saints, God, Lord, and Lord Jesus, help me to get beside myself, Lord, and let you speak, Lord. Lord, this message be so simple, Lord God. But Lord, we believe it's timely, God. And Lord, I believe the bride uh needs to catch this, Lord Jesus. Lord, we love you. Bless the people, God. Strengthen them, Lord. Strengthen this church, Lord, this assembly, Lord. Strengthen the pastor, Lord. strengthen the pastor's wife, Lord, the children, Lord, and a lot of times uh Lord, we I've watched in in this time I've been in this message, Lord, how the pastor's children are under attack, the pastor's wife is under attack, God, literally trying to hinder and stop the work, Lord, that you have, Lord, using your man of God there, Lord Jesus. Lord, and Lord, not only in that, but Lord, we see in every person's life, Lord, how the devil attacks, Lord, all the time, Lord, Lord Jesus, we love you. bless the people, strengthen them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. So saints, we uh um looking forward to uh coming months. We actually had a visitor about um three weeks ago, maybe four weeks ago, we had a visitor uh um I believe it was on one of the trips to Thailand. Uh brother Ron had uh contacted a a brother there. He he became our interpreter for about two weeks and uh in October he said, "Hey, brother Simon, I'm coming to see you." I was like, "Okay." And um he said, "I'll come and see you in December." Well, was the very week before almost like the weekend before Thanksgiving. And he said, "Hey, I'm here." And I'm like, "Okay, I'm coming to see you now. Is that okay?" I was like, "Yeah, I guess it is. It is now. Absolutely." So, so in all these things, he was uh very very excited to uh see America as his third time, but he's never seen snow. And he got to see snow. And the first couple days, saints, he was rejoicing. He was he was he was grabbing his hand. He's throwing in the air. He's doing selfies with snow and the snow on the trees, the snow on the ground, and the snow on everything. He was But then after about a couple days, he's like, "Man, it's really cold." I was like, "Yeah, that's that's the revelation of it." to to the eye this the pure white undefiled snow looks beautiful but there comes something with that for water to get in that state saying it's got to get cold right [laughter] obviously he's never worked a day outside in uh eight hours in the freezing cold so he doesn't understand but he caught a little mini revelation there and he's like hey brother can we go in the house I was like yeah let's go uh so we know that uh the prophet and of course we know God in in nature he types uh the winter time is death and how even in death things become be beautiful, right? But it's cold becomes cold, right? So, uh uh we uh were happy to uh have him along for us for about a week and we actually took him to Iowa to see brother Brooks and we had a little service there and it was good time. So, so [clears throat] this morning saints, I'd like to uh teach on this [clears throat] topic uh a sinless bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I believe brother Jesse even meant hit on this. I I been trying to keep up with his videos. He makes so many videos I can't even keep up. [laughter] That's sad for me. Uh but uh he's done a tremendous job and I see I like what he says. He I'm defending this message. I'm defi defending Jesus Christ and his prophet. Right. And what a gallant stand that is. Um so in this topic saints uh the sinless bride uh this is a most uh paradoxical or maybe a very a thought that uh doesn't make sense whatsoever a sinless bride. Um but in this saints of God there is a there there there's a truth more real to this than there is anything else. Right? So, we've got to have our minds set on these things. And uh we trust this. I may have even mentioned many of these things before, but I want to start with this. Oh, we have it up also. So, in this this study, I'd like to start with this quote here uh right off the bat because remember this saints, this quote right here, saints of God, is the true bride, right? This is the bride. This is like a Joel to army. This is the this is the this is the people that goes in the rapture. Okay? If you can fulfill this quote right now, there's obviously many scriptures in 1 Thessalonians 4 uh verse 15, uh 1 Corinthians 15 dealing with the rapture mystery, right? But notice in order to be the bride that goes into that will not see death. Now this she will have to have these things. Okay? You know, in the time when uh uh Eleazar was sent to grab a wife for Isaac and as soon as she came, he he came, he said a prayer, he said a prayer. He said, "Lord God, the one that waters me and my camels," he said, "Well, be that's the girl, right?" You know, the prophet said, "The angel of the Lord was leading Rebecca in that time." So, literally, he she he didn't know God was working on the other end and neither and Eleazar had to have faith that God was going to answer his prayer, right? But in order when now when she did those things, what took place? He instantly as soon as I Elizer and and his prayer was answered, he adorned her with these things, right? She had to put on the the the ornaments and those gifts and everything, right? We know brother Ram said those are gifts of the spirit, right? But uh in our type as well, we have to have those spiritual gifts going, but you also want to catch these things. He actually pinpoints what we need to be what this invincible army, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now remember this, Christ in the true church." So, we're dealing with the true church. How many here believes they're in the true church? Absolutely. You better believe you are the true church. Amen. Why? Because belief will bring these things. If you have faith that you are that, what can stop it? &gt;&gt; What can stop faith? There is nothing. See, God, saints of God, God honors faith in serpent seed. When they went to the Beatles concerts, right, and were healed, faith did that. The Beatles didn't do that. They didn't do that, but faith in them did that. So if you can believe that you are the true church, nothing can stop you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It becomes invincibility. Right? He says, now notice, he says, the true church in the continuation of the book of acts, the book of re revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church, defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works, attempt the destruction of the people, God's people, and the discrediting of God's word. He says right down to the time he is cast lake of fire. He fights it at he cannot he can't stand it. He knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church. So notice from here from this point if the true church get the true revelation. You need this revelation. I need this revelation. And he says and what she is &gt;&gt; what she is. If you can catch this revelation of what you are, it'll start this process, right? &gt;&gt; Because I I believe if the wife of the bride of Christ can catch this revelation, she will move and start acting like this. &gt;&gt; She will start moving in such a way, she will conduct herself in such a way as David was with s with with Saul, he behaved himself wisely. He and and then as we saw as the time moved on, he says he behaved himself even more wisely. And at that time when he became more wise, that's when Saul saw David. He said and then he started to fear David. &gt;&gt; See, so we've got to walk in this way. Now notice what she is and what she stands for and she can do the greater works. She will be an invincible army. So we have to have we have to know the revelation of true church and what she is to be able to move on to these greater things. Right? But first of all, you have to have this revelation of who you are. Now, in this moving these things and I and I like this here it says he says and she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; What is invincibility? You can't lose. &gt;&gt; You are as the prophet of God says or actually the scripture says he says you are more than an overcomer. &gt;&gt; What [cough and clears throat] is more than an overcomer? It is Jesus Christ who over overcame for you and then likens it and gives gives it to you. He says no. He no you're the overcomer. I overcame so you could be the overcomer. That is more than overcomer. Do you believe that? Do you believe Jesus did these things? Do you know who you are right &gt;&gt; now? Notice sure that's really easy to say. That's really simple to bring these things. Right. Sure. Um but now we're going to get into some of these things here as we continue. Now notice, for a just man fallth seven times. &gt;&gt; Has anyone fallen last week, Monday through Saturday? Has anyone fallen like in their minds? &gt;&gt; Hey, two hands for me. Has anyone fallen even in the flesh and kind of kicked back on this and kicked back on that and had a bad attitude? Mothers, have you gotten frustrated with your children at all? Sister Christian's like, "Of course I haven't." Yes. No. She's like, "Yes, yes, absolutely." Right. Fathers, brothers, have you have have you gotten frustrated with anything at home and just had a negative attitude? &gt;&gt; When you go into negativity, you've fallen. You actually fallen from grace. You've actually fallen now in your mind, in your in your in your spirit realm mind because the prophet said the Holy Ghost is always positive. Amen. Praise be to God. See, so it shows it's so difficult to live in the presence in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. Oh my. I remember a quote back in the early 50s. Brother said, he says, "I'm trying the striving. of trying to find how to keep that presence there always with me. Amen. Actually, what dwelling with God and able to feel him, saints of God, it's one thing where we're living when we can't feel the presence of God and yet he's there. And it's a whole different thing when the Holy Ghost when you can feel his presence. Amen. Saints of God, it's just like this. If I'm to hang out with this brother right here and and and he would go with me to work and he would live and he he would literally be the guy recording my life. If if he was there and I take him to work, he'd ride in my pastor's seat. I drive him around and you have to watch me work these he and he would start recording. I would act a lot more different knowing he's watching my every step &gt;&gt; knowing he's watching my and if I could tell him. I said and the brother's like, "Brother Simon, whatever you're thinking, you got to say it out loud. God have mercy." [laughter] He goes, "Why? Because I got to record it. Even my very thoughts." Yes, brother. Even my very thoughts. Right. So, saints of God, it'd be a lot easier to live. I'll say it like this. I'd be able to keep myself in check a lot easier if this brother was literally hounding me all day long. But saints of God, you've got to come to realization that God is still doing that right now. The prophet said he is not our actions, he's not our words, he says, but our thoughts and will speak louder in heaven on that day. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, saints of God, we fall constantly. Right. Sure. Absolutely. Saints of God, we have mind battles. And I'll say it like this. We know that crow, that devil comes, that raven, whatever you call him, that serpent, that devil, that dragon comes and tries to put bad and negative thoughts in our mind constantly and what and try to attach into our heart and bring forth what a root of bitterness, a a rooe of jealousy, a root of this or that, saints of God, we've got to overcome them things. As soon as we as soon as we hear something that's contrary to the scripture, cast it out. Amen. Because if he's the word and you're the word, what should we be feasting on? What should we be thinking on? What the word of God? Now notice &gt;&gt; uh let's continue. So notice here he says he says and a just man fallth seven times. It doesn't say how many in in a day in an hour. He says and rises up again. It does not give a time period. &gt;&gt; So there's no time period required. You can literally fall seven times in a minute. [laughter] Bad thought. Bad thought. Bad thought. Bad thought. Bad thought. And bad thought. Amen. So, but what and what we get back up the next minute &gt;&gt; and you catch yourself and Lord forgive me and that last minute is totally erased. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is still on the mercy seat interceding for our sins. Amen. Now, let's continue on here. He says, "Now notice he says now the word now the word of God or the church dogmas is before you take you can uh is before you. You can take uh accept what the dogma of the church is or you can take what the word says. Remember in all ages has been as it is right now. There's always a popular belief among the people and it's always been just a little bit contrary to the real word. &gt;&gt; So notice remember in all ages it has been as it right now every age battled the exact same thing. It's like this. In the time of Smyrna and Pergamis when there was very little word in a time of dark Asia, saints of God, what little word they had, they were taught in Latin. They were taught that the Catholic Church is this and the and this and that and all these false doctrines, right? But little what little word they had, there was always something that was so close to the truth as to deceive it, right? But the elect always overcame, right? Why? Because they were the elect. Not because they live so perfect. because they were the elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's continue on here. For there is not a just man upon the earth that doeth good and sinnth not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not one just man. &gt;&gt; There is no one we can lift up and say, "Oh my, look at this. Look at this man here. Look at this brother here. Look, look how clean that sister lives." Saints of God, there's not a just one. That's why saints of God we uh I just I I actually got in contact with a with a missionary from a I actually went to a funeral and the over the during the funeral thing. I heard about this missionary over in Africa and he seems like a very very legit uh brother. I contacted him and found out he's a real real man of God and and we were just speaking back and forth and and he said he said brother he goes gives me these visions. He says, he says, and a lot of times he said in these big big meetings they have, he said, he says, he says, a lot of these people go and are actually worshiping the minister. He says he sees it in the spirit realm. He says come up out, he actually says he comes up out of his flesh and he goes into the spirit realm and he says he these people are worshiping the gift or the minister and not Christ. And I'm like, wow, that's exactly right. Now, let's continue on. So notice he says, "For there is not a just man on earth that doeth good." He says, "And sinnth not." Right? We can all equally agree on these things. Absolutely. As in the time of Jesus and that that woman caught in adultery, he says, "He that hath no sin, let him cast the first stone." Right? [laughter] Anyone got any stones? Nope. Neither. Go and sin no more. Right? So notice in the time of temptation, he says in time of temptation, notice we got two things literally working in the majority is deception and then of course iniquity. Right? And iniquity is what? knowing what to do, knowing what's right to do, but then not doing it right. &gt;&gt; Now, the dangerous I they're all they're both dangerous, but this one that's something else, right? You actually the people who in caught in deception, they believe they're trying their best to do what's right for God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but the but deception comes through a trick, a snare, &gt;&gt; something that that that is set in place, pre-meditated, [laughter] a trap of the devil that he set for you, right? But we've got to be mindful of these things. A real man, a real wilderness man will be able to see. A real tracker, a man that that's been in the and can track an animal. They'll they'll look for little h drops of blood here or little broken branch at a certain height or a little way indentation in the leaves a certain kind of way. Why? Because he's trained himself in this art of tracking. And I'll tell you this in in in the days I actually met a brother a couple brothers there that were in Vietnam. He says he says when you were in Vietnam he says you had to be I you had to be identify how the Vietkong would set their traps in the jungles and in fact he says he a lot of times if they got a little whiff of a what looked something is a little fishy in this out in the jungle saints out in the trees in the high grass he said if there's a little funny feeling he said he would go three or four miles out of the way to avoid that you know what took place I'll just tell you the story he said there was a captain he was a brand new captain captain. He was sent a man who's never even been in Vietnam. And he was sent he was in charge of they sent him in charge of like 20 or maybe it's 100 people and and this brother I was talking to was one of them. And they came up to a certain spot. They're going into the lower spot. It was actually a quick way to pass over to the next mountain or however. And and and the guy that's been there that I talked to, he's been there for months and I think almost a year. And he said he says, "Cap," he says, "there's something wrong right here." He said, "We need to go around this." And he he goes, "I'll make that call." when he disagreed that that the guy he said he goes I'll tell you what I'm going to go I'm going to take the long way over the mountain over here and you go this way he said brother Simon he said he said within half an hour he sort of heard an explosion and they went back down that mountain and sure enough they had almost all died there was a trap set but that young arrogant captain refused to listen to a trained veteran who was able to identify the traps of the Viet Vietnam I'm not justifying. We know that being our war was a joke, right? The poor poor boys that went over there died, right? Now, &gt;&gt; now notice here, he says, now notice here in in James 1:12, he says, uh, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation." &gt;&gt; You know, the devil's a the devil's been watching the humanity for 6,000 years. &gt;&gt; You know what the devil does? Here's Malachi working this and this and he'll bring something along maybe he's never seen before a little flashy and he's watching he's working this this does his eyes go like this or not and if he sees that his eyes just followed it for a brief second guess what he's going to wait a little bit and he's going to bring it around again and if his eyes if he his eyes catch it again and he turns he's going to see an open door he's going to see one of the weaknesses in his life and I'm not like hey right we're just this is example right now notice and that's the same way the devil is he knows exactly I'll say this he'll put thoughts in your mind in the spirit realm can you see your thoughts I can't see my thoughts he'll put those thoughts in your mind and he'll watch what how you react &gt;&gt; sir yes sir &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he'll put an as and I'm just say I'll use myself he'll put a negative thought against a person And he'll watch if I say God have mercy or that brother that that sister &gt;&gt; if I start saying something or he'll watch my countenance. Saints of God we're dealing with a mastermind. The brother said he says you are no match for the devil except except without the holy except with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's watching. He'll put this thought about someone or something or a certain situation and he'll watch your expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll watch if you start getting sad. He'll send this thought into your mind and he'll say you're working. Do you start slowing down &gt;&gt; in your work? Do you forget what you're doing? &gt;&gt; And then he know he saints of God. This is how this works. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right up here. Temptation right starts right here. Oh, yeah. Right here. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation. For when he tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord had promised to them that love him. Let no man say, when I when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted with evil. Either tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted when he's drawn away with his own lust and entire. See, someone says to God, it's exactly what took place with serpent and Eve, right? &gt;&gt; This is real. &gt;&gt; We're deal. We don't wrestle against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why you can't get upset with your brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Saints of God, I don't care what takes place, you can't get upset with them. Why? Because it's it's not them. &gt;&gt; If they and I was like this, even if they have the Holy Ghost and you have a problem, both of you filled with the Holy Ghost and you have a problem, it's either your flesh, a devil anointing you, or it's their flesh, or a devil anointing them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's one of those four things. or multiple &gt;&gt; maybe two Holy Ghost filled brothers, two Holy Ghost filled sisters having a disagreement. Maybe [snorts] you both got issues. [laughter] &gt;&gt; A lot of times it's not one-sided. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it is. &gt;&gt; I just watched something happen two Tuesdays ago. Truly, I can only compare to what Brother Jesse said when he was in Ghana. Was it Guyana or Ghana? &gt;&gt; Guyana. That devil possessed woman came up and he started cast a demon. She started biting his hand whatever and he cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ to this and she fell dead at she she fell back dead is as slain right as one slain right. What Jesse brother Jesse say? He says he says textbook Bible. We had prayer meeting on two Tuesdays and nights and there's a certain situation going on. Pastor Cam comes out. Usually he picks a prayer scripture. Usually when you come to prayer meeting, you want to bring a scripture to sew into the people and how important prayer is and how prayer. He comes out with Job 1. Starts reading Job 1. And by the end of that prayer meeting, three things took place exactly textbook Bible. I was so blown away. God is God. His word is completely right. &gt;&gt; Everything he wrote in there will not come back void. [laughter] It must take place. Amen. Now notice, but there is no temptation taken you. But what what but such is common to man. This brother right here, brother Sai, you have no idea what I'm going through. That might be true, but somebody's been through it. &gt;&gt; If there is an overcomer in the days of David and there if there was an overcomer in the time of Noah, if there was an overcomer in in in Philadelphia, there has to be an overcomer in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; This remember every battle you're demon you're battling, every demon, every thought, this and this, whatever you're battling, saints of God, many others are battling the exact same thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's all common. You know what I I have sometimes I have brothers call me and say, "Brother Simon, I know I'm not trying to bring you down. I know, but this is what I'm battling." I'm like, "Bro, welcome to the club." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I have those exact same battles. You do? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Probably more than you. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; It's all the same. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're all the same. I'll tell you this. If we could literally expose our thoughts right now, our mind battles right now, I bet they would all be almost the same thing. Am I going to make this rapture? Am I the bride? Did God really choose me? Am I a Judas? Am I foolish virgin? Saints of God. Those that's the main say saints of God in the denomination. They have no even idea what those things they don't even that's not even on their mind. &gt;&gt; But here in the message where too much given as much is required. &gt;&gt; Now we've been given so much word. The devil can use so many things to try and persuade you to believe contrary to what God has called you to. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's no temptation taken. There has been no temptation taken you with such with such is common to man. But God is faithful. [laughter] Who's faithful? Did did the Holy Ghost anoint Paul said, "But you are faithful." in the book of Revelations 2 and 3, then he's faithful and true and just. Is that you? No. That's Jesus Christ. Amen. There's one that's going to get you. Did anyone choose to be born here? No. God allowed you to be brought here and he placed his uh his seed within you. And because you have the seed of God, that's why you're here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the only reason you're here. Read the church's book. Three, two or three quotes. He says he the only difference between us, he says us and them, he says, is the seed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now that seed, it's good to have that seed, but you have to have that seed quickened full of the Holy Spirit. The spirit, the Holy Ghost, God, and your seed must be come together and then start producing life, right? &gt;&gt; It's good to have a seed in you. You It's good you can hear this word. It's good you can know the mysteries, but we must be what? Born again. Amen. He says, "But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able." &gt;&gt; What was that? Is this a promise of God? Oh, brother, I go I go through hard things. I I have many trials and temptations. You don't even know about it. But saints of God, if God allows Satan to tempt you, it's because you were built for it. &gt;&gt; You were built for it. &gt;&gt; You can overcome. There is nothing that you God has allowed to come upon you. You cannot conquer. &gt;&gt; There is nothing. Is this true or is this false? Do we come up here and rip this scripture out of the Bible? Nope. That's not true. No. But God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted what you are able to be tempted with. Right, &gt;&gt; saints of God. &gt;&gt; Well, why me? Because you can handle it. &gt;&gt; Why me? Because you can handle it by the power of the Holy Ghost. You can handle it because God is faithful. But he will with some temptation also make a way to escape. There's always a way out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a way out. A lot of times the way out is not exactly the way you want to go. [laughter] A lot of times to get through these things, you got to pray &gt;&gt; and labor, right, and call on God. A lot of times you have you might he might have you fast. &gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of hard, brother, to go without food for three days, four days. You know what just took place? I just watched a brother literally fast from March up until a week ago for 30 days at a time. And the Holy Ghost came in brother upon brother Cam. He said, "Go and tell this brother." And that entire fast was for this final battle for a battle at the He goes, "Brother Cam, I didn't even know what I was doing." And then it came out and was revealed. God is faithful, but there's always a way out. Joseph caught in Piper's house. He was faithful. He's made sure everything is right. The temperature is set right. Oh, we got electricity here. We got electricity here. Everything this is set. Potter's house was perfect &gt;&gt; and then Potter's wife starting having eyes for him and finally she so caught up in the temptation that she was uh uh being caught up for what she went and tried to uh do certain things, right? But God made a way of escape for him. &gt;&gt; There was a door open. It didn't say that pastor's wife went to the house and locked all the doors. &gt;&gt; If she'd done that, things would have been different. But God allowed her for that to make to make her to make that mistake. &gt;&gt; And because and he resisted. He left his coat and cloak, however you want to say it, and he ran out the open door because there always has to be a way out. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But will the temptation But with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can get through it. You think your life's hard? I challenge you. Go and listen to some on YouTube. If pastor allows us, that's okay. Go on YouTube and listen to some of the Holocaust survivors who were in the camps. How did they get through years starvation of starvation? That was unholy ghostfilled Jews. How did they do that? You are able to handle way more than what you think you can. You can handle as much as the Holy Ghost will allow you. I just taught a little bit on Wednesday there and I kind of started out like this because I had nothing to go on, no service, nothing to preach on. You know what I told the saints? You know, in the time of Daniel, the three Hebrew boys, there come a they had to make a choice, right? Bow down, right? Wouldn't it have been great if like a week or a month ahead of time, God dropped on Meshach, uh, Shadrach and Abedneo, if he would have dropped the visions on them? If God would have gave them, thus sayith the Lord, they would watch themselves, uh, have not bowed down to this image. They watched themselves stand like this. And the king challenged them. The king said and then they said, "King, we we've already made our choice." And they saw the vision where they go, they were cast into the the fiery furnace and then the they they didn't die. The fourth man of fire showed up. Wouldn't it have been nice if the three Hebrew boys would have had that vision and they would just acted out and said, "Yeah, king. We're good." There'd been no stress. Absolutely. Hey, I'll walk in myself. You don't have to bind me anymore. I'll walk right in. Right. &gt;&gt; But God didn't do that. He told them nothing of the trial that was coming. &gt;&gt; Because in their heart would have gotten scared, would have been fearful. &gt;&gt; Even Daniel sat in the lion's den. Would have been nice if Daniel the prophet of God. God did not give Daniel a vision of that. &gt;&gt; Where he would not bow down. He actually he said, "I'm going to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ." God did not give him a vision of that. He had to go into that by faith. &gt;&gt; You can handle it, saints. &gt;&gt; Now, notice here. Here he says, he says, "God is not a man that he should lie. Everything written in the word, he's not a man that should lie. There's always a way out. There's always a resolution. No matter what is plaguing you or trying to plague you, there is a way out. Trust in God. &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is so faithful. Amen. Now continue here. Now I want to uh jump here a little bit by God's grace. Now notice here he says he says then the spirit uh sorry then Christ the seed of Abraham and we were going and and we be uh being dead in Christ and baptized into the body. He says we are Abraham's seed and heirs of the promise and then how is it how are you how are you ever going to fall away if God made the promise to you? How are you going to ever backslide and go away and have have to go to hell for it? And you say well can we backslide? Absolutely. And when you baptize, you're going to get it. You don't. He says, he says, "Don't worry. Abraham got it and the rest of them got it and you'll get it. Don't you think it gives you the right to sin?" He says, "And it doesn't." He says, "You'll pay for everything you do. You'll reap what you sow." &gt;&gt; See, even so, notice why? Because Jesus is a good father. &gt;&gt; He's the everlasting father. And if you are a son of the king. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If he loves you like he says he does, &gt;&gt; if he loves you like his own children, show me, I was like this. You show me someone who won't correct their child and we'll call him a backslid. &gt;&gt; We'll say like this even in the spiritual pastor Jesse, if pastor Jesse can't correct this and this sin in a church, however, then he's he's backslid, right? But if God is a true father, which he is, saints of God, every time we do something wrong, God is going to spank you. [laughter] Amen. That's why, saints of God, if you see anything little tiny creep in your life, get it out. Why? Do you want to get spanking? Do you want to get spanked? A lot of times, I remember when God when my dad used to spank me, I learned real fast. &gt;&gt; I was tried to be a obedient boy. First of all, because I was so tiny and second of all, because I don't like pain, right? And because of those things, saints of God, we learn real fast. Don't do this again. Don't do this. I see this coming. I'm not going to do that again. I'll say like that. Just like when I got in trouble with the law in denomination. You think I ever went and did that sin again? Nope. &gt;&gt; You think I want to go before a judge and say I'm on a probation for uh two years? You think I want to do that again? Nope. I learned real fast. I had to come before a judge and I was accountable for my actions. &gt;&gt; You know what? Thank God that thing that I did was just uh level four, the lowest of the lows, right? And he gave me the correct sentence. It was just two years of probation. I didn't have to meet with anybody. This is He said, "No, you go do this again." He said, "I see you again in this court." He says, "We're up in this thing." And he said, "You're going to have some problems." And I'm like, All I needed to hear was that judge's voice one time. All I needed to hear. I was like, "Yes, sir." Yeah. Me and you could be friends. [laughter] Yeah. I'll never We're not going to do this again ever. He says, "But brother," he says, he do one little sin and you'll reap a whole wash tub full. That's right. But brother, that don't mean to say you're lost. See, [applause] &gt;&gt; you're not lost. you messed up this, you've done this wrong, you've done that this sin or committed this crime or or this saints of God, that don't mean you're lost. &gt;&gt; You've heard the rumor how even uh Jeffrey Dawnmer, they say he gave his heart to the Lord in in prison and g and and supposedly received the Holy Ghost. The Malachi makes the rapture. First one in line, Jeffrey Dome, and just Mel like, "Praise the Lord. [laughter] Don't eat me." Right? We're gonna see people we are not going to expect. Who do you think the worst devils of this that's on this planet are going to attack the most? Satan's children or God's children? They've already got their own children. The devil, but now he he's hunting what? The souls that can't be lost and they can't. &gt;&gt; He says, "But brother, that don't mean you're lost." That's exactly right. Abraham reaped exactly what he sowed. That's right. But he was still saved. Let me say it like this in dealing with Abraham. Abraham, come out. He says, God says, "I'm going to make you a great nation. I'm going to have a I'm going to make you this this. He said just go into this land where I lead you. As soon as I get the land, what takes place? A famine. What does he do? Was he obedient to the promise of God? The father of our faith. &gt;&gt; If we be the true seed, spiritual seed of Abraham, was he obedient? Absolutely not. because times got hard, times got tough, he ran all the way back to Egypt. &gt;&gt; And in that time, notice one sin led to another. He lied about his sister, his wife. &gt;&gt; God actually had to intervene. &gt;&gt; God had to come down. Thanks God. The entire promise to him would have not taken place. He would have lost. The entire plan of God would have been lost had not God intervened. Right? &gt;&gt; And he's intervened for you. &gt;&gt; I'll say this. Think about your life. Has he intervened for you or not, saints? Amen. I know he's intervened for me and I know he's intervened for you. Amen. But now notice as God came and as God came and intervened and shut the pharaoh down, what happens? Even in his disobedience, Pharaoh said, "I'm going to give you camels. I'm going to give you sheep. I'm going to give you man's servants. And I'm going to give you woman's servants. And it looked like he had wrought the victory in disobedience. It looked like, man, even look, I I'm blessed no matter what. And he was. But because of that, what took place? Come down the way. Sarah's like, "Well, I'm not having a baby. Maybe take Hagar. And the Bible says Hagar was an Egyptian. Where did Abraham get her all the way from his first backslide? &gt;&gt; And now Hagar's children, Ishmamail's seed, are ruining the planet. &gt;&gt; They're ruining Europe. They're taking over America. Everything Abraham sowed, we get to reap. [laughter] &gt;&gt; See how this is, see, it looked like, oh man, I came out with all this great things, but what? He took one problem. One problem was with him. &gt;&gt; It looked like he gained the world. My [snorts] Now look, Abraham reaped exactly what he sowed. That's right. But he still was saved. Amen. Look at this. Romans 8. He says, "And he that searchth the hearts knoweth that what what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." Let's get in the prayer like that. Get in the prayer, saints of God, where it's no longer you speaking, but you just the presence of God comes down. You start weeping and crying, uttering things which you don't even know what's being uttered. And yet, that's the Holy Spirit praying through you. And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose. All your mistakes, God's going to work them to the good. &gt;&gt; Every mistake, God is going to turn it into gold. Just like back in the middle medieval times, they called them alchemists. and they believe they could to take uh iron or some kind of ore or metal and turn it into gold magically or whatever they want to do, right? Well, God can do that. &gt;&gt; He can do anything. Did not he change a water to wine? Did he not speak this stuff into existence? [laughter] And he can do it for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I I love this. Now, one of the greatest examples coming up here. He says, "If the steps, the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." Ordered. Your life was ordered. Do you believe you're a seed of God? &gt;&gt; Everything has happened for a reason. I don't care if you think you made a mistake. I don't care if you know you've made a mistake. Everything is ordered. &gt;&gt; You have to understand this. &gt;&gt; Every part of your life, God is in control of it. You have done things you don't even know what you've done and why you've done them. But it w if you're a seed of God, it wasn't you doing it. God literally allowed, he moved you that way. Here's a really good example. Brother Austin there went to was it Arizona or Colorado? Arizona. Look what he got. [laughter] Brother, your steps are ordered. [laughter] Sister Le's like, I'm just in Arizona hanging out. Hey, who's this who's this big tall guy? Hey, now your steps are ordered. You see the example? &gt;&gt; Explain that. Explain that please. &gt;&gt; We can't except this. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And he delightth in his way. He wanted you to go that way. We couldn't explain it. We didn't know anything about anything. SAINTS OF GOD. ALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'm even where I'm at right now. But I know this. God is in control. Amen. Just keep walking with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to fully get into the leadership of the spirit. Fully walk in the spirit. Amen. Now, let's continue on here. I'm at like 40 minutes. I got to start rolling here. He said, "Now, notice, let's let's do a little warning here. I'm not just saying to do whatever you want to do, but he says, "So many wants to go around. Some get another way. And when when you find out you find yourself going on, you find God blessing you, but you're working in his permissive will and not his perfect will. &gt;&gt; So there is a perfect will and a permissive will. &gt;&gt; Now God can bring the permissive will back to his will. It's fully possible. In fact, it's promised. But notice, do we want to be in the permissive or perfect will? Perfect will. Now we're supposed to be now when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you became a babe in Christ. Right? Now notice we have we have to then we grow into maturity. &gt;&gt; And as we grow in maturity, we should be able to see what the word as things come to us now in our lives. Thanks God. This is 2025. How many's been a Christian for 10 years? &gt;&gt; 15 20 25. We've got to come up higher in the word, right? We've got to know who our husband is. We've got to know the word and what the word is. And it's like this. You've got to in your life when these things come, bring it back to the scripture. Well, I have an opportunity to do this or to do this. Is this going to hurt my church attendance? Is this going to hurt me this way? In the spiritual realm, is any of this going to hurt my spiritual life? &gt;&gt; That's main thing. What if I came up and said, "What if what if next time you Lord willing, brother Jess has me and I say, saints of God, praise the Lord, I just got a job offer. I'm going to make $300,000, but I got to go overseas for like two years. It's been good seeing you, brother. I'll see you when you're bigger, stronger, and even faster. I never know. God bless you, brother. Hey, hey, I pray that God will bless you continually. Uh, but I got to go. I got to make some money." Is that permissive will or the will of God? Am I chasing after him or I'm chasing after this? a man I could buy a lot of things going overseas working where there's gold working where's this those things of God that's and those are that's that would be a big thing but now are little things in life &gt;&gt; do I pay my tithes do I give offerings and what is left can you give an all in secret &gt;&gt; because if you can do these little things, God will trust you with the bigger things. &gt;&gt; Remember, we we're to grow up. We have to mature in the word of God, right? &gt;&gt; I'm striving as well, saints. He says, now can hear in the time of Joseph, Joseph had many dreams, right? He was a dreamer. I don't believe any of his brothers and his father and mother didn't even believe any of the dreams. But the dream came to Joseph and he believed it. And because he believed it, he couldn't explain it. He just believed it. It doesn't make any sense. But at the end of the day, when he came down to where the rubber meets the road, look what he tells his brothers after Jacob dies. And Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for I am I for am I in the place of God? But as for you, ye thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. Joseph had to go through all that to what? Save his brothers, save his sisters. He God used him to save the world because there was a famine coming. &gt;&gt; From the time Joseph was born, God knew a famine was coming. &gt;&gt; God ordained the famine. [laughter] He ordained the birth of Joseph and because of those things he wanted to glorify the God of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to show who was the blessed one. Amen. The I like this the chosen one of that family. Right? &gt;&gt; Who he was going to be a prophet, right? &gt;&gt; And God allowed all those things to transpire. Let his brothers get envious and jealous and and hateful and sell him and this this and treat him like garbage. What? So the not only his brothers but everyone could be saved. &gt;&gt; And Christ did the exact same thing. &gt;&gt; Now here's the best here's one of the best examples in the time of David. [clears throat] We know the story of David. A man after God's own heart. I absolutely adore David. And we know what took place when he decided to stay home from battle. He went and took Uriah's wife, Basheba, did a secret sin. Correct. David took permissive will. Now I want you to notice something here. This right here picks up right here where Nathan the prophet comes to David. Right? Is there any record in the scripture where Nathan first comes to Basheba? Basheba. Why are you out bathing at night in front of the king? Don't you know you is there any rebuke to search the scriptures any rebuke to Bashiba? No. Wait a sec. You're telling me that that she was not in fault. [laughter] Now, as Nathan bypasses Basheba, he goes right to the real problem. &gt;&gt; Basheba was bathing. She couldn't call her maid servant say, "Go get David. Bring him over here." She didn't have the power to do that. She was out bathing. I like how brother Brookie say she knew what she was doing. But now as Nathan advances now to David, for thou did it secretly. But I will do this thing before all Israel, before the son. And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord, against Uriah, against Basheba, against this child in Bashibba's womb, against Israel, against the office of a king. &gt;&gt; See, God, and of all our failures is we are sinning against God. &gt;&gt; Even amongst each other, if I do this brother wrong, this this I have to repent to him. But I've also if I if I did something say brother I'm so sorry forgive me please forgive me brother don't my charge I would have to also repent to God as my savior because like the brother bram dealing with the the husband the wife and they both had affairs this this had to make it right on every side remember in discernment line she comes up brother said he says hey remember before the war when your husband off the war and you went to this she goes how do you know that I've already made it right with God see she made made it right with God, but she never made it right with her husband. &gt;&gt; But it's the same way. If she'd have made it right with her husband, but not told God or repented from God, it's still with her. &gt;&gt; Everything must be clean. &gt;&gt; There was a sermon about a year ago, Brother McBride came here and I listened to it and I'll never forget what he said. He said, "God is not going to let his bride get away with nothing." &gt;&gt; You remember that? I listen that sermon. I was like, "Woo, that thing was burnt into my heart. I said, "Lord, keep me clean. Cleanse me. Don't let me get away with nothing. Let saints of God, let me repent of every sense." God, since that time, I've been able to go on Facebook, contact some of my old college friends, college buddies, fraternity, sorority, and start making things right one by one. Things I had forgotten, I did, I lied, I did this and this, I did this, this, this. I've been texting them. I said, "Hey, do you remember when I did this, this?" And some of them were like, "Yeah." And some of them were like, "No." And I said, "Well, I want to make it right." And I had to make it right through Facebook. They said, "Simon, I forgive you. You're still my friend." I haven't seen him in 30 years. They're still my friend. He says, "I'm still your friend." I was like, "Praise the Lord." [laughter] But what? They gave me grace. They forgave me, saints. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Now that burden's off me. I didn't even know that a lot of those sins I didn't even know was there. I've forgotten all about them. But I kept saying, "Lord, help me to get everything right." And he'd bring this thought. I'm like, "Oh my goodness, I did do that. Let me look on Facebook." I was able to contact them. People I haven't spoken to in years and years and years. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. You know what you do? You when you sing to God, there's always this fear in making something right. No one likes confrontation. No one likes to admit their own faults and failures, right? &gt;&gt; But you know what I find? Just say it. Just say it. They're either going to hate you or they're going to forgive you. Either way, you are in the clear. The you have no blood on your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Now, notice David's in the wrong. He says, "I [clears throat] have sinned against the Lord, and Nathan said to David, the Lord also has put away thy sin, and thou shalt not die." He gets grace. David gets grace for this heinous crime. a death of one of his 30 mightiest warriors, his top 30. He Uriah was there, David's mighty men. And he did that to his own man. Was this in the will of God? Everything will work out the perfect will of God. Look what it says here. And David comforted Bashibba his wife and went into her and lay with her. And she bare a son and called his name Solomon. And the Lord loved him. You mean out of this situation, God could bring forth a child that God loved? &gt;&gt; David would have to pay for it. And he paid tremendously. &gt;&gt; He paid dearly with that sin. But I'll say it like this, saints. It was of God. God allowed it. &gt;&gt; Now notice, and the Lord loved him, and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jediah because of the Lord. Now, of all the ladies, of all the sisters in Israel at the time of David, why did God allow Uriah to have his house so close to David that as Basheba was taking a bath, he could see her? &gt;&gt; He was setting the stage. &gt;&gt; Now, notice notice the name play here. Solomon the Lord loved him. Solomon had a meaning. What does David mean? I mean I think David means beloved of the Lord. So the beloved of the Lord took a wife called Bad Sheba, right? It had to be be Basheba. It could not be any other woman to bring forth Solomon. only the it would not be Micaiah or Michael Mcccoall right Solomon would never come through MCL &gt;&gt; but it could only come through Basheba what does the name Basheba mean that word Basheba means a daughter of an oath so the beloved one had to pick a daughter of the oath and if you break this down that word bath part means the apple or the branch a daughter Sheba means to what? To complete to be complete. An oath. He says a sevenfold oneself. That is that is to swear by declaring seven times. So God allowed to pick David to sin this sin with Basheba because because of her name, she carried a sevenfold oath. Seven times is completion. Why Bashibba? Because the names mean something. Your name packs a power. Seeing then, seeing how it began in the church of Ephesus in the second church age, third church age, the fourth church age, 15 years down all the way to later see the last age in the Old Testament in the Lord willing, maybe in some servants coming. I'd like to show how the old how that the seven church ages typed in the Old Testament. how they began to just exactly like the beginning of the church age of the gentile church and went right down through a similar dark age and came in the glorious line of Pentecost at the falling of the Holy Spirit in the early church age of Jewish dispensation. Right? Seeing in the Old Testament how perfectly typed at beginning in Solomon. So David had to produce with Basheba why she was the start. She would bring forth the seven church ages of the Old Testament. Literally the seven churches of the Old Testament started with David and Bashibba. &gt;&gt; Do you see the power in that? What was the culmination? What was the end of this? John the Baptist. That that sin by David and Basheba. That thing right there ended with B with with John the Baptist coming out. And then who' it really end with? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He can take something that was done wrong and turn it into the coming of the first coming of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And you think your sin's too big? [laughter] Do you think that God is not going to cover your thing? He's going to work this out, saints. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. What took place the the time of Solomon's temple being dedicated? The Holy Ghost came down just like in the book of Acts. All the ministers had to stop and freeze. Why? The train filled the temple. Out of that union started this. That's that's truly amazing. Now, we're getting about an hour here. I want to jump here by God's grace. In the time of Judah and uh uh Tamar, remember the story about Judah? Tamar, Tamar married one of the sons of Judah and he died. The other one died and now Judah's like, I promise my next boy when he grows up, he'll be your husband. And she's like waiting and waiting and being patient this this. And when he become of age, he didn't give her to him. And Tamar was like, "Wait, what's this? What's this? We got to have a deal here. The deals." So what'd she do? She, the Bible says she took off her widowing garments and pull on the garments of a harlot. We know what took place next. Then it was three months later, found out she was pregnant. And Judah's like, "All right, you're going to die. Tell who did it?" And she had the signness of Judah. She said, "The man whose sicknessar is a child that I'm bearing." [laughter] Did she did she reap for her sin? Was she guilty? Judah said, "Thou art more righteous than I." Basheba was never at fault. Never blamed on her. Tamar not in fault. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. Can't we we can forgive but not forget. I I could forgive you but I always remember you done these evil things then but but you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of God the bride is justified. She never done it in the first place. Amen. You know I heard this quote. I was like I don't I don't understand this. I just don't get it right. Amen. standing there married to the virtuous son of God, never sinned in the first place. Why? She was for ordained. She was trapped into this. This is you. He's talking about you. When someone's preaching about the bride of Christ, bring it back to yourself. This is you. &gt;&gt; She was trapped in this. And now when she heard the truth come forth and the blood cleansed her, she stands there virtuous. No sin at all at all. Where's this? Where is this written in the Bible? [snorts] Look here. Let's go right to the be beginning. And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed in his nostrils the breath of life. And man became the living soul. You know why he stood man first? Because he's the head. He would be the head. He would be the husband. All the weight would be on him as brother Jesse said preached years and right in the beginning he talked about the hus the house band. He used to take the house and as it it would things would get bad and he'd have to keep everything together. If it started expanding he's got to move with it. If it gets less he's got to move with that as well. The house band, right? He's to keep it together. And now notice who does the serpent attack first? Who does he go after? The woman. But after the fall, look what God says to Eve. I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow that thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband. He shall rule overe. Does he say anything because thou has disobeyed the word? Does he bring the word in here? Eve, I told you or your husband should have told you, thou shalt not eat of of the tree of knowledge good and evil. Where does he bring that there? He does not bring that to her charge. But look here. And to Adam, he said, because thou has hearkened unto the voice thy wife and has eaten of the tree which I commanded thee, saying, thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. That commandment is allotted to Adam and not Eve. Do you know in the whole Bible Eve is pretty much mentioned only one other time as far as this. Look at this. And I suffer not a woman to teach but to you to abs you super authority over the man but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed than Eve. And Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived. What's what's the Bible saying? She was deceived. She was trapped. When the serpent came into the garden of Eden, he was setting a trap. There was time for deception, a time for beguiling, to morally, utterly seduced morally and utterly and in the mind. She was trapped. There was a trap set for her. And she had no idea. She was deceived. Adam was not deceived. In other words, he knew better. &gt;&gt; He knew better. She did not. The word was not accounted to someone who was deceived. But the word was accounted to someone who knew better. Now, in the Bible, when it's talking about redemption, when it's talking about salvation, there's only two people involved. &gt;&gt; And one of them is not Eve. [laughter] Oh man, I I never I never saw this until a couple months ago. &gt;&gt; If the bride is sinless and she never did in the first place and she was trapped into this and she can be married to the virtuous sinless son of God. The original sin had nothing to do with her. The original sin was held to Adam. Not the bride. &gt;&gt; Where's it written? Wherefore, as by one woman sin entered into the world. Does it say Eve? Does it say Adam's wife? Or did it say Adam part B? Because remember when they first took place there both their names were Adam. [laughter] But after the fall, he gave her a name Eve. But notice Christ here, the Holy Ghost says he says by one woman, not by one man. He says by one man. He doesn't even say Adam this time. He says what? One man. Sin entered into the world and death by sin. It was caused by him and him alone. He had to make the choice. He was not deceived. &gt;&gt; He says, "So death passed upon all men that they all have sinned." He says, "For unto the law sin was in the world, but but sin was not imputed where there's no law." What does it say? For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin was not imputed until there was uh when there was no law. So if God when he gave Adam that garden of Eden, so here you go. Here, this is nice. We're on the east side of Eden. Here's a nice garden. I got all this planted. All you got to do is keep it. And he would have not given a commandment. We wouldn't be here. [laughter] We'd still be in paradise. we'd be eternal. We'd be we'd be spoken word, sons and daughters of God, perfect. &gt;&gt; But God set the stage again because soon as he put this man in order, gave him a job, this, this, this, he gave him a commandment. And when he gave him a commandment, it set the it set the opportunity, it set the place for him to sin. &gt;&gt; We had to sin. We had to go into this. This is the perfect will of God. Even when all Christians are being martyed over in Kenya and Christians over here and this and this dying and the the world's falling apart and our economyy's they say in 2026 it's going to get bad. We don't know. But if it if it drops, thanks God. It's all the part of God. It's all the plan of God. &gt;&gt; It's his plan. This is where he wants it to go. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't because of the wife. It wasn't because of Eve. He says, "Nevertheless, death reigned from Eve to Moses, from Adam." Even over all them that had sinned after the similitude of Eve's transgression. All blame is brought upon Adam. [laughter] After the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come? [laughter] Saints of God, it is written nowhere in the Bible, it's your fault. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the sin. I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with this. You were trapped here. You were caught here. &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible does this link to her. For since by man woman man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. You know why it couldn't be Eve? Why? You know why Eve had to be deceived? Because if she brought that transgression, God would have to be a woman. But because God is a man, [laughter] he had to bring forth a man first because that man had to fall. If a man fell, take a man to redeem it. Amen. Jesus came as a man. [laughter] The husband, the mysteries between the husband and the wife. Ephesians 5, right? Or four, how it was, right? That's the great mystery between the husband and the wife. Christ and the church. This has nothing to do with you. For by man came death. By man also came the resurrection of the dead. Even as as in as all as in Adam all died. Eve all died. Adam. Even so in Christ shall we all be made alive. Now here's the beautiful thing. Adam was human. Human. Sinful. Was Christ a Jew? No. said he he was born out of the lineage of the Jews in the He came in the likeness of that. &gt;&gt; But that was God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That was God in flesh. That was a that was a a body in the likeness of sinful flesh. &gt;&gt; He was not Jewish. He was God. &gt;&gt; A God flesh. A GOD MAN. A GOD PROPHET. a god body, sinless. It could die, but it couldn't it couldn't rot. &gt;&gt; It couldn't see corruption. Why? Because it was the word. Where's the safest place to be? In heaven, on earth, or on the word of God. &gt;&gt; The bride is sinless. Now, you just can't say that and sin no more, right? Uh should we let grace abound in sin? No. But when someone who is receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they're sinless in the eyes of God. Now, here's here's the part. Here's the hard part right here. Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin? What did the Bible say? You are dead to sin. And if you're dead to sin, you're sinless, live any longer therein. So know ye know ye that that so many of us was baptized into see this is why that baptism is so important, brothers and sisters. Baptized into Jesus Christ was baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death. So that as a as Christ was in the in the was raised up from the dead uh uh by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life. For if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him. When brother Malachi got baptized, this old Malachi died right there. When you got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, your old man died right there. From that point, sin was already dead to you. But did we understand it? It's just like this. When I was when I was in the world in college, I was an atheist, a heathen. But then I had to have awakening come say maybe I'm supposed to serve God. And I started going back hearing the word. I believe, man, I'm a son of God. Then I come to message and I really knew I was a son of God. But what that revelation came almost 2,000 years after it was finished. It's the same right here. I was baptized in 2001. But are we coming to the revelation that the dead, their sin's already dead in this flesh? It's already dead. Our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should know serve we should not serve sin for he that is dead is sin sorry sorry that he's dead is freed from sin you're freed the only reason we fall and stumble is because we let this rain in our b m mortal bodies &gt;&gt; but Paul said we've got to die daily and not let this rain on our mortal bodies sin Right? &gt;&gt; So now it becomes part of us to battle. What was the promised land? It was the type of the Holy Ghost person. Right? Going into the promised land of the Holy Ghost. But what notice? God was going to give it to him. But there was still many enemies in the land. There's still many enemies right here. But remember who's going to get the victory? Who fights for Israel? Who fights for you? God. &gt;&gt; We still see some giants in here. We still see our enemies right here. But who's going to fight for us saints? &gt;&gt; It's not. Now, we had to do a little bit fighting, praying, fasting, and laboring for God, giving what? Uh uh being obedient to the word, but saints of God. And overall, he's going to give the victory. &gt;&gt; You already have the victory. Now, we just have to what? Yield. &gt;&gt; Every time Israel tried to go into battle without thus say the Lord, they lost &gt;&gt; without the leading Lord or presumably they lost. Saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here we go. Almost done. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof. Right? Two two laws. Look here. You are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning. This is the my message to the church now. Right before he leaves the world, he he goes off the scene. There's uh November 25th. This is my message to you now. You are completely justified. If you know you are completely justified, in other words, if you know that God has no sin against you, what can you do? Speak the word. What do you What do you need, son? What do you need? Well, I'm in need of this. How can God not answer someone that is not even guilty of any sin? All you have to do is believe it. The the prophet said, he said, "The skies are full of plent Pentecostal blessings. The powers of heaven are waiting for us to call for them. You're standing complete, justified, like you never did in the first place." Hallelujah. Let's stand here. I know it was simple brothers and sisters but I'm telling you we have to catch this full revelation and I'll say this when you catch it for yourself when you have this and you know that this might fall but I'm sinless in the eyes of God at that point you can have it for others I can be like man I just failed but I know I'm sinless God I forgive God forgive me I've repented and I can Look at this brother. Sinless. I can look at this brother. Completely sinless. A young man might have a struggle as this is. But tell you what, God's God's in control. You have, saints of God, you have to have the exact same grace, the exact same uh uh mercy that you see in yourself on others. when this comes down to it as far as like uh let's say with interactions with the church, if this brother right here sees me do something wrong, don't wait too long. Just say, "Hey, brother Simon, let's make everything right right away." Because things if we let things continue to go on here and there, this things it grows. &gt;&gt; We've got to cut these things right at the beginning. If there's anything anything between anyone in here. Let's get it right tonight or this morning. Let's get this thing all right. Any unconfessed sins, anything we've got against this saint, get it all out. Get it done. &gt;&gt; And then what? The the Holy Ghost can come and do mighty things right. Amen. I'm not saying this anyone's guilty of that. I'm just saying. Notice he said, "This is my message to church." Now, as you as we go off of the air, just in a minute, you are standing. If you're standing on God's word and with God's word, every Amen. John tit every jaw Jesus every tit where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the wheat where you'll get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did in the first place hallelujah you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and wash in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you've never sinned at the the first place. You are perfect. Musicians, if you want to come play, I know it's simple saints, but this is a revelation. It's written in the word. It's hidden in the word, but this is a revelation. Prophet says it even himself. He says it says we are the very righteousness of God. What is God's righteousness? Perfection. He's holy. He's pure. He's pure. Undefiled. Just like brother Pastor Jesse has been preaching on what? Holiness. The holiness of God. Brother said he said the the presence of Jesus Christ is different than the presence of an angel. You look at the Revelations one where John was standing before God uh before Jesus. He said he fell down as one slain. We're dealing with the all omnipotent mighty creator. And if he laid his righteousness down so that we could be it, it says that he Jesus became sin for us. It does not say he became sinful. He became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of God. If we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us. He took our spot. Adam took the spot of Eve. The judgment fell on Adam. Then we must also accept the fact that we are by union with him have become the very righteousness of God. To reject one is to reject the other. Are you the righteousness of Jesus Christ? Let's say it all in one accord. Are you the righteousness of Jesus Christ? Yes. And amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, accept it and go on. Believe it. If you have that drop into your heart, into your mind, saints, you can ask God for whatever and have full [music] faith in him that he's going to give it to you. And we know that the Bible says that it can't be denied. But the revelation of it is missing. Remember, the true church will catch this revelation. When she knows who she is, and when she knows who she is, she can do the greater works. It is not a is not real to the majority of God's children. See, [laughter] if you're God's children, don't feel bad. A lot of us are still waiting to catch this revelation. I see it in the word, saints myself. But I'm still waiting for this revelation to fully drop. I'm not talking about word form. I'm talking about realization. Cuz when it hits re realization, you know, you know you're different. You know you're sinless. You know everything about you is under the blood of Jesus Christ. It is not a real to the majority of God's children. It is just a good verse in the Bible. [music] But we need mean need but say but we need to have it made alive to us. That will take a revelation. Amen. All hearts minds clear &gt;&gt; saints. This is who you are. You will fall. This will fall. But remember, this [music] isn't you. Separate yourself from your flesh. Do you see with your flesh or is there a spirit? Is there a soul in the inside of you looking out of these eyes? Bible says what? The eyes are the window to the soul. The real you is in here. Look past this. Husbands, look past [music] your wives. Wives, look past your husband flesh. Brothers, look past your sister's flesh. Sisters, look past your brother's flesh. Don't get caught up on the veil. This is just a veil. This is just a temporary house. I'll tell you this, if you guys would come to my house, there's nothing fancy about my house. If you roll up in Grand Rapids, Ohio on 16791 niner, whatever it is, Wakanda Road, you pull up and your Google says you're at my house, you're going to see a little green [music] nasty house. The roof need I need a new roof. I need new siding. My roof leaks a little bit when it rains real hard. You say, "Man, Brother Simon's not a good guy. Look at the house he lives in." something wrong with him. You would be judging me by the house I live in. So, we can't judge each other by this [music] house we live in. We're dealing with 6,000 years of genetic problems in our strains. [laughter] Me and brother Jess. Got a little bit of Welsh, German, some Mexican, some feisty Mexican. Jess, they say the Apache warrior, right? A little patchy Indian going on right there. 6,000 years of your your forefathers, your foreathers, &gt;&gt; the sins they committed, saints of God, waring still here, but we have a God that's greater. Amen. If you need prayer, saints, I trust this was a blessing to you. Remember, it was spoken. You are sinless. Accept who you are. I don't care what the devil tells you, you are sinless. Receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love you. Lord God, we just pray God you drop this revelation to this this bride [music] here. Lord, I believe every assembly has bride in it. We trust the majority are Lord Jesus. Lord, but Lord God, Lord, we believe, God, Lord, that your word is correct. [music] That the revelation you sent from Malachi 4, Lord Jesus, Lord, and then we see it hidden right laying right in the scripture, Lord, Lord, that your wife, the one that will see not see death, and those that have even gone before in past, Lord, are sinless, Lord. and Lord Jesus, Lord. But now, Lord, as we approach the rapture, there has to be a people, Lord, how can we receive a new body? How can we have faith to receive a new body if our hearts condemn us of s something, Lord, that we're not guilty of? Lord Jesus, we ask, God, you would go into the conscience of every believer here, God. And Lord Jesus, Lord, you we ask you would purge their conscience of any [music] sin, God. And Lord Jesus, I believe many here have the Holy Spirit God. And Lord Jesus, Lord, those who are still battling, God, Lord, we ask you, drop this thought to them, Lord, this revelation, God, make it plain. Make it real, Lord, to them, Lord Jesus. And Lord, may your Holy Spirit, [music] Lord, cleanse their minds. Cleanse their conscience, Lord. Give them a clean, pure one, Lord God, knowing, Lord, you covered it [music] all, Lord. Your precious blood, the Holy Spirit, the token, God has made a way. Lord, we love you, Lord. [music] Bless the people in the name of Jesus Christ. A.
