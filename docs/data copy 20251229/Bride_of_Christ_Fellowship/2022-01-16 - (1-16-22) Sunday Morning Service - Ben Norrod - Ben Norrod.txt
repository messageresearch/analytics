to me the message of this couldn't be any more powerful now than it's ever been in other words if it's ever been powerful right now this message is something we all need to hear and i love this little song amen and it's about prayer and i believe in the power of prayer amen i believe that god almighty hears our prayers don't you believe that amen listen to samantha she's going to really sing amen some words to you that you want to remember all the days of your life you say i'm not able i'm too young i'm too old and i can't sing or teach and no titles do i hold what can i do for i want to do my part and i want to help the hurry with all of my heart i can pray until the walls come down till there's healing all around that's something i can do i can pray in my secret place calling on your name something i can do i can't pray my family shows no interest my child has gone so far and though i've tried my best to reach them their hearts seem so hard but can i do [Music] to bring them back to you for my family's lost and dying and my words they don't care then i can pray until the walls come down till they're stealing all around that's something i can do i can pray in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do [Music] now my friend you may not be a preacher you may not be a singer people may look at you and say ah just a regular old joe nothing special about him or her why you may not even be looked at as anything great in your own community but there's one thing that we know the bible tells us if a man or woman has been filled with the holy spirit that they can call on the lovely on the mighty and on the holy name of jesus yes sir no matter what your problem might be you can go right into that place and call his name and he'll hear from heaven

walking with jesus [Music] land he tells me that everything is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that always shines is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] praise the lord amen let's stand together this morning and let's get right into the preaching of the word of the lord amen do you enjoy good singing amen hallelujah when i say good of course i don't mean the technical part of it i mean the worship part of it amen and uh i want to say to little brother smith back here man that pin is sounding good you're going to have to teach me a few things when i get done with all this amen i like that i never will forget i had the shock of my life been a number of years ago now brother jesse but we've come into the little church for many years but jesse didn't have a piano player you know and you come in i was all raring to you know at your service sir and what can i do and do you need a piano player and he said we got one i said who i couldn't believe it i thought well praise the lord yeah that not that i couldn't believe it in that regard i mean it just really surprised me and shocked me that he had got on there and started playing and come along as quick as he did that was the thing because i thought well you know beginning piano player you know how they are you know mary had a little lamb oh not this kid no no he he was giving it all to it and i i said well i like that i i really like that amen sounded wonderful and you brother also so i don't want to leave you out wonderful talents wonderful guitar playing enjoy the singing and i was um listening to you outside the door there briefly and uh and i just thought the way that everybody's singing from the bottom of their heart it just sounded like real old-time meeting in here and i like that amen ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 if you got your bible i want to speak to you god helping us upon the purchase power amen the purchase power how many knows that we have power amen not within ourself but because the lord jesus has shared with us his power that's the only reason that we have power in the first place is because he has shared with us his abilities his powers his glory amen and how many knows he give it to us in the form of the holy ghost how many knows that that's right and uh looking now at ephesians 1. i want to read two verses 13 14 and i would like for you to read them with me amen as you're following along anyways and uh really pay attention to some of the reading now because paul is going to make some statements here that are very very very essential to understanding the baptism of the holy ghost so first thing we want to look at is the first part of this verse 13. now watch this close in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth now stop there just a moment look at that ye y e you'll pay attention very closely to the very introduction of the holy ghost and what the baptism of the holy ghost actually means the holy ghost to you is not a they not of them not a body not a church but it's always an individual thing between you and jesus christ this is why paul didn't say in whom they trusted after they received the word of truth in whom ye also trusted that is the real genuine new birth a personal revelation to you not to they not to them not to the church not to the body but to you individually as sons and daughters of god now watch this is the gospel of your salvation now notice you hear the word of truth but then it is the gospel of your salvation so what paul if you link this together with other places what paul is saying in other words you didn't just come to church in the word the sound of somebody preaching the word reverberated off your eardrum you heard it but that gospel was demonstrated to you for your salvation so it wasn't just the preaching of the word of truth but it was also the demonstration which the gospel is not just word only but power and demonstration of the holy ghost so he's demonstrating to you those very things now watch these in whom also after everybody say after after that ye believe say it again after you believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise so not when you believe but after you believe there'll be some old drunks sitting on a bar stool you believe god yeah i believe in god but he he says that and he does believe but after a man or woman believes god not just when they're on a high or in skid row or in trouble on and on and on but after they believe god then god confirms their faith by sending the holy spirit as a seal that seal tells us tells you that you have fully trusted in the gospel of your salvation if you don't get that i don't care how much the old drunk says glory to god i believe him i believe him yeah i go to church every sunday sure the devil does the same thing and got nothing to do with whether you're born again or not come on somebody talk to me a little bit amen it got nothing to do with it believing is only a partial step in the full process of it amen now the holy spirit then verse 14. now let's focus on that a moment then let's pray which is the earnest of our inheritance now paul uses two words here for earnest in the greek there's one word here arabhan and then there's another word could rio now uses these two greek words for the same word earnest the first one this one here we're reading audubon which he would say in the greek in his language of speaking greek or ever how they would speak on the street they would say uh are a bond or in other words this is a down payment or a portion of money that i owe you but then this this other word carrillo he brings it in just a little bit later we'll get to that in a moment i don't want to leave you standing too long but just just to put it out there so you're thinking in that direction for a moment but this particular now this is arabon which is an earnest or a pledge or a down payment of the full amount so paul's saying christ give us an earnest money of the inheritance the full inheritance may be this but he gives us a portion like this until the redemption of the purchase pres possession unto the praise of his glory so brother if the down payment is this good imagine what three fours and four force and the rest of it would be like the whole thing would almost take you out of this world it will take you out of this world one of these days amen that's why i believe in laying up inheritances and my inheritance is out of this world that's right amen my benefits are out of this world right amen now second corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 and 22. now let's catch this verse here and uh and then and then let's pray over the word now second corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 and 22. now we're in the second letter to the church of corinthians which corinthians is a book of correction and thank god that was people that was low down and sorry and rotten enough that could do all kinds of things wrong that paul could write about him because the rest of us sorry low down good for nothing people needed to read this amen amen that's that's the way that works amen second corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 now he which establishes us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god who hath also sealed us and given the earnest now this word is called rio now he's not saying arab like down payment now he's using a different version we would say of this word like for example if i said to you bored bored may be in english one word but it has four or five different meanings behind that one english word same idea here now paul when he says he hath given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts now he's saying this to anoint or to furnish with the necessary powers to equip with what is necessary for its administration so paul in just saying i'm giving you a piece of a payment but now he's saying christ hath not only given you a portion but he hath equipped you anointed you furnished you with everything you have need of to do the thing god called you to do before he takes you out of here oh we can close right there and say been good to be in church can't we that's that's powerful amen let's pray together over the word and father we thank you so much lord it's a privilege to be able to bow our heads to you and father you see our fragile bitter brittle lives on this side lord god we are needy people of you and your grace and i pray today that you will come into this little sanctuary dedicated to you father may you anoint our hearts by thy word and by thy presence that we might be receivers and sponges of the truth of this last time then lord jesus we know that it's not he that willeth not he that runeth but god that showeth mercy father show your rich mercy to us today now and open our hearts and lives that we might be receptive to that which you would give us lord anoint me as a speaker that i might be able to get out of the way that you can use me lord to be able to speak and we thank you for our brother jesse sister christian the family and the church body may you bless them anoint them lord and heal the sick and save lost and deliver lives lord make this little lighthouse shine as bright as you would call it lord catch every lost soul along the way every ship sinking misdirected lord not knowing what the direction is may thy light go forth tonight lord jesus from this little place and around the world even if it be thy will and bring every lost soul into thy folders we know you said you would never lose not even one lord i claim i'm that one they claim we are one of those ones we know we are in your hand and we thank you and praise you and we trust you'll come into our midst now and do great things send thy angels into this place lord with great supernatural signs wonders and miracles lord jesus though it may be quiet though it may be unseen deliver and drop into every heart the need that is laying before this body in the name of jesus christ now we commit the word both speaker and listener to your hands amen and amen and amen god bless you you may be seated for just a little bit amen may the lord bless you so very good you know pentecostal preachers say be seated for a little bit because we're hoping you'll jump up again when the word starts hallelujah amen but anyways we know that the spirit of the lord amen is upon me jesus said because he hath carrio or anointed me to preach the gospel the very same word that paul uses here for the anointing of the holy spirit is the exact same word that jesus uses when he quotes from the book of isaiah now we know that as the body of christ to be christians to be believers that no one i don't care what their name is who they are what stature or character they might hold amen in life of what kind of monies or positions or powers they might be in every man every woman come to the world shape and iniquity in sin my mother conceived me i came to the world speaking lies i was a loser from my very birth there was no under any circumstances that i could have changed myself mercy and ask for his forgiveness and then he justifies me forgives me of all of my past sins then knowing that there's no way no matter how holy i might dress or how righteous i might try to speak or how careful i am with my thoughts there's no way that i can sanctify myself then knowing that i needed a further step of mercy and grace amen by his holy spirit he sanctified and cleansed my heart amen that that i may not have been perfect at that time i may have had little things that i had to work on amen but the desire to want to do those things has been taken away can you say amen amen and then when he sends the holy spirit into my heart he does so so that he can lay claim upon me claim upon my body claim upon my mind amen this is christ making his mark upon you and telling the world telling you telling the devil telling all of heaven telling everyone around amen this is my beloved son this is my beloved daughter amen and whom i'm well pleased to dwell in amen the baptism of the holy spirit has been one of the most misunderstood subjects in christendom today the reason it's misunderstood is because man is always trying to figure the formula out amen but what we need to know if we want to understand what it is that's been sent into our heart amen is first of all it ain't our formula first of all it ain't our promise first of all it's not within our power to move into the baptism of the holy ghost this is a work that christ and christ alone can do you can't do it by joining a church or believing a message or why following a prophet amen you can't do it by following a pastor or a teacher an evangelist for that matter amen you receive the holy spirit amen when christ deems your vessel amen is worthy of reception of that holy spirit that's right amen not how long your hair is or your dress amen and i'm going to go on the other side not even how long your tongue is amen amen christ ain't looking for a perfect individual he never come to save perfect people he came to save those that could believe him amen and shove aside all unbelief though they might struggle though they might fight though they might wrestle with that own personal unbelief but christ is looking for a willing man or woman that'll throw themselves before jesus christ and say here am i lord send me amen here am i willing hearts let me tell you something brother one reason that we don't have more evangelists on the field today they're not willing amen it's a hard life amen you got to struggle from church to church service to service to service amen it's either a fight dealing with traffic amen and contrary people on the road or a fight dealing with traffic and contrary people in church it's a battle amen amen no matter where you're at or what you're going amen it's a tough thing some preachers well i'll just work me a job preach to a couple times a year amen just do a little work for the lord amen but there's no suffering amen there's no suffering involved they live a cushy life in a nice house and a nice home amen and everything is hunky-dory we say down in the south amen but god is looking for a man willing willing to get on the road to go out into the jungles and be a missionary looking for someone willing to sacrifice the things of this life to do the works of the lord and brother jesse that's what he's looking for in his in his saints that's what he's looking for in his bride that's what he's looking for in his ministers that's what he's looking for in his singers and his officers is someone willing to pay a price amen pay a price for the glory of god and jesus christ if we want to be recipients of the holy ghost we've got to be willing to lay down some things we've got to be willing to lay our life into the hands of someone that we're not even sure is around us sometimes we don't see him we don't taste him we don't uh touch him we don't feel him and we don't hear him often amen many hours of the day you'll go and not even feel like the holy spirit is around you and yet he tells us read a book that you're not sure is his and trust a presence you're not sure is there amen and believe on a promise that you're not really even sincere wasn't invented in hollywood somewhere another amen but christ in the very same token still tells us lay all of that imagination aside lay all of that fictitious aside amen and put your confidence in me and let me tell you something brother sister if a man or woman is willing to take god at his word amen he will come on the scene he will prove himself he will manifest himself he will show himself he comes to those that are looking for him and expecting him to do great things in their midst right but it's difficult at first to believe such things it's hard at first to have it in your mind okay this god i can't see him where is he amen the agnostic will tell you all it's just a thing in your mind all of that is just positive self-talk all that thing you think is the lord speaking to you that's just that's just you being a happy person and believing in yourself amen but yet at the very same time amen if man is so powerful within himself then please tell me why the jails are full of people that did things and don't know why they did it amen tell me why that the psychological clinics are full of people that have no ability to just positive thank themself out of depression out of suicide out of all of the bipolarism and the manifold things that they're facing amen if man is so powerful amen then maybe the satan worshipers are right amen do you realize that the religion of satanism is not a religion of worshiping the devil you got that wrong if you think that what they actually believe is that man is both god and the devil and that man is his own maker of his own good and his own maker of his own enemy and his own evil and his own satanic something amen it's not they fall down at some altar and go oh lucifer that's just a bunch of hollywood and fantastic the real essence of satan worship is man empowering himself to believe that his evil is necessary and as good as necessary my god i wish somebody would preach with me right now amen that's exactly what satan told eve in the garden of eden you follow me and i'll make you a god that's exactly what he tried to do amen empower her with the ability to do god-like things but brother let me tell you something amen when the voice of the lord come walking in the cool of the evening amen man both man and woman ran ahead from god and covered themselves believed at the fear of the voice of him who has the real control in our lives amen adam didn't have the mental prowess or the mental strength of the mental ability amen to stand in the face of god and tell a bald-faced lie amen and man still doesn't have the ability to make his own evil his own good i agree he's been born off a tree of knowledge of good and evil but this is why he must be born again amen he cannot make his own fortune he cannot fulfill his own destiny we hear the expression you know that a man is a maker and a master of his own directions that's a lie and if you want to make god laugh if you know every time in your life you ever want to you tell god a joke tell him your plans amen because one thing's for sure whatever you tell the lord amen it's like a father laughing at a small child amen trying to drive a car about four or five years old going going down the road run run run amen and we laugh at them why because we know they don't have the ability to drive that car amen that's about the way it is with human today amen we make our own plans make our own destinies we set five-year goals 10-year goals amen but my bible tells me amen don't go into a city and say we'll make so much money today amen and stay here for a year but say if the lord be willing we'll do the things that god wants us to do amen we have as we sing the song we have no promise of tomorrow amen jesus said don't even think about it that's a hard thing to do isn't it i mean i don't mind telling you that as a a planner i'm an ambitious person that god's made me in a way that i like to see things 15 years down the steps but i've come to find out that everything i ever decided had to be a certain certain way was always the opposite of everything i ever planned amen so i've just tried to learn through the years that we trust god we have confidence in his direction have confidence in his leadership amen that's why i'm standing here 23 years later amen married to what i think is one of the greatest women to ever walk shoe leather amen she's got to be great she's put up with me for 23 years hallelujah and i believe that god leads a man leads a woman in the direction that they should go the scripture tells and i'm quoting now amen ponder the direction of your feet that's true amen don't just lay down and say i'm not going to do this or i'm not going to do that amen the prophet said christians are the most ambitious people in the world amen christ puts within them the ability to work and labor and achieve amen but they do so amen not because of their mental ability not because of their education not because of their standard or their grit but because they are following amen the leadership of the jesus christ and they know exactly what god wants out of their life amen the prophet said here you give me a man a painter a farmer a factory worker and so forth he said a man or woman that will fully surrender their self to god and trust god and put him first he said i'll show you a man and woman that'll be successful in spite of all the devil throws at him amen right we talk about success but we talk about it from the context of a self-help book in a positive affirmation book and from the from the from the aspect of the latest latest of the latest of the top speaker or the latest ted talk and those are the ones that inspire us amen but jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added to you amen what i'm trying to say is that we make our own plans and we try to form our own destinies when we should be spending our lives in total surrender to the hand of almighty god there should never be a time never be a moment never be an hour never be a minute never be a second or a time of day that we don't stop and say lord am i still in your will am i still doing the things you want me to do am i still pleasing you am i still following you amen i think this is sometimes why uh women and forgive me sisters if this sounds harsh i don't mean to sound just you know dispassionate or to be uh uh fail to be courteous in some manner when i say this but i think this is why sometimes women will get so upset when they lose a baby amen or they go through a miscarriage or you know some tragedy will happen and a child will die amen it's not the connection as much as as is that's a natural thing of course if a woman carries this baby say nine months and then it's still born well sure that makes sense why that it would affect her but i think the deeper reason some can't get over such loss like that is because we make our own plans and because we can carry a child within our body we begin thinking or a father can propagate life we begin thinking that we have control over that child's destiny amen we don't this is why the bible said train them in the way they should go when we train somebody we train them amen hoping that they will listen to wise counsel rather than become a robot regurgitating everything we tell them we can't control their destiny i was thinking about it in the office i thought you know lord you've given me a wonderful family some wonderful girls and i was thinking of brother jesse and his family and how nice it's been that the lord has given him kids that want to serve the lord and help him in the church and i was thinking of that but i thought yes but at the same time you know and my girls are in church amen and they love the lord i believe and i i told them just yesterday you know i said i'm waiting on the hour when you get to a spot to where you can receive the holy ghost and i told him until that hour arrives i'm your holy ghost until that time comes i'm the one going to watch out for you and protect you and mama and i are going to keep our watchful eye on until jesus can take over but this is the reason we dedicate him at the altar this is the reason we give him to the hands of god because think of it as much as we try to raise our kids in a christian environment amen that alone is not the destiny of a child amen god is the one that shapes look how many drunkard homes and drug addict-type homes that christ amen will snatch them right out of that home amen and give them a life worthy of the gospel amen now that's not to say we don't want to do our part we want to do everything we can to serve the lord amen and teach our kids to serve the lord to the best of our ability amen but just placing them in church is not going to put them in a condition to where that god's predestination will be overrode amen but when we lose children in this world maybe a baby will die amen or a woman cannot carry a child to birth maybe she's barren amen we get so upset and so tore up but brother sister unless we forget amen it was paul that quoted my it was god that separated me from my mother's womb amen meaning that it was god who gave the life god who brought it in this world god who took it out amen and what i'm trying to say is we get so upset because we feel like the power has been stripped from us but no man can give life no woman can give life though she might give birth she can't give life it takes god to give life and forgive me sisters i don't know your background your past i don't know i hope i'm not saying something that sounds ugly or out of the way i'm trying to show you a spiritual principle to what i'm saying amen just the same exact thing when god will take a loved one go to the other end of life now amen and you look and you see that uh you know maybe maybe some teenager get killed on the road some drunk driver hit him at a party one night or some kind of a thing some boy coming from the church amen and he's dead now they'll go to the casket wheel more and we'll cry of course we miss him of course we feel the loss of course we carry that burden within our spirit within our body and our mind amen we'll go through the seven steps of grieving and those things we'll go through the denial we'll go through the acceptance we'll go through all of those things amen but while we're standing by the casket lest we forget it was god who taketh it's who giveth amen he's the one that shows mercy and he's the one we have to learn to trust in all things amen it's the same way while we're living here in life if god gives us a life amen and your man lives say to be 20 30 40 50 60 years old amen the bible said that god promised us 70 years but then paul turns around and said but for this cause many are weak and sickly and many sleep that means dead amen the reason some of them had to go prematurely amen it's because they wouldn't be obedient to christ in his word and if you are a believer amen and truly a genuine saved believer if you won't be obedient to him he'll let your life be cut short of your three score in 10. what i'm trying to say is that at the end of the day we need to understand that in order to be a christian we must relinquish all control amen from birth from conception to life to death our journey and where we go all of it has to be committed and dedicated to the hands of the master of life now is he the master of it he's the creator of it amen but we get so upset when that job don't come through we get so objection set when that rays don't come through we object to god in his presence why'd you make it like that lord paul addresses that in the book of corinthians or excuse me in the book of romans when he says amen can the potter amen can the clay say to the potter why did you make me this way amen it's not my choice it's not my decision as a matter of fact the apostle paul tells us here later in the book of ephesians as you're coming down amen into a few places that the weakness of the law amen and i want to tell you something we'd put so much on our free moral agency and our choice and how we choose i believe that a man has to say yes to god but let me tell you what it probably looks like the truth of the matter is amen we cracked the door just enough for him to jam his foot in there so he can take over amen because you know how it is we choose one thing today and then decide that choice wasn't good the next day amen if you don't believe that just watch everybody after church when you're trying to figure out where to go eat amen it goes to prove that even though we are free moral agents there is a weakness in our own choosing brother jesse amen i'll serve him today but in six months when the trials are hard i will decide that it's over with and i'm done serving the lord amen brother that's why i'm so thankful to stand here before you this morning and say thanks be to god that i had no say in the matter once i relinquish my control amen he that began this good work is he that will finish this work to the day of jesus christ amen i just say yes long enough for him to get in charge and when he takes charge and he takes over and he takes control praise be to god amen that's the moment that i can now say i am bought with a price i am not my own in that wonderful think about it in this way we think to ourselves why did god make me this way why did god make me and shape me in a certain direction why am i the kind of man that i am or the kind of woman i am it's because god understands what is needed to make the body do what it needs to do and it is honestly the truth i'll say this to you it is honestly the truth that the only reason we feel bad about ourselves by the way we look or the way we dress or whatever is because we're living in an eden that satan has created for himself and in this satan's eden in this place we live in amen folks that are doing the things they do and acting the way they act and behaving the way they behave a lot of it is the influence of technology and hollywood and all of these other things because let me tell you something sister amen i don't care how big your nose is when you get to heaven nobody cares amen i don't they're not going to care whether you have curly hair or straight hair amen whether you're asian or whether you're a man african-american or or anglo-saxon why does sugar like me they don't care amen god is every bit a bouquet of humanity and he's not looking none of us will be walking up streets of gold saying why is she wearing red red looks so bad on that lady amen they won't think that way but we're a product of an age of people amen that for 6 000 years have tried to take their own destinies in their hand and let me tell you how powerful man is amen i'm reading from the book of genesis now amen i can't stop and read all these things we'll be here all afternoon so i got to keep quoting amen i'm just trusting you'll do the homework all right amen you do the homework and i'll give you the assignments amen but watch in the bible god said we went down and we looked and we saw a man building the tower of babel and his ambition was so great to get to heaven that he would achieve the thing that he wanted to do one mind one accord amen and god said let us go down and confuse them amen less man a ch the things that he was trying to achieve you see because where there is unity there is power amen when people get in one mind and one accord there is power in that process once they dedicate and commit themselves to being in unity amen there's power in it if you don't think so just look at a sports team amen as we was coming over the uh ohio river yesterday we hit right at the time that the bengals had won their playoff thing and and the fireworks the orange fireworks were going up all around the stadium and they were just hooping and hollering and we looked up you could see the you know the stands going way up to the top with fans all dressed in orange and the bengals colors and people hollering who day who day who they you know and and going on going on going on amen and as we were crossing over there i thought to myself yes amen it's a team amen that may not have had the best players but it was a team that had unity they got in the same mind the same goals they all work for that goal amen nobody stops and looks back at the tape and says you know what i didn't like the color of my uniform there amen i didn't like the way my right shoe felt i didn't like the way amen the coach yelled at me no they had a vision they had a goal and once they got in unity of that goal and that vision amen they drove for that vision and laid all of that petty stuff aside i hope you're spiritual amen i hope you're listening to me amen this is what the apostle paul tells us amen let's hide every weight that easily besets us let's hide every stumbling and petty thing amen and press to the mark of the high calling in jesus christ amen get in one mind and one accord and man has great power however when man begins to achieve if he achieves outside of the will of god it will always come to naught quoting from the book of psalms now david made this remark he said i considered the green bay tree he said i looked at man how that he prospered and the wicked how they come up and made money and they had houses and riches and popularities and things he said but as i considered this tree and all of its beauty and all of its strength and all of its glory eventually it died and it withered away and became nothing you see when we look at other people's lives and we judge ourself by them amen the apostle paul said we're unwise doing that he said they were unwise in his day when they measured themselves against themselves because you see no man can add one cubic to his stature just by positive affirmation positive thinking he can't add one a cubit uh one hair to his head or less believe me if you could add hair to your head amen i'd sit in a dark room for six days and do nothing but think about a full beautiful head of hair hallelujah are with me now what i'm trying to tell you is that the destiny of a human being is in the hands of god you say what's this got to do with the earnest money what i'm trying to say to you is that the promise of the inheritance of the saints of god amen is out of my control from the moment i took the breath of life and all i can do is surrender surrender surrender surrender amen and let jesus have control of every area of my life and every spot amen and keep walking in that willingness and that submission until the redemption of the purchase praise of his glory and the purchase possession notice paul said christ hath furnished us let me stop here a moment in other words what i'm trying to show you i'm paralleling i'm doing what they call in school a compare and contrast i'm trying to contrast for you our abilities versus god's ability but now i want to compare to you what god's put in man now let me read just a couple statements from the prophet of god first i want to quote to you amen from the patmos vision brother man said a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent now wait he didn't say a man was omnipotent he said a man fully surrendered to god was omnipotent it doesn't mean that if you're just a man that you're omnipotent like i said devil worship that's the idea behind satanism i don't encourage you to read just read the satanic bible but as a minister i've read them all from the quran to you name them amen when i was in africa some years ago i had it on my kindle i went through the satanic bible a preacher said to me my god what's the matter with your brain i said you got to know how your enemy punches if you want to punch back amen so i don't encourage it i not you know maybe too much for you but as a preacher you study things that other people may not touch but i was i was absolutely dumbfounded to see the principle of it was empowerment self-empowerment self-empowerment i'm gonna say something to you i hope you catch me but that's exactly a lot of these self-help books that you see and all these empowerment books you see brother it's the very principles of satanism hiding in a very pretty cover man cannot empower himself this is what i'm trying to tell you this is why that i read to you these two greek words and their definitions amen that if the earnest of the holy spirit is christ's portion placed inside of you and that portion placed inside of you is christ doing the furnishing christ doing the equipping christ doing the anointing amen christ can you ready to complete your job amen then you have nothing in it it's not you or your education right or how much you might do in school or how much you might do in a trade how much plumbing you've learned or how many carpentry uh skills you might acquire none of that has spiritual value to the son of god or a daughter of god amen it might help you get you a job it might help pay your life bill but it ain't got nothing to do with your soul amen these things are just tools that we use to get along in life as the scripture tells us that if a man won't work and provide for his own he's worse than an infidel he's denied the faith amen the bible said you don't eat because you're not working so if you want to eat make sure you work right christians aren't lazy people they don't sit around their feet up on a barca lounge or eating bon bons and binging netflix amen christians are people that are ambitious and studious and thinking about how can i fulfill the father's work what can i do for my family for my wife my husband my children my whatever amen and if there's no children maybe mom is still alive maybe dad is still alive maybe grandparents are still alive and in your mind you're thinking to yourself amen how can i be a testimony of the glory of god amen for those that i love and those that love me what i'm trying to show you is that when he says couturio the lord hath carrillo or anointed me jesus is not referring back to a time in in other words he's not speaking of a time when he decided to become god now listen i'm going to give you a little godhead here for just a moment amen i know it's one of brother jesse's favorite subjects it's one of my favorite subjects amen and him and i we've been up down that ladder so many times the rungs are all worn out going up down to godhead but let's not forget that jesus was not born the holy ghost he was born a man he was born of the holy ghost but he was not born the holy ghost the holy ghost is a spirit and a spirit can't bleed a spirit can't die a spirit can't feel pain a spirit can't be tortured amen but he was born of the holy ghost if you look at the scripture it said jesus was conceived of the holy ghost in other words jesus was the body or the temple that god created in order to place his life in so that he could express himself to humanity and we know that it was a bridge we know that it was a bridging of the chasm that adam could not cross back over to god amen so this body was created in a way it could put one hand on a sinful man and one hand on a holy god and bridge both of them together again hallelujah that's sadly what he did that's exactly what his mission was amen jesus's job was not to come down for three and a half years and open the seals no his job wasn't to come down here amen and expose the white horse rider amen jesus's mission was not to come and explain to us the vials of the trumpets nor was it his job to place the church in order amen jesus come to seek and save that which was lost and to give his life for propitiation amen i'm happy to say i believe he done the very thing god called him to do but now remember during the period of his life leading up luke 2 52 amen he grew in wisdom before god and man so jesus was not born a person with the holy ghost either he was born of the holy ghost but not born with the holy ghost now listen carefully jesus you'll never find one scripture in the bible where jesus raised the dead cast out devils or healed lepers prior to the river jordan i know this disturbs people brother jesse i had a i had a good friend of mine tear me all to pieces the other day about this godhead teaching you mean to tell me you believe that jesus received the holy ghost of jordan that's what the bible said amen there's not another scripture in the bible that you'll ever find that said jesus full of the holy ghost until he goes into the wilderness coming from jordan amen to be tempted of the devil never any other place does he ever even speak that way amen and what it was is jesus was not going to the river amen because he was a sinner who needed to get saved he wasn't going down there because he was some kind of a you know the dreg of society and he needed to discover himself and find his true purpose no when he was 12 years old the revelation was clear when he tells mary i must be about my father's business that wasn't making tables and making you know and working with wood tools and things like that and then he was talking about his father god amen the kingdom of god fulfilling that which was caught amen into his hand let's not forget that when jesus comes into his ministry at 30 years old it was the same birth year the same uh uh uh uh age uh a requirement and the same uh status of age i'm trying to say as it was when a priest would enter into the ministry amen at 30 years old just like jesus amen a priest like aaron of them could enter into the priesthood at 30 years old 30 years old jesus comes down to the river amen and he speaks to john amen and john and jesus were cousins by the natural birth they might have played together fought the sandbox together over the same tonka trunk amen but when that light of the holy spirit followed jesus down to the riverbank amen john forgot about all of them old years amen about all of that familiarity said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world amen and when jesus comes and receives the holy spirit remember he received it without measure let me give you a word picture the word we use for emptied himself god emptied himself in it's not like i take this bottle right here and empty it into another thing the bottle remains the label remains the cap remains that little seal around there remains amen the chemicals of the bottle remain but when the holy spirit moved into jesus cap that little ring whatever you call that little seal thing there amen this the chemicals the bottle the water everything moved into that temple of god there was nothing left on this side it all moved and housed itself into the holy spirit into the holy spirit into the form of jesus christ all right you say what was he doing all right watch him now luke 4 18. now jesus coming from the river jordan he's been 40 days tempted of the devil now he walks smack into the temple sits right down in front of him the bible said he opened the scroll open the book listen that wasn't an easy thing the scroll of isaiah alone is about that thick around amen was so many chapters jesus would have had to take time and roll that all the way out in order to come to the place there where isaiah said he hath anointed me lord has anointed me to preach the gospel but then look at the word that jesus uses he hath anointed me or in other words could rio he hath equipped me he hath furnished me with the ability to do that which i am administered to do and to complete my administration and part of that was to preach the gospel to the poor you see there's a lot of preachers today that don't want to do that part amen when they preach the gospel they want to preach the gospel to the rich because that's where the money's at hello somebody preach to me now amen they're not interested in preaching for the help of the people amen they got a different idea in that hallelujah he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted you see many ministries today want to preach to those that are already fixed because that's an easier church to work with amen i strongly disagree with that those that think they are fixed are the hardest ones to deal with because you spend all your time showing them how broken they are amen and you got to get ugly with that sometimes too amen i know we don't think preachers ought to be ugly but hey listen you had a school teacher amen no offense brother jesse's sister sam but you had a school teacher that probably yelled at you and told you to sit down and be quiet amen preacher's got to do the same thing sometimes amen you get all excited thinking i can do something and then we got to set you down and tell you you can't do nothing amen i can do all things through christ not myself but through christ which strengthens me are you with me say amen amen now follow my thoughts now jesus being furnished now what do you do when you go into a house and you furnish your house amen you might have empty four walls like this but then you put in a toilet amen you put it in a sink you put in a vanity hallelujah put in uh a soap and soap dishes and you go through the house and put in all all of the uh towels and the uh and the sofas and everything what are you doing you're furnishing the house to live in it you're getting it in a condition where you can walk in at the end of a hard day at work amen and kick your shoes off at the door and sit down in your barcalounger and pull the handle back amen and snooze for a little while pay homage to amorphous that's the god of sleep if you didn't know what i'm talking about amen where you can relax and rest yourself for a little while amen and enjoy yourself hallelujah you go into the place amen and set down in a furnished place how comfortable how nice it is how welcoming and warm it is and inviting it is to walk into a fully furnished house why do you think they stage them before they sell them amen they want you to go in and look at that house with them pretty lights hanging over there and that certain certain thing in the corner and that deal on the table and that certain little doily hanging off the side of a cabinet amen they don't want you to walk in and look at four gray walls and nothing on the floor they want you to picture yourself at the end of the day amen in that in that bathtub calgon take me away amen they want you to picture yourself there so they furnish the home amen to equip it for the purpose of selling it well my brother sister that's exactly what the holy spirit has done for you and i amen before we started our earthly journey he had an inheritance laid up for us now listen close jesus never came to give us our inheritance no he never jesus never came to give us our inheritance he didn't he came to purchase that which had been given before there was a son a moon a star or anything else you'll find that in the adoption of your questioning he never come to give us the inheritance that was something according to the bible how could jesus give you something that was already given to you those things were already laid in the mind of god before the foundation of the world read ephesians 1. he said without him was not anything made that was made going to colossians as well amen those things if you connect them together you'll find out that everything that was ever created god created it and everything that would ever be given to you was already ready for you then amen now mind you that clock's going to preach a lot faster than i am and i won't be able to get it all in again you'll have to do your homework on this but if you study them deeply you'll find out jesus never come to give you an inheritance he come to purchase it there was a lien placed against your inheritance because of your first birth and how you were born there's no way that man could inherit god's blessings now listen to me it's impossible for you to be a recipient of god's blessings of your own accord you can't do it that's why a lot of the prosperity preaching and the uh the type of preaching we hear today in the charismatic world and the denominational world and organizations of light even independence and things will teach the people that if you're positive you know old smiley osteen i love joel this is my bible it is who i say i am and so forth like that i like joel i think he's a nice man and i would certainly like to sit down and have coffee with him one day and talk some things over but let me tell you something as much as the positive message is appealing to a crowd that can fill up a stadium like church it's not reality in the powers of the holy spirit it's not reality brother it's not a rea a real thing amen to listen at a self-help book and hear it tell you that if you're just a little bit more positive that you'll have a better life let me tell you something if a man is running from the presence of the lord he could be in the presence of every positive speaker and keynote positive man and woman on the face of the planet he could listen to every ted talk in the world he could speak nothing but positivity every day of his life but if his soul is running from god he's the most measurable person on the face of the planet my bible tells me amen and that's more than the rest of them whether it be maxwell or whoever the speaker might be my bible tells me the way of a transgressor's heart amen this is why a man will put his gun in his mouth and blow his brains into the next world having 65 billion dollars in the bank he might have the money in the bank but it has no deposit in his soul to give him peace hallelujah forgive my bluntness i know we've got young ones here but amen this is the realities of life we cannot be in a position to think we have control that's the failure of the church today amen the failure of message people and preachers alike today brother jesse amen we've got too much control over what it is that we call church let me explain something to you coming into the house of the lord this morning we dedicated this place to jesus christ didn't we amen the pews the walls everything has been given to him tomorrow they could come in here and run this as a tax place amen you could come here and do your taxes tomorrow afternoon but today the holy spirit has had a place of dedicated for his worship and his glory we come into this we call this the house of god that's true amen but when we come into this place and we dedicate it to his holy hands we are not saying to him that we are just tell you what to do when you arrive we commit and dedicate the place so he can tell us what he wants to do when he arrives this is why the bible said where two and three are gathered i'll be in the midst in other words if you're gathered in submission if you're gathered in and your response is this way lord we want you to come and we're gathering because you're the boss not me you the boss not me amen the attitude of the two or three are god you do the work and you do the business and you handle how you want us to do and yet and i don't mean to make you feel bad i don't thank you as contrary to brother jesse but just using this remark but sometimes when you hear like brother jesse when he was saying you know lord if it be a prophecy lord if it be a tongue lord if it be that people are critical sometimes not that you were but i mean in general they're critical when they hear ministers speak this matter they think ah something like that well the reason they feel that way is because when they walk through the door of the church and sit down they are still in charge but let me tell you something brother that the holy spirit will come and find just two or three in a church building hallelujah amen that surrendered and subjected to jesus christ amen where he can use my eyes use my mind use my mouth use my body use my spirit whatever he wants to use i'm at his and it can drop down and signs wonders miracles and prophecies you can heal the sick raise the dead do whatever he wants to let him just see just come in and paralyze us so we couldn't even speak amen we just sit and look amen at the all the presence of god he can do what he wants when he is in charge but if he is not in charge then we are fighting against the wind right because in our minds we think well i'll do this i'll do that i'll do this i'll do that even when we're trying to song lead i've been a song leader in my lifetime i think i'm going to sing this i'm going to sing this i'm going to sing this i'm going to play it this way and people are just going to rejoice and rejoice in joys the ones i think they'll shadow and they pout on the ones they pout on the ones they shout on or i thought they'd pout on amen i preached this sermon i'll say it this way and i'll crescendo this way i'll raise on my toes i'll look this way i'll gesture it doesn't work it doesn't matter i learned as a young preacher it's not about the dynamics of how you behave it's about following the leadership of the holy spirit amen this is what the prophet called hollywood evangelism amen the idea behind hollywood evangelism is not a man that's got maybe a certain delivery but it's the idea that his something is what will stir the people that's hollywood evangelism amen that's why you hear preachers say if you come to church to hear me you're going to be a failure well that's true you don't come to the house of the lord to hear that man preach you might like his ministry you might like his delivery but you're there to hear what the holy spirit's got to say using his mouth to say it right that's why we believe in a five-fold ministry again if man is in control then tell me why the insane words are filled up why are there so many hospital patients laying in the bed dying of covet and and some of them hanging upside down on a hospital bed amen with a vent in their mouth and laying them upside down so all that mucus and thing can drain the other direction hoping they don't smother to death before another hour passes if man is so in control why can't he stop the pandemic you know what this pandemic has showed us how out of control and how less powerful and unpowerful and whatever else you want to say how completely helpless and hopeless we are without the grace of jesus christ in everything we do i want to share something with you he told me the other day i was thinking when this omicron come on i got discouraged brother jesse for a moment i heard him talking about the resurgence and how it was beginning to pick up momentum and i got discouraged and i said to myself oh god we have to live with another thing now now we have to live with this and it seemed like the holy spirit said to me but haven't we lived with cancer haven't we lived with diabetes haven't we been living with tuberculosis and whooping cough and sinus infections and the flu every year and haven't we been living with all of these dreaded diseases all along and i thought that's right lord and it seemed like he kept speaking to me it's like he come on the end of it and said but haven't you also been living with the holy spirit all this time [Applause] hallelujah and i got to thinking about that i thought that's right amen the bible said in him we move and live and have our being praise the lord it's not about whether we have to go through another strain of a virus it's whether we have faith in jesus christ to bring us out of the thing amen i was in the hospital in september i went in for seven days the last part of august i picked up the delta variant from my oldest daughter in school was i vaccinated yes had i had corona in february yes i did vaccinated march and april i was a breakthrough come august and by august i was uh i had my uh just the sinus the upper respiratory type thing i come to that first week of september where it dropped down into my lungs and with a matter of days my lungs were completely eat up with covet-based pneumonia i spent seven days in the hospital they packed me full of their uh their plasmas and their all of the antibiotic and those things like that and somebody said to me was you afraid when you went and i said no i wasn't and one guy said to me well you know you brag a lot about those kind of things i'm really not bragging about me i'm just telling you that the lord had given me peace before i went into the hospital that it would be all right that i wouldn't have to worry that i would come out with a thing and let me tell you something folks i ticked every box for not having to be able to stand here today as far as i was concerned i ticked every single box where i should be six foot under the ground somebody said they don't bury them six foot anymore brother ben is three foot i said anyway i'm under the ground either way amen but anyhow i knew in my spirit when i went in there something had said to me the lord had anointed my spirit to understand i would come out of this thing it would not be a sickness unto my death i knew that the holy spirit would deliver me at the end of the day from this from this horrible horrible disease that is that's swept the world and has taken so many people to the grave amen why did i know that not because i decided i'm gonna beat it amen not because i had grit and i decided like people with cancer i'm not gonna let cancer beat me let me tell you something brother when god pulls your when god pulls your card from the rack amen and it's your time to go you could be surrounded by the best doctors the best medicine and the most technological scientific minds in the world and still amen go to your way amen in the grave sign amen you take a man like bruce lee one of the most strongest fit put together amen as far as health goes an absolute picture of health took an aspirin one night and was dead within an hour amen his boy had the same condition amen what i'm trying to say is that you could have everything together everything laying the way you think it should be done and still never be able to control the true predestination of your life we make choices sometimes can i give you an example jonah had decided he wasn't going to preach in nineveh and jonah had decided he was going to run from the lord and jonah decided it was better for him not to go to the ninevites but it was better for jonah to go to tarshish and god had already prepared a fish a special fish that was jonas size swallowing and it was ready for jonah and whenever that fish amen come right around now and if you do the history on this you'll find out that from where he took that ship to tarshish way down there on the riverbank he went plumbed down toward galilee and he got on the riverbank where it was just a like a maritime type town amen and and nineveh was way up over on this side now we know according to history that it was the assyrian empire capital was nineveh and the assyrians and the jews had nothing but war all the time they hated one another despised one another now all of a sudden god speaks to jonah and tells jonah go up into nineveh and preach and tell them to repent could you imagine what kind of political fallout that would have created in jonah's home you know how people get over politics you know how sitting at the dinner table if somebody tells you they're going to vote for biden or for bush or for trump or for obama or whoever they're going to vote for it's almost world war iii don't worry about the nuclear bombs killing americans amen we're going to kill each other at the dinner table over who we vote for in the next election the fact of the matter is brother at the end of the day it would have been such a devastating thing to this man to admit to those jewish people that he was going to go help one of the greatest rivals that the jewish nation had ever come in contact with so he decided he was going to go to spain that's where tarshish was all the way 2 000 miles plumbed down to spain in order to get away from the presence of the lord now if you look at it on a map amen he started from the lower part of israel he started out this way and when that fish got him he took a great big hook and did a did a detour a a 360 or a 180 come all the way around rather amen and and we call it a u-turn you know what i'm talking about a u-turn did a big u-turn like this right back to the riverbank and he had to walk four more days in the desert straight back into nineveh i bet that old boy did some thanking amen from the three days in the belly as well amen in a whale's belly belly's well you caught that one didn't you amen in the whale's belly hallelujah amen three days three nights amen and four days into nineveh amen and as he stomped into the city of nineveh i figured them seven church ages had done made jonah decide i better obey the holy spirit amen and when it comes to him preaching his message amen and telling the people to repent amen not only did they repent but then jonah gets mad about it god i told you i if i preached to him you'd save him and i didn't want him saved it goes to prove that even though with a discouraged temperamental prophet god still saw to it that his children would be taken care of amen sometimes it's not about the vessel god's using in their personal identities and their personal characters and their natures and their makeup it's about a man just willing to do what god called him to do amen sometimes we look at people and say i wish they'd be this way i wish they'd be this way i wish they'd be that way sure i wish some preachers and some men and women would behave differently as well but again a temperamental prophet preached repentance and everybody got saved amen he didn't even like it when god saved him he told the lord he fussed at the lord see i told you i told you the book of jonah closes out with jonah in a bad mood and the ninevite's still saved amen i hope you're understanding me about something amen the holy spirit doesn't look at our abilities or what we can offer when he gives us this earnest holy spirit he is the one that equips us and finished furnishes us rather and finishes yes he'll do that too but he furnishes us for the administration that we're called to now in closing i want to say one more thing to you if you think in your mind that you don't have the ability to do what god called you to do if you think that you're not qualified or that you don't have the strength or the stamina or the ability to do what god called you to do then you don't understand the holy spirit that's living inside of your heart amen and show us the father brother brahman in 1955 says amen i've got it laying here in the message that he says that it's like a seed remember david said you'd be like a tree planted by the rivers of water but see god didn't plant you like a tree meaning that you wasn't just like a great big grown tree but you're like a seed he plants and positionally places that seed where it belongs and that seed has the responsibility to drink and grow where god placed it that's my only job just let god place me and then just keep absorbing and drinking and bringing everything god says my way amen christianity is not hard it's just something people have made hard amen and then as he grew into the stature of what god foresaw he would be the prophet said like this he said every acorn it was in an acorn tree was already in it when it was a seed so when god gives you the holy spirit and he gives you the new birth and he makes you born again everything you have need of even your rapture resurrection is laying in you right now you don't have to worry about whether you're going to be able to do what god called you to do now the lord might lead you to go to school he might lead you to take up a trade he might lead you to read a certain book maybe a self-help book he might read you to get counseling he might lead you to take a medicine you might need something for adhd or for ocd or for odd or for h i j k l m l p you you might need something that's all right if the lord is leading you let the holy spirit lead you he knows that the the mess the conglomeration conglomeration that we've been left in this physical man sometimes we need things to help us along a man said to me the other day he said well brother ben he said why would you even tell people it's okay to take a medicine for attention deficit disorder and the man standing there looking at me had a pair of glasses on a hearing aid in and a brace on his left leg and i said brother heal thyself amen physician heal thyself first amen the point i'm making to us is that we need to understand that the holy ghost knows that we need temporary helps in this life amen so god will drop handfuls on purpose to encourage us and to strengthen us and it might be using the world oh don't forget amen the wealth of this wicked is laid up for the the of the wicked is laid up for the righteous amen every time donald trump drops another million dollars into his bank i mean he's doing that to help me in some way down the line that's right amen and don't fear amen already i've been praying for 15 years or about 10 years now i should say amen that god would help me find a way for the government to pay my student loans all of this talk you see on the television out of god you can thank me later amen i've been praying that the holy spirit amen would find a way for us to be able to cancel a lot of this debt and help us with some of these school loans and things i'm kidding you y'all let me let him be serious amen but now what i'm trying to say is that i believe amen that god uses these things yes he can use people amen through massage therapy if you've got a bad muscle or a doctor to help you with headache problems and things of that nature amen but don't think that your resources of life lay in the external they lay in the internal what god amen has already placed inside of you let me give you the holy ghost praise god in acts 10 38 the bible said god anointed carrillo furnished equipped jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power it went about doing good healing all that were oppressed to the devil for god was with him this is why i could come along in saint john 2 19-21 and say if you destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up again he knew he had the ability within himself to take control of death in his own mortal body he knew he was equipped to raise this body i am equipped to do the same thing i could say the very same thing destroy this body let me die in a car right let let some disease hit me give me a little time when rapture time comes i'll take that same holy ghost life and raise this body back up out of the grave yes sir it will be the bride speaking the resurrection it'll be the bride of jesus christ speaking that voice of the resurrection oh you say that's jesus yes but i'll remind you paul said christ is in you the hope of glory he has no voice but your voice no hands but your hands amen are to be you speaking resurrection oh you say how can that be glad you asked me i'm going to tell you the reason the brine speaks resurrection it's not because she has the ability to look at death and say death i'm better than you actually when it comes to dying or the way that we die we get it in our mind that somehow humiliating deaths and things are beneath us we look at brother branham the way that god took brother branham off the scene great mighty supernatural works and things was done in this prophet's life and a drunk driver hit him on the road and he finally died of his injuries succumb to his injuries some weeks later and when you tell people about the message of the iron what god done through that mighty man of god amen they ask you how you die it's embarrassing but remember it wasn't beneath brother branham to die amen as an immortal human being would die as a mortal human being but don't forget the very message that is spoken out of our mouth amen we'll meet it one day and that very positivity of jesus christ will meet this body when it comes time amen and when he sounds from heaven the voice of the resurrection my voice will already be here to meet it hallelujah amen it'll be a deep calleth to the deep amen one magnet will pull to the magnetization it'll pull it right out of the ground amen and bring forth the resurrection if you can receive it you're speaking it right now but you're not speaking your own words you're taking his powerful anointed creative supernatural omnipotent words and you're speaking those words and one day your body will catch up with the thing that you've been speaking last thing we're gonna go amen the bible said isaiah said a virgin shall conceive first of all joseph was not the father mary was not the mother she was a mother to jesus but not the mother of jesus they said well some man said to me well you know how did jesus get his humanity i said he got it from the same place adam did adam didn't need a father a mother god was enough amen god gave him his humanity that's how he got it in the first place but jesus being virgin born meant that his blood was not mixed with the tree of knowledge of good and evil his blood was a direct creation from the tree of life all right now listen we're going to go when jesus absolutely was getting ready to be conceived mary had no idea that she was that mary the words have been spoken brother brahman said let's imagine isaiah might have got a little embarrassed when he said these words not knowing what he was even saying a virgin shall conceive he's a grown man probably had a family or something else or at least seen people with families he knew how children got here he knew virgins can't conceive he might have got embarrassed maybe he spent the rest of his life thanking lord i must have missed that how but i know that was you i know you spoke but how how 700 years that question hung in the air went around the earth and around the earth and around the earth and all of those scriptures about messiah were circling around the earth around the earth and one day a girl about 16 years old will say he was walking up a dusty road day and a man stepped out of nowhere and said mary hail blessed is the fruit of thy womb oh for that which is conceived as of the holy ghost what i'm trying to tell you is that our full inheritance is laying out there it's been spoken and it goes around and around and around and what we're doing is we are echoing what down here what's been spoken up there and one day it will match when that positive negative comes together then i'll just if i'm laying in the ground i'll just because see christians don't die they fall asleep glory to god right whatever age i fell asleep in i'll just wake up at the sound of the savior's voice amen but it's his voice but it's my voice yes if i want to know what god hath called me to do i just go to the man that called me and say what do you want me to do if i'm working a job and i don't know what job i'm supposed to do i go to the man that hired me and i say tell me what is it you want me to do we do the same thing we go to him and say lord what is my calling what is the position what do you want me to do listen to this the prophet said your body is not yet redeemed no matter how good how saintly or how holy or how much holy spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not completed yet it's just got the blessing the promise of god the earnest of our salvation i think we know what earnest money is but just in case you don't earnest money let's say you owe a hundred dollars earnest money might be ten dollars of that hundred dollars so the down payment that christ gave to us and our soul is only a down payment there's more to come down the road there's more that he's going to unfold to us and more that he's going to lay in our lap but listen carefully he doesn't give us the full inheritance right now because we don't need it right now let me say that again he doesn't give us the full inheritance right now because we don't need it right now he furnishes us and equips us with what exactly we have need of until it's time to go we go out of here the rest of it will come so if there are things in your life you feel like you're lacking if there's things in your life you feel like you ain't there yet if there's spots in your life where you feel like i'm just not getting to the place i need to get to don't worry that's natural that's normal every christian feels a way because we've only got a down payment we don't have the full inheritance we always feel like we're missing something and we will until our bodies change even those beyond the curtain of time listen out their words he said will paul's group be there yes he said then i preached exactly the same thing that paul preached listen to their words that's right we're resting upon that and when jesus comes he'll come to you and when he does we'll come back to the earth with you amen and stand and be judged and so on and so forth and he asked them do you eat here no do you sleep here no even those that have gone beyond the curtain of time standing in another dimension it's just another room like we're standing here like this right now if you didn't know what was behind that door there could be all kinds of people in there playing bunko and card games and video games could be all doing all kinds of stuff if it was a soundproof room you wouldn't know what they were doing amen all of a sudden you pop the door open there's all this activity and things going on and you think well what in the world was y'all doing here this whole time that's the way that other dimension is it's just another room beyond us we can't see it but there's activity going on all the time amen there's rolling fields of bluegrass there's women and saints and man amen running up and down screaming and hugging and crying every time a saint goes into the crosses that veil amen there's rejoicing from the angels of god amen there's powers heaven is a beehive of activity amen it's a metropolis of activity but it's just another room beyond us amen but one day my body is going to catch up with that rhythm my soul and my body is going to catch up with that rhythm and i'm going to step i'm going to be able to grab the door and just go and step into that place amen but one day that which i am lacking will be given to me amen closing amen preachers are liars i've said that four times hallelujah one one more place so i got to get this in amen in the message jehovah jairo the prophet said that's right he said you're looking at things today he said but listen and i'm paraphrasing now he said if there's no joy here he said then there'll be no joy there he said there's no love here there'll be no love there if there's no resurrection here there'll be no resurrection there so he said divine healing is a down payment of resurrection we know that god will change us and recreate these cells into the image of jesus christ take out all the sex glands take out all of the strains from your great-great-grandmother and grandfather you'll be more like the angels in other words you won't have to worry about propagating your own species amen we won't go to heaven amen and try to repopulate heaven amen with those in our own likeness amen we do that as fathers now our children are those that we propagate in our own likeness but when we go to heaven all of that tree of knowledge of good and evil be removed from our system think about it amen you might even still have the same nose but you won't have your daddy's temper you might have the same ears but you won't have your mama's impatience hallelujah all of that will be taken out of you amen you say why because that's the down payment that's the full inheritance that's everything he's come to give me is to change me in a moment and a twinkle of an eye let's sing together stand under your feet do you love the lord say amen amen amen let's sing buddy let's worship the lord for a little while anybody want prayer you're sure welcome to come i'll pray for you otherwise god bless you and may the lord bless you continually amen and just
