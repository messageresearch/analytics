praise God praise the Lord let's take a few prayer requests here tonight by the grace of the Lord hallelujah thank the Lord don't you love the Lord tonight praise God praise God just like to share a little testimony up a little testimony on Facebook last night on Saturday we were I was in Albion at a youth banquet and brother Brian and I were talking he's a preacher and he said he needed hip replacement both hips we need to replace I thought oh my and so I said brother let's let's agree to pray we had three brothers there he was one of them I said I said is there any Cyndi to confess he said no I said let's speak life into your hips he said he had a degeneration in his hips and the doctor said he need both hips replaced the doctor said there was no hope for him to get better I said let's speak life into that I said let's do that by God's grace so we join him you know he put our arms around each other and we spoke life we rebuke Satan in the name Jesus Christ and we just were just rejoicing and and I didn't know he was gonna go back to the doctor but he went to back to the doctor yesterday and they did an MRI and I talked to him last night on the phone and he said the doctor said I don't know what happened he said but your hips heal your body healed itself thank the Lord amen so before they said your body can't heal itself with degeneration but they said now your body's healed itself you don't need hip replacement she said you have any pain he's like no she's like do you want anything any help he's like no I'm just gonna believe so I just want to say thank the Lord and brother ayan said 'thank he said tell your church thank you for praying for me we prayed for him on Sunday morning by God's grace and in church you know why that meant so much to me because I when he sent me the text I was weeding outside and I was listening about the brand of my new ministry and it's all about the spoken word he said if you speak he said he said if you speak God's Word it's not you speaking it's God speaking through you so that's that's that's why we he got better it was God speaking his healing amen thank the Lord that's why I had two witnesses that meant so much

and we worship you in Jesus Christ name Amen praise let's stand and take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace I like to go back to the purpose series tonight so look at purpose part 24 let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 amen praise God hallelujah thank you lord praise God please ESDS chapter 3 praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God now we're looking at Lord willing tonight the tenth and the eleventh seasons or times here but we're in a please Ashley chapter three let's read verse one together and after that I'll read some verses all by myself but let's just all put our voices together for verse 1 after there say Amen all right so let's begin on three one two three to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven now I'll read verse two on time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn any time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose here's where we're picking up tonight a time to keep and a time to cast away verse 7 a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace let's go down to verse 11 he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the end I start from the beginning to the end they got as blessings of reading his word you may be seated praise the Lord we're just like to look at this thought here part 24 we look at the tenth and eleventh seasons and let's just quickly review I like to do that you know after I take a little break I like to review so you can switch up there Lydia will go through a few those review slides there it was in it kind of inspired to me brother Brad never said this specifically but brother Ram did say the moon represents the bride and the moon the moon goes through 28 days of its Lu lunar cycle different phases and then there's 20 a there's 14 sets of two so there's 28 different times and seasons and so it's very spiritual and I can see from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that Christians go through these phases Salomon wasn't just writing you know by his it wasn't just guessing he was led of the Holy Spirit to write these seasons out and so we can clearly see there's a time - in that there's a natural there's opposite seasons and the natural where you'd born and die like brother branham but then there's complementary as well where you have to die before you're born again praise God and then the Bible said you have opposites of planting and plucking up in the natural but in the spiritual and complementary ministers plant the Word of God in our hearts right and then things could get plucked up to which that would not be a good thing unless you're getting all the weeds plucked out of your heart okay but there's a time to plant the Bible said pause planted I've watered but God gives the increase and there's seasons of that where you maybe you've never heard a certain thought before but a preacher will preach it and it gets planted into your heart amen or maybe there's a little season where you taken the wrong spirit and it's got to be plucked out like I was talking yesterday to a friend and he was saying how a man came and was at their church and he was praying over somebody in unknown tongues and we know that shouldn't be done because there's no interpretation well this person later got a depressive spirit because this person kind of they kind of and they didn't know it - later but they kind of dabble in the message you know they're hearing the message they're a little with the Pentecostals and then the voice of healing and they're all kind dabbling but yet they were allowed to come in the church and preach and and this individual this preacher prayed over this person twice in an unknown tongue and it was kinda like a denominational spirit but a spirit of depression came upon the individual and then this other one had to pray with them until it got off them amen so see that's an example of we've got to be careful what kind of spirits we receive amen we got to be careful to prove all things and you were really thinking aren't you really thinking hard aren't you you ought to we ought to prove all things by the word of God but this is the case where something was planted in the wrong way and it had to be plucked up by prayer because immediately after that preacher came in like that and mixing you know the message with denominationalism to come down with the Great Depression and it kind of went through the person's family to church we gotta be we have to watch we have to watch what kind of things we say amen to right you'll hear me when we have guest preachers in if I don't agree with something I'll just say they say huh or interesting I'll say okay or I'll say nothing at all if you don't hear me flat out a minute then you know I may not receive it because I don't want to take the wrong spirit praise God but see there's a season for that now and the person was talking to me saying why they have to happen and the Holy Spirit struck me I said it had to happen so now you can preach against that and help people to overcome depression amen right everything we go through there's a purpose for everything amen there's a purpose for every season the reason you go through hard times church is to that on the way out when you give victory you can testify to somebody else amen and you can be a witness that yes you can overcome this - here's how I did it praise God amen but there's a season for that of course there was a season for good and good planting like we talked about there's a season to kill and heal and the natural medicine you know medicine will kill the disease and then the body goes to healing itself or God will kill a life take a life like Saul or spare life like Hezekiah for 15 extra years but in the spiritual you know we have to kill evil influences and then healing begins praise God James said that church he said when your gather together you pray and he said you kill one another so killing is like a church battle it's a church split kind of but God always brings healing amen to those who will repent and there's a season where to break down and to build up and the natural like the breaking down of Jerusalem and the rebuilding and the Bible said there's a time to break down strongholds the Bible said casting down every stronghold right that you might build up a stronger testimony for the Lord hallelujah and then there's life events that are weeping and laughing sad and joyful but in the spiritual its weeping praying crying out to God for victory and then laughing when God answers your prayer like we just experienced amen glory thank the Lord and then mourning and dancing is like you know funerals or or dancing like a church like I danced a few last month around the church you know I just had a great I just the Holy Spirit struck me just as I had victory that day amen and I love that I love to have victory and I was praying for God for more revelation healings and God has done that so we thank the Lord for that but they also type ministries because Jesus said John the Baptist made you mourn but he said my ministry is like piping but you didn't dance so see a healing a great time of healing and revival and miracles is a time to dance amen it's a season praise God we thank the Lord for that hallelujah and then casting stones here in the natural it's like tearing down or building up structures it could be gathering stones to build a fence or something or casting them way to clear off ground in order to plant a good field and but the but in the spiritual it we represented your worship because Elijah gathered stones that were cast out and to repair the altar for true worship so see there's times that your worship gets kind of broken up your prayer life gets a little stale right you're feeding on other things around listen to the Word of God and you need seasons where you you you gather them together and you restore your worship praise God Amen that's right these are all seasons and where they brother ray you've been around 40 years right we talked about that right and so see he's been around Williams been around a long time and can you brothers raise your hand if you've been through some of these seasons is that right all right Fraser well I know I have to not only been around 20 years and so you see it was very inspired Salman was led by the Holy Spirit to do this amen now let me go back up here just go back to my notes here tonight because I'll just kind of go off memory now we're gonna get to here but the one time embrace and refrain from embracing the Bible said embrace wisdom right so there's times where you're really embracing the Word of God right and then there's times of course you're rejecting any temptation those are great seasons amen we're not and we're not embracing a lie or a doubt or a fear or struggle or anger or temper we're not going to brace that we're not going to embrace on jumping to conclusions we're going to embrace waiting on the Lord for wisdom amen waiting embracing of course there's a natural like a marriage you know if husband and wife are praying and fasting then they don't embrace during that time or church problems you know if someone is out front of the blood you don't call them brother you might not shake their hand Jesus said it might like just make them like a publican you know and don't don't talk to him because they're out front of the blood and then there's a season to get and lose and and that's in the natural you know you you you have a season of gaining then you have a season where it seems like all your savings are gone but in the spiritual it's a time where you get revelation or you might lose the joy of your salvation right because the man said David never lost his salvation he just lost the joy of his salvation so we see that now tonight let's look at keeping and casting away because in the in the natural it's it's similar or very similar to saving and giving this is more like a this is more like saving getting and losing is just kind of receive it but here we come there's another season where you you save it you're keeping it long-term how many could say men sometimes your your you're saving long term other times you're not you're just kind of you know I got was my wife and I were talking this this this family that's got more kids than we do and and they were my wife was talking to to them and and they were just saying this that you know they've had a season where they want to save but as soon as they get an increase a big bill comes up but the person said I've got a choice I can either be discouraged that I can't save or I can be happy and say thank you Lord that we don't have to go in debt because the money's already here and it's here to be taken amen all right that's exactly what we go through see their seasons where we can say but their seasons where we get it and lose it and we got a choice because it'll be happy and say praise the Lord I had it in order to pay the bill or we can get angry and say I can never get ahead that would be the wrong spirit because we got to recognize their seasons that we go through praise God as some of them are longer than others praise God like job's we know the Bible said Joe went through his boils for months we don't know how many months but he just said months he didn't say years he just said months and so his season of testing was rather short compared to like Joseph Wright who had to save for a 13 11 years in prison I was on eleven years with Potiphar and then two years in prison 13 total years he waited and then finally in the thirteen years God God God magnitude his gift and he entities he's magnified by Pharaoh but he only had to wait 13 years for it right and we are we got to we got to keep ourselves from getting bent out of shape or discourage we got to remember that lay maker song that even when I don't see it God's working amen hallelujah we gotta remember that so that's why it's so inspired for this time because we're at a time where it's a dry spiritual season right but I said that the tears are bringing forth their fruit and we're bringing forth our fruit and my man says in the church age you at the end of the we see you don't see a lot of change amen on the outside but there's great change going on the inside amen yes and that's what we're seeing we're seeing change on the inside we're seeing more love and receive more obedience to the Word of God in our lives amen hallelujah see those seasons and times that lasts longer than others we have to be thankful remember brother ham says God lets you go through these just to see how you're gonna respond is that right he just wants to see how you're gonna respond praise God if you're mature enough if you're ready to go on to the next test amen but you first gotta pass this test amen right see we we all go through these tests we all go through these times and God is with us in the midst of the test remember we saw it last week but later said God is not going to push you through a pipe and call you an overcomer right God gave you grace not save you by grace no effort of your own you just accepted it but there's the seasons happen so you can experience being an overcomer so he can let you make the choice not force you to do it but he can lead you to do it praise God because you asked him to lead you did you not when you became as one of you he took full responsibility for you like the key of David right that's where the key of David on the shoulder and in the in the Middle East weddings you know they put the veil the woman on the shoulder to represent she is under his responsibility and when you got saved Jesus took full responsibility for you amen and he's gonna lead you but he'll lead you but then he'll let you be the one acting on it praise God because mother have said God will force you to do any decision it's got to be your decision amen hallelujah you've got to die to self you got to die to the flesh you have to die daily yet the Crucified the human will you've got to mortify the deeds of the flesh amen this must be done and God wants us to be an overcomer but he also says if you want to reign with me you have to suffer with me right so the Bible says if you want to reign with him you've got to suffer with him so that's why many of these seasons involves suffering it's a suffering to lose it's a suffering to be rejected right if somebody rejects you we'll get to this one it's going to be as hard it's hard with that one these are hard seasons of war it's hard seasons of rejection is difficult but it's it's molding our character so that we can reign with Christ amen Christ is not going to let anybody sit up there on his right hand and left member remember James and John's mom said can my son said retina and Jesus said that's not given I can't give that that's prepared of the Father amen so the father is watching which of his children are serving me which of my children are making decisions to serve me amen they're all going to be saved but which ones are dying daily amen which ones are choosing to walk in obedience to the word that they've heard amen hallelujah praise God thank the Lord and so we see we come to this season where it's keeping in the natural you keep money but then there's a season you want to cast it away and invest right so there's long term savings or there could be a season of of giving it away of investing praise the Lord and in the spiritual from what I can see by scripture without having you know a brother branham a full sermon of brother band just focusing on this stuff but from gleaning from the scripture and the quotes it seems like you have a season where you've got to keep your confession and then there's seasons where we may struggle like the lose one we may lose the joy we may cast away our confidence but see we've got to go through a season where we failed praise God so we so we know and we can relate to others who may fail and to encourage them and say you know I fell short to him and I kind of lost my confidence and I kind of made a mistake but I had another season where it came back amen see because we are we are ambassadors right the Bowers that we're ambassadors of the Ministry of reconciliation there it is right there amen God reconciling we thought we died you know we we backslide daily we know that sometimes we go through further you know more extreme backsliding me we'd say little more than just daily but we got to remember that God's in the business of reconciling us to himself amen praise God where we may seem like we're so far from God but God allows those little seasons and it's a law of contrast God allows that so next time we'll choose the right choice and we'll stay closer to God and we'll alone for God's anointing we're longing for his love luring in yeah if we're far from God we'll learn to hate that feeling and what would it be closer to God all the time amen that's right and these are seasons that Solomon observed and was led by the Holy Spirit to ride a bicycle let's look at 10:11 tonight by God's grace let me set my timer and let's look at these two these two seasons here now proverbs 21:5 the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteous nests but of everyone that is hasty only to want now see this is keeping or saving so our thoughts church we got a member of thoughts are going to be going towards we have to be diligent thoughts of a diligent are tending only to plenteous nests so we got a we got to have an attitude of thinking the Lord is going to provide for us we said all the time but it's true Jehovah Jireh we've got to put we got a train of thoughts to go right to that he's Yahveh Jireh we got to say Lord this has happened before I've I've lost before but but I'm gonna keep thinking that you're gonna provide because you're Jehovah Jireh Amen this may be the season where where it's cast away right and I I can't keep like I ought to but my thoughts are gonna remain that my god has provided great things but see when we're hasty when we're impatient Oh we think about is that all we think about is what we don't have remember the Bible what the Bible say the Bible said contentment with our godliness with contentment is a great game and so we know that we've we've reached a great level of Christian character but honestly climbing up that ladder of the cetera man you've reached a great level of character godliness when you when you have godliness and you're content with the things that you have and it might take a couple prayer meetings for you to get there but you can get there praise God it might take a little crying might take a few little more push play on the sermon but God can get you there but you got to be willing to get there praise God see what we have in our society is kind of like a it's like a pity spirit you know everybody wants to be pitied it's a we call in sports like a losers mentality like the Cleveland Browns I'm not gonna watch their games but they just lose and lose and lose all the time and and they the city just gets in a mindset we're losers we expect to lose same it but the Bible says expect to gain amen expect God to minister and be Jehovah Jireh expect the new season to happen amen and I guess they got some good free agents this year but it's all it's all spiritually it's all about our thoughts remember because we create an atmosphere with our thinking praise God and if we create an atmosphere of Dow and Lawson and I'll never have anything then how is God's were never gonna break through to our hearts amen where we could have faith and rise above and overcome that temptation not see it's like everybody everybody thinks you know somebody owes them something you know we don't you know God doesn't owe us anything he's the Bible said he's already done everything he's freely given all things that pertain to life and godliness amen he's already the Bible says in 2nd Peter chapter 1 that he's already given us every blessing amen every spiritual blessing has given my promise and we just have to believe it and keep like he said keep believing keep watering the seed or keep nursing like else Shadia keep believing and every spiritual promise will be given to us amen I'm not saying I'm the master of this or you may be this person the master of it but we've got to have the attitude like God is going to bless us and God is going to provide we can't meditate on the wrong things we've got to meditate on the right things see it's a season of keep I believe God's going to bring me a season of of blessing and and he's going to give me the things that I have need of for myself and my family praise God father send for he become as poor that deals with a slack hand but the hand of a diligent maketh rich he that gathered in summer as a wise son but he that sleeper than harvest is a son that causes shame so many times you see this with sinners or lazy Christians you know the reason they're struggling is because of their own effort right there they're not working like they ought to be and so there is a law or season of that that people can bring upon themselves you know we had some young people in our church a few years ago and and what we observed by watching some of them is the reason they couldn't get ahead is because they didn't work hard but church if you work hard God promises I bless you praise God amen some of these are brought upon ourselves and we got to make sure that we're being diligent we're thinking diligent thoughts God's going to provide God's going to provide but then doing all that we can do praise God so wisdom so there is there's a there's a season summer right so either gather than a season a summer is a wise son hallelujah so keeping or saving in the natural now here's a casting away in the natural and maybe you've gone through this lately I'll be honest I've been going through this a little bit lately queeny's 11:1 cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days so see you may not have a lot of bread you know in those days bread wasn't very abundant you had to bake it daily that's why Jesus brought daily bread into prayer you know you had to bake it every day give us this day our daily bread and so here he's saying cast your bread upon the waters you know you're gonna lose here for little C's you're gonna cast it away but he promises that it will return after a few seconds one day what's the turnover gonna be many days ii of I mean I love when God does that we love when God does that one time I just heard a sermon I was I was studying a sermon I preached in the past to write the current book I'm on and I and I remember this testimony I tried to give somebody a certain hundred number a hundred couple dollars and they wouldn't take it I'm like come on I feel like the Lord to give me this and they wouldn't take it and the next day in the mail I got a check for that same amount and that proved to me like God was in that I was trying to help them out but because they wouldn't take it god bless me anyway you know people say you know don't rob me my blessing or something like that and that's true I mean we want to give everybody a chance to give right Paul said that I want to give you a chance to start fruit to your account in heaven but we also got to be humble enough to receive if it's a season to receive but that's one time I seen it where it came back after just one day but the Bible says here with a natural investing in mind you cast away you might not have a lot of savings but if you invest some the Bible said I'll come back many days after enough for what brother Brandon my brother Ram applies this to your words program always applies the scripture I think there's four quotes on it he always applies this to casting out good words about people he said if you or somebody say something good about you you say something good about somebody else they'll say something good about you cash your run upon the water it will return you as the brother said in Canada the other day said yes brother branham Buttered so that's about right you see if you're just gassing upon the water it'll return buttered that's the way so it comes back so you do unto others as you'd have them doing to use that's a good thing to live by no we had that this year you know financially our tax return was was way higher than it's ever been this is the highest one we've ever had for years I poured into you know paying tithes and offerings ever since I became a message believer now I've never missed one as far as I know and there would be years where my tax return I had to pay in you know and but it was neat to see it returned after many days amen but then all my expenses came up and had to pay off are all these other expenses but I said thank the Lord again because it does return amen it will return it's based upon seasons boy just as sure as that moon is going to get brighter right now it's dark but just as soon as it's going to get brighter each day first you'll get your days will get brighter Amen your see your bright seasons will return early man it's it's the Word of God it's written in nature it's written in the world it's written in our hearts it's written in heaven highly God's Way will not return Lord amen the light will return hallelujah see Cacharel on the water it'll return you someday so the right seed you'll reap the right crop if you sell the wrong scene you'll reap the wrong things you can't go east and west at the same time you either going one way or the other you're either pointed towards God this morning with all you've got looking to him or you're pulling the other way you think sometimes you're going right when you're going wrong but you can't go to the right and left at the same time he said if you're headed left you're going left and you'll come out left if you're headed right you'll come out right you'll keep right I'm sorry you can't keep from coming right it may seem like you're going wrong but you're going right follow the compass and the compass is the Holy Spirit this word he said now this is another quote and there'll be many many there that we didn't even think would be there speaking of heaven for you know it's at that time that I believe that the bread that we've cast upon the human troubled waters will return to us on that day when we see the effects of our testimony on people that we didn't understand their actions sort it will probably be there what a day that will be now that's what I'm hoping I'm trusting that as well for us search it'll be foolish virgin unless somebody heard our testimony and then they moved away and got saved and got filled with the Holy Ghost right that that could happen but for many like Abraham and lot like the Bible says that's the time we're living in Abraham's trying to call out lot the bride is just trying to get more foolish virgins say - now we know there's a group that needs to be filled with the holy ghost in the bride as well but just as Abraham's ministry was the same his family so are we trying to save the rest of the family of God and we know you know I know the church age go to or the first version or not you know truly that your God we know that because they're not born again they don't have the full status of sons and daughters they don't inherit rewards but they inherit life I know that too but remember jesus said blessed are you and come and inherit the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world he said that the fish virgins in Matthew 25 now the effects of your testimony Church that's why you can't that's why I put your testimony everywhere you can put it on Facebook text it to your friends that don't believe send them a nice text sent them a letter put your testimony because you don't know the effects of your testimony it's like casting bread upon the water that's why I had to put that testimony on Facebook last night I've been kind of frustrated with Facebook lately you know but I still put it on there because I told brother Brian I said I wanted to encourage the faith of those people who are sick but it also has to be a witness against those who don't believe in divine healing and it may go and that testimony may have more effects and they say my if a little Church like brother Jesse's going to have a healing that our church can have it it may raise somebody else's bride he's 42 if a 42 of your man can be healed I'm 35 or I'm 36 or some at 42 year old can be healed I can be healed - amen he said it brings forth pleasant fruits and we'll see them on that day the wayward loved ones and relatives the wayward loved ones and relatives praise God now here's another about giving to the poor casting it away there's times and got to give it to the poor he have to he hath dispersed he that give it to the poor his righteousness in North forever church you know this right now the Bible said the breastplate of righteousness right you know you've got the full armor of God on when you're given to the poor well at least you got the breastplate on you probably got the word do but the Bible said a man that gives to poor people he's already got righteousness his righteousness endureth forever it is a righteous anointing in your life amen it's evidence of your righteous character you're doing what's right and that was in the Old Testament what about the new Amen well it's part of your armor the breastplate of righteous what does the wonders of breastplate protect your heart amen so what protects your heart righteousness amen when you do the life things it protects your heart you feel like you're saying Amen right you feel saying your heart in your heart you know I'm a child of God because the breastplate of righteousness for texts all Satan's attacks to touch your heart to make you feel like you don't belong and you're not a child of God that's why we got to do righteous things and ever feel like the righteous Amen that's right amen see it says it's the type all those armor pieces are types right when you put on the feet by minutes it when you put on the feet shot it means you're physically ready or spiritually ready to walk in any path of God in the nacho I can drive over there and help that person out I can go across the street and be a witness to my neighbor like last night I can do those things because my feet already but see that also means your feet are protected your spiritual path is protected hallelujah and so see your your feelings your emotions toward God they're protected when you're doing the righteous acts of God that's right now here we got to recognize opportunities let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we have therefore opportunity so we got a church we got to look for opportunities and usually you know surprise you you know but but God will that God will show you when it's your opportunity to do something good you'll feel it you'll you'll say well it's opportunity I have it to give and I've been asked to give or I feel led to give but I'm at a hard season do I keep it or cast it away and the church said I don't get a whole lot of real shout on that one but because we're a battle of this flesh man amen but as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so you got to recognize all this God wants you to do is recognize opportunities right now here's spiritual now here's where we just like we lose the joy here's where we cast away our confidence instead of keeping it brother and sister sometimes we go through a season where we just cast it away and the Bible says here that impatience is casting away confidence so you basically give up and you're no longer stead because patience means steadfastness you're no longer steadfast God's gonna answer I know it raised God God's not gonna fail me hallelujah he I'm patient he's gonna answer so that the opposite of that is casting it away Oh God's never gonna hear me I'm fending for myself I must upset God God's mad at me the Bible said cast not away therefore your confidence well I would Paul write this if Christians in a battle casting it away right he's writing Holy Ghost for Christians right the Hebrew Christians he's tell about Mel Kazik he's some about the promised land and the sword of the word you know discerning thoughts intentions are but he's got to inject this thought in here do not cast away confidence because every believer sometimes cast it away they go through a season where they doubt what God said that's not therefore we remember them racked up that $10,000 bill remember when he was in his evangelistic ministry and what'd he do he said I'm done but his his son Billy Paul and his wife his wife kind of had to have a I'm not gonna go there but his wife kind of had to help him to get back on the field he almost quit C because he was cast away his conference and church I just listened to a sermon this week where me too kept brother branham from quitting the field a second time I've heard one already now I heard a second time brother branham said I was about ready to quit I think it was in my new ministry program was talking about that and me too had to come up and say oh yeah there was but they have said I'm 50 years old I have I feel like I haven't done anything for God and both man said his wife kind of rebuked him and he said he liked it a little bit she said don't you know all that you've done and don't doubt it you know God God used Moses at 80 God use Abraham 75 his wife had to encourage him see brother Ram was going to cut he was almost casting away confidence I've done nothing for God but church listen if you cast your to put your testimony out there if you go try to invite people to church if you tried to share about divine healing and miracles if you've done that you've cast the bread upon the water a man it will return it to you it does have effects you may not see it but don't cast away your confidence keep your confidence Amen hallelujah I'll be honest I went to that recently as far as with miracles and God knows my heart I've never said this before but at that one day I went and prayed for him that first grader my class had cancer I fasted all day and I preached twice in song led I think one of the times to and I was in my prayer cause of that morning I fasted all day and I took a prayer cloth of Brooklands and I prayed and and I didn't see a immediate miracle and I went through this I really battled this for a couple months there I was wondering am I ever going to see any miracles again it was a hard it was a hard season it was one of the hardest seasons this is these last few months and that's why I thank God for the anointing cuz when I get up here you probably don't see it I thank the Lord for that ask God to forgive me right but I go through seasons where it's like God are you ever gonna do any miracles again and have I failed you I'm checking my life god I know I fasted and pray and I know I know I cry out to God I spoke to them of that cancer I spoke to the cancer all these things and we started we started going through seasons where we we cast away our confidence but look if we just stay in the saddle Amen if we just stay at the post of duty God will do miracles again we've seen two miracles in the last three weeks that woman's eyesight got healed at Camp Search and God just here brother Brian amen it's DS ins amen and I go through these two weary castle where my confidence I think I'm just a failure I'm no good wife I don't even preach am I even called to preach should I ever pray for a sick person again and we go through these seasons but the Bible said keep it don't cast it away hold on your confidence the Bible said you have need of patience that have you done the will of God you'll receive the promise what was God showed me I need some more patience thank you lord thank the Lord I do need it Church you need it I need it who doesn't need more patience that was when was that man that was January I think I wasn't prayed for him I don't think we saw America until last month June or May know it's early this month no it was SECAM invited me the first week of July no so we have to do miracles this month so we had I prayed in January February March April May so six months six months I'm struggling and Church I had a brother at Columbus I don't think I've shared this before maybe I have but the last time I preached in Columbus it was on an Easter Sunday and after the service we went up to the park for fellowship and his brother's name was Israel and he comes up and he's shaking he's just shaking I'm like well what's wrong sir he's way taller than me though I'm like what's wrong and he said he said I have to tell you something I said okay go on tell me the Lord he said while you were preaching he said the voice of God came to me and said I'm gonna use him for miracles and he said no no no he was talking about me he said that's not the voice of God he said it came stronger I'm gonna use him for miracles he said no no no that's not God he said the last time I was you're getting under the spirit and he just had to he just had to say that's God so he came up after he said he's I'm here to tell you God's gonna use you for miracles now we just seen - amen I'd like to do more we like to see more if it's God's will I got to make sure I say that if it's God's will because it's not it's not me it's not my word that God ever uses anybody for anything it's God just borrowing them like a microphone amen the microphone is no voice but gets God's voice speaking through the microphone amen and so that was what quite a few years ago now that was probably 2013 or 2014 and so see I battled this you know from time to time I'm just trusting now that God will give me victory to keep my confidence amen the be paid she like mother have said and church is so hard for you and I but it's so hard for me but believes that if I pray for a hundred people tonight and they all die I pray for a hundred tomorrow I don't know if I'd have the patience right now to do that but I'd say after today on my last night but you see how that could be so I just prayed for one I didn't see America when I get called down the dumpster do I quit or what Oh God have mercy on me be patient with me but see it's times and seasons God's taking us through these things to build up our faith to help us a shine Rider amen to come to the fore leg but in said the false light amen before moon the full manifestation of Jesus Christ in the bride amen so what do we have need of what does brother Jesse have need of patience now you could anybody during this whole time anybody could have went off out up to my wife and maybe said in private now she probably I would have said it but does your husband ever need patience and she probably said yeah now you were to do that but but if anybody knows I need patience it's mrs. Smith over there but you know he's not projected I tried out you know hiding my battles you don't just try to get out of the anointing so your needs can be met it's not about me my needs being met when I'm up here it's about your needs being met my gift not for myself it's for you and so see it's it's it's this idea of spiritually casting away when we start doubting or feel like it's not gonna happen but the Bible said do not cast it away you're gonna be tempted in that season to cast it away but believe hang on to God's word believe God's Word see cuz after you hang on if you hang on you'll receive the promise Corey now what is this word mean here the confidence it means boldness and it's basically you know bonus so yeah confidence is bonus but think about the loans last time you just had bold confidence to believe God was gonna answer prayer or boldness the witness of somebody or boldness to pray for a sick person or bonus to go try to win your lovin to Christ that's what the Bible said don't cast away your boldness it's another synonym acidnam for now and this is what Paul after Paul preaches on the full armor of God we've been looking at that a little bit tonight just mentioning a bit the Bible said that a fully armored Christian is praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me so he says pray for me you fully armoured Christians that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth with confidence a man who had seen miracles right a man that had raised that boy from the dead puck was a publius of his name he raised that young man from the dead after preaching all night he raised a man that had raised somebody from the dead said pray for me Church so I can be more bold that I'll have more confidence in God that when I witness I'll be more confident now how many can relate to Paul a lot more I can I'll be on top of cloud nine after miracles give it a few weeks in a few battles that I'll be like what I even called of God or not should I sit down or what now card you wanna pass through the church no just my matters you know he said that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I'm in boss ambassador in bonds that then I may speak boldly as I ought to this proves he wasn't speaking as he ought to it sometimes so he said pray for me brother raise it pray for me but they aren't pray for me that I'll be bold like I ought to be bold he see cuz they're seasons I cast away my boldness right because I'm frustrated I'm discouraged I'm depressed I'm defeated so sometimes I cast away my confidence but the Bible said keep your confidence amen now this is beautiful right here though how is he gonna do it we need the prayers of the Saints Church if you need prayer come up here tonight if you need prayer at the end of the service don't sit back yes it isn't just like us we think we can we can we can do it I don't need your prayers I'm strong enough I can do it by myself and here's the first church age mess and you're saying yeah and he wasn't just a regular he was a fire he was a fireball in the hand of Christ a star in the hand of Christ which which brother have said where all of our lives are depicted there in that example we should all look and say my we need to be on fire like Paul we need be on fire like brother branham right so don't be ashamed if you're just lacking boldness you know that you don't tell me you're able to tell me or whoever the guests preach you have to tell him just say pray for me and just watch the Holy Spirit pray for you watch the Holy Spirit pray for you if a church age messenger who had more revelation than any of us so much so God had to put you know troubles in his eyes and you had to pack a doctor with them around all the time Luke I believe in divine healing doc can you put some more drops in my eye plea thank you sir all right let's preach now if a man like that could humble himself and say please pray for my bonus church let's humble ourselves - you know why cuz it's a time in season when I don't need those eye drops when he didn't need those eye drops he was brought preaching just as hard but when he he needed them you know and he needed a little bit he probably said preaching he's doing the best he can and he just knew I just I just got to get through this season amen I just got to endure a little bit longer and God's gonna bring me out praise God Hebrews 3 5 and 6 and Moses verily was faithful in all's house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ has a son over his own house whose house we are if see Judas is not gonna be part of the house of God because he did not hold vast the confidence but we have said he was generally justified genuinely sanctified but he also lit all out for money he said if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end amen were the house of God were the body of Jesus Christ if we just keep our boldness in confidence amen how do you learn other words but in William I believe I'm going to be in the rapture amen don't worry I got congressmen here that I'll be at the marriage supper of the Lamb we've got to keep that Amen we got to keep that confidence that we like it's a pray for me brother just pray for me sister so-and-so pray for me that I won't lose my confidence if you lose it for a little while don't we discourage you're not lost going to hell you're just going through a season to show you your weaknesses so that God can make you stronger because remember when Joe went forth through the fire he said I'll come forth as gold right amen later in the same chapter he repeats it take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end amen to think of initially when you first receive that bonus or you first had confidence and any promise of God you've got to keep that confidence to the end and the church said praise God that's why it's good we go over these things see how this is the ordained of God see how this is the Holy Spirit here sees like bitterness and the Holy Spirit will rightly divide all the Word of God it can all be rightly divided if it's taken with prayer brother Graham said and meditated and rightly divided and examined and searched the Scriptures it can all be rightly divided but it's got to be done by the Holy Spirit seen next chapter seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed in the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession that literally means your confession my brother man said he's the high priest of your profession for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so Jesus was tempted to kind of throw away his confidence he was tempted but he never gave in right he held his profession praise God let us therefore come boldly on the throne again that's my church even if we don't feel like it we've got to get bold when we pray now there's times you know like hand out to cry out you know and I look like you're drunk you know home crying and weeping but but the Bible said keep your covers hold fast your profession other words God I'm a blood bought Holy Ghost field say I'm a son of God Amen hallelujah and you're my father and I come to you by the blood of Christ in the name of Jesus I come boldly to the throne of grace that I may find mercy and help in the time of my need hold fast your profession hold fast your words don't cast it away but and I don't have quotes on here but brother I talk about this all the time people would come on the prayer line on the right hand side and get healed and they'd walk out and the disease would come back a few days later because under that anointing they could hold on to that confession well a prophet said I was healed praise God which that's glorious but the person has to believe in himself amen it's got to be more than just the faith of brother Branham and that's what he said he saw that many times he said they would walk out and then they would a few days later it would come back on the blindness or the epilepsy or whatever it was because they couldn't hold onto it they weren't professing it amen and so see we've got to make sure we keep our profession like the Bible says so Brougham saw this all the time yeah I can go faster this one here already already did my time but let me let me finish this I this was no shorter so let me go through the season here number eleven eleven season how many can say praise the Lord we can see the keeping in cast away can you see it in scripture clearly Hebrews lays that out try not to cast away your confidence because it's your profession that the high priest honors and that's when we go through seasons now let's go this one quickly here render so now in the opposite you either preserve clothes by sewing them or you dispose of them by renting them or ripping them right I give all seen up my wife and we do it when the socks wear out you rip them and use them for her rags my clothes always I keep my clothes as long as I can and finally I'll rip it yeah use it for something good to clean the windows or something like that and the opposite the Jews had a physical sign where if someone blaspheme door they're like jobber jovian blasting but if like like Caiaphas he run his garments you know when they thought Jesus blast him but he didn't but joy when he went through the suffering he lost his family he rent his clothes it was a sign of mourning so there's a natural season of that where they might run their clothes and then they have to fix it right or get a new garment now spiritually rend means to repent then so means to unite or join together and to me Church this is the season of the refilling of the Holy Ghost in your human spirit because I've said this before and everybody gave me a hearty Amen so I appreciate that but you cannot get sealed resealed in the Holy Ghost and then getting your soul cuz the Bible never says that you're sealed until the day of your Redemption so the time your body gets swallowed up your soul gets the the theophany on it if you die now you get the theophany but if you go on the rapture you get both the often and glorified body you get both amen but the Bible never says it's a refilling of the soul it's the refilling of the human spirit because the Bible said you renewed day by day if you but you gotta press in to get that right like we saw on Sunday night you take the kingdom of God not by laying back when you take it by force alright there you get you take confidence right you get confidence and you keep your confidence amen don't worry I'm gonna keep my revival today I'm gonna go get that word I'm gonna live that word today I'm gonna keep my revive I'm not gonna cast away my confidence glory now let's look at these thoughts eyes like I said I'll try to go this fast C natural sowing is done when the old peace is sewn on I'm sorry when the old peace is sewn on an old garment Jesus tells us this no man is foolish enough to sell a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that's filled it up taketh away from the old and the RET is made worse you don't put a nice new cloth on an old pair of jeans because it's just gonna make the rent worse it's not it's not gonna it's not gonna attach the way you want it to so you only sell an old piece of cloth on an old garment and you use new pieces to make a new garment right now barn says this and I'm just I'm not gonna read all this for times sake but barn says so Jesus is saying my new doctrines do not match with the old rights of the Pharisees because the Pharisees came up and said how come our disciples fast but yours don't and Jesus says you don't put old garment I'm sorry new our mitts on our new pieces on old garments in other words right you don't put you don't put the new message of the hour you don't build that upon the old denominational thinking Amen right that's what he's saying you can't start with a Pharisee foundation and build my doctrine on top of it because they're their doctrine is already it's man's interpretations its commandments of men and not the commandments of God so their foundation is already wrong so he says you can't take a new garment and put it with an old garment it's impossible see we only sew or unite all with old in the natural so we have to recognize there's a time to sew new with new right according to Jesus there's a season to unite new as new now here's natural the morning Jacob when he knew Joseph they thought he had died you know actually take him to Egypt sold to Egypt he run as clothes there's that's where natural closes like renting or mourning there's a season of mourning I like this one this is a good spiritual one now here's spiritual ready he said thus saith oh he said therefore also now say that the Lord turn he even to me with all your heart and with fasting with weeping with mourning see if they had to do that the Old Testament church don't you think we got to do that in the New Testament and rend your heart and not your garments and turn to the Lord your God for he's gracious and merciful slow to anger of great kindness and repent with him up eat praise God see when we run our hearts God is asking us to take whatever we had and rip it up amen right whether it's Netflix or whatever whatever temptation whether it's gambling and and trying to buy lottery tickets whatever you were investing in or meditating on or giving your time - you've got to rent that up and get totally rid of it and turn with all your heart to God that's real renting in the spiritual rip up any any evidence or any shred that I was ever involved that totally rented away now you've rent your heart and now you've turned to Lord your God and he's gracious merciful slow to anger a great kindness and he repents him of the evil that would have been brought upon you right ha ha oh my glory now spiritual sowing is commitment because the word put here means to sow and Jesus said them no man having put or sown his hands to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God see so God wants us to sow or unite are all of our efforts into doing his will and not to regret it and look back and say oh I wish I could go enjoy one more night of drunkenness one more sip if I could just have one more night of pleasure at the bar my so spiritual showing is full commitment without looking back and lusting for the things of the world here's another one teach me that way O Lord and I will walk in that truth unite my heart to fear and in other words let my heart be sewn to your heart in commitment amen that may be fully attached amen fully committed that's like the word cleave the word cleave means glue he said you leave your mother and father and you cleave to your your your Hut your your wife right so the same idea you get glued on you get sewed on you get connected to Jesus Christ amen unite my heart to fear your name this is a spiritual season now see rending and sowing are done simultaneously just like we saw in the spiritual you've got to die before you're born again these two seasons go very closely together because the next scripture after sowing Jesus goes to new wine and oil thank you Lord amen and no man putteth the new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottle and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marked but new wine must be put into new bottles you cannot put new wine or the Holy Ghost into an old dry stony heart a new heart first or justification oh boy job said behind my belly is as wine which has no vent it's ready to burst like new bottles the fermenting wine expands right a new skin will expand as the wine ferments but old dry skin it's already done expanding it can't move to the the moving of the holy spirit a church that's why is the longer we serve the Lord some of us who met here a while around the message the longer we serve the Lord we got to make sure our skins don't get dried out right we still got to be flexible a lot of times we see what's called the Solomon syndrome and I preach it all the time but people will start out on far more then they'll get cold on God they won't pray like they used to they won't repent like they used to they won't serve God like they used to and their hearts get really dry on God that's true but see when the person is born again yeah they may go through seasons where they cast away their confidence but God is going to help them expand as the wine expands ain't no way they'll go through a season where God's going to help me grow I've been in the message 20 years I've never seen this I mean this is 40 years I've never seen this God is helping you to grow to fall back in love with Jesus amen to expand to be able to change and rededicate your life and and grow closer to God you're able to be flexible with the Holy Spirit in other words the Holy Spirit can move you to live a closer life to Christ glory it's a season amen a season of renting up the old and sowing uniting your heart to serve God glory remember sowing and this one is the same idea according to Jesus now brother I said you can't put this revival on an old theology mix it up jesus said that in Saint Luke you can't put new wine in old bottles I also wonder what that statement was made why you can't put new wine in old bottles I come to find out I said look where we got a glass jug a bottle why couldn't I put one in those things they put new wine in it like we do right here here's our wine next time for communion we use glass right but he said I found out back in the days when Jesus was speaking of the bottles wasn't made of glass they didn't have the glassblowers in those days and there was made up of an animal skin and the animal skin have been tan and was sewed up or tied up and they put the wine the water the liquids in a skin bottle and then after the bottle becomes so old and so no wine and or anything it dried out the animal oil the skin left it and they got hard and stiff Church we don't want to be hard and stiff towards God praise the Lord hard we all know hard-hearted I'm not gonna help anybody out find an opportunity I'm not gonna help him out I'm looking out for myself that's a hard hard stony heart there right and I see what Jesus mean that if you put new wine unfermented wine into a bottle like that and that new one had life and it went to work and in fermented it would burst the bottle and that's the way you take the baptism the Holy Ghost and put it in an old dry formal cowhide it'll blow up as sure as the world you can't have it like that you try to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost as an old experience of some long drawn-out church experience it'll blow up as sure as the world but new line said Jesus goes in new bottles the new bottles has still the animal oil and the skins and it's flexible that's the way God Church must be for revival flexible so you got to be willing to change your normal routine and habits every morning I do this instead of this well you got to be willing to be flexible if you want revival every Friday night I do this or every Sunday night it you got to be flexible you got to be but you have to be able to be moved by the Holy Spirit amen you know you can put new wine which represents the word with the new old bottle and you'll read the word and it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever that old bottle will go poof but no up I don't believe it Church we got to be careful that I don't believe God is gonna heal me I don't believe God's gonna answer my prayer God must've gave up on me I'd be careful not to blow up I just seen it like this too I had to be flexible on saronite when I prayed for that guy I took Lydia just Lydia and another girl we drove two hours to get there and we we left at two o'clock and I didn't get home till almost 12:30 a.m. and I was exhausted on Sunday but I still preached to sermons by God's grace but I had to be flexible in other words in years past I would never I hadn't a clue do to them in other words I had to be flexible to be able to administer to my daughter so she could go to the meeting and hear the preacher and have a good time but in being more flexible making sacrifice we got a greater reward ha ha ha Amen see that so I just I never thought about that so right now had to be flexible to make a sacrifice to take my daughter to a youth meeting tired worn out had to keep me awake while I drove home but then God heard the prayer of faith amen hallelujah Amen flexible like you've heard it I've heard it this week - I heard it where you know it's you've heard it heard it - if you want to get difference or results you got to do different things in other words we can't be down and discouraged all the time and expect a different result we've got a person in the kingdom of God we got to be flexible we've got a rent things up we got to get rid of things and just give ourselves wholeheartedly to God amen thank you lord he said the baptism the Holy Ghost is just as real today as everyone's proof I don't believe it and what do you do you spoil both bottle and wine can you imagine that church people's lives get spoiled because they won't be flexible to hold they get dry lives are spoiled and then the Holy Ghost that could have been poured on them that that a church service was spoiled because more people could have got the oil reminds me of that that that story with Elijah how he said he said get all the vessels because the oils poured out a pen I don't know you bring all the empty vessels while there's all your here praise God let's not let this go to waste amen let's not spoil this opportunity let's fill everybody that wants the Holy Ghost and you know Jesus going to fit everybody with the Holy Ghost that wants it before this rapture amen hallelujah amen but see many people like whose version they're gonna spoil all that one the opportunity to have all that wine but you and I don't let it spoil we can't let it spoil we've got to rend up anything that's getting in our way and we got a God say God you not my heart two more of the Holy Spirit amen ha ha he says you're you spoil wolf why didn't bottom line you're casting pearls before swine let's stand to our feet here your message is going to pieces and no one receives it I've just blown out up to us that's all there is to it but you get new bottles and put some new Holy Ghost wine in it and the world says it'll working alive in our hearts and it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the line says I don't know the wine talks did you know that the wine talks oh it's that voice of God hallelujah he said the line says Jesus is the sea yes hey today forever amen that was the Y that was talking through us so that I said I rebuke the degeneration that was the wine talking the wine was talking through us amen the bottle says amen such as I brother Brian said amen and I believe it amen said Jesus Christ is wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities with His stripes were healed just the same yesterday today forever the new bottle said amen it spreads out with new life both of them has kept and preserved so you can't put new wine into old bottles last quote on the day of Pentecost God had 120 brand-new Pentecostal bottles said it with their necks up oh is that how we ought to know each other's Amen now for us if we are together so we're saying God refilled my human spirit oh we just gotta have our next up next of our human spirit he said they all got their next up and when the Holy Spirit fell from heaven it filled those bottles and they all bounced all over the place preaching the gospel to be no world the clear that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever notice it I see they bounce around the world we just got to bounce around acronym Mansfield Church I know that guys bouncing around from one place to the next witness in and Brian and singing in pounding drums praise God haha hey man that's right Church that's right we got a bounce from one person it's because we're all filled up with new wine amen hallelujah well can I come to the here's the twelfth now we'll get to the twelfth next time not today I'm stopping now looks I can have some voice tomorrow 12:00 is to keep silent and then there's a time to speak that's gonna be a good one because we just talked about that with brother Branham speaking the word brother Branham said I never spoke those squirrels he said God spoke through me to speak those squirrels he didn't even take credit I've got closer brother Branham said he said I'm not the voice of God but RAM said any time a person is here he said it's not my voice it's his voice and today they're worshiping the boy saying brother branham's the voice of God Lee's voice of God well yeah in a way God speaking through his voice but brother Branham is not the voice of God the Lord is the voice of God amen because it's the one that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever but as I said we're all new brother SEZ at the 7cr listener this week we're all mutes he said there's no good in any man he said I don't care who he is and he says don't think I'm trying to be humble I'm not being humble we're all mutes like this and we've just got to yield ourselves and let God speak through us so a miracle happened all that did is proved that you finally showed up that I finally showed up baby so God could speak through me right Church that's right so there's a mole there's a season for keeping silent and to speak praise God let's serious bow our heads for a word of Prayer and then in a moment after we pray we're and lift up our bottles to heaven Oh let's pray though for a moment if you have a need tonight yeah this is the thought that you just come to my mind if you've cast away your confidence that's pray for it
