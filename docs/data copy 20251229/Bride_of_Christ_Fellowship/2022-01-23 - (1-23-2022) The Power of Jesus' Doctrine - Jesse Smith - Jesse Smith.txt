honor the word of god such a beautiful atmosphere great singing children now got a wonderful job on the piano we like to read two scriptures here i'd like to preach on the power of jesus's doctrine i wanted to just take a few sermons and do a little series on this as far as my records i've only preached one sermon about doctrine i called it doctrine the saves back in 2017 and uh so it's quite a while ago i had heard different voices saying amen that no longer in the church but thank god for those that are still here by god's grace let's go to luke 4 31 luke 4 31. 431 yeah we're at about 57 thank you luke 431 the power of jesus is doctrine or doctrine means teaching and i'm trusting this topic will help us better understand the emphasis on jesus's doctrine and teaching lord willing my next video will be about this subject so that's why i've been in study on this subject here for a number of weeks by god's grace when you understand doctrine it's instruction or how to or command so if you just look at that that definition any command any instruction from jesus which involves our whole lives right uh you know work family church gifts of the holy spirit etc any instruction we are given on how to live and what to do is doctrine so uh the scope of doctrine is enormous it covers uh every era of our life as you'll see how we how do we pray how do we fast how do we uh operate the gifts of the holy spirit how do we love how do we i forgive how do we receive the holy ghost how do we be how are we saved i mean this covers doctrine covers so much uh scripture and there's so many commands that jesus christ and his apostles and bible wroters our bible authors rather wrote forgive me uh it's just it's a massive subject it's just enormous and i want to take a few sermons here and hopefully this will enlighten uh myself and i know has enlightened me as i've studied but light and everyone in the church and those who you know listen on archive or so forth like that you know really help them and then the next youtube video will kind of briefly cover this subject as well luke 4 31 and 32. verse 31 says and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days verse 32 and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power now in the next verses 33-36 jesus rebukes evil spirits and they come out of men okay and then in verse 36 and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out verse 37 and the fame of him went out in every place of the country round about so people were astonished at jesus's doctrine or his commands because his commands were with power okay then john 6 45 this is kind of one of where i want to end up lord willing at the end of this message john 6 45. i think i'll have all my children join me in reading this okay john 6 45 now the reason i'm reading this is to show i like to close with the thought that brother branham uses this scripture to show the evidence for having the baptism of the holy ghost is the fact you are able to be taught of the holy ghost those who cannot be taught doctrine by the holy ghost are not born again so that's what brother branham put in at least two places in the church age book and it's just a beautiful thought i just you know i uh i thought it's just so critical for us to understand these things so let's read uh john 6 45 on 3 1 2 3. it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me let's have a word of prayer let's bow our heads here heavenly father we love you god and we're talking about you today lord jesus the greatest thing we could talk about the greatest person we could think about meditate on and speak his word is you oh god the lord jesus christ we come reverently god again forgive us of any sin god and may our faith lord be honored today may our prayers be honored may you heal lord the sick lord god and do miracles in jesus name for your word is with power hallelujah you said you sent your word and it healed the sick so lord send your word to benjamin vu send your word lord to simon in england in jesus christ's name to lead in akron god just heal the sick and afflicted i pray father for your word has power may they receive the revelation of your word and so god will give you thanks and praise and just take me lord use me as a vessel that your people might be strengthened god growing grace and knowledge of you today may we all be taught of our father today the heavenly father the holy spirit in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you being seated praise god so we'll look at this thought uh the power of jesus is doctrine and i know to be a blessing to you because i'm not sure how many uh sermons will get out of this series but i think it's really crucial to understand it so i first want to overview doctrine briefly by the grace of god in the bible you know brother braham said when the seals were open the bible became a new bible so how many can raise your hand at home and say the bible is new to me hallelujah so you have to look at what was your attitude toward the bible when you were a sinner right even if you were sitting in a message church and what was your attitude toward the bible once you got saved and then when you get filled with the holy ghost you should have even more love for the bible you should realize more the importance of holy scripture for jesus said my words are spirit and they are life to the christian the holy ghost filled christian the word of god is not a dead letter the word of god's a dead letter to the desires of the flesh and the worldly desires of the mind but to the soul the word of god is absolutely life it's life-giving and as we read the word of god the holy spirit quickens that word makes it alive and uh feeds our souls and then it gives us strength to obey the word of god it's a beautiful beautiful experience being a holy ghost phil christian praise god just pick up your bible and you receive as you read you receive the life of christ praise god to to live through you so let's just do a brief overview here the word doctrine is the same as teaching it's just another word for it uh and there's three main greek words that are used for doctrine and teaching their meanings overlap so just you know just as we have numerous different words in our language in english that mean the same thing right so we i'll just read briefly look at the greek words uh the word didasco has 91 hits that's the one that has the most uses that's the word teaching in the greek in the new testament and then uh the next one is dida did aki or didache i'm not sure how to say that but that has 30 uses usually it means the word taught in the new testament and then dida scalia that's the word for doctrine in the new testament so if you add these up church there's 158 uses for doctrine and teaching and taught in the new testament so this is a pretty large subject right how many verses are there on the seven seals well there's there's there's revelation you know chapter uh five six and eight but that's really all that's really all there is right but there's 158 for teaching doctrine and uh being taught of the lord now i'm not diminishing the the verses on the seals but i'm showing you how much emphasis the holy spirit who wrote the word of god put upon doctrine and teaching it's a very large emphasis okay now i'm going to go through the greek definitions briefly as well just to show you didasco means to instruct to be a teacher to impart instruction instill doctrine into one okay scalia means teaching precepts instruction or doctrine and then didachi or dadaki means teaching or instruction so that's it's completely uh synonymous they're all synonymous terms okay now i just as i was meditating on this thought i just had this this thought come to me as far as 158 times just in the new testament right the old testament has 110. so this is 268 in the bible there's almost 300 times the whole bible uses doctrine teaching instruction now compare that with a subject we all love how many love the latter rain subject the latter rain is the rapturing faith and we all want rapturing faith praise god we all we all want to go with jesus none of us want to be left behind right and as much as we love this subject guess how many times the term ladder rain is used in the bible nine times nine not even ten not even ten there's eight in the old testament and one in the new testament james five verse seven is the only new testament scripture about the latter rain now we all are excited for the latter rain we're all excited to uh you know to have rapturing faith but the bible emphasizes teaching and instruction from the holy spirit many many more times so the conclusion must be this both both subjects are imperative both are absolutely necessary for us we are not the foolish virgin we will not be left behind we're not the lot group we're not the noah group we're the abraham group praise god we're the enoch group hallelujah so the only conclusion is that the holy spirit is emphasizing god's love for doctrine and those who will be taught the doctrine will be ready for the latter reign that's the only conclusion that we can come to if the holy ghost gives such an emphasis on teaching and doctrine and then just a small number of verses on latter reign then that must prove the latter reign is hidden from the majority of bible readers right it's a it's a revelation it's a mystery hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but it's revealed to the babes that will receive the emphasis of the holy spirit about living a life that's pleasing to god keeping jesus's commands he said if you love me you'll keep my commands and as many as i love i'll rebuke and chasten so god is going to rebuke us and correct us through giving us commands that we need to obey that in turn molds the character of jesus christ into our character because that's what we're supposed to be the bible says in romans we're supposed to be fashioned like unto the son of god right conformed into the image of jesus christ so that's a great revelation all if you want to be ready for the rapturing or the rapturing faith the latter rain then receive all of jesus doctrine receive all of paul's doctrine brother branham's doctrine you know as it lines up with the word of god and we'll talk a little bit about that you know in future sermons to come so what a great uh what a great thought what a great overview uh that teaching and doctrine and instruction is commands is a major uh subject in the word of god and the only conclusion we can come to the reason more churches don't preach it is because uh uh it doesn't uh it's not an easy thing right uh most most people don't like uh commands right they want to come the bible says in the last days they'll want to come to church and they want to have a preacher tickle their ears right so a tickle is not the same as a rebuke right think about when you're a child as your mom or dad they ever tickle you well what about when they rebuked you was it a tickle no it was a it was a humbling experience right a tickling is more like a playful kind of thing we don't want to come we don't want to come to church and play church that's what the foolish virgin that's what you know other people do uh workers of iniquity especially that's all it is is playing at church a foolish virgin does have some serious sermons we know from time to time but the true bride of christ will receive the commands of christ and they will be rebuked by christ as jesus said as many as i love i'll rebuke them i'll speak to them at times harshly in order to correct their character because they know better right most of us as christians we know better uh when we do sins right we commit sins but we know better and so god is patient with us aren't you glad he's patient with us and he's loving and he works with us until we surrender to his holy spirit to receive his power to overcome bad habits to overcome complexes that we looked at on wednesday remember most people will live with their complexes most people will live with their bad habits and then just pray for grace at the end now they can be saved like the thief on the cross if they really repent but jesus bride should have such character the bible says that she should be continually examining herself to clean out her whole life walking in white garments right no stains on the garments living the high calling living a higher life remember you can jump as high as you're living praise god so we can jump and rejoice in what god has helped us to obey helped us to overcome uh over the course of our service to the lord jesus christ sorry it's kind of cold down here i got cold hands as it is so um now i want to start with a couple quotes from brother brown two quotes from brother brandon okay so bear with me this is from 1953 speak to the rock now listen brother braham said the gospel is not altogether the word this is the word of god and all things must be based upon the word if it isn't it isn't true but jesus said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now he did not say teach the word he said preach the gospel. now we have to stop here and make a correction because jesus did say teach okay so brother man just has a human mistake here right and the proof is in matthew 28 19 jesus said go ye therefore and teach all nations okay so again as we as we grow as christians we we love brother branham he was a true prophet we give him honor like john the baptist but he was not infallible and he said if there's a mix-up look in the bible here's a perfect example he's showing there's a difference between preaching and teaching and there is and you'll hear it as i finish his quote but here he says jesus didn't say teach the word but i just read you in matthew 20 19 where he said teach all nations okay so there's a great balance here now let's finish the quote so the gospel consists more than teaching the word for paul confirmed that saying the gospel came to us not in word only but through power okay demonstrations of the holy spirit would come and demonstrate the gospel bring the word to a living reality okay so now brother is talking about the difference there's uh the manifestation of the word of god but then there's the speaking of the word as well or the preaching of the word there's power and there's preaching or teaching we'd say if you just receive the word by knowing the word that doesn't do you any good the letter kilth but the spirit giveth life okay he says then you must be born again and then the holy spirit quickens the word to you okay he says in other words like a grain of corn it's the laying in my hand it's just a grain of corn it'll never be nothing else but bury it and it becomes contaminated molds and then it brings up another grain of corn just like it okay so just in other words just sitting in church hearing hearing uh the preaching doesn't do you anything you've got to accept that believe that plant that in your heart and then the holy spirit comes quick in that quickens that word and makes it alive okay so brother is making uh um a point here to show how there's the word but then there's the manifestation of the word as well okay and so we see that now we're going to see it in the bible the broth the bible calls it this the bible says it's preaching verses teaching so that's why that's how the bible defines it preaching is them uh declaring what god has done or what god has gonna do teaching is instruction with commands on what you should do okay so we're gonna show that by numerous scriptures today by god's grace but just keep that in mind that's the point brother branham is making there's times you're teaching you're commanding the people but other times there's you're speaking the word of god and it is demonstrating itself in power right like with brother jose getting healed you know and brother johnny getting healed you know from his ankle uh pain there and you know brother uh for the amen you know being healed when sister hua laid her hand on him you know prayed for him that one night you know uh that's the power that's the manifestation of the word of god that's the declaration of god's word right you have that but you also have the teaching of god's word as well now fast forward to the next year the seven church ages brother brahms said um he said i'm staying a year and six months in this book of revelation in the tabernacle here that's what i like in teaching so brother man says here he likes teaching i just love teaching oh my i i think it's wonderful it gives the basis it settles the church so brother branham says teaching gives the church a settling or a foundation he says and in preaching now there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and sway it out there in places that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught now look at that brother says the teacher plants the seeds in your heart but then the preaching makes it come alive that's another interesting thought there which i believe is true as well see now you've got to put some seed in first and then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word so here here we're seeing different aspects here of preaching and teaching you have the idea that some preachers will just preach it and you've got to let that word you've got to men you've got to ponder on that word right like mary pondered on the word of god until it came to a realization right a manifestation and then brother makes this statement there's a vast difference between a teacher and a preacher see it's two different gifts of the holy spirit all together two different gifts and i humbly say this i haven't got the gift of either brother branham says now i believe there were times brother ram had the gift of course to preach and teach but but here's what he's talking about in context he says but my gift as of usual is praying for the sick okay so we know as brother rams polls as he grew in his ministry right the second poll the third poll was really the opening of the word that was a real teaching ministry for him he taught the seven church ages the seven seals marriage and divorce anointed ones at the end times i mean all these amazing revelations okay so we know then there's seasons for our ministries as well or you know some people may have just one gift and that's their gift their whole life right but brother random had gifts here uh healing gifts at the beginning and then really came in uh to teaching later in later in his ministry he says that's what the lord called me to do this was 1954. okay so six years before he started teaching on the church ages all right so i got some bible readers here can everybody open their bible i could probably just go right down here and i could have some good bible readers here one two three four five six seven eight nine i have nine examples there's actually ten uh but there's there's nine examples we're going to read briefly because they're really short that show how jesus paul and the apostles all had they had both they had preaching and teaching so this proves with every ministry even jesus ministry he had to plant the seeds and then he would come water them or quicken them with the anointing of the holy spirit now both have the anointing right it takes the anointing to teach the right doctrine but also then takes another anointing here to make that alive okay so why don't we start here with lydia let's look at three verses about jesus he had both preaching and teaching okay so let's go to matthew 4 23 lydia acacia matthew 9 35 and haven't you get matthew 11 1. so we've got your bibles at home matthew 4 23. you can turn there as well occasion 9 35 and haven matthew 11 verse 1. it's going to be good if you turn there yourself in the bible there i'll give you a few moments here hopefully everybody read their bible already this morning but if not this is an important time for you to read your bible got to stay in the word of god praise god so here three verses about jesus he had both preaching and teaching and just humbly in my ministry i see both i see the holy ghost anointing me to teach at times but then i see the holy ghost leading me to pray or speak the word of god other times and it it manifests itself thank god for his mercy okay so uh lydia matthew 4 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people amen jesus did both preach and he taught now i forgot to say this but the word preach in the greek means to publish or declare so jesus would declare the sick heel there it is right there that's the preaching he would declare you're healed rise in the net rise in the name of the lord well he didn't have to say that but we say that rise up in the be receive your healing in the name of the lord that's preaching the gospel right but teaching is where he would teach on how to fast how to cast out devils right how to do marriage in divorce he would teach how to how to give alms so see he would have he would have teaching and then commands and then he would publish he would preach or declare the word of god uh woman rise up you know he a woman be healed of your infirmities you know he would he would just preach the word of god okay acacia matthew 9 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sicknesses and every disease among the people amen so another witness jesus both taught and preached in the synagogues those were like their local churches where they read the law of moses every sabbath day but also preach as well of course he probably wouldn't preach in the synagogue right he would just read the scripture like in luke 4 he'd read the scripture in the synagogue he might do a little bit of teaching in the synagogue i'm not quite sure uh but he would preach out you know on the boat on the hill a sermon on the mount you know he'd preach anywhere where the people were gathered to hear the word of god okay another one uh haven matthew 11 verse 1 and it came to pass when jesus had made in the end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities amen so after jesus sent out his 12 disciples then he went specifically to the cities they lived he went to their hometowns and he preached and taught in their hometowns so they would say oh this is simon's rabbi right oh this is james rabbi this is john's rabbi what a mighty servant of the lord now that that's the that's what the humble would say right the majority rejected him calling him beelzebub but though the common people heard him gladly praise god hallelujah so there's three witnesses jesus both preached declared god's word and taught gave commands how to instructions on how to live okay now let's do uh apostles malachi acts 5 42 lydia acts 15 35 in acacia acts 28 31 i'll give everybody a chance i'll repeat them acts 5 42 malachi lydia acts 15 35 and acacia acts 28 31 now we see paul and the apostles doing both preaching and teaching brother ram said there's a vast difference isn't there there isn't there there is yeah i'm sorry there is like some preachers they'll just build your faith like i'm thinking like i like brother diggs right or you know they'll just build your faith just believe god's word just believe god's word leave god's word he doesn't really get down into teaching you on how to do this or how to do that you know but then like look at my ministry or other teachers you know you would see uh you know and they'll tell you this is how to do this this is how like brother bender out remember he taught us how to pray years ago that bible study he taught us about this is how you pray this is how you approach the lord through prayer mary taught us about music this is how you do music we talked about that last week this is how so that's a teaching that's a doctrinal uh discourse on how to do this how to do that but jesus would preach and he would declare the word of god and the devils had to move praise god hallelujah so maokai uh was you right acts 5 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach jesus christ amen daily every day they taught and preached in fact when uh in the in acts 5 we didn't reckon read this to later but the angel sets the apostles free out of prison and then they wonder what happened they just kind of the angels let him out and the angel said go stand in the temple and teach the words of this life the angel of the lord told these miracle workers i just saw the lame man walk right the gate of beautiful he said go teach in the go teach the people go teach them in the temple so how could any man say the holy ghost doesn't want teaching the holy ghost loves teaching the angel of the lord loves teaching hallelujah because it's it's a part of it it's planting the seed of course that's one anointing and then the waters of the holy spirit will come and quicken that seed and make it make that live for example we just don't want to hear uh teaching about how to fast we actually want to experience it we want to fast and then see god do a mighty miracle or god give us our hearts desire we just don't want to hear teaching about praying we want to experience the power of prayer amen we want to live it praise god amen but that's what we must understand we've got to hear the teaching how to and then trust god and draw close to god until he gives us the anointing to do that and it may be quick it can be something very quick it can be right happen right in the service or it could come later but the thing to do is keep feeding on the word of god okay so lydia acts 15 35 paul also and barnabas continue to antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also amen praise god so paul barnabas taught and preached the word of god and paul said if you teach or preach anything different than what i preach what do you say you're cursed anybody that would teach something different than paul is cursed by god and the bible said for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many people die and get sick because they change paul's gospel they don't discern the body of the lord they don't judge the word of god and teaching the right way okay the last one for the apostles this is about saint paul he had a hired house where although he was under house arrest uh rome let him receive all these people into his house he could teach and preach the word of god so acacia acts 28 31. preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him amen so paul had all confidence in what he taught and all confidence what he preached what he declared in the name of the lord beautiful um yeah i think for time we'll go ahead and we'll go ahead and read paul so malaka or haven colossians 1 28 malachi 1st timothy 2 7 and lydia ii timothy 11. so again haven colossians 1 28 now this is right after paul talks about christ in you the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost which brother brahm said was jesus's first doctrine jesus first teaching is in john 3 ye must be born again if you want to see the kingdom of god you must be born again so colossians 1 28 first timothy 2 7 2 timothy 1 11. okay so haven when you're ready colossians 1 28 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom so that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus amen praise god we preach and teach with all wisdom where do we get wisdom james says ask it'll be given to you right where do we get wisdom fear the lord uh lord i i don't want to fail you lord i want to be led by your holy spirit i don't want any sin to enter my life keep me clean so in doing this and staying in the word of god meditating upon the word you'll be a great success joshua said amen meditating staying in the word of god but we preach warn and teach every man okay so that's why that's interesting too there i just had that thought you'll have sermons of all three right you have a preaching sermon like we said brother diggs and other brothers that razor brother joe adams no doubt about that uh we'll have warning sermons right like those sermons i kind of preach with the false prophecies and false prophets even around the message coming out of jeffersonville and then uh the thunders movement that's that well that one had a lot of false prophecy of course that's all broken up into uh factions now as well but then also the word of faith movement has loaded with all kinds of false prophecies we have to stay away from those lying spirits okay but then also then there's teaching sermons teaching us how to pray teaching us how to fast teaching us how to give alms teaching us how to repent praise god we need all these we need all these types of sermons and god has anointed men for every one of them praise god uh malachi first timothy 2 7 where to i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ am i not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity amen so paul was ordained by jesus christ to be a teacher apostle and preacher he was ordained for all these things and thank god he was because without it we wouldn't have much of the new testament right we wouldn't know how to do think about if we if we didn't have paul's letters i mean we wouldn't know hardly anything about you know hair length and gift gifts of the holy spirit modesty i mean we really want to have a lot of idea about the rapture you know we would be so lost as far as not having a lot of revelation but thank god we got it who ordained it jesus christ ordained it because he did the same thing he would preach teach warn prophesy he had all these gifts of preaching he had all the fivefold gifts praise god hallelujah lydia um ii timothy 1 11. i'm going to tissue where unto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles amen that's kind of like a repeat of maokai's maybe a shorter version preacher apostle and teacher of the gentiles praise god okay so now church that's bible proof there there's nine bible proofs that jesus paul and the apostles did both preaching and teaching so if you hear any message preacher any preacher in general say oh we don't need doctrine or they belittle doctrine that's because satan has deceived them or they have a complex or something has happened because again it has a major witness in the scripture and as i said we'll get down to the end where brother branham says that's the proof you're born again that you can be taught doctrine you can be taught of the holy spirit if you can't you're not a child of god okay uh so now as for this sermon i want to spend most of this time looking at the the ministry of jesus christ okay so many people today i'm just going to read a few things off here many people today misunderstand that jesus was known for more than just his power which was his preaching he was known for more than that he was also known for his teaching okay because as we write we're going to read these scriptures again the pharisees and sadducees and the scribes had no power of god and they had no doctrine of god right they just had the basic fundamentals like the ten commandments but they didn't even carry those out right right because the bible said or the history shows they live by the traditions of men which was from their their own books the mishnah they had their own books outside of the bible to live and those their books told them how to interpret the bible which is wrong it's just like the book of mormon today or any other bit extra biblical book that has equal authority as the bible okay um and i believe the scripture teaches this jesus's power flowed from his doctrine right fro fro flowed from the commands god gave him so because he could receive god's commands in god's doctrine he could uh he could uh the power of god could flow out through him right because that's why the pharisees couldn't do the miracles jesus did because they didn't have jesus doctrine okay as we saw like brother ram says the illustration he uses doctrine are like the seeds but then the water's got to come upon the seeds to make those commands live so that's how it must have been with jesus he received god's instruction and the spirit came to quicken uh those commands in his life and then he could speak the word of god okay so let's see how um jesus got his doctrine from the father so it's john 7 16 and 17. i'm going to start reading some of these to give my children a break here they've been good they've been good merciful to me john 7 37 so got your bibles john 7 37 i'm sorry john 7 16 i'm sorry john 7 16 my fault actually let's read 15 because they say and the jews marveled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned because he was in the temple yeah look at verse 14 he was in the temple teaching he was teaching the word of god they're like this guy never went to seminary school verse 15 how does he know this he never learned verse 16 jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not my own but his that set me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine or concerning the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i shall speak of myself in other words if you receive god's word you'll receive god's power amen that's it right there hallelujah if you receive jesus doctrine you'll see the same holy ghost in the book of acts manifesting your life hallelujah now look at verse 18 jesus says i'm not speaking to myself he says he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory so see when people preach their own doctrines their own teachings uh their own false ideas they're seeking their own glory right but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him praise god so jesus doctrine was not his own it was the fathers and he said those who obeyed his doctrine would know it came from god hallelujah church i had a man email me this week and say why don't you turn to to judaism he said you you're such a smart person i'm not smart but he must think i'm smart he said you want you turn to judaism that's what smart people turn to and i just wrote them back real short email i said sir i have seen jesus christ heal my mother of cancer i've seen jesus christ cast out devils i've seen jesus christ cleanse my wicked heart how could i ever turn from this jesus christ is alive and i said his spirit lives in me praise god amen i mean what else what else can i say i can't convince you but i've been convinced because i've done jesus doctrine and i've known it's from the father praise god hallelujah the same is true today those who follow jesus doctrine and instructions will know it's from god because they'll see the results that it bears and they'll see it in their own life and then nobody can talk them out of it because they're witnesses of it praise god that's where the holy ghost was to make you a witness unto akron unto doyle's town hallelujah under the uttermost parts of the earth praise god here's an interesting thought let's go to mark 4 verse 2. i just want you to like i said this is a massive subject now in verse 1 he's in a he's in a boat by the sea teaching out of a boat while the people are on the land verse 2 and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine hearken behold there went out a sower to sow hallelujah wow now look at this thought church look at this though this is kind of new to us even jesus's parables were doctrine right because if they give you commands on how to live or how to on how to live their doctrine for example this one this is the parable of the four grounds what how is this how to it tells us how to keep our ground pure from weeds amen and what he say that last ground is what a good and honest heart jesus christ himself said the mysteries of my parables are doctrine aren't you glad you know him praise god there's 16 in chapter 8 of my book if you want to read it or listen to it you can listen to it for free 16 parables that jesus talked about the kingdom now there's more parables than that but i just found the 16 that say the kingdom of heaven is like and unto so and so there's parables about the rapture there's parables about repentance right the man the unforgiven servant right who wouldn't forgive the other one but got his servant or his master forgave him of all those millions of dollars of debt that's how to repent that's how to forgive i mean jesus parables were so powerful they were teaching the believers as well see they caught the they taught the common person gladly but the pharisees they were just stories to them they didn't mean nothing but see they're not they're not kids stories to us they're stories of wisdom to us praise god they're stories of life to us and may we by the grace of god keep our ground honest and pure free from weeds free from the cares of this world always put jesus christ first and keep the cares of the world out of our hearts how many could say amen to that beautiful beautiful i mean this is bible truth here laying here all these years right and you know sometimes you don't hear people preaching it's because many times they maybe they're not called to do it or maybe they're disobedient and they're not growing in grace and knowledge of the word of god okay now uh matthew 7 28. i'm going to turn there now if you know kind of the context here this is the ending of the sermon on the mount right which was one of jesus most famous sermons he ever preached right he finishes his sermon on the mount and look at verse 28 and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes so that word doctrine means teaching they were astonished as teaching well what did he just teach them about well if you go back to chapter five when he starts it the beatitudes right that's how to be blessed right blessed are they blessed are the poor and spirit blessed are they that mourn how do i how am i blessed keep the beatitude there's a doctor right there okay then he gets on the light of the earth you're the light of the earth uh then he talks about uh thou shalt not kill and how we he talks about how uh to deal with anger right how to overcome anger and you can be angry and sin not jesus talks about that how to give your gifts in uh matthew 5 24 how to give offerings and and ties right that's in chapter 5 as well uh looking and lusting is in matthew chapter five so right mental purity how how do i stay mentally pure that's a doctrine right um marriage and divorce is in uh matthew chapter five how do i marry how do i please god with my marriage that's doctrine uh and then chapter six is alms fasting and praying and how to pray amen these are all doctrines these are all teachings from the lord jesus christ on the sermon on the mount it's just it's overwhelming to think how much doctrine and teaching jesus christ gave us and then you see many message churches that don't want it they think they know how to or they think they don't need it and so they get lazy on god they lose their fire they are actually lukewarm because they're not born again a child of god won't grow lukewarm for very long right they'll just be lukewarm in their mind for a little while but then they repent and they get back to living from the soul praise god and also the doctrine of seeky first the kingdom of god that's a doctrine amen in matthew 6 33 and then matthew 7 the narrow way he talks about the narrow way he talks about false prophets how do you recognize false prophets that's the teaching that's a doctrine and then the anointed ones of the end times in matthew 7. many shall say to me lord lord have me not cast out devils prophesied done many wonderful works in your name he said i never knew you ye that depart or sorry you that work iniquity depart from me you that work iniquity so he even gives us the how to recognize workers of iniquity and then he closes by how do you uh how do you overcome the storms of life and he said you have to hear my word and obey it he said then you build your life upon the rock amen there it is it's like we're saying amen and then the bible says they're astonished at his teaching they're this is amazing doctrine amen so they enjoyed his his preaching as his his miracles but they also were astonished at his doctrine that taught them how to obey the commands of god how to live a life worthy of jesus christ the messiah amen it's beautiful i never set a time or so here i'm just going to finish i'm not going to close yet but just bear with me here um let's go to john 18 verse 19 john 18 verse 19. jesus i believe he's in the high priest being questioned on the night of his arrest peter's outside the in the courtyard of the high priest warming his hands right before he denies christ three times and while jesus is getting questioned in verse 20 john 18 20 jesus answered i spake openly to the world how many paul's right there that's why i'm not afraid to put my sermons on youtube if jesus wasn't afraid to put his sermons out there before the world why should i be afraid right and any man that would be afraid of that that shows he don't have the confidence that christ had and i'm not saying everybody has to do youtube or anything like that but uh we should have no fear we sh because the bible said we should study ourselves that proved unto god we should have a relationship with christ where we know we've studied the word and then the holy spirit will give us confidence it's approved by god you come out and preach it i don't care who hears it because the holy spirit gave it to me i know it's vindicated by the word of god so jesus he's being arrested he said i spoke openly to the world i ever taught or gave doctrine in the synagogue ever i looked ever not just sometimes always i always taught in the synagogue you guys were always there listen to me in the temple whether the jews always resort and in secret i've said nothing praise god hallelujah why asketh thou me ask them which hear me what i've said unto them behold they know what i said so look at jesus i all the time i was always teaching doctrine i was always teaching the people of god i didn't hide nothing from anybody so that's why i don't care you know people don't like the the six reasons you know ministers marian virgins isn't the new testament i don't care if people don't like that i mean i love them i pray for them you know some people are trying to correct me on that but they won't even watch the video they won't even hear the other side it's like a judge it's like it's like they're like an unjust judge they have two different sides but they could you imagine a judge saying that well i'm going to listen to one side but i'm not going to listen other side then i'm going to make the judgment that's ridiculous that's immature that's a babe right that's a or that's a prideful or or fearful spirit right because brother man said you must take everything back to the word of god and the doctrine must go from genesis to revelation amen praise god so see the more you're in tune with the holy spirit the more bold you are with what the holy spirit showed you because you know it's vindicated by the holy spirit in your in your soul and also it's vindicated in the word of god amen jesus wasn't scared of what he what he preached and taught okay now mark 11 18 this is uh this kind of shows the reaction how are workers of iniquity and religious people going to respond to true doctrine what is their attitude going to be for to true doctrine and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and saw how they might destroy him this is mark 11 18 i'm sorry for they feared him because all the people were astonished at his what doctrine and teaching they wanted to kill jesus because his teaching and doctrine was with power praise god it was with authority in other words he would he didn't have to say it but he was in other words saying this is thus saith the lord i am the lord right i am the messiah who can convince me of sin he says search the scriptures for in you for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and like i've said this before i told the church the most harsh responses i have on youtube are people around the message so that shows me we got a lot of pharisees and sadducees around the message no one said worst things about me uh than people around the message uh and so that shows jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever people want to silence me or kill me or tell me to stop stop preaching or call me serpentine all these things all because i stand on the bible doctrine that's fine let them say what they want it just shows we're more like jesus the more we have his teaching and his doctrine because it came from the father amen amen hallelujah so that's why the bible said all who live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution or you know hateful speech and so we live above that because we have the power of jesus christ amen the love of jesus christ okay so let me finish up on jesus and doctrine and then after that i'll try to find a place to close here just just being led of the holy spirit just trying to ask the holy spirit holy spirit help me to be led of your spirit here by god's grace i want to be more mindful of the holy spirit okay so let's go to mark 1 27. again jesus cast out devils now look what mark 1 27 says and they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves saying what new thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him okay so see casting out devils is a doctrine it's an instruction it's a command because jesus said only or some demons only go out by prayer and fasting so you have to follow those instructions or those doctrines in order to manifest the power of god now why can't people see that why can't everybody in the message see that you've got to follow the doctrine in order to see the power and the church said amen you have to do that or else you're not going to see some kinds of sicknesses healed thank god for the ones we have seen a lot of them in jose's family you know different ones that have been sick that god has healed miraculously we thank god and we had prayer and fasting days for those people to be healed from cancer so uh we must keep all these scriptures in mind um i just want to say this too you know uh i think i share this on the youtube video one time i went down to columbus and i preached and god healed two people miraculously one guy had a liver trouble and uh he said i just he was weeping he said he felt the fire of the holy spirit come over him and he was healed later a few years later he came back and he got sick and had a surgery but he's still alive today by the grace of god but in that moment god gave him a temporary healing by the grace of god which we're grateful for he was just praising god rejoicing his name is darian okay darian's mom in that same service got healed of back pain knee pain arthritis pain after that service she come up after me or she come up to me and she sat down she said look brother jesse i can sit down i can bend my knees i can move my knees i don't have any pain in my back i got a car accident last year i had all this pain in my back and there was another brother in that church i'm not gonna say his name uh he actually goes to different church now it was kind of comical okay but uh he went up to my wife and i was standing right there by my wife and my wife may remember this and he asked her what is it like to live with a man like brother jesse and i just started chuckling right there he was so astonished at the power of god now to me that's it just gave me a vindication as i thought about these scriptures i'm like has anyone ever yes people have said that about our ministry and uh you know we just my wife and i laughed i'm not even sure what she said i have to ask her after service you know he said what is it like to live with a man like that and i'm sure she's saying she probably say it's interesting because i'm human right i make mistakes and brother graham said you love your best and your worst at home i just want to let you know too that people have come up to me after preaching and i've heard the same thing they're just they are uh moved by the power removed by the the grace of god that they saw in the service but i know it's not me i know it's just it's a gift right we yield to the gift and then the gift manifests itself when there's people pulling on the gift of god they're hungry and thirsty for righteousness and it lines up with the timing of god okay so i always remember that related to this um we already read luke 4 same same thing the doctrine had power to it um okay yeah now let's go to the the great commission so we already read let's go to matthew 28 19. we're going to just focus on jesus's ministry here today because that should be a good twice church twice jesus says teach them in the great commission i remember brother graham said he didn't say teach but remember got to go back to the bible i'm not disregarding brother brandon he's still prophet of god he's the church age messenger seven church age messenger he's elijah he had the elijah spirit but he's human and we have to rightly divide the word of truth so verse 19 go you therefore and what teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father of the holy ghost which is lord jesus christ acts 2 38 now look at verse 20 doing what teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you and lo i'm with you even to the end of the world so church if i know i'm trying to teach you and i you and i all of us on how to obey god better how to enter into our gifts and our callings if i'm if i know i'm trying to teach you how to do that then i know christ is with me because he said teach all the commands i'll teach him all the commands until i return and lo i'm with you even to the end of the world praise god hallelujah so see it was teach all nations so all nations need the teaching gift or the doctrinal uh truths of god's word now one thing i forgot was in the book of acts remember when paul paul smote elimus blind you remember that he was trying to stop the deputy from hearing the message of the hour right and so paul said you'll be blind for a season and the deputy's like i believe he said i'm astonished at your doctrine remember that see this there there it again there it is again jesus they were astonished at jesus doctrine they're astonished at paul's doctrine people should be astonished in our doctrine as well today as it manifests through signs wonders and miracles now there's going to be times when people come to church and there's no miracles right just like jesus when jesus was on the cross they said physician healed thyself and he didn't do it also when jesus was in his hometown nazareth or was it capernaum the bible said he could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief praise god amen so there's times people's unbelief hinders and we saw that with aiken right one person's unbelief could hinder the move of god that's why we always have to come to church prayed up right and repenting of our sins and believing god's word and so there's divine appointments god has to do supernatural signs wonders and miracles manifest his power and we must be ready at all times for god to move in those seasons where vessels meet from the masters used praise god constantly cleaned out constantly uh looking for god to move in our lives who would have thought god's holy fire would have burned down through austin on that one sermon when everybody else was sick with coven but yet stephen and our families there and austin alina but that's the service where god's burning fire came into brother austin he felt the power of god cleaning him out praise god i mean just you don't know and then how about that wednesday night sermon where god gave brother austin the financial victory by god's grace you never know you never know it's gonna be saturday night sunday night remember on that sunday night service when cam preached the wind blew through the wall and struck sisterhood and she got instantly healed from that flu praise god you never know the wind blows where it blows but we got to keep laying in the doctrine laying in the warnings laying in the prophecy laying in the teaching preach the word of god and when souls are ready to receive it god will move but it's god it has to line up with god's timing as well amen now this matthew 28 getting back to matthew 28 was the great commission he said teach teach teach all nations now there's also the great commission in mark 16 so go there verse 15 mark 16 15. now this is what brother brahm i think was referring to when he said jesus said go preach don't teach right but we know jesus also said teach yes this is it right because you use the word preach verse 15. he said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so so then after the lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so that's how i looked at it you know that's one way to look at it too you teach and you preach and you do the doctrine and then god will vindicate it with supernatural or there's times god will just speak supernatural things just speak i declare this you're going to be healed in jesus name and this it's just supernatural it's a declaration of the preaching of god's word amen amen all right now let's see how jesus warns about doctrine and then i'll try to find a place to close okay so let's have some readers here lydia matthew 15 9 acacia matthew 16 12 and um haven mark 12 38. so matthew 15 9 matthew 16 12. and mark 12 38 for haven whenever you're ready lydia these are jesus's warnings about false doctrine but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men amen so jesus says the pharisees actually scribes they taught doctrines of men commands of men and in context here's another doctrine maybe you didn't know this there's a doctrine on how to take care of your parents when they get old this is for me my wife sister naomi brother wesley bang you know amen who anyone who's got parents that are getting kind of elderly here's a doctrine and their doctrine was oh you don't have to take care of your parents just give the money you're going to take your parents with give that to the temple and that's okay that's raqqa right that's okay raka and jesus said no that's a doctrine of man that is not a doctrine and that's vain worship in other words god is not receiving that offering god is not receiving that money you've robbed from god right you rob you robbed god because you robbed your parents see that's doctrine i hope this just gives us a great understanding on our lives almost everything we do as if it's a how-to it's doctrine acacia matthew 16 12. then i understood they how that he made them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees amen praise god so that would be a whole other sermon to go through all the false doctrines the pharisees and sadducees held right sadducees didn't believe in a resurrection right so that that influenced how they lived right so that was a doctrine as well because there's no resurrection we'll just live this certain way right this this is how we're going to live our lives right and of course the pharisees would make broad their phylacteries and all their how-to on how to pray long prayers in the temple you know those were all false doctrines that's not how a christian that's not how a believer a christian should have lived their life right so their their false doctrine was 11 and 11 is always said in the bible so you'll find this true doctrine is god's bread amen false doctrine is corrupted bread right it's leaven so true god's true doctrine is unleavened bread right and pharisee doctrine is leaven bread in haven mark 12 38 and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love solutions in the marketplace all right the salutations right here was that what it was thank you so even those doctrines the doctrines of the pharisees and how you would greet them in the see how how you would instruct them this is how you greet us in the marketplace this is how you treat one another that's how to that's doctrine she said beware of the scribes beware of their false doctrine so in other words false doctrine is doctrine jesus hates we also see this in revelation 2 verses 14 and 15. i'm going to read that revelation 2 14 and 15 jesus hates the doctrine of the nicolaitans and for austin alina nicolaitans means conquering the laity so satan's uh the way satan corrupts the church is by conquering the laity making them feel like they don't have any holy spirit they don't have any gifts it's all in the preachers right that's how satan conquers churches so we have to remember everybody has a gift everybody has a calling from god everybody has to be faithful though with that ministry and pray and seek god and understand how they can be used by god in their gifts for ministry everybody has a ministry not just the preacher okay so jesus says in revelation 2 14 and 15 but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols so idolatry and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine the nicolaitans which i hate so see god hates when uh only preachers have the anointing on them god wants everybody to have the anointing on them praise god god hates any preacher that would do that that would just say oh we're the holy ones you're not right that's that's like in the catholicism right because the the priest has the ability to turn that bread and wine into the literal body of christ called transubstantiation that's a lie from hell you don't have that power to do that they're just symbols but they they believe those lies they propagate those lies and spread them around the world and also fornication would be a false doctrine jesus hates the teaching that's okay to fornicate before marriage or of course adultery or homosexuality anything all that can be lumped in there and then eating sacrifice to idols in other words have any association with idolatry which for us many times is money uh family like we had a chur or a family that left our church a few years ago and they told me family was always first before god in church they admitted that they've been the message 40 years but they admitted that family was always first and they knew that was wrong so that's a that's an idol family became an idol to them okay brother branham can become an idol you make every word he says thus saith the lord that becomes an idol sports is a big thing i always harp on that right cell phone addiction you know that could be an idol when you go to your phone more than you go to god you know so these are all doctrines that jesus hates all right and then um revelation 2 24. so the next church age the thyroid here in church age verse 24 jesus said but unto you i say and unto the rest of thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not the depth not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden okay so the doctrine of the depths of jezebel so the depths of jezebel is basically the mature form of catholicism living by doctrines of men and crucifying the effects of the holy ghost in a church that's the depths of satan that's the depths of jezebel in other words being ruled by denomination rather than the holy ghost does everybody understand that that god's great exam okay so it starts with sayings then it goes deeds then it goes doctrine to balaam then it goes uh the doctrine of jezebel the depths of jezebel jezebel religion okay so that's the progression of the four first horses right in the in the first four seals that's the progression okay so that's there's doctrine jesus loves that's the father's doctrine that he gives and it empowers the believers who obey it but he hates the doctrines of devils of course okay so let me uh let me close with what i had told you okay so uh john 6 45 john 6 45. i'm going to close with a quote here from brother branham thank you thank you for staying with me still got seven people live streaming so praise god hope that's all the families in the church you know about god's grace uh this is where i want to get to at the end and like i said this is a huge this is a major subject here i don't know how many sermons i got out of this but i want to just focus on this the power of jesus's doctrine because it's the power we're supposed to be restored back to what paul's doctrine right brother ramsay said i preached what paul preached well who taught more doctrine than anybody in the new testament it was paul paul you could argue jesus too so paul and jesus but where did paul get his doctrine from jesus we're supposed to say the same thing paul said we better know the man who gave us all this doctrine but the church age book let's show this how learning doctrine and being taught by god is proof you're born again it's absolute proof so let me read this quote can you read that uh john 6 45 that was our text but i want to just listen to it again here it is written in the prophets and they shall be taught all and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath word of the father cometh unto me thank you all that the all the father has called all god's children will come to him and they'll all sit at his feet and learn from him okay now brother man says this is chapter four on the church facebook as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the holy ghost see what jesus says in john 6 45 okay she just read it it's written the prophets they shall all be taught of god but if you turn to isaiah 54 13 it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the lord so see in the gospel the word children was left out right so brother rahm says he says look all the all of god are the children of god thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of god he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the holy ghost now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost it doesn't say in the church ages that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit's saying i love that quote hallelujah that puts tongues interpretation prophecy etc aside as the evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking he says yes the spirit is teaching that's exactly what jesus said he would do when he comes in john 14 26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written he said this is how paul received his revelations he said in galatians 1 verse 11 and 12 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it of man but by the revelation of jesus christ paul was taught by jesus christ who is the holy ghost amen praise god and brother ram says and to every age we see we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches now you know the word here just doesn't mean to audibly receive it it means to obey it right hear o israel the lord our god is one lord that doesn't mean just here he's one that means believe he's one and keep all the other false gods out of your life right have no other gods before me that's what the word here means so he he that hath an ear let him obey in other words hear what the spirit obey what the spirit says to the churches brotherhood says this your prophet my prophet said but only a spirit-filled man can hear the revelation of that age oh hallelujah none other can no sir they cannot because that's exactly what paul said in 1st corinthians 2 6 through 16. i'm not going to read all that we'll have to pick that up next time here's the second to last quote this is the last quote last one i'm going to do do one scripture after that brother said did you get that last thought it's about he that hath an ear let him hear the spirit says the churches every church age ends with that same admonition the spirit gives the word the spirit has the truth for the age each age has its own elect that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them hallelujah so when you receive the word and you obey it that proves you have that seed you read that proves when you obey it it proves you got it see satan will never obey all the word of god that proves you don't have the seed right here you don't obey anything this is what god forces him to do you know he's got to present himself before the lord you know but he don't obey the doctrine you don't may the teaching of god john 8 47 said he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god they refuse the word jesus and his words for their days but the true seed receive the word because they were of god brother branham again cites isaiah 50 4 13 and all thy children shall be caught of shall be taught of god the holy spirit jesus said the same thing in john 6 45 being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled he says no other criterion in other words there's no other requirement the requirement is hearing the word and obeying the word of god but what are tongues and interpretations and other gifts they are manifestations that's what the word teaches first corinthians 12 7 says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to prophet with all then paul names those manifestations so in closing you are a child of god when you can be taught of the holy ghost if the holy ghost can preach to you the words of god out of here through me and through any other fivefold ministry preacher that proves you're a child of god if you don't that proves you're not a child of god so may god give you a a heart that wants to obey the bible says they obeyed from the heart every sound doctrine praise god the bible says that so may we have a heart a good and honest heart that can receive all the commands of god all the doctrine all the teaching of god water those seeds and they'll bring forth the manifestation their time in closing the people that go to hell did not learn from jesus right they would not be taught by the holy ghost revelation 21 said the fearful went to hell that means they couldn't learn to have the the spirit of power love and a sound mind they refused to be tall i'm just going to be fearful so they went to hell the unbelieving i'm not going to believe in god i'm not going to believe in jesus christ i'm not going to listen to him they receive they refuse faith they couldn't be taught to have faith the abominable the disgusting they couldn't learn that homosexuality is disgusting or bestiality they couldn't learn that cross-dressing they couldn't learn transgenderism is abomination the side of god they couldn't learn it they didn't want to learn it right yeah murderers went to hell because they wouldn't learn about forgiveness and how to repent from hatred and how to repent from wrath they couldn't learn it they would not be taught by the holy spirit how to love and forgive and pour coals upon the head of your enemy praise god right be kind to your enemy love your enemies bless those who bless those who persecute you rather whoremongers which is any sexual sin right they couldn't learn of the holy spirit how to control their sexual passions so they went to hell they didn't want to learn how to be temper right and control they couldn't they wouldn't learn that that anointing of the holy ghost temperance sorcerers demonic which is demonic powers they wouldn't learn to avoid the occult right and all the pleasures satan offers for a season they didn't realize or they didn't want god's pleasure they knew god's pleasures were there but they didn't want god's pleasure they couldn't learn to get pleasure in serving the lord in the house of god amen but thank god we got it hallelujah amen idolaters go to hell the bible says they couldn't learn to worship the one and only deity they wanted to draw strength and they wanted to look at something else rather than have faith in the one true god they couldn't learn that there's only one god they couldn't learn that i'm not talking about trinitarians they can still be saved unless they go unless they go really far and they really do believe in three gods then they're then they are lost but if they're just ignorant they can be saved so idolaters you know they make money their god as we said any any person that would refuse to learn that god is the real provider of money amen god is a real provider of every good and perfect gift that we have need of and so they served other gods rather than god they go to hell because they wouldn't learn they wouldn't be taught the truth and all liars that's the last one that lists there they wouldn't learn how to be honest they wouldn't learn how to just tell the truth like it is every time and so jesus sends all liars he has to judge all liars are unworthy of everlasting life because they wouldn't be taught of god the bible said they shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death but all god's children are taught of god you are of god because you hear god's word let's stand to our feet praise god amen hope that was a blessing saints my just it's just a beautiful topic a beautiful subject i i just couldn't get away from it i've been looking at the last maybe three four weeks or so and i just trust that the power of jesus christ doctrine is a reality in your life and i know it is i love all of you we love all of
