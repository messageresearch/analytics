announcements for Sunday brother Sampson Shetty's a pastor from India he'll be preaching on Sunday morning I just got news that he he needed a place to come he's on his works his way around America to kind of raise support for his orphanage I think has an orphanage over there and a church so most people over there in India have no jobs they happen to have no job so they don't have nothing to give they can't even support their own people so he'll be come and preach in Sunday morning Sunday night but the Hosea will give us testimony so we're looking forward to that brother you said you're gonna try to condense it for us he said I could take three hours I think you do his testimony so because he loves the Lord and God's done so many things in his life so we're thankful for that looking forward to hearing the testimony so here's a prayer request we'll have our brother Adam come in just a moment sister Shirley lorises wife is still alive she's been in hospice for almost week now she's

let's get into the Word of God here by the grace of the Lord I want to go to a second Timothy chapter one again when I come preach another message on the spirit of fear by good grace of the Lord like to look at that thought again tonight let's go to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 2nd Timothy 1:7 just want to thank everybody again we had a wonderful fellowship on Sunday appreciate everybody bringing all the food and the time devoted to being with the Saints by God's grace so we appreciate all the fellowship and a wonderful time in the Lord and all the sacrifices that went into that thank you everybody for all the sacrifices you gave to have that fellowship so second Timothy 1:7 like to start there let's read that and then we'll read one more scripture we'll read Matthew 10:31 let's read 2nd Timothy 1:7 let's read this on three one two three four God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind now go to Matthew 10:31 that'll be our other scripture Matthew 10:31 Matthew 10:31 let's all read this on three one two three fear ye not therefore year of more value than many sparrows that's how word of Prayer let's just bow our heads as we look to the Lord tonight if you need on your heart just make it unto God Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord God where your love is there is no fear Lord God for perfect love casts out all fear or take this moment tonight Lord God and the greatness of your power and your glory Lord yet Lord the Bible said to be the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe Lord so let the preaching of the gospel tonight be through the power of the Holy Spirit dear God and Lord just break your word to your people father may each one of us be delivered from any fear Lord God each one of us Lord have such a faith that it will conquer and cast down any fear for any situation Lord God we know you're able Lord God so help us to be willing Lord and help us to be listening Lord God to the Word of God help us to hear help us to believe with faith in our hearts Lord Jesus guide us Lord you said you guide us into all truth we trust you to do that tonight Lord bless your people for coming out Lord physically to the house of God tonight be with those livestreaming Lord in different places may they sense your presence may they focus on You Lord God may they meditate upon the promises Lord and may you give them what they have need of tonight Lord God will not leave empty for your glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you be and see the praise guy look at different direction than we went on Sunday morning I was real blessed to see different people encouraged by the message Sunday that really blessed me I'd like to take this thought though Jesus always said fear not that's my topic Jesus always said fear not that's my topic tonight the prophet of God said that in testimony in Los Angeles Jesus always said fear not do not fear if you do then God can't work with you if you do believe then God can work with you how many want God to work with them amen so one look at this thought here that's my subtopic as Jesus said always fear not amen so I felt kind of as I was studying and preparing I kind of felt led to go that direction we're gonna be reading a lot out of the Gospels tonight and look at the many times jesus said fear not and look at as we look at that look at every situation and see how it applies to our lives because we are constantly dealing with fear how many would raise your hands say I battle with fear often you know it's something natural that's inside of us you know the natural fear when something bad happens usually our our instinct inside of us is fear but there's such a thing called a spirit of fear which is a demonic power that can come upon someone and anoint them the Bible said people can give a place to the devil in their minds and they also can think of as fear and they become prisoners to fear that's all they can think of that's all they can experience is fear because the Bible said fear has torment and we don't want to be tormented we want to be free in Christ today praise God and Jesus offers us that freedom from fear if we're willing to believe his word amen so I want to look at this thought and we want to look at how fear is our greatest hindrance I want to read some quotations again from the prophet of God from brother Graham's quotes he said there has been the greatest thing that I found him unchristian people throughout the entire world has been fear they're always afraid when a little sickness try they're afraid next he says one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody's scared to death it's always what's going to happen who it's gonna happen to what's going to happen but Jesus said when the fearful sights come lift up your head and rejoice for your Redemption draweth nigh amen the Prophet said again the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear everybody's scared to death about something but he says what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy and carefree and singing up here and testifying back there amen how many how many like the walk around their house singing and testifying of the Lord you've got to create the atmosphere of faith in our homes you know it's been neat to see what we've been doing the youth group with the kids and it's been neat to see each week they get caught somehow singing to God while they're cleaning their room or singing to God while they're passing out the clothes or the laundry it's the need to see how each child is able if they can get in the channel of God to create the right atmosphere and children does it make a difference in your lives when you're singing does it make a difference you feel different don't you and your singing God's praise and you have faith in God's Word it creates the right atmosphere we don't want to create the spirit of fear it allow them to come upon us we want to create the atmosphere of faith around us amen you know Sunday night after church I went home and I started getting some burping I was constantly burping and it's that feeling I get when I'm gonna throw up and I feels feeling awful but I was also having a burden for a certain but I knew was struggling so I went up to my room and I was just praying on my knees and I just kept burping and I thought I don't like this I feel like I'm gonna get sick and something faith just rose up inside of me and I just spoke to that sickness and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I'm just sitting there praying on my bed you know my knees I just said and the name of Jesus Christ I command this sickness to leave and I just started giving God glory just you know whisper and saying thank you Jesus I know you're gonna touch me I know and I was I wasn't planning on doing that it just kind came to me and God is my witness within a matter of five or ten or fifteen minutes all the pain and left and I've been burping for a while like a couple hours I'm thinking oh here we go I'm gonna get sick I don't want to throw up I don't want to get sick the kids just got over it a few weeks ago and I some just came upon me to speak the word and within a matter of minutes God took over so that's my testimony of hearing the Word of God and and remembering I'm not to fear to get sick I'm to have faith against that and I spoke the word against it and I just this week experiencing the power of the word how many know there's life and speaking the Word of God we there's power of life and death in the tongue so I was so stirred up from Sunday that I went home and that sickness couldn't get to me because of God's Word and I'm so grateful for that I just want to make sure I testify to that and give God the glory amen very thankful for God's mercy praise the Lord I want to read a few more quotes about how fear is such a great hindrance let me let's look at a few more here by the grace of the Lord he says this we find out over the world there's a great fear setting among all the peoples in this Atomic Age when it's just ready for anything to happen so here's the thought of the Atomic Age and how many ever hear about North Korea you hear about North Korean almost every week on on the news how they might get a missile a few years ago you remember it was Iran the prime minister of Iran well he's got a nuclear he's got a nuclear and so there's all these things that Satan uses to try to get people to be afraid and get them to fear and those can be uh those can be real dangers but we've got to put all of our faith and confidence in God's grace and in God's power we can't let ourselves get fearful we must be full of faith amen we must not let fear bring us down now what to read another here by the grace of Lord he said all the nations are scared to death there's they said there's some atomic bomb somewhere we know science has developed mechanical things at any moment without warning the whole world can go to pieces and the world is scared but he says I'm not scared of the world going to pieces there's going to be a thousand year millennial reign after all of this is over so God's Word cannot be defeated people are scared about the world blowing up or the world being destroyed that's impossible because the Bible said God is gonna burn it over with fire and then started anew and then have a thousand years of peace after the tribulation so God's Word cannot be defeated people create all these mount in the fearful images well we have to all fly to Mars or we have to all do all these things but the Bible never says that the Bible says we're gonna live on the earth in a period of peace where the lion lies down with the lamb praise God where the children will lead a serpent the Bible said America likes to catch him but in the but when Jesus restores all things he'll lead the Bible said the general lead the Serpent's with the string or with a leash they'll lead the Serpent's around and there'll be no hurt the Bible said they will not destroy or hurt in all my holy mountain God is gonna restore this earth he's gonna renovate this earth but people are scared of things that aren't even possible according to God's Word aren't you glad you know God's Word amen people fearing about all these things happening if they would just look to the Bible the Bible tells us the end the Bible tells us how this world finishes and we're glad to know it amen and we want to share it with all those we can share with all those that have a heart to hear we want to share it with them now he says this again in this is in Waterloo Iowa he says this we find this great day that we're living one of the most blessed days of all the times for those who are ready to meet God so how many ready to meet God if you're ready to meet God it's one of the most blessed days to live in he said but it's one of the most fearful and dreadful hours facing the unbeliever his destruction at and so this is the day where it's the most blessed hour if you're a Christian what's the most fearful hour if you're an unbeliever so the world is going to be afraid but we're not to be afraid we're to have hope in the Lord now let's go back to Revelation 21 verse 8 I want to revisit this scripture from Sunday we looked at this scripture on Sunday morning I want to revisit this revelation 21:8 and this is fully backed up by Scripture I you know even preparing today I found a lot more scriptures that can support this this thought that we looked at on Sunday morning remember jesus said that somebody can be lost by just this obeying one command that's what Jesus said about the rich young ruler he kept all the commands but he told the rich young ruler go your way sell everything that you have and come and follow me he turned it down and the Bible said later that he was lost right the Bible says that for later on he built all the big barns and everything like that and then the Bible said later he was caught and he went down to hell so he just disobeyed one word he loved though pleasures of the world he loved money more than he loved God and because of that it kept him from being saved because he served Mammon rather than rather than serving God revelation 21:8 let's look at that scripture again I just read verse 7 because it's a great promise to you and I he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be as God and he shall be my son but the fearful the unbelieving the abominable the murderers the whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death how many feel that's a pretty serious Scripture my goodness someone can go sadly someone will go to hell because they're just fearful because they let that sin overtake them and they choose to serve fearfulness and obey fearfulness rather than accepting the grace of Jesus Christ that's right jesus said they will he said I've come that you might have life here let's go that let's go to John chapter 3 verse 16 we all know John 3:16 but afterwards Jesus said many will not come to him because they loved the world more than they loved the Word of God so we must love the word more than we love anything else John 3:16 this is the famous scripture for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now now Jesus goes on to show what belief in God actually looks like for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God now here's verse 19 and this is the condemnation so we're going to people be condemned and go to hell this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God praise the Lord don't you love that look at the promise of God Jesus said the reason people will go to hell is that they love the pleasures of the world more than they love God we must love God with all of our heart soul mind and strength amen we've got to make sure we love God with all that we have and leave no doubt to anyone that we love God more than everything else hallelujah now so see people can fall in love with fear more than they fall in love with God and how does that possible the Bible said they're so they'll serve fear more than they'll serve God you see it all the time with with drugs you know you see people you see drugs take people down in the road why you know why would they choose to do that they choose to serving drug they're choosing to serve drugs more than they serve the Word of God let me know God's word has power to deliver from drugs I mean that I've been delivered from numerous addictions different drugs God has delivered me from that you can use another one like greed people choose to serve money rather than serve God so if the Bible says something though they'll reject what the Bible said and they'll choose rather to make more money that's serving money and loving money more than serving God right just like drugs or alcohol relationships you can put any sit in there anything that makes someone a disobey God's Word can cause them to be lost and Jesus said that they won't come to the light because they love sin more they love righteousness amen I hope that's just painting a clearer picture for us tonight by the grace of God we must love to come to the light huh me love to repent huh me love to feel clean before God huh me love to come and and draw closer to God and feel like you're forgiven amen it's such a great feeling to feel forgiven to feel clean to know that you confess all your sin you've left the sin behind in your life and you're moving forward in Christ Jesus amen that's a Watts called walking in faith a man walking in the spirit hallelujah now that's uh I just something I want to lay down there by the grace of the Lord now the Prophet says this as well brother Ram said this he said everything is don't fear he said Jesus always said fear not let struck me when I heard that that Wow Jesus constantly said fear not and I knew angels always said fear not there's 71 scriptures that say fear not in the Bible angels always say fear not and Jesus was constantly telling the Saints to not fear and so brother Ram just kind of he gives us an overview and says everything is don't fear how many can relate to that in every trial of your life many times it'll come down to just not fearing because you have to you and I can't deliver ourselves from Satan's traps but it's God who's going to deliver us and so we must wait for God to deliver us I'm understanding that you know if you're sick you must wait for God to heal you praise the Lord so everything revolves around this thought of everything is don't fear everything is believed in every trial we must believe hallelujah because fear really is unbelief it's a form it's unbelief we're scared gods I got to keep his word now let's start going through the scriptures now I tried to put these in order of Jesus's ministry the best that I could but I was going you know Matthew Mark Luke and John trying to put these in order I did the best I can you got your Bibles go to Luke chapter 5 this is the first time I can find Jesus saying fear not it's right when he's calling his apostles his 12 apostles Luke 5 verse 8 Luke 5 verse 8 now as we go through these stories compare it to your life compare it to where you are right now let's look at this you can also look back at your life and see well where has this ever happened in my life hey men hallelujah now this is the miracle of the draw of fishes when Jesus was first calling his disciples all right now this at the lake Jenna Sarah and verse 1 Matthew 5 1 well let's go down to verse 4 Jesus was teaching the people on the ship now verse 4 now when he left speaking he said Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drop and Simon answering said under the mass under him master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net never had a real hard night I'm not sleeping I've had a few not too many I know my wife said a lot of hard ones with the children long hard nights or I've had this many times I get up and there are certain stresses in the church or certain stretches stresses in the job or problems and I can't go back to bed it's 1 a.m. it's 2:30 3 4 I can't go back to bed because of the pressure and so Peters been up all night and he's washing the net saying well we had a hard night nothing game in and Jesus says we'll go back out they already came in and he says go back out it's kind like you get home from work and the Lord would say we'll go right back you're not done and it's hard for Peter and he says fine at your word Lord and that's a good lesson right there even we're at our weakest times let's obey God's Word he said nevertheless he said okay Lord at your word I'll believe it even when we're tired god help us to obey the Word of God now verse 6 you know the story when they done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned on their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man Oh Lord look Peter recognizes I'm sinful just by doubting just by just by Oh bang with a bad attitude you can I say like that sometimes we obey we don't feel like it and Peter recognizes that as sin doesn't the Bible say we should have a cheerful attitude we should cheerfully obey the Word of God how many want to be cheerful when they obey the Word of God oh yes I want to when I hear the word I don't want to disagree with it or grumble under my breath and say well I guess I'll do this because the Bible said so god loves a cheerful obey her amen he loves a cheerful Giver he also loves someone that will cheerfully obey the Word of God that should help us church if we have to fit to have a bad attitude and grumble to obey God's Word god help us to humble ourselves god help us to humble ourselves now look at he says this verse 9 for he was astonished all that were with him at the draw the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus sent Simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men so this is interesting you know there they're all nervous you know their boats are gonna looks like their boats are gonna sing cuz they have such a blessing God has blessed their business so much but he tells Peter don't fear boys because you're not enough to worry about catching natural fish you're gonna be called for spiritual fish amen which is more valuable natural fish or spiritual fish we must win souls by God's grace amen this nation's been so down but there's still got to be somebody out there we're still here there's somebody we can witness to praise God let's have a heart to witness by God's grace now that's the first one now if you go down to verse 26 they they come to the end of the day they've had they had and the Bible said they say we've had a strange day seeing all these miracles was a strange day verse 26 and they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today so the power of God brought a great fear upon them and verse 27 and after these things he went forth and saw public and named Levi sitting at the feet of customi sending them follow me so you see where this is that Jesus has to kind of put fear in the hearts of these apostles to show them that he's God and then they'll follow him see Jesus has to prove his power to them to convince them to leave everything and follow how about with you to God have to do that for you did he have to show you his power and his glory he and that's what we need Church the beginning of wisdom is what fear it's grace that taught our hearts to fear right and grace our fears relieved amen God needs someone that will fear him if he's to lead them if they don't fear God then it will do no good then they won't want to follow Jesus but we must fear God first and then follow in his word amen so see that he starts calling them one by one he's he's done son he's done a miraculous thing and he now has caused fear to come in their heart a good godly fear in their hearts that's the first time I could find Jesus saying fear not now go to Matthew 10 verse 16 here's the next time he's going to send out his apostles to preach two by two Matthew 10 19 I'm sorry ten sixteen parmie now put yourselves in their position you're gonna go out to buy to you and someone else are gonna go into a town that has never heard the gospel they've never heard that there's a prophet in Galilee but you're the one to introduce them and they've just done Pharisee or sad you see or Herodian they had never seen the power of God they've never heard about this rabbi but you're the one who's gonna bring the message of the hour to this this city right all the this is how Jesus sends them out and I look what he says in verse 16 behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves she's didn't beat around the bush he told them you're gonna be like sheep amongst wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless of doves then he tells me to watch out in verse 17 verse 17 said beware of men for they will deliver you up in the council's and they will scourge you in their synagogues who's usually Jesus biggest critics is that the sinners or the church members the church members who's the ones that crucified Jesus the church members right the Jews of his day were shouting crucify him crucify him and number pilot gets convinced well I better get I'm fearing the Jews I better give in and give them to Jesus it was the church members that killed Jesus right and the Bible said the mark of the beast at the end time will be a false Christian Church the Bible said to be a false Christian Church that'll deceive people and you cannot buy or sell so it's connected to your bank accounts right it's connected to the ability to buy groceries you cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast right we know that that's parts the end time it's a false Christian religion that peoples of the world will be sucked into and will take the mark of the beast and we'll be damned by taking the mark of the beast so it's a false deception of churches right and what is that mark of the beast what 666 you remember that 666 is the title of the Roman Pope vicarious Phil I de remember that in Latin he's called Vaqueros Felidae which means instead of the son of and if you add up the caressed feel that day the Latin if you added up with the Roman numerals equals 666 so at some point the Pope of Rome will be the Antichrist and you can see it now because he exalts himself above the word his word is above the Word of God you say give me example well Jesse I love to the Pope said that we should pray to Mary and there's not one scripture in the Bible that says we should pray to Mary can anybody find one there's not one right the Pope says that we should pray to Mary I saw his tweet he said I remember I showed it to you if he makes it ever raised you're a few remember that didn't remember that okay the children okay you guys remember that the Pope said if you don't pray to Mary and if she's not your mother you're an orphan well there's nuts not in the entire Bible the Bible said we pray to one person who drew prayed to Christ the Bible said there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus and I've read the Catechism of the Catholic Church I've almost read all of it and they say when the Pope speaks from the seat of the Basilica of st. Peter's Basilica in Rome he's infallible right and so no matter what he says whether it's in the Bible or not whatever he says is his truth it's infallible it cannot fail and the Bible said the Antichrist will exalt himself above the word of God he'll send the Temple of God saying that He is God so church we must pray for people to come out of those systems the people aren't bad people but the system is a deceptive system that is if the system adds to the Word of God how many can say amen to that it adds to the Word of God it absolutely does remember the Catechism calls it calls Mary the mother of God and there's not one scripture in the Bible where Mary's called the mother of God it calls Mary the mediate ryx there's not one scripture in the Bible where it's called where she's called Mediatrix you see so this is what Jesus found out - jesus said beware of men for they will deliver you up to the council's it's going to be religious people that actually persecute the true Christian and the true Christian is one who believes the Word of God amen let's keep going verse 18 and ye shall be brought before governors and the Kings for my sake for a testimony of them for the end the Gentiles but when they deliver you have take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in the same hour what ye shall speak you know I had this Sunday I had this happen to me Sunday somebody came by and was talking to me and I don't know if you saw I don't know who's out there somebody not in our church somebody just come by and said something awful about real loud in front of everybody about somebody else in our church and I was so shocked but I was still under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and they said this person is so awful this I said you want to go talk to him and I didn't even think about it the Holy Spirit just brought it right to me I said you want to go talk to him and the person got real quiet and then drove away shortly after they were this person was bad-mouthing someone in our church right in front of them and I didn't know what to say but the Holy Spirit brought it to me and I didn't laugh at it I didn't agree with her because that's gossip right that's bad-mouthing people that's hurting somebody's but I experienced this on Sunday this person badan out of somebody just a few feet away and I said you want to go talk to him right there oh and they said oh he's here I said he's right there I didn't agree with that gossip I didn't agree with that but the Lord gave me what to say in that hour and I appreciate that by God's grace I appreciate that it was so striking it just in churches just like that it just came out I didn't have to think about it just came out right because that's why that's why Jesus gave you the spirit it'll give you what to say in the hour you need aren't you thankful for the Holy Spirit hey then it'll give you what to say in that hour we're not to gossip we're not to swear we're not to speak evil we're not to fear and the Holy Spirit gives us the power not to do it Amen that's right Church Alleluia amen I love to see that happen in my life he's just like you we'd love to see it happen in our lives we can go under the anointing of the Holy Spirit how do you look at verse 24 it is not you that speaks but the Spirit of your father which speaks in you that's what we need more of God speaking through us now lugia verse 21 and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise against their parents and cause them to be put to death and you should be hated of all men for my namesake but he's an endure to the end shall be saved remember he's still talking to his disciples when they persecute you in this city flee to another so see Jesus and tell them to be martyrs did he at the beginning he told them to run from evil at the beginning his disciples he and say die you know give your lives as a sacrifice he said go to the next city they persecute you flee away in other words keep preaching the gospel amen I like that he should not have gone over the cities of Israel to the Son of Man become the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above is Lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household and we saw this with Jesus right they call Jesus Beelzebub because of all the supernatural and so then they hated his disciples right because he was doing the same thing Jesus was now here's where does verse 26 fear them not therefore these are people that are going to kill the disciples right they're gonna kill them they're gonna try they're gonna drag them into courtrooms and Jesus said you're like sheep in the midst of wolves he said fear them not for there's nothing covered that shall be not revealed in here that should not be made known amen don't fear people try to speak evil against you if people would persecute you say evil for you against you as being a Christian jesus said fear them not how many appreciate our Lord amen remember our titles Jesus always said fear not before he sends out his preachers to these these religious people that are gonna hate the truth he knows they're gonna hate the truth he says be ready to run right be ready to run and don't fear the men you have to run but don't fear them keep preaching the Word of God hallelujah now I'm gonna go down to verse 28 Malachi and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell and this week I was watching more videos about Isis and I watched some pretty graphic videos I didn't know they're gonna be that graphic but it showed you know people being murdered by the the Isis and it just kind of struck my heart as I read this about about Jesus you know and what jesus told his disciples here we have Christians that are willingly dying today to Isis and they give their lives over and Jesus said fear not those who can kill your body because they can't touch your soul so I appreciate don't you appreciate that Christians my such rugged Christians of such pure faith they're able to give their lives over and die for the name of Jesus Christ because they're more scared of God than they are men but see their fear for God is not a UH it's not a bad fear it's a holy fear praise God and you see that you see and that's the kind of faith we want praise God our country doesn't have much religious persecution yet we know it's coming because the Bible said it will come but we don't have that yet but we should pray for those who are being persecuted for the Saints in Thailand in prison have you prayed for them have you prayed for the Saints in Iraq and Iran and Saudi Arabia that are in prisons we should be praying for those individuals but see Jesus says don't fear those who can destroy your body fear those who can or fear Him who can destroy your both your body and soul in Hell amen this is a great word for Jesus to give to his his disciples go to verse 29 Malachi if you can are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father now this is a either 1/4 of a penny or 1/2 of a cent depending on which time period are not two sparrows sold for a farthing a quarter of a penny or a half of a cent so the value of these sparrows are very little and G and God Jesus says God knows every time one of those bird dies and how much more valuable are you than those birds praise God look at verse 30 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered Hawkins hallelujah he tells them don't fear I've even numbered the hairs of your head you're more valuable than the birds don't fear what man shall do to you first 32 therefore whosoever therefore shall confess me before him him will I confess also before my father which is in heaven Luca verse 34 think not that I am come to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword now what Jesus says I'm going to send this sword where does he send this sword the next verse tells us Malachi verse 35 the next verse tells us for I am come to set a man against variance against his father and the daughter against his her mother and the daughter in law against her mother-in-law so Jesus says when the real gospel comes it will sometimes divide families but we must stay with Christ in his word amen we must stand with Christ more than father more than mother more than brother sister we must stand with Jesus Christ that's the sword that's going to come but we must love Christ more than anything else that's right verse 36 a man's foes shall be they of his own household jesus said this is what you're gonna cause you know and as a man that's hard to do right you know and I'm when we seen you know the yang family come in you know and we sing the grand family come in and to come into the Word of God you know in this day it's hard when families are torn apart but jesus said that has to happen the word is going to cause that and it's not it's not really to divide families as it is to unite the family of God amen that's what's actually happening when when some people won't believe and others will believe those that are believing actually being United to the body of Christ amen they're being united to Christ and this is the sword that Jesus said that was going to come when these two by two preachers go to every city there have to divide houses and those that will believe shall be saved amen now I don't want to finish there's a lot going on in this chapter but I want to skip to the next one let's go to Matthew 14 22 let's skip ahead to this one I just thought I'd spend more time on that one because that was really there's some really striking things in there I want to make sure I preached most of them you heard but I just want to bring it make it a refresher to you Matthew 14 22 we're looking at fears Jesus always said fear not constantly saying fear not before he sends out his disciples he says fear not now here this is Jesus walking on the water where Peter walked on the water 14:22 most of us know the story Jesus sends his disciples across the sea and said I'll catch up to you later I'm gonna go in the mountain and pray right but then in verse 24 the waves begin to be tossed there's a great storm verse 25 jesus comes in the fourth watch of the night which remember would have been let's see 6 to 9 would've been the first watched nine to twelve would've been the second watch 12 to three would have been the third watch so this is sometime between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the morning they're rowing and I've never done that I've never gone on the boat at 3 a.m. in the morning but these disciples are out at 3 am sometime between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. the last watch of the night it's real dark at that time isn't it real dark on the waters and the storm picks up and they don't have Jesus but in the fourth watch Jesus went out unto them walking on the sea between 3 and 6 in the morning when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out in fear so they see a man walking to them on the water and they're scared all it's a spirit it's a ghost it's a ghost verse 27 but straightway Jesus spake of them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid amen so in the very early morning hours when they're perplexed with fear thou lictors they have to twofold of fear they're fearful of the storm but they're also fearful of this body walking towards them but Jesus speaks the word and said be not afraid he said be of good cheer hallelujah it is I amen verse 28 and Peter answered him and said lord if it be if it be thou bid me come upon the water and he said come now look how quickly this is a good example for us look how quickly we can shift from being scared to the faith from scared to being full of faith look how quickly Peter before Jesus comes is all scared but when Jesus gets there now he's full of faith you ever experience the the back and forth nature of being a human being first you're scared and you're full of faith he starts walking on the water full of faith and the Bible said when he saw the wind boisterous in verse 30 he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and sent him oh though of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased now that's a good lesson for us right instead of being tossed to and fro like sea his faith was tossed he was first scared and then he's got faith and then he starts doubting instead of being tossed back and forth we must be fully persuaded amen we must keep the faith we must keep the the confession praise God we must not doubt what we've already heard the Lord say and how many like to read your Bible hear what the Lord tells you amen you can read the Bible and hear the same voice of the Holy Spirit speak just like Peter did amen and it can speak to your life today hallelujah it can speak but we must obey it we must not doubt it we must have faith in the promised Word of God amen alright that's the next time that's that's the third time so we've did the miracle with the fish we've done the sending out of the twelve and Peter walking on water the next one is a girl being raised from the dead in let's go to Luke 8:50 they have of course two parallel passages which means they have the same story in different books of the Gospels Jerry says daughter raised from the dead we just listened to it on Lamplighter yesterday yesterday on our drive home we listened to Titus comrade of the cross on the way home that was a beautiful story I just caught the end of exhausts and there's something else on the drive home but in the story you know the story Jarius you know his daughter dies he goes to Jesus and begs Jesus that Jesus comes to his home now you remember the story jesus walks in and everybody's crying and moaning and he said aw Jairus she's dead and Jesus looks and says she's just sleeping and they start laughing him to scorn and Jesus said get these people out of here praise God Jesus knows this girl's not gonna rise from the dead if people are fearful and afraid so he's got a kick out nice as we can say it Jesus has to kick out the unbelievers the people that won't believe he's got to kick them out and say get them out Jairus we only want believers in here amen sometimes God has to do that for us amen sometimes there's times people won't come to church or there's people that maybe leave early sometimes there's a reason for that and sometimes not every time but sometimes it's to make sure there's only people here that have faith amen because doubt would have hindered this woman from raising from the dead that's like when I told you the story when my grandpa prayed for his wife my grandmother Julia and she raised from the dead at the Wasi on Fulton County Hospital he only had the doctor in there him his pastor and a deacon there was only four people in there and the doctor agreed to pray with them the doctor bowed his head and prayed I think that was a night I don't remember in 1968 or and I remember what year that was but my Uncle Roger had just been born and my grandmother Julia died and they all had to agree in prayer there was nobody down there they didn't believe everybody believed and my grandfather said the pastor they just joined hands and prayed they touched her body in five minutes you know it started to get a little warm in a few more minutes she was breathing a few more minutes she was up and she was awake and my grandfather spent the rest of his life saying Oh hallelujah has a Spanish dialect you know he'd say how do you think of Jesus you know God raised my wife from the dead and he told that testimony everywhere he went amen that God still raises people from the dead but see you can't have unbelief there you've got to have faith there the first time I cast out demons in South America remember the story I told it I was all scared but then something dropped down from heaven I felt it come upon me I just felt something coming upon me and it said love casts out demons and at that moment I was no longer scared this woman was just staring straight ahead and talking like a come on zombie or something like that and I looked at her and I talked to these brothers I said there's too many there's all these kids they're all kind of scared as teenagers looking at us all kind of scared like oh the preachers gonna try to cast out the demon and you know I noticed that so know what I did I told her I told two other people and a pastor I said let's take her behind this house and let's go pray for let's get away from the crowd amen I just had such something came down upon me it was the Holy Spirit I know that it can I know that now and I had I said there's no way we're gonna be able to pray for this Dina possessed girl she's a stairs right ahead and making noises and could hardly talk and understand her we had to take her behind the house and this and God is my witness we join hands and I said let's pray for this demon to leave and as soon as I said that she started kicking and fighting all those things I just bowed my head I prayed in the name of Jesus Christ say in the blood of Jesus Christ is against you this is God's God's daughter she started screaming and fighting we just held on to her and the devil threw her down to the ground we just kept praying all of a sudden she just let go and I kinda like passed out and I later read in the Bible that's exactly how Jesus cast them out hey man how are you it's exactly how Jesus and their like we got a patter on the cheek and said how do you feel she said I feel better I said let's praise the Lord and we started and then it happened a few days later I was praying for a girl and she bit me on the arm before she fell down the ground and before the demon was cast out and so see these things have to happen you have to be away from fear and yet be full of faith that's how these things happen there can't be any fear you can't have any doubt jesus said that in Luke 8:50 let's read that Luke 8:15 so those are two stories where everybody around was full of faith there was no fear and then God moved on the scene look 850 but when Jesus heard it you answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole all's you got to do Jesus says is believe you cannot fear you must believe only how many want to believe only amen I found that to be true I know that's the truth Jesus proved it the Bible proves it if we only can get rid of all the fear and just believe all things are possible then the belief amen that's the that's the fourth time there the fourth example I've given how am i doing on time okay I got 10 more minutes let me set my timer I just wanna preach about an hour are you enjoying this tonight by God's grace Jesus always said fear not always fear not fear not in every situation whether sending them out whether dealing with sickness or death or healing he always had to get the fear out first before he could do any miracle all right now the next one is John 619 let's go there John 619 I'm sorry I'm sorry I already retired read this one yeah I'm sorry we gotta read this is a parallel passage the one we already read pardon me are you read that one yeah I'm sorry my fault let's go the next one here by God's grace let's go to mark 1032 this will be encouraging for you and I mark 1032 mark 1032 this isn't necessarily a miracle but this is Jesus bringing comfort to the people mark 1032 I want you to see how Jesus come first watch how he comforts them because God might be comforting you tonight the same way there might not be anybody here a demon-possessed I don't see anybody demon-possessed in here I don't see anybody may be dying and thank God you know that that God's blessed us where we don't have those troubles but this is definitely one thing we can pull away and say this is true we need all the other times for when people are sick or dying or close to death we need all we need all the scripture for that but tonight this might be one that was really for us mark 10:30 - and they were this disciples they were in the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took unto the again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him now verse 33 1033 so I got the room yeah saying behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be delivered under the chief priests and the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and she'll deliver him to the Gentiles and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and he shall and shall kill him in the third day he shall rise I don't know if you caught that there but the thing is they're going up to Jerusalem and they're all scared and so what does Jesus do to help them in their fear he tells them what's going to happen in other words he foretells the future would that encourage you I wonder what's gonna happen I wonder what's gonna happen Jesus says I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen in other words I'm gonna prophesy and I'm gonna tell you the future hallelujah glory don't you like that Amen Jesus in order to comfort them says let me tell you the future and the Bible said the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy hallelujah thank you Lord they're going up there all afraid he tells them the future the future should comfort us praise God because Jesus tells us what's going to happen amen all right now go to Luke 1231 let's go to Luke 12 31 Matthew Mark Luke Luke 12 31 I hope that was a blessing Luke 12 31 Jesus had just in Chapter 12 he just warned the of 11 of the Pharisees gave the parable of the rich few fool which is actually the rich young ruler for that we talked about earlier went to hell because of his love for money he kept all the other commandments but he just didn't keep the commandment about riches he loved riches and so the Bible said he was lifted up his eyes in hell because he loved money more than he loved God how awful how sad is that Luke 12 31 but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for as your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom Amen in that beautiful promise we must put God's kingdom first above everything above our jobs above our families above our homes got seeking God and doing God's will must be first and then he promised everything will be added to you don't fear I'll give you the kingdom and the Kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the power of God the believer if you just seek God first and put him first the kingdom of God will come to you it's a promise amen now let me show you a couple where fear hinders here's a few where fear hinders the people let's go to we're already in Luke let's go to mark 9:31 mark 9:31 let's go there mark 9:31 and 32 Jesus always said fear not we're seeing this all the time he tells everybody fear not fear not no matter what situation whether just a beginner whether your disciple being sent out whether there's sickness in the home every time it's don't fear don't fear have faith in God amen mark 9:31 for he taught his disciples and said then the son of man is delivered in the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise that third days this is a parallel passage what we read earlier look at verse 32 but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him so here's something we want to learn from Jesus preaches the word and they're scared to ask in the meaning of that we don't want to be scared to ask God though what his word means right we want to come to God in prayer when I say lord help me to understand this they should have went to Jesus and they should have asked him right that's why we should be afraid if you have a question for me come bring a question I love questions if you hear another preacher preach something we shouldn't be afraid to go ask them because fear has torment right so the disciples here because they're scared to ask they can get themselves in a spot of torment they get them spot their selves in a spot where it's uncomfortable they don't enjoy serving the Lord because they're under fear all the time we and the Bible says that especially preachers should be ready always to give an answer for the hope that's what inside of them I remember that first Peter 3:15 but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer for those for the hope that you have within you praise God but see they were scared to ask you and I can't be scared to ask remember we like the Bible said there's no there's no love and fear right fear has torment we don't want to sit back in me torment well I don't know what this means I don't know what that means we should pray ask God and then go to the vessel that God sends us to we don't want to stand back and say well I'm just gonna be led by fear we don't want to be fearful we want to go to Christ and ask him amen God does not give the spirit of fear God didn't want them to be fearful God does not give the spirit of fear now then here's the next one Matthew 21 26 this is an interesting one about the Pharisees the primary remember this one where Jesus doesn't answer their question because they're afraid they're afraid of the people the Pharisees are afraid of the people and they're afraid that they would deny that John was a prophet they're afraid of what the people would do to them if they if they denied John was a prophet Matthew 21 26 remember this story now in verse 25 I'm sorry I'm just gonna go to 25 you have to the baptism of John whence was it from from heaven or from men so they asked Jesus what authority to have to teach these things and he said well let me ask you a question I like how God turns it around on them let me ask you a question there is trying to catch him in something wrong right with his questions he said the baptism of John wasn't from God or was it for men and these were men that wouldn't obey the prophet of God John the Baptist these are religious church members that wouldn't obey the spirit of Elijah hey they wouldn't obey the spirit of Elijah right oh my look what they said in verse 25 and they reasoned with themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say this why did he not then believe him verse 26 but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold John as a prophet so see they didn't want to admit that they feared the people right so here's the Pharisees are in a state of fear look what Jesus says because they're in a state of fear verse 27 and they answered Jesus that we cannot tell and he said well neither tell I you by what authority I do these things right see that they're scared of what the they're scared of what the people will think so Jesus says well I'm not going to answer your question if you don't have enough courage to state what you really feel I'm not going to answer your question so see Jesus will let people sit in fear if they don't want to obey the Word of God because Jesus is calling us out the Bible says he that the Sun sets free is free indeed Jesus wants that make his people free but if these religious people just want to sit there and don't want to know the Word of God and don't want obey God's prophet they didn't obey John the Baptist Jesus said fine then let them go there I can't help them because they're scared of the people and they're just trying to keep a position because it's all about money for some of these right it's all about money they just want to keep their stats their status in the community they want to keep their their paychecks you know they wanted to keep their homes and for some religious people they won't come out into the truth because they're scared about money they're scared of being rejected by the people you see that so geez leaves the nurses I'm not gonna answer your question I'm gonna let you stay in your fear because you're fearing to obey the prophet of the hour aren't you glad we've been Jo BAE the prophet of the hour amen let me close now there's my timer that was ten minutes so let me find my place to close here all right cause I still got a lot left I may have to finish this next Wednesday I might have to finish your next Wednesday let's close with this Romans four to four maokai let's just put these up here real quick I just want to go of this we've I preached on this a few years ago but I want to show how to get in love with God so faith can operate it starts with Romans 2:4 if we know how many what faith to operate in their lives I want that to out of walk and if there's something I want to walk in my home and the school or a church and if there's a fearful thing I want to have faith in that situation I don't want to be scared I don't have faith that you know God sent me here to help out the situation to be a man of faith not a man of fear I don't to be a man of faith here's how you get faith in your heart so you can operate God can operate through us now I'm gonna skip down here know not knowing that the goodness of God leads us to repentance so the first step in getting full of faith is remembering of how good god is we must remember how much God loves us right because goodness when you remember how much God loves you then you can repent because you know God's gonna forgive you right we're not we're not scared of going to hell that's what happens people get scared they get caught in their sins they think God can never forgive me God could ever give me but the Bible said we the goodness of God will lead you to repentance when you hear how much God loves you that should make you want to repent amen when you see how much mercy God has had upon your life to heal us or bring the word to you or help you or love you or provide for all your needs that seen the love of God should make us want to repent of our sins and in our mistakes that's how God works with us so first we must recognize how good God is to us and then we'll repent of our sins the next step is Jude 120 now I go to Jude 120 the first step is repentance if you sin against God in any way remember how much God loves you how good god has been to you repent of that sin and jude 1:20 says this you're getting good maokai good work buddy getting good on the computer there I always tell him all the time I'm proud of him he does a lot of he keeps up with us real good but ye beloved now look what it says building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost how do you get more faith brother Adam for the Hosea how do you get more faith you pray in the Holy Ghost I just pray the same old prayer routine Hilma Hail Mary Mother I mean some people can pray that I'm not making fun of them I'm just saying if they pray the same thing and it's not really from the heart it doesn't have any effect just like we can pray we can just come here and pray I can pray here but if there's no heart if there's no sincere in it the Spirit of God won't bless my prayer we have to pray in the Holy Ghost and that's how you build yourselves up in holy faith amen so church there's a reality behind that we need to pray until our faith rises but the first step is confess your sin know how much God loves you God's love will lead you to repent and then you pray until your faith is built up hallelujah and then next Scripture okay I'm sorry 21 Malachi so you pray and the Holy Ghost and keep yourselves the love of God don't hate anybody don't get mad at anybody love and love your enemies love those that say evil things against you keep yourselves and love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus and eternal life so first see how much God loves you wants you to repent repent of that then pray in the Holy Spirit pray with God's Spirit upon you until your faith rises keep yourself in the love of God first John 4:18 now Kai first John 4:18 a little bit faster if he puts up their force looks like I said I need to close my times already up first John 4:18 so if you've done all that there is no fear in love that's why Jesus would always say fear not don't fear don't fear nothing can be done if people are afraid there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear right so this is the step this is step number two love cast out off here the first step is recognize God's goodness and pray building up your faith step 2 when you're full of that love and faith that will cast out all the fear in your heart because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love now our flesh might be fearful but we got to have faith in our hearts because sometimes our flesh you can't help but your flesh is just going to be scared but if your mind is all if your mind is clear from all fear you can stand there on the Word of God and know what's gonna happen amen perfect love casts out all fear now look at verse 19 this goes along with the previous scripture look at verse 19 Malachi says we love him why because he first loved us so that goes back to that first step you have to remember how much God loves you we must remember how much God loves me praise God then repent of my mistakes and then pray in the spirit until our faith is built up and then that faith will cast out all fear amen hallelujah and then the last scripture let's stand on our feet Galatians 5:6 now I can put up there the last scripture then faith starts operating by love yep Galatians 5:6 thank you sir this is how it's done this is the Bible teaching on faith and fear for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision right here but faith which works by what what does faith work by love faith works by love so if you gots it in your heart let's go back again you gots in your heart remember how much God loves you repent confess your sin as you pray build up your faith believe God's promise then cast out all the fear now once all the fears out now your faith can operate now if you get sick now you can speak to that sickness right or now if somebody's sick you know now once all this is out your hearts pure pure before God now you can go pray for the sick person and trust God's gonna heal them you can have faith how many believe that by God's grace that is the scripture Jesus always said fear not praise the Lord I want to just close with this brother Craig I was watching his testimony in 1999 brother Brooks preached a sermon on the sermon title was Jesus never preach a funeral because he go into every funeral and raised the dead he never reached a fever that's awesome and brother Craig tells the testimony I forget what month it was was in 1990 must been in the spring or summer or winter because they went outside and all of a sudden brother Brooke stopped and he said I feel that too close so they stopped there he's outside shaking hands is that Bible believers where where I was married my wife and I were married this was what we got married 2000 weeks this was four years before we got married and brother Craig said he went over to brother Brooks's house which is right next to the church he just reading his Bible studying all of a sudden here's a big bang outside the church he looks out the window and there was a car accident two cars collide at that corner right there where the church is Spencer bill Road I forget the other one I forget the name of the road and brother Craig he sees it and he's caused the brother Brooks his wife and he says call 9-1-1 there's an accident and they said and this is on the tape and this was also in the newspaper in Lima brother Craig has the article this was in the newspaper in Lima 1999 they went out and the situation and there was a an Indian man and his wife and they were Muslim and the Indian man is laying there and brother Craig said there's blood coming out of his face and his wife was a nurse and checked first pulse and he's dead she says she's screaming crying said there's no there's no there's no pulse and brother sun brother Craig's testimony there's no pulse this was just what all these 18 years ago brother Craig said the people in the church just heard a sermon that Jesus never preach a funeral he said they just go around there real humbly they just started praying just whispering dear lord have mercy and brother Josh for his twin brother you remember Josh for the song leader I donno if you member him his twin brother was going to church there at the time he said he felt that dead man's spirit and soul come down and enter back in the body and all of a sudden the man's eyes open and they raised him up and he was alive and they just started praising the Lord glorifying God and it was in the newspaper you can watch it on the testimony they have the picture of the man on the newspaper he had no pause his wife checked he's a nurse no pause they prayed God brought him back to life and the man wasn't even a Christian and that's how much power God has but see there was no fear in that it was just a bunch of young people his brother Craig and some young teenage you know boys and girls they there's out there praying and God raised the man back to life I remember other Simon was here and he's prayed for two or three people in the last few years that have died on the jobsite and God has eventually brought them back to life God is the god of Resurrection but we just must have no fear how many believe that by God's grace I'm given as many amazing examples as possible because I want to stir up your heart so no matter what situation happens tonight or tomorrow we can have faith and not fear and pray the prayer of faith and watch God come on the scene you know the Lord tonight let me close with that by God's grace that's just by our heads here Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord these things are stirring up my heart Lord God so thankful Lord God for your mercy and love
