Ephesians chapter six I liked it Lord willing maybe finish this book today nice conclusion chapter 6 verse 1 then tonight you know for the 4 p.m. service by God's grace will be preaching from my house and they will look at Bible covenants again thank you I think we're on the Davidic covenant or David covenant and then the new covenant that's the New Testament covenant the last one is the eternal covenant praise God Oh church this you know as I study these things at such a confirmation like God will never break his covenant we just we have to remember one thing we just have to respect God's covenant in other words respect his promises obey his promises and then he of course he'll keep his end of the the covenant by God's grace it's so beautiful so wonderful to see that God's covenants never fail think about that even the rainbow covenant is still in effect today God says I will not use water to destroy it and he gives us all these signs all these promises but now the promise is the baptism of the holy in the soul of the believer praise God so we can't really look out I mean we thank God for the rainbow but the the token now is in our souls praise God it's he wanted the token so close it was in our souls everyday thank you did that help okay okay so they just got to fiddle with some of the sounds back there thank you yeah we ever do the live stream because I'm always preaching you know so I don't know what it here it sounds like so thank you darling thank you and thank you children appreciate that so if even six verse one we'll just read one two four and then we'll do the memory verse as well so we can have that by God's grace season six why we just read verse one and then we'll just do our memory verse by God's grace season six one let's do that on three one two three children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right amen Romans 12 please Romans 12:1 and 2 Romans 12:1 and 2 praise the Lord that's this is what God is doing during this time he's renewing our minds we all face this virus right but we take one day at a time but we're not taking the same view as the world they take a totally different view to this o man's gotta solve it man the only way it's gonna be solved is by God's grace God will use men of course God will use women but we take totally different attitudes because our minds are renewed and we do the perfect will of God first 1 & 2 so let's read it and then ask the Lord to write upon our hearts Romans 12:1 and 2 1 2 3 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's have one more word of Prayer let's ask the Lord to minister here to every need if you have a need on your heart just make it unto God Heavenly Father we love you Lord we we know your word is true we thank you for your covenants or promises Lord God and Lord you look you could only swear by yourself with this covenant Lord you made a promise and there's no one you could swear by so you swore by yourself as you live your word will remain true as you live your promises will come to pass we thank you Lord that you're the greatest one Lord and all your promises are yeah and amen so our faith is in your word today father transform our minds today teach us through your word that we could take one day at a time Lord God and Lord by your spirit we could maneuver these dark times with your light for your word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path granite Lord God help us today may we feel your presence more and more Lord speak to us direct us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ's name everybody said Amen god bless you didn't see the praise gun so I just have a few slides there Lydia if you'd like to switch over by God's grace will try to finish this chapter Lord willing today so we thank the Lord for His grace be really nice to finish this thought here we'll see how the Lord works it out if I could I don't have the quotes in front of me but let me read them real quick last week you may remember I I mentioned a social media post that everybody was sharing about germ warfare so there's only two quotes on germ warfare I want to read them both to you so you understand because some people and I saw a lot of message people sharing the germ warfare quotes but if you read them carefully they all refer to the Tribulation Period okay so let me read it this is from 1954 Lorraine said let me pass something here quickly as our times going listen did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days that there'll be a germ warfare that diseases will break a pop break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's quite a statement the only way this fits in the scripture is if it's tribulation period okay that's the only way it fits because imagine that everyone else without the baptism holy ghost gets judgment the only way that fits is the Tribulation Period yeah praise God because remember the rapture comes Saints at a time where people aren't expecting it if if this was in the church age everyone would know it's the rapture because everybody would be sick except those that are in the churches the real Holy Ghost filled churches so yep that's why we have to rightly divide the word of truth and don't get me wrong I believe this school I believe those everyone without everyone without the baptism holy ghost of the tribulation that will all the plagues will fall on them the Bible says that the Bible says that because it will fall on everyone who's not the 144,000 praise God but there's but I we can't find any scripture that says during the church age though the germs will fall on everyone except the born-again Gentiles I don't see that I don't find that anywhere in the scripture he says now he's quoting member Ezekiel 9 which he said mark those that are signed crying in my house he said in everyone outside the city slay that's quite a Scripture only the people that are siding crying in God's house will be spared from being slain and everyone outside and he speaking of Jerusalem will be slain that are not sighing and crying that has to apply to the Tribulation Period right we know there's a lesson we know there's a spiritual lesson yes all those without the batson Holy Ghost will have to suffer and go through the tribulation we know that's spiritual but that's not a that's not a natural prophesy to the bride it's a spiritual prophesy to the bride it's natural to the 144,000 praise God I so hope everybody can understand that when when when message people use these quotes a lot of times it's they're not preachers and and that's nothing to say anything against them but if they don't have a gift to rightly divide the word they're gonna get it mixed up okay and what it does is I said last week it creates a fear upon people oh I better make sure I've got the Holy Ghost or I'm gonna get the coronavirus that's not what brother Graham saying okay and then we know there are people that had the Holy Ghost and had truck awful things happen look at Paul you know it couldn't you know a demon buffeting him he says a messenger from Satan is buffeting me yet he's born again so we know being born again doesn't promise us a life a picnic right it doesn't promise a picnic and so we got to be very careful how we interpret these quotes now let me continue on but with the angel or who had charged over these plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was why how much what kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition immune so brother Adam is actually applying it to the church but we know by Scripture brother Branham grew in his understanding he grew in his understanding and he said later all these plagues don't happen in the church age he said they happen in the tribulation period so this is a quote we rode brother man makes it sound like it's applied to the church but later he grows an understanding and realizes all that all these great worldwide plagues they're all for the tribulation okay so let me just share that there that we're not we don't want to be we don't want to be careless about how we use quotes that's and when we are that's when people get into false doctrines that's when people get into things like oh every word brother Ram says thus saith the Lord that's how they get into things like that because they they don't take enough time to pray about it and line it up and rightly divide the word of God alright so here's the second one that's the first one the second one is in 1960 he said he's talking about how in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God he said the Word of God lives tonight in us in the power of the Holy Spirit discerning even the thoughts of the heart how we thank thee that in this great hour when all hopes immortal life is finished atomic bombs are laying in the hangars hydrogen bombs sickness diseases germ warfare Oh God and everything the way it is knowing that the Bible said that man would actually rot in their flesh and that angel was given the Commission don't you touch any of those don't you come near those who has the wine and oil now that's a third seal quote brother Branham uses that later he says that was for the Dark Ages so see this is this is before the seals so brother Graham said the Bible became a new book when the seals were open praise God see brother Graham is just trying to do his best both these quotes are before the seals on germ warfare you just look up germ warfare and so he uses a third seal quote which he later says was thus saith the Lord it dealt with the church ages during the dark ages so like from 1,000 and it went up to about 1700 so he's speaking of still 700 years but here he's applying it before the those seals are open he's applying it to his day but it wasn't for his day it was for the previous day help us Lord amen god help us to be solid amen that's the thing today we need to be solid upon God's Word amen we need to ask the Holy Spirit to help us rightly divide the word of truth you know brother Austin sent me a text this week and he said what about this coronavirus I sent him a link to my sermon last week the coronavirus was prophesied by Jesus he said it's one of the Sorrows but it's not the end the end will be the plagues and the vials and the woes that's the end of the earth that's the end of the world as we know here today the world systems and so I hope that helped him by God's grace and then he uses the quote again from Ezekiel 9 don't touch those who the seal of God upon their forehead now that could be for the Jews as well praise the Lord so church I hope I just want to share those there's two quotes about germ warfare and we got to be careful how we use them so we don't promote fear rather than faith praise God and we want to rightly divide them and church I'll even say this I'm not gonna use any names but I did get a quote saying when I use that I'm sorry did get a text last week saying when I use that quote to encourage us not to promote fear I had somebody text me and repent for misusing that quote and they admitted it was the Holy Spirit discerning their hearts Very's God and now I just read you he's saying everyone without the Holy Ghost will get the germs that has to be the tribulation because there is nothing in that with the Word of God we don't see any prophecy with that with the Word of God can I give you another one real quick let me give you nothing a lot of people I've heard a lot of preachers say lately because I had a lot of time to listen to preachers cuz you know I'm at home not at school not at work I'm still working but I'm just not working the whole time I'm a lot of preachers use this this quote where brother Branham says I don't see anything that could hinder the rapture brother masters I don't see any scriptures that need to be fulfilled and until the rapture could take place but but that might be true but remember bro Graham said pick up your pen and write and he said according to revelation 13:16 the Beast is going to force the bride from preaching yes so see people will their souls like on one quote a germ warfare or I don't see any scriptures that need to be fulfilled the rapture could happen but yet what about other quotes so see the reason I'm saying that I like the HOS dad knows that I'm talking about because a lot of people say let's see there's there's no scriptures that need to be fulfilled the rapture could happen tomorrow well it might be true but look there's other scriptures there's other quotes or brother Branham seems their reference scriptures where they have to stop they have to force the bride from stopping to preach like we read I showed it to you last week so see what do we need we need to be not be wishy washy and immature we need to wait upon what we say we need to make sure that we're solid praise God because I'll tell you those that really have the Holy Ghost that are listening to fivefold ministry they won't be tossed by every wind of quote or wind of doctrine right they won't be tossed they'll be silent on God's Word so I just say like this well that's fine it is you know whichever quote you want to take one thing I know I want to be born again I want to be solid I would I want to I want to pray for people to be saved and be filled with the Holy Ghost you see I think a lot of people use these quotes to scare people because they're not ready right so because they're not ready they use it the wrong way right and a lot of times too they don't study deep enough or into the Word of God because remember Jesus said or Paul said the Holy Spirit searched the deep things yea the deep things of God see the Holy Spirit would take you deeper like Simon preached would dig it out praise God if you really want to get somewhere you got to dig out and find the very solid foundation of God's Word amen hallelujah praise God so see how those those are - there you have germ warfare 's 1 then you have this other one where I don't see any scriptures the rapture could happen well that could be true but then you've got him saying other things later like revelation 13:16 that this still has to be fulfilled before the rapture that's what he says in one place and he says something in another that's why we need the Holy Spirit to divide all truth praise God praise the Lord in church let me just let me know I say I'm not being critical again I'm just saying I see a lot of people tossed they're tossed from being fearful and then then their talks are like being prideful Oh like see I know I know all about the quotes and I know nothing can happen everything's already been fulfilled the rapture is gonna come and oh let's just be sincere praise God let's just be solid praise yeah let's just be loving let's just be a servant praise God rather than like I see a lot of people you know online they're thinking they try to be know-it-alls let's not try to be no dog let's just try to wait for the Holy Spirit to discern the truth from heir praise God now I just want to start with that so we had that okay now we did our text and our memory verse now let's look we'll try to get to the whole chapter here uh some of these things we've already gone over then josè me dad's we got listen up here real good real good and I and I and I think church if we're just humble then we will really consider these scriptures and examine our motives and how we we should look at how we treat children and grandchildren yeah we should especially as leaders because we're the leaders so that means the sisters are gonna look up to us in our homes and the children are gonna look to uh up to us so we we've got to be the ones to set a real godly example praise God and this is why as men we got to be really careful brothers not to get too upset because our anger can stir up other people to be angry right and you should see that like with you can see that with any politician it could be anyone it can be Obama Trump George W Bush if one of them leaders gets upset it will cause lots of people to be upset right any leader now also this is also true if the wife actually leads the home and she gets upset that will cause other people to be upset too right we've all seen that right where a woman actually she's in control of the home and she leads it by anger I've seen it in in some of my family members not in my house but in other places I've seen it where the woman actually the wife actually is the head of the home and by her anger she controls everybody else but today in the scripture the scripture is looking at the men as leaders and we have to make sure that we don't get angry praise God and we don't get bitter and we we don't get a we don't get wrath upon us right so let's look at this here now he's in 6 1 through 4 this is quite a statement here children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right so after chapter 5 now Paul begins writing to children but member of the previous chapter we looked at and I shared it with the sister and she said it was a real blessing she goes another church and she's a newly new mother and she said she said I never the last sermon I preached on marriage and husbands why she said I never heard it brought out like that I'd never knew the history of Rome and Ephesus she said this is really gonna help me and so I'm thankful that the Lord used that to help out a young wife remember Paul when he led into this he said submit yourselves one to another so he's he's promoting humility right brother branham member when brother Graham put on the apron to help out his wife that was him submitting right and submitting himself to his wife and his children serving them in order to help out the good of the family in other words submitting is you and I becoming servants that's why we emphasize that a few Wednesday's ago we need to be servants submit yourselves in the fear of God one to another so find out how can we serve each other praise God how can we help each other now one way you can do it is stay six feet away today I try to do that yesterday I went to it when I went to all day I tried to stay six feet and I'll let the guy get the cheese and I'll just keep my six feet away that's just a small example but when there's no virus around we should see how we can help people financially or with food or prayer many times or a hug or handshake or text they're just reaching out to people to help them is such an encouragement like I told you there's a man that I he calls me I'm his mentor and he says he'll just get my text and I'll say I'm just praying for you brother he'll say it brings tears to my eyes to know that you're praying for me and so that's one way I can we can submit ourselves others is reminding ourselves to pray for other people and to lift them up before God amen and see how we can serve other peoples so he says submit yourselves he says wives first submit their husbands and then husbands love your wives and so he he shows that this is how the kingdom of God works it works in mutual submission praise God praise the Lord so wives submit to husbands and husbands love the wives live for them right that's that's how Christ showed his love for the church he died for the church he gave himself for the church so a husband should give themselves to love their wives amen and now after this great mystery of marriage now he breaks into the children's realm now remember we read you the history last a couple of weeks ago three weeks ago I think it is now children were just treated like animals almost in this society it was very sad the Society in Roman times was very very wicked now unless they were unless they were rich children were often just like very very mistreated they weren't valued so if you are not a rich Roman family or a family and Ephesus the children the children were just like little slaves right they were basically just kept at home until they were about seven or eight or nine and then if they were a boy then they would follow they'd go with their dad to the carpenter shop or they'd go with their dad out in the field even from seven or eight years old for those that you probably saw in your country huh with the poverty children work in a young ages that and that's all they knew they were not taught to read write anything they were not taught anything important uh they were just they were basically there to serve and work and as you saw in the Roman times the Roman men they could beat their children or their wives and there was nothing that could be done women couldn't testify in court neither could children only men could it was just an awful society and children weren't valued very much now if you were rich yes and your children would get a tutor I think at the age of eight they would get a tutor and they be talking science and math and and then they would go up to a college right and they would learn and there would be scholars and they were they were more valued I imagine to the rich people but Paul is writing to the Christians and Ephesus these wouldn't have been the most rich people they would have been the common people and he specifically points the children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right so Paul reminds the children it is right it's the thing God wants you to do is to obey your parents now the word obey means to listen hearken one who on the knock at the door comes to listen who it is so children when shooters say you know when you hear a knock you want to go open the door that's how a voice of a parent should be to the Father Lydia Malachi can you come here real quick we should respond right away now in this age the children should pause their iPads right or pause their phone yeah dad yes dad how can I help your mom how can I help you and not be like yeah sure sure you should come when it when it's not you should come right that's obedience when you hear the voice come right respond to it now this is a good lesson for all the spiritual children when we hear the knock of God on our heart yes Lord yeah come come and deal with me in this situation deal in this room in my life right this is what the word obey means someone who listens for the nut and then they open that door they respond right away let's not leave Jesus out there knocking and just outside let's open the door let him come in praise God so this is what the word obey means obey your parents in the Lord for this is right now children let me say this just like a wife if a father or a husband sisters ask us to do something and we're not sure it's right it's okay to say that right is that okay is that is that the right thing for me to do because remember brother Branham asked me to lie and Meeta said is that the right thing to do Billy there's nothing wrong with that as long as it's done meekness are you sure dad you sure this would be right thing to do as long as it's asked in meekness because we only want to obey the things of the Lord we want to we want a submissive spirit we want to obedient spirit but look look how sensitive Mita was to the Holy Spirit her husband a prophet of God says lie tell him I'm not here but like he's right there he is there he said would that be is that exactly right Billy imagine she's holding the phone like cover in the folk are you sure that's right Billy is that the right thing to do and then he said yeah just tell him I'm not here I'm going outside so she lied said no he's not here right now but she asked him are you sure that's right so I want to just make sure the Bible says that obey your parents in the Lord so children you have that right if you're not sure if what Dad is asking you to do is the right thing you you have it's okay to ask me it's okay I'm not God I'm not right on everything fact I'll make mistakes right every person does and so that's and so that is so that we don't trust in other people but we trust in the Living God yes we follow the leadership and we follow the pastors in the fivefold ministry yes we follow a prophet of God we do that but we never make them the absolute God is the absolute so see that means to abase obedient to submit and then the Bible says in verse 2 now Paul quotes Moses so where does Paul get his where does Paul get his authority from Moses the Old Covenant praise God because it was a mo law praise God it was one of the Ten Commandments the moral law of God remember there was three kinds of laws there was 616 Old Testament laws but there was three kinds there was moral civil and ceremonial which is Levitical and we know the Levitical was fulfilled because Hebrew says were under a new priesthood amen and this kind of blood takes away our desire to want to say Amen he said that's been fulfilled we have a new High Priest hallelujah it's not Aaron in this children anymore it's Jesus it's Melchizedek came ahead it's a Melchizedek priest and this priest lives forever praise God he has the power of an endless life amen now I want to just emphasize that and I wrote that my book so the people would understand Paul gets his authority from the the previous covenant because God changes not and if God wants that command to continue on then God will let us know that it's going to continue on and that's what Paul does Paul lets us know God's command his moral law is continuing now into the New Testament if not then why did Paul quote Moses he had to quote Moses cuz God's moral law was it still a sin to murder it's still a sin to lie right it's still a sin to commit adultery right so that moral law much of that moral righteous law has carried over into the New Testament and if we're not sure we right ask the Holy Spirit to rightly divide the word of God like I'll give you an example just a moment with beards there's some Mester churches that say you got to grow beards yeah I should say that's okay that they can have their Liberty to do that but see that's where it gets it gets down it gets more challenging right because now well now you have a old test command it's pretty close to Deuteronomy 22:5 or it's pretty close to the Levitical law that we keep or this law in Leviticus right and so see what does it take it takes the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth praise God now so this is the verse to honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise and that's one thing I can say oh by God's grace when I was younger I really tried to honor my mother there's some times I said some things I told you before she'd stick soap in my mouth and I'd spit it out you know excited talk back and say dirty words and she she waited till I was like relaxed then she'd sneak up from behind and pour the soap right in my mouth I'm spitting out soap and all kinds of things like that but as I try to get older I tried to obey her and honor her I'll be that's why God has honored my life because if you honor them then the Bible says it's the first commandment with promise verse 3 that it may be well with thee and thou may us live long on the earth so that's a promise of God if you honor your mother and father then it's like honoring God and God will bless you he'll make your life well right and you'll live a long life on the earth praise God now let me just I want to put this up here because I've been reading this book here I'll show it with you it's called brief be fruitful multiply and it just shows all the scriptures about having children and it's a beautify God's grace but it's a beautiful book but see today if we have God's life if we're born again if we enjoy God's spiritual life that we ought to rejoice in God's natural life as well right because a child is not in the image of the devil a child in the image of God and we don't know who's going to be saved and who's not going to be saved so what I'm saying is that message believes especially message believers saying that we've got the Holy Ghost we should rejoice in God's natural life because we God's spiritual life praise God we're God's spiritual children so we should rejoice in natural children that's right raise god the bible speaks very highly of children and let me read a few scriptures you got your bibles let's read a couple here let's read them real familiar one first Psalms 127 let's go there I just pulled out a few I thought you would like here they always encourage me Psalms 127 yeah verse three 127 3 the Bible said children are a reward from God first 3 low children are an heritage of the Lord so they're God's heritage they're really part of God's family praise God they're from God from his mind and the fruit of the womb is his reward so see when when God sends us children it's like God is blessing that womb of that mother saying this is a good thing I'm blessing this family I'm blessing this marriage praise God he's putting his stamp of approval there praise God now look at verse 4 here's here's what I like here as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the use now what is an arrow it's for an offensive attack Amen so God is God is placing me as a father or all the father's as soldiers with a bow and arrow and we're supposed to walk out against Satan we're armed against Satan and our arrows are our children and our children are being leashed into Satan's Eden and they're gonna do damage against Satan's Eden praise God amen I don't know yeah that's the picture God's painting here it's a dark world it's an evil world but I've got some soldiers that have some arrows that I'm gonna shoot out and they're gonna conquer in my name praise God hallelujah amen so I think about you know Simon the arrow brother Simon my mom shout out my dad you know cam and me we're chose combating the kingdom of Satan amen that's why you know that's how that's the way the Bible said Peter was a firebrand that means a stick that's plucked out of the fire and it's got a burning tip at the front so Peter would shout out as and he burned and he he was burning with the fire of God amen and he was - an attack I'll say like this I was shot out to strike Akron and come against all the evil in Akron praise God or Copley Ohio you might say - that's what you are - you're one of God's arrows praise God shout out and you're going to be on fire and you're to burn up just whatever is within your little reach praise God praise the Lord see that's what children are but they got to be in the hand of a mighty man but mighty in the scripture hey God doesn't care about our natural muscles it's our spiritual faith amen happy see this is the reason people aren't happy many times because they don't have the children God want them to have right because the Bible said happy as a man that has his quiver full full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies and the gates this woman who wrote this she says she gets she got letters every week of women that were riding her saying saying they suffered from guilt from the devil because they spent all their early years believing Satan's lie that oh you can't afford children and stop having children and then after her years to be bare after years being fruitful past and she's barren then the devil beats her up and say see you should have had more children see you should have had more children see that so Satan makes when you're young Satan makes you think oh you can't afford them and tries that and then when you're older and if you you believe is lies then it'll beat you up because you know the Bible says you should add more but see the Bible said happy is the man that asses quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gates praise God amen the gates were the place of judgment right so the Bible says your children will speak to the enemies in the gate Amen hallelujah see your weapons speak to your enemies praise God right we saw those we watched some animal videos what they do they member those chimpanzees they grind their teeth their that's their weapons right they let their enemies know they got weapons praise God and that's so that's what the devil sees right the devil sees our weapons Amen I'm not by myself I've got children that will pray I've got children that will be soldiers for God I got turned that know the Word of God amen and they're gonna defend me in other words my life is a testimony my integrity is seen the enemy can't deny the sincerity of my family praise God amen and the godliness that's in my family it speaks against the enemies that try to bring criticism on us so if we live a godly life the the holiness of our family will witness for us against our enemies praise God hallelujah so that's the reason people aren't very happy they don't have the children God is calling them to have you know there's other scriptures on that too there's lots of scriptures on that about it makes you happy yeah look at Luke look at Luke 1:14 this is about John the Baptist all this is awesome because he had the spirit of Elijah praise God Luke 1:14 oh how Smith and Zacharias wanted a child remember that how they wanted a child they were barren but they live such a way where the angel could visit Elizabeth and touch her womb praise God praise the Lord they live such a godly life all those years that when other people thought there's no way you can have a child they live so true and God visited her blessed her in her womb and gave her John Luke 1:14 exodus read 13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for that prayer is heard and my wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth I praise God amen happy is the man full of arrows praise God people are gonna rejoice at John's birth praise God see this is what this is what believers do when they see God is sending us another soul they see it as another testimony for God's glory another arrow to fight against Satan's Kingdom amen with joy we're not gonna read it by member Jeremiah 1:5 God told Jeremiah before I formed you I knew you and I ordained you a prophet to Nations amen this one soul was going to bless and actually correct all these nations one soul one baby what significance is in one child I'll tell you once one child can touch him all the nations praise God one child one soul can impact so many nations and so many people that's what God said about Jeremiah hallelujah not just in his physical presence but in his letters his letters whose members letters we're talking about the 70 years Israel would be taken out of Jerusalem and they were sent to all the saints Daniel got a copy of one of them yeah Daniel was study them they said this is about the 70 year period we're about to go back to the homeland praise God every nation was going to be impacted by this man named Jeremiah this little baby named Jeremiah he'll be he'll bring great joy beautiful so Psalms 112 this is a good one tear - just a couple more Psalms 112 one and two oh the value of one soul praise God oh yeah I got what I'll do one more after this Psalms 112 won praise you the Lord blessed as a man that feared the Lord that delight is greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of that upright shall be blessed hallelujah church we gotta love the commands of God right if we just fall in love with Jesus fall in love with his commands fall in love with all his word and the Bible promises that he's gonna bless our generations our children and they're gonna be mighty in the scripture presents I'll be mighty upon the earth praise God think about it Church think about uh my wife and I were talking the other week she's seen numerous of her friends fall into adult that their their marriages have had a Daltry break into them and yet they go to church they go to church but they don't really delight in the Word of God think about that see that they're not I'll say like this I don't mean to we're not exalting anybody or anything like that but they're not strong enough to overcome the temptations of Satan but those who love the commands of God are mighty in the scriptures raise god amen they have more might because the Bible says our weapons are mighty through the pulling down of strongholds praise God that's what it means we're mighty in the scripture we believe God's Word we overcome temptation we live a life of holiness of righteousness we're the children of God and the Bible said he said their seed shall be mighty upon the earth amen hallelujah Amos 2:11 Amos 2:11 Daniel Hosea Joel and Amos Amos 2:11 now here I read you remember I read you the the heat the the hey man scriptures a couple weeks ago how the Bible specifically said in the times of David that hey man was given those children so they could worship in the house of God that was their whole purpose in life was to be worshipers like they men like you children and our sister on the computer everybody finds their part in singing song specials like Jose and Naomi you just find your purpose and God just wants you to be faithful with your purpose he said that's the reason they were born was under David's leadership was to worship God and lead worship in the house of God their whole purpose for being alive amen praise God Amos 2:11 I see here's some other arrows that got another purpose verse 11 Amos 2:11 and I raised up of your sons for what for profits and of your young men for Nazarites is it not even thus oh ye turn of Israel saith the Lord member Amos is rebuking them he had he came at a time when there were awful awful condition he prophesied against the Northern Kingdom so not Judah the northern one they were destroyed first and taken as captives first but he said what what did God say I raised up your sons to be prophets I raised up your son's to be Nazarites amen so see God has a purpose he's sharpening these arrows praise God he's gonna shoot them out to prophesy he's gonna shoot them out to be devoted and dedicated as Nazarites unto God under file from the things of the world praise God that's the reason they were born to be a prophet to be a Nazarite to be a preacher Amen to be a song leader praise God to be a dreamer praise God to be a one who prays and in for divine healing God is a purpose for every one of these arrows praise God amen I'm not going to go there but remember Jesus was one of seven children at least because they list Jesus and they list for yeah the list there was four of his brothers so you have Jesus four of his brothers and then sisters at least two sisters you could add more I remember when Jesus was dedicated why did Mary and Joseph take they took turtledoves to his sacrifice and if you read Leviticus that means they were very poor because if they were rich they're supposed to bring a Bullock so this wasn't some rich family that God sent his son to he sent him to a poor humble and then you know what he kept sending brother Jose he said at least six more at least six more oh well we can't afford it God's with us praise God God is with us amen he's blessing the fruit of your womb praise God amen the Bible said in Nehemiah nine that they lacked nothing the children of Israel when they came over they crossed the desert they came to rebuild the wall they lacked nothing their sons and the daughters lacked nothing in church let me say this even though earnest for forty years Israel walked around those that that didn't believe right I just read that this week they wouldn't go take the promised land God still fed them two million people God still fed that unbelieving generation for two for forty years that's how merciful God is he made sure they had everything they need whether it was quail or whether it was manna God takes care of his arrows amen glory 50/50 split with a man about half the message people make fun of me for my family about half of them love me for it one thing I know God loves me forward raised God let me tell you I'm gonna preaching or winning up a week's here there's more data that more babies have been killed through the pill then through abortion yeah the actual surgery there's more data that proves that because think about you have millions times millions of women in churches taking the pill and what it does it weakens the the uterine wall so a a a gand sperm that that's it's made alive I can't member the exact words it can't attach to the wall that's what those pills and those chemicals do so even a fertilized egg that's life it will get flushed out and die because those pills make the lining of the uterus wall not strong enough there's probably been more abortions done through the pill than even through the actual surgery of abortion and preachers won't preach it I hear though this preacher is gonna preach it praise God because God is the author of life Satan is the one who comes the steal kill and destroy that's right that's right not a lot people don't know that but that's true God takes care of his people praise the Lord thank the Lord now let me get off of that that's important I've been reading on that this is actually the second book I've read on I have another book on it just wanting to read on that by God's grace okay now here now fathers discipline in love let's go back to Ephesians here oh good I got plenty of time here praise the Lord I'm not gonna worry about time by God's grace help me Jesus season six okay so it's these children that God has sent us we're to train them to honor us in love we must use love and not anger verse 4 and ye father's you don't say nothing about the moms now of course moms need to use love but Paul feels led of the Holy Spirit to emphasize this to dads ye father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord see and an Ephesian on regular Ephesian without God would have just treated their children like trash because that's what they were to them they weren't really that great they didn't really think highly of them but Paul says if you got the Holy Ghost he said you fathers do not provoke your children to wrath in other words use the right spirit that word provoke means and rage don't enrage your children so they're enraged against you see that but he said bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord that means the discipline and the admonition of Lord so you've got to correct your children but he said don't make it so it's so harsh that they get angry with you and that's why I was telling this woman not to and I even preach it here but the Bible says a soft answer turns away wrath I've had some children that they get really sad when I discipline them I've had others that get mad how come some of them are real they're okay with it they just get humble other ones like want to fight you back why is that because I just got different personalities I can't control how they're gonna respond but I can reach all I can control how I respond so a soft answer will turn away their wrath Oh daddy don't do that daddy what do you mean daddy you gotta turn well it's your did wrong you should not have done that I told you not to do that I warned you repeatedly you got to use a soft they have to have to feel you're sweet and loving spirit praise God right just like the Bible said in Colossians Colossians the letter that that metate Saffy's a lot but Paul tells those husbands husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them so brothers and grandfathers and brothers in our homes it's so important as leaders that we have a gentle loving spirit because Paul specifically says don't be bitter to your wives and don't enrage your children see because men we got tossed her own and we want to I want to get something done and I don't want to wait and that's how I am you know sometimes it's not proud of it it's a thing I got to overcome but we as leaders by the Holy Spirit we got to be so in love with God and in love with his commands that God can soften our hearts to make us loving because if we enrage our children we've broken God's commands and if we are bitter and upset with our wives something's wrong with us and it's only gonna work its way from the top down our influence is the most brothers our influence is the most important and it's gonna work its way all the way down that's what I have to really make sure our spirit is in the right condition by God's grace now let me just read this on beards real quick I've got three or four emails this past year on beards tell me like I gotta grow a beard because it's now the thing is I can't my DNA won't let me grow it or something like that but I just you know I wrote back a few scriptures here if I can find it oh yeah here it is help me Lord where's oh no I can't find oh your does it yeah okay yeah so this is just this this month I and I've got numerous ones and there's a few churches that say they followed by the RAM and they all their men have beards and it's because it's found in the scripture in the Old Testament it's in Leviticus 19 and Leviticus 20 one talks about men not rounding off their beards so they'll say well if you believe Deuteronomy 22:5 about not cross-dressing what about beards and that's a good question it's honestly good question so what I said I said I don't see any clear references to men being required to have beards of the New Testament and also beards are not called an abomination right like cross-dressing is called an abomination that's a detestable hateful thing and then Revelation says no abomination will come in the kingdom of God so too beers are just a civil law to the men they're not a moral law it's not a moral law it's a civil law okay so that's the way I answered that one I don't see a New Testament author trying to persuade Gentiles to wear a beard and remember in acts 15 they had a council is actually Paul and James and different apostles came together and had a council well these these Gentiles got the Holy Ghost what should we tell them and they gave them those five things remember don't eat blood and don't commit fornication there's a couple others I could never remember all of them but he never mentioned well you got to grow your beards low and if you study the history Church the reason they weren't from there beers was because the heathens did that the heathens had a certain way of worship and they would cut it and round it off and make them look like a certain way to appease their gods to make him look like her gods so to me if you want to wear a beard that's a Christian Liberty but it's I don't see it required in the Word of God but I'll say like this if I grew out my beard and it stumbled somebody I would shave it your beer does not stumble me brother Jose and there are some times I get too busy I don't shave and it kind of looks like I maybe have a beard but I don't I just can't grow one but if if it did and if somebody came as church and said brother Jesse it really stumbles me when you don't shave I'll say okay god help me forgive me you know I'll try to shave every time before I preach I've never had that problem I just want to give you an example of how we Paul will use scripture from Moses and then people think well because he uses you know thou shalt you know parents or children obey your parents then you've got to wear a beard well we got a rightly divide that by God's grace right so I just want to give you a simple example all right so that's one there with beards I don't I can't see how you can prove that in the New Testament now this is an interesting thought I'm not gonna spend much time but go to verse 5 5 to 9 I look at is Paul now you know Roman times were a lot like Jewish times right they could have a slave they could own a slave you imagine that Raymond they owned a man they could own a man or a woman through slavery and Paul realized it Paul realized they could own slaves and so Paul has to specifically write to these brothers and be like you better be careful how you treat your slaves now was Paul saying slavery is okay no but he knew this and just like our founding fathers a lot of people don't like our founding fathers because a lot of them had slaves but listen the time wasn't right for the the time had to be right for the slaves to be set free the Bible said there's a time and season for everything why didn't Paul say slaves break out from your masters and leave and run away why did he say that because it wasn't the time and season everything works in time and season praise God remember when he preached on the pilgrims they they were there for years and years years why didn't they go it wasn't the time they continued to live under the tyranny that can but then the time came where we can't send it anymore we've got to break out same thing here same thing there's a time and season for everything do I agree with savory absolutely not I'm glad we don't got it praise God where's your slaves to the banquet Amen right to pay off our houses or just slaves to the bank to buy that pay off that car I'm a slave to my jet my uh my boss well I like working there though some are not really slave but we feel like we're slaves to the mortgage company right but no of course you know and even though even Abraham Lincoln he's want to set him free but George Washington and John Adams James Madison they all knew slavery was wrong they were trying to get out of it it was so entrenched into their system they were trying to get out of it they didn't know how to get out of it because it wasn't the timing yet and I believe slavery is wrong they're not Heat Paul's not condoning slavery here he's just recognizing we're in a certain system now we're in the Roman system God has allowed this for a time and season this if you're in a slave this is how you should act as a Christian if you're a master this is how you should act as a master does that help by God's grace I don't think slavery is ever right I don't think it's ever right but God had a form of slavery in the Old Testament remember if they became a slave they not this they lose their land but in the Jubilee they get it back hey man praise God God had a way to get him back but God did allow it God did allow it sometimes now verse 5 servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to their flesh with fear and trembling so this is how he taught these servants to serve be real respectful fear and trembling in singleness or sincerity of your heart as in to the Lord so he told these servants you serve your masters like you're serving God then that sound familiar husbands wives love you or submit to your husband's as unto the Lord children obey your parents as in the Lord see it's all the same wherever you are in your position in life you always serve that person as if that person is the Lord that creates humility in you not with eyeservice as men pleasers see you're not trying to impress your your master just so you get the glory but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart so you're not doing this for any other motive I'm not submitting to my boss for any other reason other than I want to please God in my heart I want my boss to look at me and say there's a real good worker he's got to be a Christian now like oh I need to promote him and he needs to be oh yeah maybe he's make more money no that's that no we serve so they can look and say wow there's a real humble servant they must be a believer there is something different about them they do it on it for God's will not for their own not for any fleshly desires or wills verse 7 with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord a man praise God whether he be bond or free so see God even looks at servants and slaves and says if you do good good will come back to you so see church there's always that law of reaping and sowing it's everywhere if you plant good seeds you're gonna read good things praise God because you're doing it for God you're doing it for God's glory praise God not for your glory but for God's glory anything you do you'll receive back good from the Lord verse 9 and he masters do the same things unto them for bearing threatning so you don't threaten them like oh I'm gonna kill you now they could brother they men they can threat and say I'm gonna take your life I'll beat you to death I'll have my other servants beat they could do that but Paul said don't you know don't threaten their lives don't try to motivate them by fear motivate them by love knowing that your master see look he says oh you think you're so big you're a master you got slaves listen you're a slave to the Heavenly Father you got a master over you master right like husbands you got a husband over you right you rulers in the home you got a ruler over you don't forget there's somebody higher than you and he's also in heaven neither is there respect to persons with him so see God doesn't respect the master more than the slave but right but he expects the master to be faithful to God he expects him to lead with the leadership and the love of God praise God so see that I think it's really beautiful they put that in there see the founding fathers and Paul both knew there was a time in season for freedom there was a time in season came under Abraham Lincoln Paul's not condoning slavery Paul's emphasizing this brotherhood between masters and servants and the heavenly law makes all men equal praise God God makes some rich and some poor we don't that I preached that to you before but I could preach it again God makes some of us rich and God makes some of us poor remember God made Mary and Joseph poor he made them poor and he sent his son the greatest behavior of all babies my he sent his holy perfect son into the one of the poorest homes not the richest God made him poor I don't know there must been part of it the testimony maybe test Mary's faith like mother man and preach maybe it's that Mary's faith be done to me according to your word I'm poor Lord but a angel visited me all's I can do is trust in you I'll believe your word be it unto me according to your word I'm not trusting to riches because I don't have any praise God I just got the riches of your promise amen the Bible said the poor of this world rich in faith I think that's how it is the poor we are the more faith we have because we've got to have it that's true all right now I'm trying to try to get here this is kind of where one to go here by the grace of God okay now I'm preaching about an hour right now so let me let me set a timer here just so I'm just I'm aware I might go a little longer we'll see now I preach on this a little bit before let me go back five of these pieces are defensive they'll defend us right and one of them is offensive so we have five things by the Amen that will defend us they'll protect us if we put them on hey if we put these five things on they will protect us when when attacked praise God and only one of them is to be used as a weapon against the enemy now all of these are put on with prayer because verse 18 cent says praying always with all prayer and supplication the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen always all all whereas we constantly pray we make we keep our armor on we keep ourselves protected we keep our defense up praise God as we pray all throughout the day amen that's how we keep these these defense mechanisms on now three time Paul says just stand soldier just stand he says it in verse 11 13 and 14 I'm gonna read that put you on the whole armour of God that you may beware this tricks are coming stand against them verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may able to withstand in the in the evil day and having done all to stand there's something about standing amen something about standing up and what you show your real size when you stand up all right you ever seen somebody sitting down and they look kind of small but when they stand up well he's pretty big he's a pretty big guy there can you see they're ready that you see their real size and you see what they can do and they're ready to move right so standing three times is we must stand against the enemy three times we're not retreating we're not sitting down we're not we're not laying down or we're sleeping right the Bible says awake from your sleep right you wise virgins oh wait praise God be awake it's the daytime for us praise God and we do not retreat because we're standing ready to fight stand means to make firm establish to cause a person to keep us place you keep your place let's not lose what God has given to us you know I see that many times don't you with Christians they lose their testimony they'll lose their health and get sick because of their own choices right they'll lose I've seen this as I told you last week I've seen people lose their position in the church whether it's a deacon or a pastor a preacher or teacher they'll lose their predicts their position because they compromised on God's Word right that's what it means when you stand you keep your position praise God amen but if you don't stand you'll lose what God has given to you a lot of people lose their testimony oh they usual thing that person such a dedicated Saint Maya they love the Lord and then they make some evil decisions what happened they took off the armor they laid the armor down they took off the armor and they're not standing anymore they lost their place they lost their position I don't want that to be my testimony I want to stand in my position praise God I want to hold my place where God's called me to a place let me hold it praise God if God's giving me land let me possess the land praise God amen three times he said hold the land hold your place hold your position don't lose it stand there as a real soldier of Christ hey man I'll say like this I'll stand from one thus saith the Lord to the next like the last time I wonder if I should be a pastor I said God you sent me someone that my ministry saves in the message and God said amen and hooah I'm standing on that praise God I was going to go off and be an evangelist but I said Lord if you give me this I'll stand there praise God amen and I've stood there praise the Lord because I only want to do what God wants me to do and if God would think it's so great to come out of heaven and answer my little prayer then let me be faithful with my end amen in other words let me keep my word because I know he's going to keep his word praise God Stanzi find your position you're your escape from safety keep your authority that God has given you as a Christian hallelujah thank the Lord you know let me just real quick this week I put out that not every word brother Ram said is done said Lord it's my number one video out of the last two years it's really skyrocket in some ninth phrase to the hard but you know what a man from Romania found it and you said brother Jesse he said I'm from Romania he said we're the only message Church in our city that doesn't believe every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord he said this video was such a blessing he said can I have all those quotes so I'm going to share him with our little small church he said I just want to encourage you well Jesse keep making those videos he said God visits with us he said God is doing signs wonders and miracles in our little home Church in Romania so the God had to send our from our little tiny church God had to send the truth over the Internet through the satellite to this little tiny church in Romania and it's the only church that's holding forth the real truth of God brother Rams not God he's a prophet he's a man he makes mistakes and see I love how God's use in one small church to go across the globe to help out another small carriage amen keeping our position praise God amen standing up for the truth keeping the Word of God pure refreshing amen to the saints of God that really encouraged me this week what is it taking on the full armor of God praise the Lord authority now here's the picture this is a beautiful picture this is from that video I get some of my historical truths from but the Bible says we put on the full armor of God this is how Paul ends the letter and you know I never realized this but you know where he got you know where Paul got the armor of God he got it from Isaiah I didn't realize this and Isaiah was writing about a certain soldier so let's read about it he's right about a special soldier who's got a Isaiah 11 verse 1 I never knew this I thought well praise the Lord what a blessing why would he write about a soldier Isaiah 11:1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots a man this is 900 years before Christ would come from the seed of David amen who's he writing about he's writing about Christ and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him and the spirit of wisdom and understanding in the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judged the poor reap you've that reprove with equity for the meek of the earth he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reigns amen so about righteousness and girdles he's talking about smiting things he he's talking about a mighty warrior by the name of Jesus Christ amen praise God we're to Paul get this imagery from no doubt he saw Roman soldiers but then the Holy Spirit said oh that's just a copy that's a that's a copy off the real soldier the Messiah Jesus Christ praise God Jesus had on the righteousness the girdle of his loins the belt of truth hey yeah and he smite him with the words that coming out of his mouth that reminds us of Revelation 19 now we're not going to read Isaiah 49 but that's Isaiah said the words gonna come out of my mouth like a sword so just so you know that's where that comes from Isaiah said my word is like a sword now here's the Messiah go to Psalm or Isaiah 59 what a blessing praise God what a bless and where does Paul get this from the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit already foretold this is how Christ is so Christ is the great mighty Conqueror and he's saying we can be conquers as well with the same weapons ain't man now I've never weapon the same weapons at Christ's head Isaiah 59 now verse 17 declares its the Messiah no it's the helmet of salvation yeah verse 17 for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak remember the vows of the zeal of the Lord have eaten him up praise God they saw Jesus as zeal cleaning out the church right yet not the money changers and all the greedy covetous thieves and there he whipped them out so his character his anointing upon him was like armor for a soldier now verse 20 says its Messiah and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and under them that turn from righteousness I'm sorry that turn from transgression and Jacob saith the Lord praise God and as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee in my words which I putting in thy mouth show not the part of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed now the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever praise God so I'm teaching Lydia and Malachi to quote God's Word so that if God terry's and they have children you have to teach your children to quote God's Word praise God your seed and your seed seed praise God that's your purpose in life is to teach your children to fight the enemy with God's Word to be dressed up with the armor of God amen how does it go on by prayer praise God goes on by prayer so where does he get where does Paul get this idea of a soldier he gets it from prophecies of the Messiah his first and second coming amen praise God praise God first and second coming where am I at ok I better stop right there because I got a little more I like to go with the Ephesians series I want to go through each of the pieces of armor slowly one more time okay so let's stand to our feet you're musicians if you'll come let's stop right there praise God where does he get it who is the real soldier we're looking to we're looking Jesus Christ Paul didn't just make this up he saw Isaiah writing about it he saw Isaiah prophesy about it he said that's how every Christian should be praise God praise the Lord Amen let's just bow our heads for a moment and think of that picture of the soldier the helmet of salvation the breastplate of righteousness the bell of truth the feet with the preparation of the gospel and the shield of faith all protecting us and they all go on through prayer can we pray today church they will be armed and defended will be defended with God's defence how many want that in their lives and then you'll use that sword you'll use that offensive weapon when you know it's time not when you want to but when you know it's God's time [Music] let's have a word of Prayer here let's ask God to give us all these pieces to strengthen us that we can overcome spirituai many want to stand in your position today I don't want to give up what God has given to me praise God God has given me a position in this church in my family and where I worked and I don't want to give it up I want to stand there keep my position as a soldier for Christ and I want to do it as unto the Lord and not Adam and I want to do it for God's glory that people look at say that's a real Christian let's pray together ask God to bless us you how many father we love you today Lord God we're standing today on your promises dear God thank you Lord Jesus thank your Lord we've seen your prophet right - the children the father's this masters the servants and he closes by speaking to all of us Lord why stand with authority in your position keep your position do not let say and move you off of your position in your testimony Alleluia Jesus hallelujah praise be to God so father we pray in Jesus Christ's name through prayer Lord that will have on the armor of God Lord let the Saints have on the belt of truth but their minds will be focused on the truth
