christ's name the church said amen amen praise god let's take your bibles here let's go to uh ii peter one lord willing we're going to finish the mystery of golly this restored demand tonight lord willing i tried to i just thought you know well let's try to finish this and then i still got the mystery of god's will i got the mystery of iniquity to preach to you mystery of the godhead i have never preached that i've just got tons to preach we just have to let the holy spirit guide us here because we got plenty to preach just not enough time i guess but god is good i love this message that's one thing i love this word is right church it's thus saith the lord it's right amen so we got confidence in that i got one thing i want to share about the coronavirus in just a moment but let's uh let's uh take our scriptures here we'll go to that second peter one and if you're listening brother stephen go ahead and text me your memory verse if not i'll try to remind you later i know you think he works second but i know brother banks sometimes can listen and live stream i don't know if they can do it anymore but they did it for a while second peter one let's just read verse eight because i just want to look at just some general thoughts about godliness tonight by god's grace let's read verse 8 on three one two three for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ may god add his blessings to the ring of his word may be seated praise god amen um just about the coronavirus i just had two thoughts i just want to share with you real quick um i checked the wet the john hopkins university website so far 619 000 global deaths that's awful every death is awful but that pales in comparison to other plagues and other pestilences so now that's the ones that's recorded and then i saw a church a few weeks ago the governor of illinois had some of his government workers come up and they admitted on live tv that they were grouping a lot of deaths into the cova desk that should not have been went in there so just know there's just some corruption you know that that you know you and i know uh the sinners are trying to use this to take away people's rights we know that to cause fear because satan loves fear it's to steal kill and destroy but god's word gives us faith amen in the midst of pandemics we don't fear because god is with us amen and if we do get sick well our god is our healer amen god can overcome cancer god can heal from any plague or pestilence so i just want to update you on that 619 thousand that's about the number of abortions done every year and that awful it's it's just awful um it's it's half of how many people die in a car accident every year in the united states 1 million 200 000 die from car accidents it's more dangerous to get in your car than anything else i think in america so just keeping that in i just want to keep that in perspective the other thing is i was watching a video this week a preaching video and the brother i don't remember who it was and he talked about the generations and i thought he was talking about coronavirus and the generation i thought who is being impacted the most by the coronavirus it's the people that are 65 and older and i thought let's go back 65 years what's 2020 minus 65. what happened in 1956 brother branham said thus saith the lord america will either repent and serve christ or fall away thus saith the lord in 1956. that was the year brother i don't know if he knows about amen elvis got hugely popular in 1956 because it was 50 years after the holy ghost fell out in california in 1906 as azusa street so brother ram said thus say the lord this is the jubilee 1956 was the jubilee and they turned it down the church it could be i'm not saying it is but it sure looks like a judgment upon the generation that turned down the lord jesus christ and also i went back and listened to what i preached on coronavirus also in numbers i don't remember the chapter now but also david david and the book of numbers there's two times when god when the people were numbered israel was numbered twice the first time they weren't plagued because god made them pay a shekel of silver and so they weren't plagued the second time david was deceived by satan remember that and i think 72 000 died because david numbered the people and satan tricked him and i just saw that saw that pattern whenever men try to number and build up their numbers god sends a plague remember i told you i hate to say like this but the white house before this pandemic hit we're building up their numbers we're so great we have all this remember that and who has taken the credit i think the president was taking the credit i pray for that man more than i prayed for any president i don't think he's saved but i'm going to keep praying for him anyways the point i was making every time god's people exalted numbers god sent a plague so i just saw two things i thought were very striking numbers again and then also 65 years ago america had her last chance and she turned it down so i don't know i just thought it was interesting i thought i'd share that with you just something to keep in mind by the grace of the lord because to me church it looked like and it isn't interesting brother branham said judas was a modern-day judas iscariot isn't that interesting they chose judas over christ and then brother random in 1963 indicted the generation in the name of the lord jesus christ for crucifying christ again so they chose their judas and then they're indicted by a prophet of god for crucifying the lord thank god that we don't crucify him thank god we crucify our wills amen i'll say like this i'm crucified with christ praise god i no longer live but christ lives in me amen amen that's our testimony let me set my timer here i almost forgot praise the lord all right that's the wrong one how do we do that i don't know what happens okay so let's lord willing finish here i thought that would be a blessing to you i just thought that would that really helped me i thought my no wonder no wonder this virus strikes at this time and just recall you know it looks like it's just it's a it's to me it's like a foreshadowing it's a pestilence right it's a birth pain and the and the world is there they're getting ready to do the one world order it may happen in our life time it may happen the next lifetime next one but you can see how they're using this as a worldwide ability to take away people's rights and to force people to take the mark of the beast but thank god we're already marked by jesus christ amen i marked to the day of my redemption i got nothing to worry about you're born again you got you don't gotta worry about that mark i'm already marked amen amen it's a one-time thing praise god and i'm already marked by the spirit of jesus christ by god's grace i believe that with all my heart by god's grace so let's look to the word here tonight now if you've got your bibles go to deuteronomy 8 verses 2 and 3 i'll have some of the readers my ready readers i'll just call them like that i just want to bring out this thought brother branham says in the church age book you can know where you stand with god at any time in other words you can know your spiritual location any time with god so on the statueman if you're not born again or if you just got saved i love how my girls asked me about it a few months ago they said daddy do you think i got patience daddy do you think i got virtue i thought that was great i love that um you can look and see where you stand with god and if you're born again you can see what fruits are lacking in my life in other words where is god going to prove me yeah if you're born again there's probably pruning that you need amen right brother ram says you're either going into a trial or just coming out of one getting ready to go into another one so if you're born again that means you're you just come out of a pruning time you're probably gonna get pruned again remember there's nine fruits of the holy spirit right yeah so nine of those areas god's constantly dealing with us on helping us to grow now i want to bring this scripture up because israel when for their exodus they left egypt and then they had to cross i think three uh wildernesses i think there was three different wildernesses in the sinai palencino peninsula right so from egypt to israel was the sinai peninsula it's like a like a triangle land right and it's connected by a strip of land you had the wilderness of sure the wilderness of sinai and the wilderness of paran so you had this great wilderness area between egypt and their promised land praise god amen and god told them why he took them through the wilderness and he humbled thee i'm sorry can you go to verse 200 i'm sorry case you're my fault and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years of orders to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou knowest i'm sorry whether thou what is keep his commandments or no look at that i just called that he said remember all the way all these 40 years now for us it's remember all the steps of a statue of perfect man because peter said that in verse uh i'm don't you have to read it but peter said i will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance amen amen glory so peter said always remember where god has brought you the statue of a perfect man amen glory and then god told moses tell them to always remember their path from egypt to the promised land amen ah that's beautiful glory these things get more and more proven all the time so it was a three-stage process justification going through the red sea of the water baptism sanctification was the wilderness uh the statue of man there and then the promised land was the baptism of the holy ghost praise god and church they could know at all times where they were they just had to look they said look they just had to open their eyes and church inside this we just got to get our eyes off the world get our eyes on the bible and we can tell right where we are with god amen praise god you know i'm just trying to think about my life which fruit he was working on but i have to look at the fruit list again real quick see which i've been uh which fruits i've been dealing with lately i have to look at it i don't have it in front of me so see church you can always know we can always know just as israel could always know god gave us the path from justification from egypt all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost praise god now i'm sorry verse three i'm sorry deuteronomy 8 3. i forgot to read that one and he humbled me so see what does sanctification do to humble you now church it's not easy wednesday and sunday after sunday i've got to preach sermons about being sanctified right humbling and dying out you probably get tired of it right just like they got tired of the wilderness but it's why what has it done is to humble us is to show us that we can't do it on our own we need god amen we need god's strength we need god's uh knowledge god's virtue god's readily kindness we've got to humble ourselves we can't do it on our own the denominations are trying to get there by works but we know it can't be our works it can't be our strength it's got to be god's strength and so it's a matter of humility and so a sermon after a sermon i've just got to keep preaching so we'll humble ourselves and learn to die out so that christ can be magnified so we finally give christ the preeminence amen amen that's what the purpose of it is and that same thing in my life too i've got a daily exam in my life and make sure i'm humbling myself not exalting myself that's only way god can work with me to humble us right humble suffer thee to hunger see sometimes we've got to get really really hungry bendy with manna which thou knowest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the lord thus man live amen what did this message come to do to help to point us to the word the word we're supposed to eat and then speak amen we're to eat that word in the morning and speak it throughout the day praise god that's that's exactly what the wilderness was those three wildernesses uh paran and and sinai and and shusha was that probably saying that wrong i don't know that one memorized there sure sorry not even close it was to humble them and to keep them on the word live by the word live by the word live by the word and you'll possess the promised land hallelujah so see it's a great uh understanding it's a great type from egypt uh all the way to the promised land now remember church few there be how many know the few there be that find the way to the promised land remember church out of that original two million two made it over two one in a million praise god that's about what we got in the message right yeah all these millions of message believers i say one out of a million maybe more than that i don't know we'll see but sea church is a very small group how do you know because they don't show those attributes that the bible says we should have praise god like just today i was looking at the preach one of these preachers i left the message i went on his facebook page i'm not his friend him i just every now and then like this i want to see if he had a full-time preaching position yet i couldn't find it but he's on there with shorts just on his birthday he's got shorts on his wife's got uh pants on cut her hair and they're in their 60s got big old earrings on oh oh my goodness it just looked awful it just looked awful to see the people that used to honor uh was almost a pastor 40 years in the message uh they used to honor god and then it just shows they never made it up or if they made it up they forsook it and they never took the promised land few church people can serve god 40 years and still not go in the promised land my there it is right there just like they did 40 years in the winter so they never entered in but there was two that had a different spirit on them and they can make it through praise god let that be us that we've got the holy spirit on us amen not the spirit of egypt but the holy spirit that will give us courage to take the promised land amen ah there's not a five of my being that wants to put a a tattoo on my body or a nose ring or something like that there's not a fiber in my being that would want to strip myself and present myself to the public i want to promote christ amen amen i want the world to see christ through my life not the world but see they still got that desire see because they never really left egypt or i said egypt never left them i'll say like that they might have walked out but egypt stayed in their hearts they never really died up to self they never really crucified self remember jude 1 5 put up jude 1 5 up there if you got it sweetie i will therefore put you in remembrance though he once knew this i'm sorry though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not he brought them out by grace but when they turned down grace god had to destroy them because they asked for it right they complained ten times about all the miracles why we god help us never to complain amen about a miracle let me say this god help us not to complain about the jobs he's given us praise god god help us not to complain about the government because they protect us god uses them god help us not to complain about the doctors all these blessings that god give us let us not be complainers but let us give thanks everything give thanks this is the will of god in christ jesus complaining about things god help us not to complain amen god help us to give praise to his great name see we don't have to wander around the wilderness church we've got to wander around in the sanctification we can possess the promised land amen if you're stranded if you're in a rut if you're wandering around from church to church or most people not here tonight thank god that's part of the book here i said get down to business with god look at your true character now pull up psalms 1 19 58 that's a big number there psalms 1 19 58 pull this up this church this is all we have to do and you know it i know it every service all we have to do is look at the word of god and turn our eyes to the word of god and obey the word of god and everything will start turning out all right oh it's so simple the ways of god are so simple i entreated thy favor with my whole heart see we've got to come to church with our whole heart be merciful unto me according to that word next verse i here it is brother man preached as i thought of my ways i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimony see why wander around from just one thing to the next get your eyes on the lord we just got to get our eyes on the lord and think on god's ways and walk in god's ways and god will give us the victory praise god next verse one more yeah 60. i made hay see quickly obey it brother man says today the bible says today is the day of salvation be quick to repent be quick to turn your mind and your feet to god's testimonies and it won't be long you'll possess the promised land praise god it wasn't long after they got all those unbelievers out there right was it what wasn't wrong they got them circumcised they crossed over because they turn their feet under god's testimonies see it's a beautiful type church of israel taking the prophet saying you know i know it but i just thought i'd bring out those scriptures does that help all right got a few amen thank the lord i thought i thought they'd help you out by god's grace now i'm going to review this briefly jesus 12 disciples you can see how they work their way up the statute for man then they fall away like i said i'm just going to try to finish this i got some other good examples in here and church they are like measuring sticks for our lives right 12 you can look at the 12 disciples you can look at paul paul is a great measuring stick you can look at peter and we have so many details about these brothers lives david is a good example too he got the anointing oil poured on the spirit of god was on him from that day forth you can look at all these great examples in the scripture but let's look at the disciples briefly now they had faith when they believed on jesus and they forsook their family and careers to follow christ they had faith they chose the right way right they had to leave the fishing nets they'd leave the tax collection booth and leave that behind by faith they chose christ now next they got virtue because we preached on this recently do you know that they went into their own cities two by two and publicly preached and healed before jesus visited their cities and naomi think about your hometown i'll think about my hometown my wife and i can think about the same hometown which one of us would want to go in there now hopefully i believe we would right we want to go in our hometowns and preach christ amen and say does anybody need prayer anybody need healing sisters don't preach we know that but see that's the kind of virtue that they had they had virtue to go to their hometown amongst their high school friends and their own their own neighbors and everything and preach the lord jesus christ praise god now but remember they lost all their virtue the night of the rest because they all scattered so see how you can build your way up and then you can that anointing can leave you right you're going to be so anointed and fall away in your mind all right can we see that because the bible says jesus pray that their faith fail not hallelujah jesus prays that their faith now their virtue might have failed but their faith didn't fail praise god see see that's true you can run away we've all had times we've run away from from obstacles right instead of facing it we run away but our faith doesn't fail us praise god we never leave the faith now knowledge while most jews misunderstood jesus's parables and teachings the disciples assured jesus they understood them in matthew 13 51 can you pull that up there acacia jesus asked him do you understand these things they're like yeah i got we got knowledge we got knowledge matthew 13 51 i think it's a nice scripture just to show how they they believed jesus and them have you understood all these things see now just understanding and they said unto him yay lord glory see they understood now they understood those things but they didn't understand other things right jesus said they didn't understand how men are defiled they thought man's defiled from the outside in but jesus said you're defiled from the inside out where do where do adulteries and murders where do they come from jesus said they come from the the heart that's right they didn't understand about the leaven of the doctrine the pharisees and sadducees they didn't understand jesus resurrection for sure none of us would have so see there was times they had a knowledge and then it decreased now temperance now this is interesting if anybody can find any examples of disciples with struggling with physical temperaments i couldn't um but they did become a indignant against james and john when their mother asked jesus if their two sons could sit on their right and left hand but they sure lost their self-control there didn't they they got piping hot oh what do you mean you two sit by jesus what about us what about us 10 other preachers and they really lost their their self-control there right patience now look they patiently stay with jesus after many disciples forsook him because they knew like peter said we know you've got the words to eternal life so they had patience at that point but they then they hastily asked jesus to send away the woman of canaan who repeatedly cried for jesus to heal her vex daughter but jesus uh met her request miraculously see there's times had patience there's times they struggle with it all right next one see godliness uh jesus extinguished james and john's ungodly desire to call fire down from heaven upon the christ rejecting samaritans that's not very good godliness is it and then peter violently cut off malcus's ear trying to defend jesus proving that he didn't have love for his enemies so see you can look at their lives church now which one of you have ever taken out a gun to shoot anybody or which one of you have gotten a fist fight right what's the equivalent of cutting off somebody's ear see see how they lack the anointing of the holy spirit against their enemies well see we need godliness how many godliness today amen see broadly kindness now multiple times they lack this they argued about who is the greatest they forbade a brother from casting out devils because he didn't follow the twelve not very kind to his brothers right shut down your ministry brother jesus said let him alone if he's not against me he's for me they forbade christian sisters from bringing their infants and toddlers to jesus can you imagine shut down the sisters uh brother jesse can you dedicate my baby no no i don't have time for that imagine the lacking of broadly kindness on that peter struggled with jesus requirement to forgive his brother 70 times more than he first estimated they struggle with broadly kindness now charity after the resurrection jesus breathed on them and urged them to receive charity he used 40 days right of staying with the disciples to raise their faith so the next 10 days they'd have enough strength to pray for 10 days praise god what would it take people to pray for 10 days jesus christ doing supernatural miracles amen for 40 days right that's beautiful he gave them many infallible proofs of his resurrection and then said pray for 10 days and they did and finally they got one accord and then love and charity fell into their souls and jesus paul said the love of god is shed abroad in your hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us oh what encouragement church if we want to be united we've got to pray amen amen if we want unity in one accord let's pray for one another praise god let's forget our differences and let's be united in christ amen glory that's our prayer right god do do miracles do so many infattable americans and church that's what happens when people get born again amen like you heard on sunday god will give you two miracles right miracle after miracle lead you to the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen to get everybody in one accord praise god amen it gives us many infallible prayers amen to show us that this word is right these people are god's people they are the children of god amen spend your lives with god's children praise god see as you can see it's tight through israel three stages it's typed through the disciples you can clearly see he breathed on some you need to get the holy ghost cutting off people's ears and arguing about who's the greatest preacher you really need the holy ghost and so they did praise god amen i'm glad he sends it to us too we need it amen now the next one i'm not going to take a lot of time on this because i got uh well i got 20 minutes maybe joseph of the old testament you can see his life goes through the stature of a perfect man all right now you all know the types of christ uh christ and joseph was a definite type of christ i'm sorry joseph was the type of christ christ was the anti-type now let's look at the seven steps i just have to trust me here i'm not going to read all of them by god's grace but just trust me i studied these i went and searched these out last year joseph had faith when he trusted god's way for his life and he unashamedly shared his dreams with his family in genesis 37. see he just the first thing we have of joseph he has a dream and he trusts it he had faith right can you imagine you imagine as a young person you had a dream your parents are going to bow down to you all your older brothers are going to serve you and you got enough faith to go up and tell them about it sorry goodness that's faith he chose the right way he wasn't scared to share that dream because he knew it was from god he had faith then he had virtue or moral strength in slavery so i'm skipping ahead to when he got thrown in the dungeon in the prison he had virtue and to still live for god and he daily prospered in his work and then also i'm sorry slavery in potiphar's house not the not the jail i'm sorry potter first house he had virtue in other words everybody in potiphar's house knew he was a man of god because of the way he handled it he didn't compromise just because his brother oh dad's not around oh i can make i can do a deal here i can slip a few thousand dollars here i'll steal some money from potiphar no he was a man of virtue everybody in the house knew he was a man of god next he had knowledge or understanding and this understanding helped promote him to overseer of potiphar's possessions in his house and field that this this falls perfectly in line that's chapter 39 verses 4 to 6. so see he has faith to believe the dream and then he's got virtue his daily work prospers and then he's promoted because of his knowledge oh my and then he has temperance because potiphar's wife begged him to sleep with him or her rather and he had temperance to turn her down praise god amen because he feared almighty god more than he feared anything else he had tempers that was 39 verses 7 to 20. i mean it's perfect church is beautiful it just goes right in line i remember the holy spirit opened that up to me i said praise the lord i said now i can preach this amen patience he had patience or contentment as he waited in prison for two years even though they forgot about him he never threw up his hand and said i quit i give up this message nonsense i he didn't quit church he had patience to wait on god amen the same god that gave me the dream the same god that gave me favor and by this house the same god that has done all these things that's kept me alive these two years the same god that gave me an interpretation of the dream will be the same god that'll bring it to pass oh it's a good thing he was patient don't you agree church it's a good thing he had patience two years in prison sometimes you gotta wait through two years of prison at our job right right oh this situation's awful i feel like i'm a slave well welcome to joseph's world right we just sometimes we have to go through that right awful times long extended seas when is this season going to end it may be a long time but as long as you've got god's patience you'll come through now where'd he get godliness he had godliness he was so much like god that pharaoh knew god's spirit was in joseph and then gave him the interpretation of pharaoh's dream remember pharaoh said that the spirit of god is in this man he had godliness amen oh it's beautiful in church he had broadly kindness because he forgave his brothers amen hallelujah he revealed he said no don't be afraid he said i'm joseph and god sent me here don't be afraid i forgive you praise god amen lie it's absolutely perfect for the amen this type in shadow is perfect amen he's got temperance and brotherly kindness all these things and last but not least when is the when does joseph and the holy spirit meet when he embraced his father jacob when he his father came to abide with him in egypt and the bible said they met and wept and cried they boo-hooed they boo-hooed all over one another the son and the father that's like the holy ghost on you church the holy ghost on you is like the father on his daughter or the father on his son praise god amen that's inspired hallelujah thank you jesus and it's all perfectly chronological it's just one after another oh my joseph life his life was capped off when the father came to permanently dwell with him oh my i didn't know you praise god amen church that's me that's revelation that's like that one that's like that gideon revelation my sister is talking about or that hosea one remember that one oh my god's word keeps unfolding it keeps becoming unveiled to us so we can't deny it we never would want to deny it praise god it's god's revelation for us it's our spiritual food and due season amen if i keep clapping i'm gonna have bleeding pretty soon here praise god keep clapping like that thank the lord god is good church god is good all right i got uh 13 minutes so yeah let me yeah okay now the significance of number eight i'm just gonna blow through these because i got about 13 minutes i want to be cautious of the time i've been trying to do that even before you got the job so don't everybody say well brother jesse's just doing this for amen remember i was trying to do this for a long time i've been trying to shorten my my sermons church i believe you can get out if peter preached five minutes in the holy ghost film cornish's house i don't have to preach an hour and a half it's it's when the people are ready now if you're really hungry and you pull for an hour and a half i'll preach an hour and a half sometimes i just sometimes i fee i fill up so much i've got i just got to get it all out but i'm just making the point if people are hungry and people are pulling we can hear from god i believe we already have amen now the significance of number eight eight is a new beginning remember the numerology series see this i mean this book and everything it's just all fallen in god's line i mean i could not have done all this this book writing without all the previous sermons everything i've learned preaching the book of revelation 125 sermons it's all preparing me for this i could not have done it without it see because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord amen that's right so see it's a is a new beginning there's eight steps right there's seven and then eight charity is a new beginning right joseph's dad was a new beginning the family's reunited amen see paul says any man who's in christ is a new creator amen all things have passed away behold all things are become new a holy ghost christian field christian is a new creature he's living a life of divine power so let's look at the numbers the hebrew boys were circumcised on the eighth day that means they're newly in the covenant praise god now without that remember abraham's abraham's covenant without that they were they were kicked out they could not have any fellowship forgiveness it was a new beginning uh when when aaron's priesthood officially began the holy ghost and fire fell on the eighth day see the uh in other words that priesthood the preachers had to wait till the fire fell on the eighth day and a preacher's got to meet the pillar of fire amen before he preaches the gospel ours didn't catch up to it right now praise god amen the priesthood has to have the firefly amen they must be born again in order to minister to god's people former lepers were experienced a new beginning and they were declared clean at the door of the congregation on the eighth day so when he really cleaned when the holy ghost falls praise god when charity seals you away now you're really clean before god see now you're sealed to the day of your redemption hallelujah see because you're all sanctified you're all cleaned out i appreciate everybody's attention praise the lord the eighth and final day of the feast of trumpets was a sabbath day a rest day rest rest on the eighth day rest uh israel and all the israelis return to their permanent homes oh it was the day they returned to their permanent homes it was a day of rest after spending seven days in booth so seven days in temporary boost and the eighth day permanent home praise god permanent rest [Applause] so you can wander around and boost a lot of message people wander around and boot to boot the booth but they gotta get to the eighth day praise god they gotta get to the permanent rest in christ jesus and people won't worry about them anymore they won't wonder well i wonder why they wandered around why they back and forth on these topics they're back and forth because they've got to get to the eighth day i i didn't have that that was fresh to me too i didn't i didn't have that like under the spiritual understanding of that until now that's why it's good to preach it praise god remember that was that was a reminder that they left exit or i'm sorry egypt in the exodus that was a reminder now they've got permanent homes glory god brought us out of the world the future millennial temple in jerusalem will be purged and purified seven days until god begins accepting israel and her offerings on the eighth day new beginning in the millennium praise god beautiful eighth day anais or aeneas a para paralyzed man from lyda was healed and given a new beginning through peter's ministry after suffering eight years he got a new beginning after the eighth year praise god and then lastly after the flood god used eight souls to begin repopulating the earth at her new beginning eight so you can see eight is a new beginning all right now at the end of the chapter i go through the rewards and consequences of rejecting this revelation so the rewards are was it was our text tonight if you if you receive this reward your life will abound in the fruit and then the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen if you receive this revelation you'll see constantly fruit from your life amen amen you'll see in other words you'll see proof definite proof that you have the fruits of the holy spirit amen they'll be ripe in your life praise god amen also if you do these things you shall never fall amen another revelation is you'll never fall back into a worldly sinful life do what peter said do faith do virtue do knowledge do tempers do all these things and you'll never fall next you'll possess christ-like character and that's the only thing you're taking in the next life like brother brown says your character is your only thing you're taking with you paul says for we brought nothing in this world and it's certain we are carrying nothing out only you're not going to carry out what you're just going to be you're just gonna be the possession that comes you're gonna be the substance that comes out praise god not carrying it but you are it praise god your character produced good works will meet you at the judgment that's another another reward your uh your uh rewards will meet you at the judgment the bible says some men's sins will meet them uh at the judgment but see our sins won't meet us there but the fruits of our works will meet us there if we're constantly producing the fruit of the holy spirit okay so i just kind of really shorten that real real short now what are the consequences the first one is uh it'll lead to a life of ungodliness if you reject the revelation of god restoring godliness to man you're going to be ungodly and so the entrance into the kingdom of christ will not be granted to the ungodly now of course you can still be saved you know even if you reject the revelation because faith alone is required for salvation faith alone right you're saved by grace through faith you're justified by the blood justified by faith we looked at that on sunday another consequence is barrenness right you're not bringing forth any new any new fruit right no fruit no new believers you're not witnessing you're not saving souls these are all consequences of rejecting godliness in other words someone is inactive in the vineyard of god oh we don't want to be sa church we don't want to sit on the sidelines we want to be working the vineyard i'm going to be doing something for jesus when the savior calls i want to answer him but i want to answer him out in the vineyard praise god doing something for jesus working for his name amen i'll be somewhere working when he calls me see so someone without this revelation wastes their time they just waste all their time but see if we've got it we're fruitful they're barren we're fruitful we're active they're inactive not church you know that talk to any talk to any denominational person ask them what they've been hearing lately at church i mean they're not they're going to be talking about drinking beers right like brother amen saw they went to minnesota they went to their old church they're down in the basement drinking beers uh was that saturday night before service saturday before service drinking beers and then you want to go to church on sunday well i'll tell you i'll say well i'll say like this we have wine in our church natural wine but the best wine is spiritual that's the church that's the one we our church amen we got it here praise god amen that's what we got by god see it takes away all of our fears it takes me all of our inhibitions amen and we can just serve the lord and be happy and joyful and worship god amen and the reality of god's power and his resurrection thank god if it wasn't for god's grace we've been doing the same thing but amen we've been doing the same thing right it wasn't for god's grace but thank god for his grace amen see peter says without this you're blind you cannot see it far off you can't see the rapture thank god we can see the rapture coming we can see the persecution coming thank god we can see it far off they forgot and they were purged see this is one thing church a real holy ghost-filled saint is going to remember i'm forgiven i am under the blood of jesus christ see because they stay near the cross amen they said jesus keep me near the cross they're a precious fountain amen remember revelation 7 the bride from every nation comes out and they say john who is it johnson i don't know and the angel says these are those who wash their garments white in the blood of jesus amen they stayed at the blood of jesus washing and washing and coming out of persecution and tribulation and struggle and temptation and they stayed there washing them praise god they didn't forget they were forgiven they knew they were forgiven amen glory i want to know i'm forgiven amen by washing in other words confessing my sins right service after service right week and year after year confessing our sins stay near to the cross amen the blood of jesus they don't they lack that they don't confess their sins constantly they they actually grow in sins it's called iniquity that's a whole nother mystery we'll get to that saints they they're spiritually blind and they're hardened to truth they refuse repentance and the healing benefits of the holy spirit now church we're not careful too we'll get roots of bitterness as well when we can't forgive people like we want to be forgiven we want jesus to forgive us right away right right but then we won't forgive people that shouldn't be if we're growing in the stats perfect man we should freely forgive right forgive us our debts lord each day as we forgive those who sin against us or who indebted to us let's not be blind let's set our affection on things above let's look under jesus the author and i like this the finisher of our faith we've all started but christ is going to finish our faith amen he's going to finish it with divine love hallelujah staying in the love of jesus christ they forget they were forgiven from their old sins see a confused mind doesn't know if the soul is saved because they constantly indulge in fleshly lust and they make them feel they make the flesh feel like the flesh is winning the war see when people are habitually caught in sin and they don't repent they the bible says that the fleshly lust war against the soul so that these people that don't grow up on the statue of man they constantly war am i saved or not am i right with god or not am i am i a child of god or not it's because they satisfy the flesh more they satisfy the holy spirit god help us to always remember that we're forgiven of our sins the only way to do that is to stay at the state of the fountain filled with blood stay there oh perfect one more minute praise god sometimes i go a little bit over here so what is what's up uh what's what's paul's suggestion about your salvation he said work out your salvation with fear and trembling nothing is more important than being assured of your salvation and of your spiritual location in christ nothing is more important than that and church let me share this a few years ago i had a minister's meeting with some ministers a small one but they asked me where i was and i told him i said i believe i am adopted i believe i'm born again and i'm adopted and they said how do you know i said because uh brother graham said when you're but when you're adopted your word is like the father's word in other words you speak god's word and god's speaking and not you and so at that moment i think that was in 2015 five years ago at that minister's meeting now i've been challenged since then don't get me wrong the devil has challenged me but that's my confession i'm going to keep confessing that because even like with sister who was dead you know uh just speaking the word like that was their testimony life came in after we prayed life right everybody else is praying for death we're praying for life amen amen that proves we we believe in jesus christ because he's the way the truth and the life amen amen see we're a different breed praise god they're praying for death we're praying for life nothing against people like that but just we're different we're a different breed and so when i i'm just saying that because when i confessed i was adopted and my word was the father's word i was tested on it but you know what it's my confession another another example i gave is when we were it was right when we were over there in that other sanctuary i was preaching sermons and people would come up to me and say that was exactly what we talked about on the drive to church i had to happen numerous times over there uh they said we had all these questions about the rapture and you answered every one with your servant today that was the saints from pennsylvania told me that and other times i'd spoken the word and in other words i was it was like god was speaking when i was preaching not me so i just had to look at my life and i just had to examine i said well where am i i see these attributes in my life and now i'm speaking god's word and people are hearing directly from god so i thought that's my confession now if i to fall away if i had to fall away uh to murder or if i would have thought fall away to you know adultery or trying to think of some other sins that would be idolatry worship brother brandon well then i would say well i'm not probably not born again but church after all these years if i'm still pressing on if i'm still believing god if i see god moving in my life then i'm going to keep confessing that's where i am amen praise god because i i'm not i'm not looking at it uh i mean i i'm trying to be honest with myself praise god i'm trying to be honest with myself looking at the word and we gotta constantly remain in prayers we said stay on our faces stay humble let god prove it and live by every word every day live by the word of god amen and when you see that over days and weeks and months and years and now decades praise god then that's the only conclusion we can come to praise god now if we don't see those things then let's come to a different conclusion praise god but if we see a life that resembles christ then we can thank god for that let's keep our confession amen stand to our feet i better do that because it's already past the 40 minutes all right and i'll look at my notes one more time to see if there's anything else now at the end of every chapter i always put action steps because some people just like list just give me a list what do i got to do so the first thing is make sure you got faith that's the first thing and then get baptized in water and then that's the first step make sure you're justified all right yeah most people aren't even baptized right away but you don't need to have the right way to be born again like cornelius but you will if you are born again you will go get re-baptized the right way and then second step is examine your daily actions and your habits do you have these clear character qualities do you see jesus's brotherly kindness living through you and then get the holy ghost jesus said ask if you want the holy ghost ask the heavenly father gives the holy spirit to them that ask for him and then so the third step is once you're born again live boldly faithfully for christ and you'll see the fruits of the spirit begin manifesting in your life right you stay faithful to god you'll see you'll always see yourself as fruitful remembering you were bought with a price remembering how jesus forgave you of all your sins you'll remember that you'll stay near the cross and you'll grow in grace and knowledge of the lord musicians if you'll come here praise god i hope that was a blessing tonight by god's grace i just mad it's so beautiful the word of god is so tremendous so tremendous remember church jesus looked at his disciples the night he was arrested beforehand he prayed lord sanctify them through thy truth thy word is true he knew they weren't born again after his resurrection he breathed on them in church that's that's what our prayers should be right lord sanctify us through your truth your word is truth how many want to be more sanctified praise god i do i believe i'm born again but remember the scripture also says i sanctify myself for their sakes praise god but amen you've got a song really like okay let's see jesus keep me near the cross they are precious [Music] so it's in the cross in the either in the cross or near the cross did everything make sense tonight did it make sense [Music] let's pray and ask the lord to help us find our spiritual locations [Music] just look at that from your face [Music] they can see [Music] all men and women in chapter 2 it says because the law of god is [Music] they know somehow [Music] at the feet of jesus [Music] in comparison to the eternal revelation that jesus gave amen and thank you god the word we've received tonight will never be taken from us it'll become part of our character [Music] let us be so honest with ourselves so honest in this prayer lord let there be no slack but there be no forgetfulness keep us near the cross we want to be [Music] fruitful [Music] all the is [Music] [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] wow [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] see [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you let's go [Music] yes [Music] foreign [Music] i know it's easier for me [Music] i like that [Music] the ultimate voice [Music] christ take the claws [Music] this [Music] it seems [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] um [Music] one force [Music] help me [Music] these are light burning [Music] as paul said [Music] here [Applause] [Music] with your strength [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] temptations [Music] is jesus christ
