========================================

all treasures sorry of wisdom and knowledge sorry i didn't tell you i was gonna read verse three let's go to uh jeremiah 29 please verse 11 jeremiah 29 11. bless you in jesus name jeremiah 29 11 let's read 11 12 13. remember if we do these things then we'll be found of god you know i would say like this you know we if we're born again then if we are born again those of us who are then we have truly sought god with all of our hearts even our souls right and then we've found him we've been we've received his own life but then maybe like daniel or like brother branham maybe lord or saints as the lord allows us to be here maybe we'll have to seek him again right before the rapture you know just like david had this i'm sorry daniel had to seek god for 21 days to get the revelation of where exactly how close he was to the next junction of time right so perhaps we'll do it again now we want to see god every day right but there's something about seeking god with all your heart right so let's read jeremiah 29 11 12 and 13. on three one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart let's have one more word of prayer if we can't let's just bow our heads heavenly father we we love your word we're so grateful we want to love you with all of our hearts soul mind and strength so help us here tonight to give this word and this service all of our strength all of our attention lord with love god that we might we we might receive the wisdom and the treasures that we just heard about that are hidden in the godhead hallelujah and we know the godhead is here the holy ghost is here hallelujah and so lord just help us to receive of you tonight and we pray you'll just speak to us in a special way in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god hopefully uh they're up on the livestream my wife sent me a text i just saw it and hopefully she got the live stream here we went a little bit longer i kind of lost track of time uh so i want to uh just kind of go through uh a few thoughts here i don't know how many sermons will do on this and even you know as we looked at the bible study on sunday night there's numerous things i didn't put in the book that i just they didn't come to me while i was writing it like the throne right the throne in revelation the ancient of days which was a tremendous question and a very helpful one but perhaps there'll be future editions i don't know uh but or we could just do youtube videos on it but uh it's such an amazing subject right such a massive subject any subject about god would probably be a large subject right because he's infinite uh but anyways we just try to do the best we could and give everyone a biblical foundation about god and be able to show how god is not three co-equal separate co-eternal persons right but he's one person who reveals himself in three ways to redeem mankind praise god now just notice uh if you notice from our scripture colossians two verse two it says the mystery of god now notice county's god and of the father and of christ did you notice it never mentions the holy ghost what does that mean god's four persons then no see paul sometimes paul will use father son and holy ghost you know he'll use greetings like that sometimes he doesn't in fact numerous times he doesn't i mention that later in the chapter but right at the beginning of the chapter i just point out that notice what he calls it father god and christ he never mentions the holy ghost see because paul wasn't a trinitarian paul knew that god and the father were the self-same person praise god and god was and paul was able just to call out the titles because he knew it was all the self-same person okay so trinitarians can never make the case that well every time paul talked about the godhead he said three persons he never did he never said father son holy ghost every time he talked about god and the father and christ he didn't do that and so it must be uh acknowledged there that paul was not a trinitarian and he never taught it praise god and notice all the wisdom that we could want is in the holy ghost now how do you get the holy ghost you repent and be baptized get sanctified and you're filled with the holy ghost then church if you're born again you have access jesus said i'm guiding you into all truth so that means you have access to all the wisdom right because it's all truth he's going to lead you into all the wisdom you need for your spiritual journey how many kids amen to that if you're born again it's just going to come to you praise god hallelujah you won't have to go wondering where is it where is it if you are born again the truth will come to you because the holy ghost is inside of you and in him is all the treasures of all that you could ask for every spiritual blessing is already in you praise god see so uh but notice also we must acknowledge it is mysterious i think that's what we can see right it's it's very mysterious still because we see the ancient of days in daniel 7. he's white i'm sorry he's got white hair like wool and then we see a son of man come and stand before him right so we see the body of jesus standing by the throne of god where there's some sort of theophany there right unless that theophany change its form and vanish or change to a pillar of fire we're not not sure how we we we're not sure what happened in revelation 5 all we see is the bible said a lamb stood there in the midst of the throne and come and took the book but we're not told about two persons well we don't even know we don't we're not even told who's on the throne right there's there's just lightning around the throne there's just thunder i mean we don't even know anything on the throne there's no body spoken up on the throne we just see a lamb come and take the book and he's a lamb like he's slain praise god amen thank god oh that heavenly god there's a heavenly witness of a sacrifice for you and i amen there's a sacrifice right now standing there in heaven for you and i it's the bleeding bloody lamb thank god that our lamb that makes us perfect is there in heaven right now to appear in the presence of god for you and i us wretched men yet we're also men that have no condemnation praise god us sinners but yet we're not sinners because the seed of god cannot sin amen thank god there's a lamb standing there for us hallelujah hallelujah but we acknowledge it's mysterious we'll never be able to prove to a trinitarian uh that it's not mysterious it is mysterious and we acknowledge that we're not blind uh we're not blind crazy people or ignoramuses brother brennan brandon brother adam calls it brother said use all your intellect he said but use also all the power of god in other words don't throw out your intellect and you're thinking use your wisdom right but also trust in the power of god hallelujah and i've seen that even the debate i had i've seen now the holy ghost i already told you but gave me wisdom regarding the godhead that's what we do we use all of our intellect but then when we don't have the answer the holy ghost brings the answer praise god see we must only know god based upon his word praise god because satan is going to try if he can just get us on one word and deceive us on one thing he can get us to sin as he proved with eve in the garden but we've got to be a pure bride amen we've got to be a spiritual bride amen a spiritual virgin bride who has the life of god who will not change one word of god she won't accept one thing changed she only wants the pure word of god we've got to be faithful and the bible says that christ here the bible says is in christ is the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him now church we often fail in this i fail this but let's just be honest brother brahm said pray for what most revelation did he not so so we need to be often praying for that more praise god and let's when we close tonight let's pray for revelation praise god because that's what the holy spirit gives us the spirit of wisdom and revelation praise god that's where church we've seen so many churches fall away proving they don't have revelation like some of them will say if if you go too hard on the drums and then you don't have the holy ghost and yet your life can be more holy than theirs in other words they make music a dogma right or if you if you clap on a certain beat you know there's churches in ohio the messenger churches that say if you clap on the offbeat you're it's from satan you're deceived by satan i'm like you haven't been to churches very far like down south have you or churches around the world have you anyone that likes to be and likes to move and worse you must have not been to you'd be surprised what people think but see church that just shows they're not into the spirit of wisdom and revelation like a christian should be because they're making their own man-made creeds and denominations jesus christ did not send a prophet to start a denomination he sent a prophet to finish the mystery of god and show that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise god not to start denominations and dogmas increase and divide the body but to give the body the power of the holy ghost to discern the spirit of the antichrist in the framework of the church and the same churches that do that basically divide other message churches so they're not bringing unity they're actually bringing division because a tree is known by its fruit saints hallelujah praise god amen see it's the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the godhead in the knowledge of the holy ghost see so this is what we've got and remember this revelation comes from the father because peter got it from the father jesus said jesus said my flesh did not reveal this unto you but my father which is in heaven revealed to you who i am church the same is true today that's why we don't need william branham here or even the literal body of jesus christ he said it's better than i go because when the holy ghost comes he'll teach you all things amen if we have the right understanding of the godhead it'll prove that we've been taught by the holy spirit and not by a man hallelujah and many of these people that leave the message that's what that first thing they go back is to the trinity and they get re-baptized in the titles father son holy ghost and ignore the five examples in the book of acts by holy ghost-filled men what they call giants of the faith and they can't even follow the giants of the faith right because they're because they're they're giantly deceived i'll say it like that oh my but remember church it is the name of jesus christ the water baptism that unlocks the godhead if we can see that there's one name to the father and the son and the holy ghost if we can see that one name it will unlock everything because it means the godhead has one name which one name represents one person praise god amen and that's a great revelation that struck me when i was writing this chapter i don't know what page it's on but the bible said man was made in the image of god and man is a three-part being praise god so if a man is not three persons if a woman is one person with three uh three parts then so is god that was just a simple revelation that struck me because we are in the image of god so if god is there's three that then we're three but not three persons three parts or three manifestations there's brother says three offices hallelujah so we have an office of the body we have an office of the mind spirit and we have an office of the soul praise god see where that's a great revelation that came to me very simple but i had people on facebook a few years ago tell me that was so powerful it really helped them out so i thank the lord for that simple humble wisdom praise god because i only get that by meditating on the word now church the confusion about the godhead is how many persons is he now church there's 7.3 billion people on the earth listen 2.3 billion are christian and most of those are pagan idolaters believing these three gods think about that almost a third of the entire world believes god is three gods yet claiming to be in the true faith another 1.1 billion are hindus and hindus believe in thousands of god but they have they have one uh one main trinity of the most powerful gods i'll show you that in a little bit so right there is let's see two three there's four billion right there almost 4 billion now there's 2 billion people that are atheists and agnostics and they don't worship any god except the god of this world satan right so they so they also believe in many gods sports money sex you all these things see that they're believing multiple gods right right uh and so see now that's already up to uh six billion and the last group is the muslims which are about two billion and they believe in one person but yet they have a devilish uh religion as well so see uh less than a third right so about a fourth of the world actually believes in one person god and you have the jews are very small remember there's only going to be 144 000 that are actually true believers right that really get the holy ghost i think how small the message groups are around the world so there's a ver we're part of a very small group and and even in that group there's a tiny tiny minority who actually know that the one god's name is jesus christ amen hallelujah some of them still think it's father or god or something like that but there's one name above all names every name in the family in heaven and earth and all the angels have to bow to that's the name of the lord jesus christ so it's a great confusion in other words 75 percent of this world believe in multiple gods or worship multiple gods and some of them it's like the unknown god they don't even know that they're worshiping these gods right of course we know the unknown god in acts 17 was actually the god of the god of the bible but i'm saying people today say there's no god so they're worshiping unknown gods right they're they're worshiping demonic spirits so the revelation is god is one person but he eternally will exist in one body the body of the lord jesus christ that's the revelation now go to matthew 13 33 this is important text here this was such a beautiful revelation to me as well i never heard anybody preach it by the william it just i felt like the holy ghost just gave it to me matthew 13 33 this is a one verse parable now this is either the church the true church or the false church you judge you already know what i'm going to say for all of our even our young people that may not understand it you judge another parable spay key unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal to the whole was leaven now this is either a natural woman no actually there's three it could be the natural woman in other words can we get into the kingdom of heaven by making bread right so is it a natural first or spiritual interpretation well it ain't natural because if if you get the kingdom of heaven by bacon bread there's a lot of bakers that are born again right let's let's go down the street and we'll meet some people that are born again they're just making bread so see it cannot be a natural interpretation it's got to be spiritual then there's only two spirits amen there's either the holy or the unholy so let's go with the holy first some person some sweet person told me this was the holy church what church would put leaven which always represents sin in meal and meal always types christ he was the meal offering in the old testament he was the meal that elijah threw in the pod amen and the pot was healed amen jesus heals everywhere where he's accepted amen he's ground up all every particle's ground up the same because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah so who's this meal if this is the true church why would the church inject sin into three measures of truth that doesn't even fit the word of god the bible says that jesus is coming for a bride who made herself ready and she's going to be washed she's going to be spotless there it is right there is she he gonna be spotless blameless well without spot wrinkle or blemish that's the kind of bride christ is coming for amen he said keep he said keep the feast in in sincerity with unleavened bread hallelujah praise god so this woman cannot be you and i it cannot be the true church it must be that devilish mother hearted amen because there's only two people too is either the good spirit or the wrong one praise god a one verse scripture so that's why i know the holy ghost revealed this to me because it can't be anybody else right can't be natural it can't be the holy church it's got to be that demonic mother harlot church hallelujah see so what is it what'd she do notice when did she add the 11 in the beginning of the baking process way before it got full 11. she added it at the beginning when was this trinity doctrine introduced the word trinity was first put into the place in the third sec second century 180 80 a.d so 80 years after john died this woman started injecting leaven into the three measures of the father son and holy ghost because he's he's the meal he's the word he's the bread he said i am the bread of life amen hallelujah what woman introduced leaven into this holy meal the roman catholic church and it spread it's now spread for almost 2 000 years from about well about 1700 years right because it's been 1919 years since jesus raised from the dead right and then this started about 100 180 a.d right so about 1700 years or so right about 700 years till the whole thing is leaven and look at the church that started this doctrine is or is or is not the catholic doctrine 11 is it is it total 11 or not what do you think absolutely i've got the catechism at home i can show you it's full of sin it's full of leaven it's full of pope worship it's full of statue worship can you imagine coming here today and i said sister let's bow down at this statue here can you imagine if i said that we're not going to worship it we're just going to venerate it well you might as well worship it because venerate or honor the same thing as worship amen aren't you glad church you have to come here and trust in a statue or in a man-made device of art but you get to pull from all god's invisible spirits and who are all treasured with their heads but they're in your soul praise god aren't you glad church i went you
