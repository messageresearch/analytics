Holy Ghost In Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen thank you musicians by God's grace appreciate that let's go to Jeremiah chapter 20 I'd like to preach a part two here on the spirit of burning so we look at that here tonight the spirit of burning a little later I'll have just a few pictures of Casa but not right now I just got regular notes Here Today by God's grace the spirit of burning part two we'll look at the life of Jeremiah a little bit here tonight by God's grace so Sunday we looked at the life of Isaiah another uh we'd say you know some people call them minor but they to me they they're like Major Prophets we know all their messages are major messages right uh but let's look at the life of Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 20:9 we'll just read that together and we'll have you be seated by God's grace you know I could not find where brother R quoted this one time so maybe I wasn't looking at the right words but I can't find not one time when brother Ram quoted this verse yet I've heard this verse quoted many times by many people um so I think this scripture is often misunderstood I've I've said it numerous times over the years but we want to take another look at it here tonight because it ties in with this uh series here like I said this might be a three-part series maybe four-part series but um we'll see what the Lord has here by God's grace Jeremiah chapter 20:9 all right let's read that if we can on three ready one two three then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated here tonight so I'm going try to set a timer here by God's grace we'll try to do an hour I preached way too hard on Sunday I was really I don't know why I was just so fired up but I preach way too hard so I'm going to try not to preach so hard here tonight by God's grace I don't have a lot of voice left so we'll try to be under control so part one here we looked at um uh the spirit of burning in the life of Isaiah and uh we learned one thing we saw that the spirit of burning comes after the spirit of judgment so the Judgment of God God comes upon a Believer first so we can expect that God is going to give us the the real state of our life and aren't you glad for that we know all kinds of people they create a different well I'm doing okay you know you shake their hand how you doing oh I'm doing good are you really doing good God knows how you're doing Hallelujah we can present something good you know like we joked about it before how you doing well I'm pressing the battles well what does that mean that really doesn't tell us how you're doing by God's grace one time uh a man walked up to me he's a denominated man good man uh but he looked at me and he just shook my hand a little it was Jean he shook my hand real interesting he looked he kind of pulled me close to himself he said he said how are you living Jesse and I was just like I'm doing great my God's grace you know I'm doing good but he had heard that somewhere from somebody and and I thought wow that was a really nice uh from him you if you knew him you'd know why he's a real in-depth kind of person and he didn't want to know how I was doing he would know how I was living and that's what the Holy Spirit will make known to you how we're living our daily lives in other words is God continually consuming our lives or are we getting our life consumed by something else right as we saw on Sunday we close with it God is a consuming fire that mean God wants to eat up all your life he wants to eat up all your thoughts Hallelujah he wants all your praise how many want to praise him tonight Hallelujah you sounded really good on the songs praising him right Eden's got her hand up amen hallelujah God will help you Hallelujah God wants to eat up all your thoughts your praise and your worship your conversations so important because as soon as you say you're a Christian the devil's going to start attacking you as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost you get all the guns pointed at you right so you're going to have to go through many battles you have to go through many trials but that's how God likes it God likes Faith that's real that's been tested by real trials Hallelujah that's why sometimes you know we think well God why would you allow this to happen of course he'd allow he loves to test his Believers right he loved to test job because God knew Job would never curse him right job wasn't just serving God for all the blessing That's what Satan was trying to say well he's just serving you because of the good times and although it was hard for job job still overcame and he never charg God foolishly throughout his difficult trials Hallelujah and God was able to tell devil look he serves me because he loves me not just because of all the blessings that I give him so that's what we want to be today we want to be we want to have a a real love for Christ we want to serve Christ for all the right reasons Hallelujah whether He blesses us anymore or not we want to serve him because we love him and you know I you know I just want to say this plainly I'm not sure if these two steps are justification and sanctification but it seemed to me like it was uh because uh you know before Isaiah could be sent out he had to get all his iniquity burned away and he had to be a vessel that was cleaned out right that's what sanctification is cleaning out the vessel for service and since there was no third work of Grace in the Old Testament because Jesus had not uh died and uh been resurrected and glorified it seems like that could all you could have that could you you could just have two works of Grace so while I was preaching that that came across I actually didn't even plan to preach it on Sunday it was just kind of Revelation and church that's what you'll find you know I I've I've had this idea for many years I like to make just a video series on learning the message now every critic of mine will criticize me and say oh look he's learning he's intellectual but they just shows their ignorance they don't know the Bible Jesus said learn of me in Matthew chap 11 that just shows their ignorance and brother answer they just want something to pick on but what I mean by all this is have have lessons where you you learn the message by the thus sayith the Lord truths of the Bible like if you know the if you know uh water baptism and the godhead and then the three works of Grace and and you if you have the baptism of Holy Ghost really down good on the three works of Grace then everything's going to fall right into place you're never going to come up with some fantastic different doctr or something like that everything will fall right into place uh brother ram calls it uh the Keystone of the Bible he said what's the Keystone Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if you can get those foundational things and that's what I've seen in my life you know when I came in the message it wasn't brother BR brother BR brother BR it was the Bible the Bible the Bible and don't get me wrong brother br's good brother br's good that's good that's good but he he's not the absolute Jesus is the absolute and if you can get a good Bible Foundation of Revelation then the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you Hallelujah they can't and everything will fit together by the Bible well you have yes we have some questions but the majority of things will lay just right perfectly right in line with every other verse that's what I've seen in my life you know somebody uh message denier today a message accuser accused me online he's well you act like you know it all uh like you got all the answers I said I don't I never said I did but the God I seres got all the answers and oh yeah he said well you just say act like you got the final say on everything it's not me that's got the final say it's God's word that got a final say hallelujah and they can never defeat the revelations that Jesus Christ has revealed to us hallelujah so I'm not going to give into those evil spirits whether they're online or trying to sneak into our church you never give in the devil you overcome the devil Hallelujah you don't baby the devil you rebuke the devil Hallelujah that's right now we saw now for tonight just catch this I'm and I saw and as I as after I preached I saw the the uh the progress of the holy spirit it's beautiful I just I was so blessed Isaiah had the burning to put him into service tonight you're seeing the burning to keep you in service to keep you from quitting that's what we're looking at tonight don't raise your hands but whoever was tempted to quit serving God don't raise your hands unless you want to nobody's going to see it anyway well I mean they might see the front people but see we see we have the burning of the Holy Ghost to put you in service to get started and that's what everybody needs here as I said on Sunday I went through all those examples of you know in action right just do something for God just do something what you need is the burning of the fire of God in your soul that'll get you doing something for God but then you're going to be tested and you're going to need another anointing another experience with the Holy Ghost to keep you serving God so you don't quit you don't give up you don't bring reproach upon the name of Jesus Christ and then we're going to another good one next week well maybe won't be Sunday maybe Sunday night we'll see who knows how it's all going to go we'll just trust the Lord but I got some more burning verses here now let's look at Jeremiah Isaiah had the burning to put him into service Jeremiah needs the burning as we saw to keep him in service think about that God let him go through such trials that he's like I won't witness anymore I won't talk about God anymore because I've been through such difficult trials he almost convincing brother Chris to not talk about God anymore now what would it take in your life what would have to happen in your life where you'd be like I'm done talking about Jesus I'm done talking about brother brandom in the message the Bible Revelation what would it take for you Hallelujah so we want to be S we want to be sincere we want to be sober right and really consider wow what did God the god of love is he the god of love or not Church the God of all love and mercy and Grace yes the God of all love and mercy and Grace allowed his son Jeremiah to go through such trials he's like I'm I'm done talking about the message I'm done but did God allow it yes did he overcome it yes amen hallelujah is is God ever going to give you a trial that's too hard for you no he'll never do that but will it test you to the very core of your being absolutely praise God Amen and you might even be considering giving up quitting brother R went through it too we've been through it numerous times especially with the loss of his uh first wife and and uh Sharon Sharon Rose brother almost gave up he almost gave up but he said something held me amen he said the anchor held me he said what if it wasn't there in other words Church you ought to be happy if you've got an anchor to hold you in your hardest Trials of life thank God it's there Hallelujah no glory to God Amen thank God you have something holding you when you feel like you can't hold on that's how it is church let's be honest there's times how many honest where you feel like I'm holding on my I'm able to hold on to God's word that's true sometimes I feel like that too other times I get tested I feel like God you better hold on to me because I feel like I'm falling and the church said good we're all human here tonight like brother Donnie says nobody hung up their angel wings when they walked in back there in the in the other room because we all we all fall short of God's glory and we all get tested and tried but God is gracious God is with us God will hold us when we can't hold ourselves when it feels like that I'm talking about human emotion right and our human Spirits now in Jeremiah's Life Church you see so much persecution if you haven't read through it uh you need to I've read through it uh this year well I'm sorry it was the end of last year now I'm in Isaiah I'm in I just went through Isaiah 29 this morning by God's grace that's where he was mentioning about uh uh the heart they removed their heart far from me but now as we look at Jeremiah's life here just for a few moments this makes it plain to me after I read about Jeremiah's life and I've read the book this makes it plain that we are living in Le oysa because we have to battle riches we have to battle uh uh an Easy Living that's what we have to battle not physical persecution at least not yet now I don't know if you saw it but did you see uh it was in Congo 70 Christians were beheaded recently in Congo 70 and they didn't put on the news or nothing it just went across the Christian uh these uh militants or whatever they were I think I forget which religion they were but they come and right during the church service now Church which one of us now if that ever happened which one of us would stand on God's word God forbid but think about the faith they had to have to stand 70 70 and they stood on God's word none of them said you know I'd rather live I'd rather live I don't believe this and they all stood on God's word talk about I'm not giving up and I'm not turning around for what you know for what what would be worth it to to blashe the Holy Name of Jesus it wasn't worth it h thank God Amen and no doubt Church they're wearing a martyr's crown today Hallelujah no doubt they have a martyr's crown on right now Hallelujah so if you as you look at the life of Jeremiah church it's plain we're in Lea where we're rich and increased with Goods but we like I said remember he's talking to both Vines here we have need more of God we have that need hallelujah how many know you have that need today Hallelujah once you start feeling like you don't need God anymore you're on the way down you got to get back on the right path Hallelujah like I need more of God what did Brother R say those three things were uh soft living riches and the cares of life or something those three I can never remember that third one soft riches I'm sorry soft living riches and I think it was the cares of life that's what we battle we don't go through what Jeremiah went through through that we hardly need delivered from any persecution and and I'll just be honest is for for all of us most of us our persecution either comes from the family or in the church I've been persecuted more in the church than ever really in my family but that's normal that's what Paul went through and all the saints you know they uh because that's who I spend my time most time most of my time with is the Saints hallelujah or the church but see like we hardly need delivered from any physical persecution and so we got to look at spiritually uh what's trying to discourage our our our our state spiritually and help us to realize it's a real fight it's a real battle although it's not physical we got to we got to be more serious with the spiritual battles that we go through Hallelujah now I'm just going to do a brief summary of of the sufferings of Jeremiah you know he's called the weeping prophet because of all the immense suffering and persecution throughout his ministry and church his whole Ministry was basically to warn the people he did have a few chapters of Hope for the future but most of them didn't come to pass in his lifetime he had to basically preach and prophesy to a bunch of rebellious people okay so first the first two uh uh trials he went through was rejection he was rejected and then loneliness God told him not to marry in Jeremiah 16 God said you're not taking a wife you're not having children so God forbid him to have children and a wife life because it wouldn't fit his lifestyle and his ministry what God called him for now how many people would would accept that men I'm talking men how many men would accept that and be like Oh Praise the Lord but God commanded him you're not to do that so uh and it was also to symbolize the coming disaster on Judah he was in uh deep loneliness and isolation according to Jeremiah 15:17 you want to pull that up there H Jeremiah 15:17 he was constantly mocked and ridiculed for for his prophecies I sat not in the Assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced I sat alone because of thy hand for thou H has filled me with indignation so he sat alone yeah I preached on this years ago you ever want to talk about somebody lonely you ever been lonely in your life go read Jeremiah it wasn't just one time it was all throughout his life battle loneliness his whole life now which one of us have God said okay who'd like to go through trials in life who wants the loneliness trial how many of us would said yes I'll take that or uh here's the card who wants to be poor oh yeah yeah I I want to I want to be poor and be malnourished and have all kinds of diseases because I don't eat enough food which one of us well the nice thing is God doesn't ask us what we want to do God assigns us a certain trial and look what Jeremiah got he went through some of the hardest things a person a prophet could absolutely go through but what is he now he's immortalized in Eternity for his faithful service to Jesus Christ now church I'll tell you now if you ever cried again it won't be tears of sadness amen it'll be tears of joy Hallelujah for the victory over Satan and the Antichrist Spirit right there in right there in Israel he have to go very far to find evil spirits they're all around him constant opposition constantly mocked and ridiculed for his prophecies he was also accused of being a false prophet like they say they say they tell me oh you're a false Pastor or you're a false whatever false teacher all these things like that you always look at always look at who's accusing you and look at their life because you and I know the lives we live Hallelujah because God gives us the spirit of judgment he was beaten and imprisoned he was thrown in a sistern to die a pit a muddy pit to die he just sank down and was starving to death in Jeremiah 38 just left there and and God put it on someone's heart uh what was his name here it's it's Eed melik an Ethiopian official he says he goes to the king and begs him and so they tile these uh these uh pieces of cloth together like uh just a wrap around him and they pull him up and he's almost dead laying in in a a pit of mud for days and weeks on end almost died that's that that's the glamour of being a prophet there's no glamour in being a prophet of God this is what he went through he was thrown into the sister then he was accused of treason he was falsely accused of defecting to the Babylonians when he tried to leave Jerusalem so he's just trying to get out and they falsely accuse him of joining the bad guys the officials demanded his execution people were calling for his life in Jeremiah 38 but King zedekiah hesitated and spared him then he was forced to go to Egypt Church uh taken against his will in in Jeremiah 43 to Egypt he continued prophesying there and the Bible doesn't say it but history says because he was preaching against their Idols in Egypt which is the land of idolatry right represents our sinful life Egypt history says he was stoned to death by his own people not the Egyptians his own church family we'd say church church message family because they were false Believers right they're make Believers so this is the story of this we'd say mighty man of God church we don't go through nothing compared to Jeremiah we always want to remember that and even you know hose and I when he was talking me on Sunday he was telling me the different things he suffered through he said but brother Jesse he said the Holy Spirit reminded me I haven't been through nothing as hard as these other brothers in the Bible what they've been through it's been nothing compared to what they went through how many appreciate the Holy Ghost in someone's life life let's go to Jeremiah 20 we'll look at now we'll look at this one this individual so boy he needed fire church he needed a burning but he needed a burning to keep from quitting because it got so hard now as I said on Sunday church I'll say like this you and I need a burning whenever we sin we need a burning in our life the Holy Ghost to burn out that desire out of our Lives that's all we need we need uh the spirit of judgment to come on I'm wrong I'm a dirty person or my flesh is dirty my my mind gets dirty my words get dirty and I confess it I'm the guilty one and then God will send the burning to burn that out of our lives and we don't want to do that again Hallelujah so what what I'm saying is yes you need one at the beginning of your ministry yes you got to have that but there's going to come times too like Peter right Peter segregated you know Peter had mistakes even after the Holy Ghost where we need the spirit of burning to clean out our lives aresh Hallelujah everybody understand like the Bible says you got to get your first love back so how do you get your first love back do the first works that you did at the beginning Hallelujah now Jeremiah chapter 20 let's start there verse one all right yep I I turned and then I lost my spot okay seemed like at least once a service I lose my spot so I'm sorry Jeremiah 20 now pure the son of emmer the priest who was the chief governor of the house of the Lord heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things verse two then pure smoked Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the High Gate of Benjamin which was by the house of the Lord now okaya I'm going to put a picture up here here's a artist rendition here uh whoops wrong side let's see if it'll come up here's an artist rendition of being in the stocks it come up hope it come up yeah there this just an artist rendition now there's different ones some had them standing up but I would look at I I took the one that looked like it was most painful because that's probably what they did right they didn't put him through something easy so they're going to put this bar on top so this artist according to what they think is history this is how they put him in the stocks so this is what Jeremiah gets for telling people to stop sinning to put their Idols away to trust in God to believe thus say the Lord to live a holy life this is what he gets this is the payment he gets it's not a very glamorous life they put him in stocks and this was by the what of the Lord the house of the Lord Jeremiah is trying to defend the honor of the house and yet they they ridicule him publicly they persecute him publicly right by the house he's trying to help Hallelujah church sometimes you try to help people and it's among those people you're trying help that's when you get treated the worst amongst the people you're trying to help Hallelujah but don't fret that's not just you that's every believer that was Jesus he was sent to his own and his own received him no did I quote that right no his own received him not now in verse uh let's go down to verse seven Jeremiah 20:7 now this is why I read this a few weeks ago and i' forgot in the context oh Lord thou Hast deceived me and I was deceived so again was that true did God deceive Jeremiah no now God doesn't tell us all the future so that's why Jeremiah probably thought that but God don't God only tells you what he wants you to know he and because he knows he's got to test you he knows the best way to test faith is with trials Hallelujah the best way to improve patience is to go through hard times oh Lord thou has deceived me and I was deceived Thou Art stronger than I and Hast prevailed I am in derision daily everyone mocks me so not not just the physical pain but everybody coming by maybe hitting him spitting on him mocking him oh look there's the prophet of God supposed Prophet there's a false prophet of God that's what his life was subject unto Jeremiah wasn't living a picnic he was on the battlefield now it's under this everyone's everyone's mocking him so it sounds like he still don't have any friends he's still all alone now when we go through loneliness we we're probably lonely but how many people are actually mocking us to our faces right probably zero so Not only was he alone no wife no children Nobody But even his church members they're all mocking him on top of everything else and sure sometimes we feel like we job or we we're Jeremiah I'm sorry if you think that you're deceived you have been deceived to somehow exalt yourself or make yourself think like you're greater than what you are yes we go through spiritual battles but nothing like this this is a spiritual battle as well as a physical battle and church think I just thought this this man's not even in the Hall of Fame of Faith right they didn't did they name Jeremiah in the hall I not that I can remember now would he be undoubtedly but did they name him no he wasn't named but surely his name's on the Lamb's Book of Life surely verse eight for since I spake I cried out and I cried violence and spoil because the word of the Lord was made a a reproach unto me and a derision daily so he's crying out to God and he became a reproach from all the word that he spoke now we get to the context here's our here's our verse now you understand the context now I'm going to skip ahead to the next slide they kind of shrank that down looks like they see they cut that out they cropped that out this is right outside the house of the Lord he got oh yeah so when they got beaten they said it was whips and stocks so he got whipped on the back right like the Lord Jesus maybe not the same thing of course that hadn't been invented yet as far as I understand but uh pasur struck Jeremiah the prophet so struck is another word for whipping him so it says Jeremiah was called to prophesy at the atrium of the temple it was a harsh message God would bring a catastrophe on on this place according to Jeremiah 19:3 he would let his people fall By The Sword and their corpses would be eaten by birds and beasts not a very flowery sermon to preach he would turn the Jews into cannibals God told them that most messages the prophets pass in the Bible were not happily received in this case the prophet I'm sorry the priest pure attacked the messenger he flogged him and locked him up in stocks the next day pure received a personal message he and his friends would be ex exiled and would die in Babylon since they rejected God message that's the message he's got to oh that's right yeah he gave that prophecy in verse six we didn't read verse six but after he was beaten Jeremiah then had to say well also this is going to happen God's rejected you still no good news right but a prophet will give you good news if you live good verse n then said I I will make not I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in my heart as a what a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay Church he's in the deepest pain physically he could ever be in probably the most emotional pain he's ever been through and he's on the verge of saying it's I'm done I'm done with this I I got to get healed up when am I ever going to get healed when am I GNA ever get any peace in my life and so what does God do does god rescue him out of there no God sends a fire inside of him a burning inside of him to let him know that God could touch his body at any moment God could heal his body at any moment but there a supernatural sign a supernatural touch I'm with you and you need to keep speaking the word of God hallelujah amen I'm not going to let you quit hallelujah hallelujah now I hear people I hear Christians and people sing about oh it's so happy that's like fire in my bones and they're living such a happy life you don't even know the verse of what it's talking about it's a man in stocks whipped who wants to quit and stop talking about God forever and then God sends fire then God sends the burning to make sure he doesn't quit hallelujah praise God that's the context of a fire shut up in my bones most people have no idea what they're talking about now just as a side note brother Mike McClosky the one in the wheelchair uh you know many times he's prayed to God for healing and one reason he believes he's still going to be healed which would be a tremendous one of the greatest Miracles ever if God does that if God does it on this side but the reason he has hope is because one time he was telling me he was driving home and the pain was so bad he just kept crying out to Jesus Jesus and he said as he was driving home he actually started getting the feeling back in his uh his his legs which they're they're paralyzed they have no feeling but all it and he he has never had a day without pain since that awful attack on him I'll call it an attack he's but in that moment in that short moment of driving in the van while he's crying to Jesus God let him be painfree and let him feel uh parts of his legs and if I'm not mistaken even down to his feet again and this is what this is the closest thing it can remind me of a man who suffers all day 247 with nerve pain and all the suffering and yet God to encourage him so he don't quit and give up gives him one experience and said I'm with you I'm here I can heal you but I'm allowing this for a certain purpose and don't stop don't give up stay with God's word there's a purpose for all things hallelujah amen it's the closest thing I could know to someone going through something like that and yet he still to this day he still praises the Lord and testifies in constant pain if you ever been around him you see he can't he can't quite sit still in his wheelchair he's got to adjust and move because there's so much pain like many times he'll just go like this go we'll just be talking about God He he'll just go just to deal with the pain I'm like Lord have mercy and I've my wife seen it I've said I've sat on my knees and cried begging God to heal the man and he's still not healed I've cried I prayed but what did Jesus do he sent a fire in his body to show him that I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm the god that formed your body all things are possible to them that believe but for whatever reason God's withholding it God church has a a a as a special testimony for each one of us and in the moment we feel like quitting in the moment sometimes where it's the hardest that's when God will give us some special sign some special Supernatural thing to keep us from quitting to remind us that this is just a test this is just a trial troubles don't last always Hallelujah and this will all work together for good because you and I love the Lord now we went through this a few weeks ago but remember verse 11 but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutor shall stumble so here he's all positive right before he's like I'm going to quit I'm going to quit God's to see me but now he's back on the positive side sound sound like anybody familiar you know that one day they testify good and the next day they're down the dumpster does it sound like anybody you know let me get a mirror I'll show you who it is I'll do me first and then I'll put the mirror in your face here's somebody that does that you me we all do that brother said you're up one day down the next and the church said now look at verse 14 now he's back to the downside cursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day wherein my mother bear me be blessed I've never felt that Saints I say that maybe to my shame or just whatever God has allowed me to go through I've never curse the day I was born and I'm thankful for all the children that have been born to me Hallelujah I rejoice in every day they're born and the future one to come by God's grace but this is the suffering God let his faithful Prophet go through to wish he'd never been born cursed be the man who brought the tidings to my father saying a Manchild is born unto thee making him very glad look at verse 17 because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame now as incredibly difficult is for that to understand church God is the god of contrast we would never know The Joy of Spring unless went through these awful Winters which thank God almost out of almost out of this one here we would know never know the joy of sunlight without the the darkness the absence of light so it is with Jeremiah so it is with Jeremiah because Jeremiah Was whipped because he was put in stocks because he was almost drowned in mud because he cursed the day he was born because of that because of the deep dark trials God goes through then we're also allowed to see the joys of Victory and Jeremiah wrote about them in his next book Lamentations 3 verse 21 you pull that up there I'll pull that off a little later I'll pull back up there so because he suffered because he cursed the day he was born because he thought he felt maybe uh deceived by the Lord which would have been wrong but because he had gone through so much God allowed him to go through that so he could climb out of that and God could show him that God can change any situation that we're in I'm trying to preach to you tonight God can change your situation Hallelujah Glory I ain't telling you how I ain't instructing you how I'm just preaching declaring you God can change your situation Hallelujah nothing is too hard for the Lord amen many times God prove that nothing shall be too hard for God Lamentations 3:21 if we never had the cursed days where you want to quit and give up we never know the joy of the next few words listen to these words there this I recall to my mind therefore I have hope what do you recall to mind verse 22 it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not alive in other words I'm still here because God's merciful I should be dead you should be dead because his compassions fail me not Hallelujah we would never know these words and the meaning of them because if they're written by the same man except a man went through the darkest of depths of Trials verse 23 they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness not a little bit not just a little bit Mercy faithfulness but great massive wonderful amazing Eternal faithfulness Hallelujah but he wasn't saying that while he was in the stocks he had to get out of there and then God showed him a New Hope a new day a new season Hallelujah before he cursed the day he was born but now he says the Lord is my portion look he's got no wife he's got no child he's got no faithful church members but it didn't matter he didn't have any of that but one thing he had was the Lord hallelujah and church really that's all you need that's all we need if it comes down to it where you don't got anything left at least you got Christ Glory that's your portion that's what those 70 people died for was the portion of Christ saith my soul therefore will I hope in him like Jesus said don't be afraid of man that can just kill your body he said be a fearful of God who can kill your body and then cast your soul into hell hope in God's Grace Hope in God's mercy verse 25 I love this the Lord is good unto them that wait for him Oh you mean you got to wait more brother Jesse yes but God is going to be good as you wait Hallelujah keep waiting Hallelujah to the soul that seeks keep seeking God hallelujah keep waiting on God hope is on the way Hallelujah Mercy is on the way Grace is on the way Hallelujah from a man who went through a million times harder things that you and I have been through he believed there was still Mercy there was still Grace there was going to be good mornings eventually Hallelujah brother Jesse you just don't know how hard it is but I don't have to because I know what Jeremiah had it was hard for him to be with and put in stocks and to be thrown alive into a pit and drowning in mud it's never happened to you and I this is a man who experienced the worst of the worst but is able to go through that season just get through it just hold on to me Lord just keep me from quitting so I don't I don't bring any reproach upon your name just keep me from quitting so that one day I can see a new light I can see a new dawn I can have hope for the future and a man that would eventually be stoned to death verse 26 it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait see all that loud complaining see see church that's the reason that's the reason sometimes we embarrass ourselves or We complain God is teaching us don't do that next time just quietly wait like you've heard me say before this is what they told me in football we would have to do whatever whatever the position was it was maybe a push-up position or something and they would just hold us there for like it felt like three hours but it's probably like five minutes and they would uh people would start mowing I can still hear those big guys going and the coach is like suffer in silence we're going to do this until you stop whining like a bunch of babies and we would do it until we stopped whining but isn't it amazing we're we're trying to be like like it's like a football's like a military similar not even close to the real thing but you don't understand like they're trying to train your get you to be mentally tough what about God God's training trying to train you and I to be mentally tough and not just go around complaining oh this went bad today oh it's been an awful day have you had a really bad day though I mean maybe a couple I mean really bad day pain losing someone you know tragedy maybe you've had some no doubt but what did Jeremiah go through compared to the pain we go through so suffer in silence so he learned to quietly wait Lord teach me to quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord one day salvation means Deliverance one day Deliverance is coming whether I see it on this side or that side one day Deliverance is coming teach me Lord to wait quietly guard my mouth so complaints and and foolish words don't come out of my mouth help me to Hope and quietly wait for the coming of God's salvation until I get a new season of life but church is it hard to do yes we all go through trials but that's why we come to the house of God to learn the ways of God who thought they're going to hear about Jeremiah tonight and the stocks and the beatings and the the cursing he was day he was even born he said he said cursive be that man who brought the tidings of my my birth to my father curs like what that's how hard life was he was beaten as we said put in stocks the rest of this chapter chapter 20 is emotional roller coaster I don't know which preacher I heard that but I love that term it's an emotional roller coaster up and down the highest of the high feelings and the lowest of the lows because I like roller coasters some people don't I've always liked them so see Isaiah got burnt by the Holy Ghost to put into service Jeremiah gets the burning of the Holy Ghost to keep him quitting and stay in service so Church you're going to need all kinds of experiences throughout your life but just wait on him God's going to send him it looks like that one came while he was in the stocks because he says I'm quitting you know he wasn't in an easy life it wasn't a nice uh season of rest for him it seems like wow he's in the stocks maybe the spirit of God comes on him and he keeps speaking for God it's hard to tell I don't really know and just so you know I'm down to about 20 minutes or so I looked it up and it seems like Jeremiah has about a 100 or 150 prophecies in his writing that's a real prophet of God I put 30 of brother bram's prophecies in my 2021 book uh we I can say at least six or 16 of them I haven't really studied out the Divine Healing ones yet but have already come to pass there's at least 11 future prophecies that I found that are still out there and Jeremiah still has verses or prophecies that haven't been fulfilled yet just like Isaiah the Millennium the future home and all these great prophecies the Rapture the raptures in Isaiah 25: 8-9 so these prophets lived and suffered and died they were real prophets and brother calls them weeping prophets I'm sorry Jeremiah's called the weeping prophet brother said in the broken sisters he said now Jeremiah was called also the weeping prophet and because I believe that this that that this made the prophet weep was because him being a prophet and the wordl Lord comes to such and seeing the people walk after their traditions and thought they were all right and no way at all to turn them so brother said one reason Jeremiah wept was because he kept prophesying and nobody got a soft heart God help our church to have a soft heart on Sunday when brother irin preaches to us I saw on Sunday a couple soft hearts come up here thank God for that and I I'm sure if you didn't come up wonderful you know I hope you had a soft heart I want everybody to have a soft heart that's what I'm saying we don't want to harden our hearts we want to have a soft heart to Christ but Jeremiah just saw the hardening and the mocking and it saw all the persecution and uh the devil anoint people his own church members to try to upset him and discourage him and that made him weep many times because of the trial he was going through you remember when I preached on this uh remember when I preached on emotions a couple years ago I got I wrote down I three people come up and tell me how much they enjoyed that after the service brother Ram said of all the human emotions Jesus manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often he cried a lot I would say you know weeping is not my most one but I do love when I get to weep for the Lord I do love that because I feel like I'm feeling his heart like I feel like that's when I'm really at my most sincere moments when I weep for what God weeps for but brother man says what is Jesus which emotion did he have was it happiness gladness shou and joy dancing weeping he cried most often that was what he was known for by his disciples was crying the burden on his heart he said he wept often yet behind that weeping and sorrow there was still God behind there so it's showing the heart of God how much he loves even the lost the Bible said God would that no men be lost God would that all men be saved but yet God even God even knowing the beginning from the end still has a heart that cares for them the vessels of Dishonor I'm talking about now how much more does he love you Church how much more does he love do he he knows you're not going to blaspheme him you're not going to walk away you're going to I'm not giving up I'm not turning around right by the grace of God someday we'll wear The Shining Crow butam said those same eyes of Jesus saw Visions they looked deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts and knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal eyes was God who cried to those who knew him not for what he was he said if ye believe not that I'm he ye shall die in your sin sins what a message to preach he said if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do the works of my father though you believe me believe the works in John 8 and John chapter 10 he said like Jeremiah of old he was the weeping prophet for men receive not the word of God and thrust aside the Revelation so that's what made Jesus weep the most he knew the father gave him the word but then to be rejected by the very people people he was sent to made him Weep the most church that's why it's a good indicator too of your heart condition when you can experience something like Jeremiah 9 that's right is Jeremiah no Ezekiel 9 where they sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city that's why it's important every now and then you need to have an experience with God Where You Weep over the sins of the people what gets me most is abortion that's where I'll weep over the sins of the people the most just thinking about it because I've seen different videos it just instantly brings tears to my eyes almost and it makes me weep and say God how can these people do such awful things but God built me that way because he knew I wanted to be a real believer and so God has built you and I different ones you got to get in prayer sometimes and just think about sins and you got to cry and intercede for these people because that's what the Bible says God's going to Mark think about that he's going to mark everybody touch your forehead God's going to spiritually put a mark right here if you sigh and cry for the Abominations done in this city so Church let's get down to let's get down to business when we pray say Lord what breaks your heart because I want that to break my heart for you it might be a broken family that breaks my heart all the time too with my parents divorcing that'll make me cry real quick too but there's you got to have such a heart like God you got to you got to care about the things God cares about you got to be grieved by the things God is grieved for cuz Jesus mostly of all emotions he wept he wept when his friends died he wept and said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I would have hovered over you like a Hu or brood but you would not I imagine these brothers in the high school they see a lot of things that they could weep over every day think of the things people see and that go through let's remember what does God's heart say about a matter that's what we have to remember praise God we have to remember Lord use my emotions to make me more like you when people think about me Lord help it not to be silly help it to be something good like something Stern or loving or kind or gracious or sensitive to the holy spirit let it be something like that praise God when people think about you that they really love the Lord they have a heart like Jesus's heart Hallelujah now I just thought see if I can find that quote here I want to see if I could find that quote real quick where brother was tempted to give I don't know if it'll work out not see if I can pull that up there I don't know if I'll be able to but it was after his wife died I love the story and I just thought of it before I came out I didn't have a time to go find it I don't promise I'll find it but I'm G to try here yeah okay yes here it is well this is right after brother Ram saw those flies around Sharon Rose and then she died of uh was it menitis he said there the baby laid there before the hospital and the isolated Ward flies all in her eyes like that I took the old mosquito bar I shed them away and I put it over her I got down and I said God there lays my daddy and brother Yonder and flowers on their grave there lays hope laying Yonder and here is my baby dying don't take her Lord he just pulled down the curtain as if to say shut up I don't want to hear you at all he wouldn't even talk to me now remember brother Rams running from God God told him to go out to the Pentecostals and he refused to go and he let his mother-in-law call them trash and brother didn't correct them or correct his mother-in-law brother says in some places this was the worst sin of his life and he suffered the most out of any sin because he was going to go out to preach and his mother said you can't mother-in-law said you'll never take my daughter a buch a bunch of trash like that brother said okay yeah we won't do it he gave into his mother-in-law he think about that he honored his mother-in-law above God how many of us would honor our husband or wife or father-in-law or mother-in-law over God always follow God so now he's getting the teaching now he's getting the test and then if God wouldn't talk to me it was Satan's time so see Satan's got a time he's allowed to come talk to you too he said and I thought you said he was a good God what's all this you're hollering about you're just a boy look around over this city every girl and every boy you ever associated with think you've lost your mind Satan says you have Satan never ever has Satan ever told you that you've lost your mind and you you said God's a good God how many times have Satan told me you've preached this Jesse that liar what a liar you preached this you you you you've taught this you why isn't God doing more how many times have Satan lied to me he said you have lost your mind now brother back to his thoughts he says now Satan couldn't tell me there's no God because I'd already seen it but he told me he didn't care for me right most of us know there's a God what does Satan do he's not going to say oh there's no such thing as a God you know God's real you know the word of God you've seen the Holy Spirit do things but he'll say oh he doesn't love you he doesn't love you that's why you're suffering the way you do that's the same thing you tried to tell Jeremiah just give up just stop stop stop serving God just go out enjoy some Pleasures in the world with what life you got left he said I sat all night long all day long I said to god what have I done show me Lord don't let the innocent have to suffer for me if I've done wrong so even seeking SE seeking God searching his life I didn't know he was trying me God was testing me in the fiery furnace of Affliction but every son that comes to God has got to be tried hallelujah amen goes back to Hebrews Hallelujah chapter 12 every Son of God must be tried whether you really believe or not so what are you going to say in your darkest hour some of us have had some pretty dark hours right so church we want to pass the test every son has to be tried and I said Lord tell me what I've done I'll make it right what have I done but preach all day long all night and just give my life constantly what have I done and then Satan comes back and Satan said that's right you see now when it comes to you and you've told all them that you believe that he's a great healer and there lays your baby lying there dying he refuses to even hear your wife died with tubercular pneumonia you said he could heal Cancers and there there he is talking about God there he is doing nothing now you talk about him being good and how good is he to people how about you so now Satan's talked to him twice remember brother says then I begin to listen to him now Church let's not get down on brother brandom all of us have done that sometimes we start actually considering well what if it's so hard what what if he said then I begin to listen to him that's reasoning and I thought that's right he just said that's right to Satan he agreed with what Satan said Satan said again now the third time he could tell you don't even have to speak the word just look at at your baby if God would just look at your baby it would live and brother Ram said again that's right God could do that and Satan talks again and as much of you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you and brother R again says the third time says that's right Satan and I begin to think well what see brother said but then everything began to break away when it comes to the reasoning so he had all these Seasons build up oh there it is break away that's the stronghold that's the complex Hallelujah Satan had built up a complex so look how fast a complex can be build up oh yeah right Satan that's right that's right and look within just a matter of moments you have this complex breaking up but just when he's about to give up he said all the all the complex started break the reasoning starts breaking away he said but when it come to that well about leaving he said that anchor that hung it stayed there I was just about ready to say then I'll quit how many times have we almost said the wrong thing what kept you from saying it that was God's spirit that kept you from saying it God's grace God has a predestinated boundaries naturally and spiritually that you cannot cross and we ought to say Amen to that Hallelujah God will only let a real believer go so far CU he knows the real believer doesn't want to he really doesn't want she really doesn't want to do that he said I'm just about to ready to say I'll quit like sound like somebody familiar a prophet of God Jeremiah but when it got down to all the reasoning Powers had broke away then it came to that eternal life that new birth so see the devil's battling up here but God God wouldn't let this win thank God Hallelujah brother har said and then see the test the test of Satan got got here it got here and then the test started coming down here trying to convince his soul to quit but brother BR said when it got down here he said that anchor held he said because down in the soul was eternal life hallelujah amen glory he says that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't happened been what I'm sorry what if it hadn't been there what if it hadn't have we wouldn't have known one another the way we do now thank God we wouldn't be here except God held brother brandom in his greatest trial of his life Hallelujah where would I be I'd be in the Assemblies of God or some Chapel or something like that I'd be out there in some denomination but because brother Ram's anchor held our anchor will hold in our trials Hallelujah I say like this because Jeremiah's anchor held brother bram's anchor held now your anchor will hold hallelujah thank God this church would not have been like this the thousands of millions around the world but thank God it was there church each day we ought to thank God that we have the Holy Ghost because if it wasn't there we would have quit we would have brought a disgrace upon the Lord Jesus Christ and then oh here comes the spirit of judgment right now oh I see it he said then I thought what who am I anyway who am I to question his majesty Oh see now he's judging himself oh wo is me I'm a man of unclean lips look at me I'm nothing who am I I can't create a blade of grass and yeah this whole God created all these uh all these creations and life and breath and and dogs and pigs and puppies and babies and all these things God created just by speaking the word hallelujah who am I to question the Creator that gave me the very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who gave it to me it's not mine anyhow he just loaned her to me for a while and I said Satan get away from me church that's what you need when you go through trials I think I told that to brother ni I said you got to talk to Satan in your room and say Satan get behind me he said I went over I laid my hands on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down put you on the mommy's Arms Of course that means bury him on top of his bury her on top of her mother the casket the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in the morning and I said Lord you gave her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you and believe you if you send me to hell I'll love you anyhow I can't get away from that there you are he said if it was just intellectual it would have broken away but you got to have a personal relationship you've got to be born again Hallelujah let's stand to our feet by God's grace Hallelujah musicians can come thank God it was there just play something keeps holding me here by God's grace how thankful church we ought to be for a man like Jeremiah how thankful we ought to be for a man like brother brandom who in their greatest darkest trials were able to stand the test and overcome and as brother Adam says in his darkest trial here it wasn't he that was holding on it was Christ holding on to him because he accepted eternal life church if you don't have eternal life you can get it tonight Hallelujah you can have eternal life tonight it can be any time but you got to want it Hallelujah you got to let the spirit of judgment come upon your life and if you're not happy with life and something sin you've done wrong confess it to God and then worship God and the spirit of burning will come on your life Hallelujah it'll hold you in your darkest trials what a promise that we have hallelujah what a friend we have in Jesus tonight how many thankful for the Friendship of Jesus Christ Hallelujah

oh thank you [Music] for let's thank God hallelujah thank you Lord God for holding us just keep playing that you know I told maybe I told this before there was one day I doubted the message when I first came in the message there was one night all these denominational guys gathered into my room there on bookto street and they just started talking all these things about brother brandom and this they saw on the internet and they just worked on me so long it got me discouraged and we just agreed to pray that I was going to leave the message and I went to bed that night saying I'm done with the message there was one day I've got of this message I woke up the next morning I remember I was going into the bathroom I got a phone call from Brother Craig Bo he said Hey brother Jesse it's the only time he's called me in all all my life preachers don't have a lot of time to call people okay but his first words were brother Jesse do you still believe this message the night after I prayed I was done with the message the only day I've ever and church God's my witness as soon as he said that I said yes I believe this message and in my heart right there I repented and when my buddies come to talk to me I said no I believe it so what is that it's the anchor holding the church it also shows reach out to people when you feel led by the holy spirit thank God there was an anchor there thank God there was eternal life that new serpent seed was right the godhead was right Hallelujah the seven Church Ages were right the Seven Seals were right Hallelujah it was right the Bible is true how many believe that thank God for holding us how many thankfully he holds you praise God in the midst of your trials you might have one Bad Day Saints you might have a few bad days but Jesus will hold you through it all how many want him to hold you let's SE that course again something keeps holding me and something keeps holding me every thank you Lord for holding me Hallelujah you're helping me Faithfully to overcome my trials guiding me constantly G me Victory oh he's a real yeah thank you for holding me thank you for hold you know I think that prayer of job probably goes down as one of the greatest prayers the Lord gives and the Lord takes away though he slay me yet I'll trust him the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord let's always bless the Lord amongst our trials can we do that by God's grace Hallelujah if anyone needs prayer morning welcome to come be happy to pray with you let's sing blessed be the name blessed be the name blessed be the name of the
