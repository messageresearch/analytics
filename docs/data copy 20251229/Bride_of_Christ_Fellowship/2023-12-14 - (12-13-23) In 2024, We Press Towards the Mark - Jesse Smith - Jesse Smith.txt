========================================

Sunday I like to look at how brother random approached the new year so I'd like to preach on that tonight this will be a more uh quote heavy sermon you know most of my sermons are scripture heavy you know but this one a little be little bit more quote heavy sermon by God's grace so Philippians chapter 3: 13 we'll start there read 13 and 14 by God's grace so you know the reason this is so important to me a lot of these quotes are brand new or you know I guess they're made new by the Holy Spirit um I've forgotten if I've heard these I've forgotten about them and then when I read over them I think it was last Saturday I read over like oh wow it was just like uh it's like reading the new book again you know it's like wow oh felt fresh it felt brand new I'm like praise God and I was just encouraged because here's a prophet of God here's a man who's filled with the Holy Ghost worldwide Ministry hundreds and hundreds of imitations in just one year you couldn't do all of them how would you approach it and I think it's very simple at the end you'll see how how simple this is but it just gave me encourage you know as we approach the new year you know each year I always write out you know I don't actually I don't think I did last year but each year I always write out all my goals for the year it's neat to see what God inspires us to inspires me to do uh like last couple years you know writing books or or do these series on the videos and preach these different sermon series or maybe pay off some bills and you know to see how God provides but you know as we approach 2024 I want to do that again I want to I want to write down the goals the things I like to see the Lord do in my life and then ask God to give me Grace right to be able to accomplish some of these by the grace of God so Philippians 3:13 and 14 um on numerous uh New Year's Eve services brother random would quote this scripture of course this is a wonderful scripture for helping us to forget what's in the past right and focus on what's forward Hallelujah what's going to happen in the next year or or what are we looking forward to for the future all right so I'll read verse 13 then we can all read 14 Brethren I count count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those which are before let's read this PM three 1 2 three I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen let's have one more word of prayer you have a need on your heart let's make it not to god father God we're small number here tonight Lord I'm still bad with a little sore throat but Lord we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ we're grateful to Worship You Lord thank you for these songs we can sing we're grateful we're not in the hospital or at home sick Lord God we're grateful we can be here tonight so father let your holy spirit guide us anoint us Lord you know how these uh quotes and scriptures Bless My Heart Lord on Saturday as I Was preparing or even throughout last week dear God so father I just pray that inspiration that motivation uh that hope for the future could be Lord uh shared with your people here tonight God use me I'm Your Vessel I'm just your humble servant I just pray God I could get rid of my thoughts and Lord preach your thoughts so Guide Me by the Holy Spirit May each person be benefited by being here as we look to the New Year here in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said am amen God bless you as you being seated I do have some slides here so over there apologize I have a little bit rning nose here I don't like to be sick like that but forgive me by the grace of the Lord today also I don't know if you've seen this uh this morning but I put out a a YouTube video about music I'm working on the series Now Music where I can kind of like lay it down and uh be able to uh clearly Define rock and roll so I put out part today and uh I just use this illustration like with our brothers or sisters you know you'll never see me in a pair of shorts right you know because the Bible says thigh so thigh is nakedness so in the book I put you know even for men or women you know you want to think you want to cover from the shoulder to the shin right but you have this area you know from the thigh down uh you want to stay away from shown the thigh but you know you could technically cover the knee right and still be modest but it's getting kind of close right you're kind of close if you know if a sister would kneel down or something you might might start showing some of your uh your your thighs there so what do we naturally want to do we want to wear you know longer uh longer skirts longer dresses Brothers want to wear longer pair of pants and so I use that illustration with music you know and that's what I want to do on that series I want to show like here's clearly rock and roll right with the th I want to show clear examples of rock and roll like some Brandon Lake songs you know uh some Hill song songs I just want to show clearly this is rock and roll right but then there's this area uh right there's this area where it's not rock and roll you know but if you if you say with the illustration you know the higher you get up I mean the closer you get to sin right and that's how it is you know the louder the drums or we'd say uh the more the more heavy the beat the closer you are getting to rock and roll okay um so that's what I felt like the Holy Spirit dropped in my heart I've been studying on this for months trying to get this out and I finally felt like this week I just kind of felt like a peace of God come over me I was like now I can teach it by God's grace now I can preach it so uh just you know I'm working on that by the grace of the Lord and I got part one out part two I'll be working on uh next few days here uh by God's grace but it it sure is a help to me and I got help there's this one brother and this is how the Lord does it Church you know as I'm as I'm studying on it a brother out of nowhere from South Africa if I'm not mistaken he sends me all these messages they're like 20 minutes long 15 minutes long and he's telling me all these quotes from brother Brandon and it's so helpful and so he helped me with numerous things about music and it was just awesome to see he's like he's like wow I helped out you at the time you needed it and then you helped out me with the time I needed it that's how the body of Christ does it praise God amen amen so that's how I know one way I'm in the will of God you know I pray about things I just wait on it I just wait on it and I look for inspiration from God to finish something or to go forward with something and that's what I think you'll see here tonight as we look at some of these statements from brother Brandon so there's 7 o'clock all right by God's grace so now I could go about an hour and hopefully everybody will be okay Hallelujah hopefully U it's an interesting message to you too um raise your hand does anybody set goals for each year does anybody do that if you raise your hand okay okay nobody maybe a couple well I do except last year I didn't because I just forgot I got so busy um but each of the last few years you know starting I think around 2017 I set a goals I want to here are some things I want to accomplish and uh God is you know God sometimes makes me wait on them God sometimes helped me to get them done um so this year I'm thinking about different things I I like I like to write a book on family and courtship and marriage and husbands and wives uh how they treat one another and everything related to family I like to write a book on that I'm not sure how it's going to go I'm kind of waiting for the leadership of the Holy Spirit on that um that's one goal I'd really like to get done I'd really like to get out of debt you i' got one more debt I'd like to get out of I really would like to get out the debt so that's one thing I want to make for a goal and pray about that uh and maybe a couple more things you know U I got talk to my wife maybe some other things like to maybe fix up or something like that I like to give out uh more books I like to give out more uh cards I like to be a more witness you know a couple years ago brother Brooks and I we went out in a park and we just played and gave we we just played tambourine and we sang you know and we passed out books and cards I like to do more Outreach you know i' like to uh you know do some more witnessing for the glory of God you know brother Ram you know he I got a quote you know I used on that video well Ram said the Pentecostal Church you're getting so big he said he said but you're getting further away from God he said you'd be better off if you were out on a on the street with tin cans and guitars and drums playing on the side of the street the see Church in other words you know it's okay for us to have a building it's okay but if if we lose the sincerity of a Christian it'd be better off if we were out on the street right and we didn't have a nice building a nice warm building like this so we we don't want to get caught up in sin and you know I guess the point of that is I I just want a heart that's hungry for the word of God I want a heart that's hungry to win somebody to Christ to see somebody saved who wants to get somebody saved praise God anybody want to get somebody that can be a goal for the year Lord I just want to I want to bring one person to church this year how about five I want to invite uh 10 people to church this year you know but you just got to make sure it's l of the Holy Spirit praise God right so I think in most cases it's God leading us to want to reach out to other people don't you think that I think that sorry so brother use this verse numerous times as he would U preach right before the new year I know we're a couple weeks in front of that but like I said I was inspired and I want to get everybody thinking towards that uh Direction I may take even some Sunday night services and uh go a little further on this you more more scriptures so the Bible said we should press which means to to run to flee to put to flight to run swiftly in order to catch a thing to run after it also means to pursue so we should press or see seek eagerly press towards the mark okay Mark means the goal so we should run towards a goal that's what Paul says forget things that are behind run towards the goal praise God Amen now I'm sure each of us could say I really wish I didn't do that this year I wish well I really wish I would have done that mistake this year there's a numerous Financial mistakes I've made this year like I broke my lawnmower I broke my van there's a lot of things I wish I could change about this year but I can't all I can do is forget about them and press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus am right and I think M if I would have had that money look what I could have done I could have helped out more people or something but I can't forget I can't dwell on that I got to press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God now the High Calling means a Heavenly invitation this means a a feast how many know there's going to be a marriage supper of the Lamb amen so we should press on we should run towards the goal of making the Rapture right run run towards the goal of of being at the meeting in the air and then also the marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah amen as we looked at a few weeks ago we should we should desire to be in the Millennium there's going to be so many Christians foolish vergins that are not in the Millennium we should live our lives like we're running to be a part of the Millennium amen that's right it's a Heavenly invitation that we're running to that's right out of the Greek Lexicon so this is kind of like the root words of these uh these Greek words remember Church you know the Bible tells us before you anything present yourself as a sacrifice for God amen amen that's why that's what we do when we come a church right you could we could be doing other things you could be working a second job or a third job you know you could be doing other things but here we come here and we We Lay ourselves before God as a sacrifice and you say God teach me uh God burn out any sin Desires in my heart God make me more pure I'm giving myself to you as a sacrifice amen and then we say God change my transform my mind mind that I could know the perfect will of God wouldn't that be a great thing if we go into 2024 and you and you and I do exactly what God wants us to do amen I tell you that'd be a successful year whether you got richer or not right whether you got uh uh more possessions or not it would really really wouldn't matter as long as you did God's perfect will you could be happy praise Goden amen and Jer you know this whole chapter is powerful I forgot remember that Kentucky Revival from earlier this year I forget how long it lasted but this was the chapter that it came out of just so if you want some inspiration maybe go home and read Romans 12 it's just a simple chapter on you know hate evil and love good and poor uh you know be kind to your enemies it's like pouring coales on their heads just all these uh don't be slothful in your work work hard Hallelujah all these great uh lessons just simple application of the Gospel amen I heard a I heard a true story today from this this preacher who's online I was listening to just one of his shorts and he says he knew this lady who was a Christian but she was a a custodian at a big office building okay she's a custodian all she did was change the trash cans right right clean the clean the bathrooms and the boss was walking through there one day CEO and he said you know what he said what's your name she said so and so let's say you know he said you know what he said I hate you that's quite a statement to say and she said why do you hate me what did I do she said he said because every time I look at you either humming or singing or sounds like you're worshiping God or something and she said he said I just hate you because you have so much joy and I have all this turmoil in my life and she said oh you must be misunderstanding this isn't me this is Jesus in me he said why what what do you mean and she said think about it she said she said I I was called by the King of Kings the King of Kings and the Lord of lords gave me a job in this building so I could wash your toilet I could scrub your toilet I could I could clean your bathroom I could sweep and sweep the carpet of your building the King of Kings gave me this job amen and then I don't know if we're repented or not but it was just such a beautiful story it's all about our perspective right right as we head into the new year you know we should work like that we should realize wow the King of Kings set me right here in this position amen amen God opened this door for me right I hope the guy got rid of his hatred I hope he got some love in his heart or some some forgiveness in his heart but he would he just hated this person who was so happy doing this meaningless job and she I try to say it's not meaningless if God placed me here there's nothing better than I can do here praise God Amen but see church we got to be we got to First be convinced that we're doing what God called us to do if we can get a real revelation of what God calls us to do then we can sing and and worship God on the job and some people want to come to church because we're singing on the job who I keep using that testimony from a few years ago I think that's a beautiful testimony that people want to be like you you know people want to know what what what is that person got in their life hallelujah what do they got that I don't got hallelujah amen amen so I just thought i' share that I thought that was a beautiful testimony that Sinners will just hate Christians because Christians have should have such love joy and and victory and worship in their lives all right now I I shared these verses with that gentleman I IAL told you about I met with on Saturday just some simple verses remember this church God's going to instruct you and teach you which way you'll go this year this coming year amen forget the past year if you made any mistakes God if you ask God God will show you which way to go go this year amen and he'll guide you with his allseeing eye your steps are ordered of God you also have that confidence even though you know last no matter what happened this year You Got Confidence God allowed you to Walk This Way amen right because God orders your steps you you should have learned something from 2023 praise God I should have learned something from 2023 about my steps right and if we walked in God's step then we made God delighted in his heart hallelujah praise God let's not forget that church when you obey God it makes God delighted amen it makes God happy praise God Amen that's right so teach us to number our days so we also got to remember though I'm 43 you know if I got 40 years left praise God hopefully I got more than that brother only lived to 56 right right 56 I'm 43 right so 13 more years if I was if I lived as much as brother brand I got I would have 13 years left that's not a lot of time right you know I I also remember there's a student at our school she has uh cystic fibrosis I think it is and she she only lives to they only live to 30 years old I thought this sweet little seveny old girl she's only got 23 years left it's heartbreaking but you know in those years God wants to redeem those years either heal her or make her a light or a witness with those 23 years left that she has think about that just for a moment is this true or not this is true God's teaching us all to number our days amen so we would do what we would apply our hearts to wisdom we would choose the right path and not waste time amen amen and I love this one too how am I going to find the PATH brother the word of God is a lamp unto your feet hallelujah amen amen we' been going out this the chicken coop the last few nights you know what do we always need a flashlight so I get my phone on turn on the flashlight see we got to have a light we got and in these dark hours we got to have a light and you come to the right place it's the word of God hallelujah am the word of God will light up your path whenever it seems dark look to the word of God it'll light up your path it'll show you which way you're going and then you can be delighted in the way God has chosen for you amen and he'll instruct you he'll show you this is the way you need to go Hallelujah remember God rewards diligent Seekers so sometimes you know we're sometimes not every time but sometimes we're not getting the reward of God because we're not seeking God enough amen right right there are certain things where we have to seek God and then God rewards us the Bible say it's like digging for gold right or digging for diamonds anybody that studies the uh those occupations you don't get gold or silver or diamonds every time you go mining right you got to work at it you got to put some time into it right you got to get got to get dirty right and that's what the Bible says if you seek for silver if you seek for gold uh the word of God As for that you will find it hallelujah amen amen and God rewards diligent Seekers without faith it's impossible to please him free that cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so let let's take that attitude as we close out this year I I'm going to seek God and God's going to reward me now I don't he didn't promise how he'd reward us but he said he'd reward us right amen with the answers to our questions right right if we're asking for wisdom he'll reward us with the wisdom amen well we got to be diligent diligent means to Crave to search out Hallelujah to carefully search after hallelujah amen amen now brother Samuel just preached on decisions remember the second evening service he talked about Esther making decisions each person had to make decisions your free moral agency decisions to be diligent that's what makes you an overcomer when you choose to overcome you make the decision Amen brother said there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready oh isn't that awesome praise God you got the material on Earth to make yourself ready praise God amen amen oh my I want to I want to sit at that wedding supper praise God Amen I want to hear Jesus say Well done good and faithful servant hallelujah amen but said we'll weep and cry we'll we'll reach across the table shake hands with one another weep and cry because we made it through the test of life and now we're being rewarded for our efforts praise God Amen oh Hallelujah but we have it on this Earth everything we need to make it we've already got it hallelujah amen amen and then brother says so many people say well the Lord will take this evil spirit from me the drinking gambling lying stealing I'll serve him brother said but that's up to you right see you got something to do too they that overcome shall inherit all things they they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she's made herself ready I like that word G church that's why we come here let's be reminded some things we can just lay down we don't have to hold on to right amen we don't have to hold on to them right just got to lay them down you see God cannot push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other end and say wow blessed is he that overcomes he had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself and doing that we show our faith and respect toward God hallelujah amen that's what I like to do this year I I like to show God lord you have revealed this word to me now let me act based upon what you've shown me Amen in other words let me show what I've learned Amen Hallelujah Lord please don't let it be you just got to push me through this coming year and I just got to make it through the year but help me Lord to take what I've heard help me to take what I've heard brother random say or other preachers help me to apply that to my life so I'll diligently seek you and then I'll see your reward my life amen amen glory I like that remember David was better at obeying God than Saul was that's why God got rid of Saul he wasn't as good as obeying as David was so David was more diligent about keeping God's word remember uh Samuel told Saul he says the Lord had taken the Kingdom of Israel from you Saul this day and give it to a neighbor of thine that's better than that that's why there's a wise and foolish virgin the wise are are better at obeying the wise are more diligent amen right the wise are more diligent I'm still waiting you know I was I was talking to brother uh irin down there last time in Junction City and I said brother you're a farmer and I was real nice about it that I said can you explain to me what Jesus said what is a H hundredfold versus a 60-fold versus a 40-fold or 30-fold remember Jesus said that right you you know in other words our lives are going to produce a certain amount of fruit how do you get that hundredfold and he said he didn't know but his guess was you got the right conditions you got the right seed right and everything just everything works up he say sometimes I'll get a bushel and I'm sorry he said sometimes I'll get like 20 bushels an acre I don't understand that but 20 bushels of wheat in acre he said some years I'll get 60 per acre in other words that that wheat will produce prod a lot more wheat in the same amount of space praise God Amen what was it was the right condition the right seed the right timing and it was good seed amen Well church let's apply that to our lives this coming year let's make sure the ground is tilled hallelujah let's make sure the the ground is weeded out hallelujah amen amen and let's feed the let's feed that seed with the word of God and let's lay in the presence of the Sun and let's let God give us a nice increase of a year Hallelujah amen I know for sure in this one area of my life with video making I put out way more videos this year than the last year so I'm I might have had a 30-fold increase sister who brother M I might had a 30-fold increase I don't hopefully it was 100-fold you know but whatever God's called you to do invest in that right invest in it and see if God won't won't uh expand it by God's grace amen fact I think I got a an email about that that just kind of reminded me I forgot about that oh yeah so just this is just this a cardinal example but it is a spiritual thing so there was 447 new subscribers uh there was almost 86,000 views on my channel this year there was uh over there's 3,333 shares I think that's neat 3333 just a few statistics there the top video of the year was thus sayith the Lord future Prophecies of William brandom it was watched for over 596 hours can you imagine that people around the world almost spent 600 hours watching that video Hallelujah that's encouraging to me right because they could have been watching anything right I could have been watching uh Mr Beast whoever you know right but I'm just sharing that as an example let's make sure our heart heart is cleaned out let's get the right seed I know one seed that will never fail us right here praise God I know one seed that will never be uh disformed or deformed it's the word of God hallelujah amen I know one seed that's got perfect genetics that's God's word hallelujah amen now I like this statement brother B I'm not going to read this because it's when Jesus was tempted but Jesus overcame by the word he said the only way you can be an overcomer and the only way you can know you're overcoming is I'm sorry know your Overcomer is because the word Can't Fail amen amen so as we approach this year let's think about what can I overcome this year and then like brother says it doesn't really matter what you have to overcome what matters is how you overcome right and you overcome by believing God's word amen oh amen hallelujah so let's remember let's give all diligence the Bible says with keep your heart with all diligence I think children we read that one on Sunday night right amen so do everything in your power not to give your heart away to someone right too early or do everything in your power not to be tempted by any Idol right just give it every every ounce of your strength to keep your heart pure before God because out of it are the issues of Life Peter says give all diligence and add all this all all these char traits of Christ add them to yourself give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall hallelujah amen so see the word of God is given to us uh the the Holy Spirit comes to anoint us so we will do the word of God and so we will not fall amen that's how that's why the Holy Spirit sent to us so we'll overcome and will not fall praise Goden diligent so remember having the craving the earnestness the carefulness the speed the haste so an urgency so you must give all urgency and add the word of God to your nature to your character like I'll just say you know in the last few years I've really seen Malachi mature not that you I mean you were just naturally more immature when you're younger right same thing with AA I was telling you in Cas you're reading the church age book like that's just a natural thing I've really seen them really mature like I'll just using Mal one example you know I used to ask him to do things and maybe he didn't want to do it right away but now I can ask him to do something he just does it amen I'm really proud of them same thing with all my girls back there but I you know just the last few years I've just been wow I can see that they have an urgency to want to obey me right that's wonderful now how about all of us with the Lord Jesus Hallelujah that's that's where I want to I want to get better praise God I want to have a better year where I'm more obedient to the holy spirit amen amen I want to be able to hear his voice and be inspired as brother Samuel preach that prophets move by inspiration I want to be able to move by inspiration to the holy spirit amen hallelujah but that's this idea give all your diligence be urgent to obey the word of God and then you know the greatest commandment is love God with all your heart soul mind but also your strength like I told you I'm glad brother Samuel can say wow brother Jesse has lots of energy I hope that continues praise God I don't want to I don't want to run out of energy right but I but I think that's a good testimony I for myself I want to give all my strength to God Amen right there's so many other things I can give it to but I want to give all my strength to God and and the family of God and my personal family praise God amen amen and that's the that's the first commandment so the first thing God wants us to do is love him with everything we got hallelujah amen how can I show my love to God more what can I do to love God more right that's what I want to do remember brother R says first find the will of God for your life so we're thinking about you know going into 2024 I'm going to preach a little bit about some goals brother Ram talks about but before you set any goal first make sure it's God's will for you to do it amen okay so I'm going to skip through some of these this is a very famous uh review um so you I should this this is not the one I was actually going to do this was the one I was going to do brother R said uh there's five musts that you have you know before you do something for God it must be the time and season for you to do it right it must be his word for you to do it amen so like a sister wouldn't preach right because it's not his word right like a brother wouldn't stay at home and watch the kids so his wife can go work because that's not the word of God it must be God's person you must be the person do it and of course these are know more spiritual for Israel or you know for us we can look to brother brandom you know does brother bram's Bible teaching does that give me the right to do it right okay now remember David I'm not I'm not going to go through these quotes because I want to watch the time remember David messed up on three of these remember this when he brought the ark the first time it was the right time and season because just three months later he did everything the same except he just put the cart on the should I'm sorry just put the Ark on the shoulders now it was the right time and season now what he did he missed the word of God because he built a cart like the Philistines but it should have been on the shoulders he had the right person David was the right person to bring the ark back to Israel but see he didn't consult a prophet nor did he uh seek out the Vindicated Prophet all right so before you make a goal you know for 2024 let's remember we must do it according to the will of God first and then as I I shared that this was when I wrote my book you know really church we only got five areas we got to look after so in your life you've only got really five uh countries you got to possess or can I State can I say it like that states in your in your country you only got to possess five areas of your life right and how do you do it brother said footsteps are possession amen amen in other words one step at a time brother amen my sister one step at a time so maybe this God's going to help you with the relationships now God did that for aelina they really solidified that relationship with marriage that's a really good thing but now they got to possess all that land they got to learn to love and learn to forgive and learn to be patient and all those great things right but they made a great step they possessed a lot of good land in that in that in this year Hallelujah now Ministries those are like uh uh the Ministries like the the Bible said there there's helps as a Ministry helping out I know who has been a good help in the church you know helping out sweeping and buying things for the church you know just different Ministries that you do maybe it's helping out the poor right that should be alms prayers fastings right especially Ms ministering to other people amen right you don't got to possess all the land this year but how about taking some steps this year who wants to take some steps in the land amen I want to I want to possess the land praise God Amen now your vocation right where God's got you working now for me it's pretty stable but let's say something happened and I lost my job I really I really need to possess the land there I really need God to show me or if if if you're work is not the best situation then it's time maybe God's pray asking you to pray and seek his face and maybe that'll be this be a new year on a new job like remember Sister who gave that great testimony about how the insurance really helped out this year that was this year year wasn't this year what a what a wonderful move of God and I remember when she come up prayer asking for uh the leadership on the new job I remember when she come up for prayer for that so see God God opened the door where you could possess some of that Land This Year sister and you know God helping brother amen there that new new machine that's it's possessing more land because now he can influence other people he's on a different machine different job right how God guided you sisters to that department now you can influence other people you're possessing the land hallelujah amen amen right get the nine gifts of the holy spirit or for me with preaching you know I got to possess that I can't get lazy in that I can't lose Brown and uh be a a I don't want to be a confused preacher I don't know exactly what God's called me to preach hallelujah righten or location is God calling you to move to a new apartment a new house a new city a new state God might have you Poss possess some of these things but the first thing to do above all that church is find out what the will of God is amen okay now I'm going to try to move here I a lot of things I a lot of this is review I know now here I want to bring some quotes maybe these will be new for you brother R says shape your life by self-control in other words in all these areas of her life be controlled don't rush into them without praying make sure you pray before you go into these situations am make sure you pray brother R says may we shape Our Lives by self-control doesn't the bible say that be temperate in all things have self-control in every area right like an easy one to see is with relationships okay uh a man or woman will want to rush into relationship like we had a brother who used to come to church he don't come anymore but he tried to rush into some relationships I said you you're not you shouldn't do that he tried to get on a dating app and date people I said don't do that not you're ready to get married you're just going to get tempted to lust and all these things don't do that right see each area you got to possess that that area by self-control by not letting the flesh make the decision but let God make the decision am amen may may we know by the help of the Holy Spirit to have full confidence that Jesus will say Well done my good and faithful servant at that day amen so this we get this idea shape your lives by Temperance shape your lives by dying daily shape your life by taking up your cross and following Christ amen said I don't know whether I'll live to see that day or not don't don't know whether God will permit it the Rapture but there's one thing I do have I have this hope that someday I'll hear him say it was well done good and faithful servant that's what I live for to see that day to hear that voice it was well done you've done the best you could how many Want Jesus say that amen amen Lydia you did the best you could I'm trying to use other people you know Caris you did the best you could that's what I work for that's what I worked and labor in love for my Lord Jesus hallah that's what I'm working for that's what I'm laboring for my Lord Jesus amen that my life is for you Lord Brother R said if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word of God so if there's any question am I going to please God go back to the word of God and do exactly what the word of God says amen amen if a man wonders if he'll hear those words will Jesus tell me Well Done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and ass surely he will hear those words of Praise Is that awesome Jesus is going to praise His Wife well don't you if you're married don't you praise your husband thank you hubby now you probably don't call him hubby but thank you Husband you did this so well or darling like my darling you cooked a delicious lasagna meal the other night that was so wonderful you're the best cook in the country see it's praise you're just praising that person well one day Jesus is going to praise us hallelujah amen you were faithful you kept to the word of God you kept all the idols out of your heart you possessed every area of your life hallelujah amen you possess the SP spiritual land that I gave you by faith you never gave up you used diligence you tried your best well done hallelujah it was well done says if you're not sure just look in the mirror of God's word just look in the word does my life match the mirror that's why I've been preaching on the book of Acts I want our church to match the book of Acts in other words if there's poor people don't have food I'm going to give them food right if there's people that need to be deacons I going to make them Deon deons right if there's whatever whatever it is I want our church to match the book of Acts if somebody's sick I want them to be healed praise God Amen Hallelujah this is the same idea he's talking about he wants to hear Jesus a good and faithful servant he said you were faithful you stood at the post of Duty you didn't Sher it you told the truth regardless of what it took you told the truth may God help us to tell the truth to our friends friends and family members am our co-workers tell them the truth it's well done now that's what I'm looking for not for a better car although it might be time for you to upgrade right better position although you might need a better position I want him ever what anybody else else says about you that don't matter how many Want Jesus the most important thing we can have in the next coming year is having Jesus amen doing what he asked us to do being faithful now Mal's got a big decision he's going to have to choose a college or stay at home or start he's got a big decision you know what he needs more than anything he needs Jesus God LED Lydia she's loving it where God's led her aren't you glad you didn't go off to college but she could have she could have been like these other women well my dad's kept me down all these years I want to be a free independent woman now we can ever see her doing that but some message women do that so do some message Brothers right instead of finding God's will what does God want Heen hallelujah what is God have we sought God for what we should do amen this guy's got some prayer time right here so you have to make some prayer time here by God's grace couple years coming down to now with mine God just made it so clear I either went and got the workforce or I took a full scholarship to play football at AC it was a no-brainer right I'm poor I can't afford college or get a free education that's a no and now look God has me a pastor here all right so it all works out you know even if I wasn't even serving God so in other words God orders all your steps praise God Amen just be faithful just be faithful in the little things and God will make you ruler over many things hallelujah amen exactly right we want Christ for this coming year amen how many will Pro now look at this this is so beautiful what have said how many will promise me when I leave this building brother R I'm going to go to some secret place and I'm going to rededicate my life for I hear the Cry of those that are out there he's talking about saving souls and I want God at that day to take me up before him and say it's well done my good and faithful servant Hallelujah that is something special amen my goodness what if I asked each one of you who wants to rededicate their lives and you don't have to raise your hand now what if I said now how many going to go home and make sure you pray about that in your prayer closet that's sincere that's sinere here hallelujah I just love that how brother he's given him a goal what's your goal what are you aiming for remember the beginning we're supposed to press towards the goal right what's the goal the High Calling The Heavenly invitation amen amen be ready for the Rapture praise God set your heart on Christ and do what Christ has called us to do praise God amen Amen brother said do a good job with your talent right some of you got real good talent with your job that you currently do right you got real good talent people know wow they're really good at this or wow they do a great job they're better than other people well brother said do a good job with your talent brother said you want to come into heaven and just by the skin of your teeth like like lot where the Bible said he'll have no reward just eternal life that's his only you don't have no reward don't raise your hand but none of us want to get to Heaven by let's get them our teeth right right would you just want to come before the father and the talent that he's given to every one of you as being negligent you just didn't want to use it or let something else stand in your way see we don't want to be negligent we don't want to neglect our gifts we don't want to neglect our talents he said you we shouldn't let little petty things that meant nothing to all little fusses and stews and arguments Church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you want to stand before the father like that I don't believe you would I don't believe that you would do it neither would I how I want him to say it was well done not by the skin of my teeth but it was well done my good and faithful servant maybe you're a housewife if you are God made you a teacher of your children do a good job at it regardless of what you have to do do it welll how many want to do your job well this next coming year praise God I do like at my job I just got teacher of the year right so people are coming up saying great job gab you're the teacher of the year last year I got my principal came in and he grades me and I got the highest grade as a teacher so I feel good about that it just encourage me I'm doing the best I can I'm doing I'm trying to do a good job at it right now if I was getting bad grades I start to wonder well Lord am I am I being faithful or am I what's wrong right I should be doing the best I can do when your boss watches you when you whatever you're doing you want to do the best job at it that you can because it brings glory to God like that story of the of the of the custodian she didn't see her job as oh I got to clean toilets or I got to take out the trash she saw as God has me here to minister to other people amen the King of Kings chose this spot for me and I'll be happy with it amen hallelujah the king of kings hallelujah oh yeah I like this brother says oh your son his whole thoughts is upon you brother says like a tutor the holy spirit will report to the heavenly father of course it's the same Spirit but brother is's giving a he's giving a a analogy in 1956 he says all he's trying to do is please you he's so interested in your Affair till it's hard to hold him down how many a year like that praise God you're so in tunee with wanting to serve God it's hard to hold him down cuz you just want to do something for the Lord amen that's beautiful that's beautiful I'd rather just be a little overzealous about the father's Kingdom than to have no Zeal at all for it I'd rather overwork now see we don't have to overwork though we can find the sweet balance right like Jesus Jesus would do all the prayer meetings but then the Bible said he would go out and rest himself right he' go out alone and have some alone time so don't forget that no matter how hard you work make sure you take a little vacation right amen said he want to get away it's only the second time he's gotten away this year I said good brother you need to get away you got to refresh your batteries amen you're going to wear yourself out Jesus did it right uh Solomon did it with his wife there's times a couple needs to to leave the busyness of their life and just go get away and forget about all the cares of life and just enjoy being married amen sorry he said a Church of Christ preacher said Mr brandom I'd rather wear out than rust out and that's a lot of Truth i' rather wear out and die in the harness as brother Neville says than refuse to have any harness on right now I'm not telling you to overwork but I'm just saying this is the attitude brother Brandon took it's better to be a little more zealous than to be neglectful right now here's a quote I remember so this one was brand new to me I I don't know if I read this before brother said I was thinking of a story sometime up in the Northwoods I think I said Alabama on Sunday wasn't Alabama's Northwoods there's a boy he's about 25 years old he's just kind of a floater we called them he's a gentleman not a fugitive or Renegade he's a gentleman but just a guy that likes to float around no place to go nothing to do that's a horrible way to take a life I gave this his man his dinner sometime he was a bum I said when did you start this he said about 20 years ago I said where are you going he said nowhere I said then where did you come from he said nowhere I said how long do you expect to keep this up he said I don't know I don't know nowhere no idea about nothing no Ambitions why the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person in the world Amen in other words where where you going I know exactly my goal for this year where where did you come from I come from the mind of Christ I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world amen amen I know where I come from I know where I'm going praise God Amen see this is these quotes speak to me and they make me want to pray more so I can have a goal for this coming year what does the Lord want me to accomplish for this year I don't want to just float around from there float around and let just you know go with the cares of life and just I'm just trying to make I'll just see where it goes we should know where God's going to take us right to some degree we should have some idea what God wants us to do amen I church I've been preaching here 17 years I had the same old desk all these scuffs are probably my punches right there you know they're just made with my ring you know scuff it up I should have an idea about where God wants to Lead Me amen amen right and so this year where we Le where God lead us a lot of on Dancing this year right and God even Vindicated with brother Jim coming to preach on Dancing he let a 68y old man preach about dancing amen hallelujah see we should have an idea where we're going now I'm now I'm in the book of Acts praise God right and Book of Romans we should have an idea where we're going we're Where's God calling us to go we should be ambitious he said we should be up and add up and I'm up and I'm ready I'm eager I'm diligent I want to do what God's called me to do I know what God's called me to do amen amen listen Church you don't find a lot of people that know what God's called them to do you don't find many people right right and if you want other ideas let me know I'm in contact with this other man he's not a message believer but he has lots of friends in akan that their Ministry is to help uh people get off drug addiction and make them food and reestablish them you know some of them were like uh I don't know how to say it uh kind of like prostitutes you know just awful lives and my friend has numerous friends they they they purposely bought homes in akan they fix them up and then they invite these people that were on drugs and they invite them in and Rehab them and get them reestablished in life if you feel that's your ministry that's a Ministry that that's a real ministry that's helping people the Bible calls it helps right let me know I mean there's what is God calling you to do I don't know but each one of us should know what God's called us to do amen Amen brother R said they asked brother how do I know what gift I have brother Ram said because you can do it you can be up and at it right that's what you can do so if you can be a servant if you can have compassion on people that other people couldn't have compassion on then that might be your calling right you want to find God's will for your life but you want to be ambitious the only way you can be ambitious is to know what God's called you to do if not there's going to be questions right if I was wondering if God called me to do something I can't be ambitious because I'm I'm not sure if I should do it so that's why I said first find God's will then you can be very ambitious with it praise God Amen like Malachi can be very ambitious he needs to play more songs Casey you can be very ambitious God wants you to sing more songs because we can all see the gift right Haven God wants you to write more songs Hallelujah Caris God want you to sing more you Hallelujah L God wants you to write some more stories you know you can clearly see that what can you do what has God given you talent to do and then you do it with all your heart amen now brother says why do Christians want to frustrate themselves he says many times they come to me in confessions on private interview they confess all their you know adulteries uh they can't deny it the holy spirit's right there they try to cover it up it brings it out right then they must they might as well just tell it try to get it out the Holy Spirit stops and says just a minute here's a certain certain thing so when they come they begin to tell me about the little things of the world and I notice that among Believers you're going somewhere what you drifting for get some ambition about you set your goal on Christ and quit Italian with the world see these people are drifting from relationship to relationship now that doesn't impact us but what what does impact us is that we don't want to drift not knowing what to do this year right what does God want me to do I don't know what did God want me to do last year I don't know what does God want me to do in 10 years I don't know at some point we want to know praise God right like I told you that brother Randy SC he was a pastor for over 40 years but then he knew God had called him to go do missionary work and he say he preached at cams a few months ago he he got back it was in Europe and he said he preached this he he said God put it on his heart to preach this he said to answer the question of 40 preachers think about that preaching one service and and feeling led to leave the pastorship behind leave the church behind I'm no longer a pastor I'm going to go be a a teacher and a evangelist and then he answers all these questions of 40 preachers to me that's just a great that's a a great testimony of he knew what to do because he waited on God until God showed him what to do in other words he left being a pastor at just the right time and it was just the right season oh my Hallelujah set your goal on Christ amen and let's get our eyes completely off the world let's look to Christ amen he said but once you know the goal you got to persevere now persevere means to continue in a course despite or course of action despite difficulty Hallelujah so see then you know you get to the spot you can know what God wants you to do but then it becomes difficult well God's just giving you a test he wants you to persevere right he just wants you to press through and be an overcomer brother I preaching this Ser sermon many times perseverance he said every person on Earth that's ever been on Earth that has ever achieved anything that amount to anything had to be perseverant right you got to be sure first what you got your faith anchored on now go back to my book uh that the last book I put out two and a half years I put in that book I had to be pers think about that have you ever worked on a letter for two and a half years how about a report for your college class anybody ever wrote a a paper that took you two and a half years to write it was not easy I had to persevere as many times I felt like I don't want to have to I don't know how I can do this I don't want to finish this I'd rather do something else right I had to persevere it got difficult but if you're ever going to achieve anything you have to persevere until you accomplish it praise God and guess what that was my that was my goal for three years in a row write the book finish the book finally finish the book finally I you know I talked about it so much I got tired of talking about it I would tell you at Saints well well someday it's going to come out you know I talked about it for two and a half years almost three years now so here's I think this is where I want to go yeah and good I got about 10 minutes so here let me look at a few quotes I kind of want to get down that one yeah but let's see can go okay you've been a great audience here thank you for your patience church I know you love me you're so patient with me I love you too God's grace now look this is December 27th right before the new year this is the year before he preached the church ages he says this is going to be a great week for me now notice a great week I've got to make decisions for the coming year of all the invitations isn't that something all the places he was going to go he had to decided in one week I want go to the office and pick up all my invitations bring them home and therefore for the next few days I go to prayer to God and pray for him to guide me and show me which way to go and what to do we don't live in a time like it was back then where God LED them from place to place it's a different system he says and the way I do it now listen please here's the way you do it I put them in separate piles so he'll have a California pile how about an Arizona pile or a l pile or a Liberty Center pile or an acon pile he said I put them in separate piles I let them lay so here's all my here's all my uh needs about this here's all my needs about this here's all these things and I take to walking and praying is that something I'm going to go for a walk brother what are we going to do we're going to go walking it don't matter I'm just going to pray while I'm walking sound like a good plan right what brother brand do well pray but I'd also go walking and pray while I'm walking Lord I have these 20 invitations from California which one do I take Lord God isn't that isn't that beautiful he's just going for a walk to talk to Jesus I must tell Jesus all my troubles now these aren't troubles but these are invitations I don't know which way to go so I just want to go talk over with Jesus and I only got one week to decide for the next 52 weeks think about that I got one week to decide on 52 weeks that's not a lot of time I better be walking with the Lord right we better be walking with Jesus right right he says I do that he said oh and I maybe I get in my car and I'm gone a day or two I come back praying so he just drives maybe he'll go pray in his his cave right he had a cave where he pray there's a nice video on that I just try to get away and pray something comes on my heart to go to a certain place that I see if it's just an impression and afterwards if it's impressing me so hard I go to the pile and I pick up that letter and read it to see where it's at then from there so see he just spends time in prayer Waiting for God to inspire something here's the reason I do that he says you think of writing about 72 hours on a plane the storms up and down around if you ever rode overseas don't know sometimes whether you're up sometimes down swinging rocking pitching through the clouds he says the first thing Satan meets you and says well the minister will group said this some that div divide on the boat and so forth then you might be able to say well maybe the Lord didn't want me to come but when you're set from God you're ready to meet the enemy amen how many want to be ready to meet the enemy this coming year praise God amen amen in other words I know I prayed about this before I did this that way I can meet the enemy I don't have to worry am I in the will of God or not I know I'm in the will of God amen amen because I waited on God I prayed about it I I gave God a week think about that I gave God a week to show me if I was right or wrong church you can do that too I remember before I proposed a Christen I remember this before I proposed a Christan we had a spring break over at the at aranu and I asked my pastor there at the chapel I said do you think it'd be a good idea for me to just take this week and pray and see if I should propose a Christan he said that's a great idea aren't you glad I did but I took that week and I just read my I lifted weights we had to lift weights I lift all these weights but during that week I just spent my time in prayer Bible reading listening to sermons I didn't know the message yet and by the end of that week I was sure I wanted to marry her I don't know if she remembers that or not the pastor's name was Brian kler if she if she's listening now honey I'll look for a text after service but I just took a week I said I really want to know and God led me in the right right direction praise God but ra said I want to step here in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus and I'm going to stay here until God's work is accomplished amen he said and then now look what he said then he asked for prayer you pray for me because I have all these piles and I got to know which ones I'm going to do this year I need your prayers so not only did he pray he asked for the prayers of the Saints aren't you glad when people pray for you then they know you're praying for you what a blessing now remember brother Ram tells us if we just try to wa I'm going to make a New Year's resolution I want to lose weight or I want to gain weight I'd actually like to gain some weight this year my wife says I'm too skinny remember brother Johnny told me that a few years ago he's like bro you need to eat more food like I probably do actually he says some people say well you should live a better life turn a new page this is New Year's oh how many resolutions did you make and you all broke and you broke all of them it'll never work to make a resolution it's a dying out and a rebirth a regeneration a new creature in Jesus Christ amen so it's not it's not Lord I want to make a resolution it's Lord let me die out so you can be alive in me praise God Amen not like I want to think I want to do this or I think I want to do that let's not do that let's do Lord what do you want me to do amen I'm going to make some videos on this Lord willing for the YouTube Ministry so people can see this is what brother brandham did like you shouldn't just dri through the years and say I wonder how many more years of the Rapture let's not waste time let's use this time wisely praise God right like brother said if you can just get one Soul saved let's get a soul saved this year amen he says you go up and write a resolution tonight wife I'll give the promise I'll turn a new page I'll never drink no more he said then by the next morning you he said you're drinking he says you just turn a new page and turn it back the next day of course that's talking about Sin he says everybody's got a vow wrote out and a pledge you're going to try to make for the new year then about the day after tomorrow they're all broke so you know you turn a new page every year and then turn back the next morning did it again and I love this look what he says he quotes the scripture Paul said forgetting those things in the past all the mistakes and all the things that I've done I pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Christ that's the only regrets I have is my heirs for the past year and I humbly ask him for Grace to press on toward the mark of the High Calling he says I'm sure we'd all feel that way how many feel that way praise God Amen the only regret is I made some mistakes this year but I'm going to rejoice in the blessings of last year but this year I'm going to press toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I'll preach more on habits Lord Lord win brother man said bad habits are evil spirits right we're we're fighting we're struggling we're trying to overcome evil spirits so you want to have the right habits you want to have Godly habits right all right and I want to uh let me close with this last one here I I'll get to these later here yeah this what I mentioned on Sunday he said Billy right now is working on overseas for a complete World Tour beginning right immediately after Christmas he said then in January I want to do a complete World Tour he said we're working on that now finding just where the Lord will lead I'm so grateful ever to the people the ministers and he says much as I say against their denominations and things like that you know on the books laying right there back now brother Roy borders takes care of the invitations since Christmas the first year there's been over a thousand invitations Around the World Imagine That so again like I said who's got a thousand uh emails they need to answer on their phone I'm going to look at that red bubble after church on your phones I'm going to try to peek and look at your phone it's kind of like it is you got 1,000 to-dos on your to-do list right a thousand invitations so the Lord just has to direct me on which one of those to go to and what to do we just depend on him you couldn't take them all so Church don't feel discouraged if you got a big to-do list or there's lots of things on your heart you can't do everything God's not asking you to do everything but God wants you to do something there's something God wants each one of us to do in this coming year and so we need to do like brother brandham we need to pray about it we need to wait on the Lord about it he says so we're just laying them out before the Lord and saying now you tell us heavenly father and you help me pray with this manner you help me pray that we can get this over I'm going to read this one to you because you might be surprised you might be shocked on this quote okay so get your inhalers ready if you got asthma get your inhalers ready praise God he says brother argb never runs out of things to do for the Lord Jesus don't you like that he doesn't do them grudgingly he just freely goes out and does them I couldn't have ever taken trips overseas if it hadn't been for his help and he's got a burden on his heart when he gets a burn for some Nation here he will come I'll see his car drivve in the yard you know me and my wife will say well here we go overseas again don't we so brother arganbright with the burden on his heart I never forget you remember Mike chister who comes up he came here a few weeks ago remember he played that uh flute you remember him years ago years ago it's probably 2010 he came to me and said brother Jesse will you go with me to Main the state of Maine like he was real looking at me like and I'm like uh let me pray about it so I prayed about it and I felt led to go and it was hard cuz I had to leave little little Mali little Lydia they were really little and we flew to to Boston he lost his luggage but then we prayed an hour later he found it literally he did a dance like this he said praise God praise God I found my luggage in front of everybody I was like praise God that's what I knew this man had the Holy Ghost he's like glory to God hallah brother Jess I love that guy he's a real Christian there's my hour anyways we weren't done yet that little town that little state of Maine was it was another plane ride we got this little tiny plane and I thought we were going to die the lightning was going the plane was shaking I thought I was going to die there's I'm not really a good flyer anyways we landed we went to this real small Church in this tiny little town I prayed and fasted I preached a couple services on the last one you know just a couple people come up for prayer but on the last service I was in the office finish up in walks the pastor sister she's got to be 55 or 60 and she starts crying she said brother Jesse thank you for coming this weekend she said I will never be the same Hallelujah and it wasn't my leading it wasn't my idea to go there it was brother Mike Mike basically come to my church and said I got a burden on my heart will you go I didn't really feel like going oh and then uh and then uh he spent all his money he had no money left and then somebody at the meeting come up and give me the certain amount of money and it's just for me right they didn't say give it but I was like you know what I want to give some of that to brother Mike and the I gave him above and beyond the cost for his ticket and he's like brother Jesse this is so amazing I was out of money I could not afford this and God paid me back I said God will always pay you back hallelujah amen amen that's just one example where this guy was led of the Lord to do that so I just followed his leading because I could tell he was led of the Lord this is a little out of ordinary I could tell this is Led of the Lord and it leads to what change lives that's what we want we never want to be we always want to be different right God make us more like you praise God now look brother said he's such a goodly or Godly little person even I have no leading yet yet I'll go with him because I know God leads him brother Jesse don't you can't say brother brandom never had the leading or brother R didn't always know the leading of the Lord that's exactly what brother brandom said I'm just saying what the tapes say brother Bram didn't always have the leading of the Lord so sometimes he had to go with somebody else El is leading of the Lord but you got to have you got to follow somebody who you have confidence in that they follow the leading of the Lord see that's why I got confidence in brother Mike when I see brother Mike here I'm like he's probably led here by the holy spirit because I've seen it work before he was led of the Holy Spirit to do that ain't easy to leave family ain't easy to fly we had to push through all the lost luggage but we got a good Holy Ghost Dance out of that Hallelujah and then right before this is the last one I'll read musician can come here musician let's stand last one and church even there's times you don't have a leading but you still want to do something for God I'll try to explain brother R's out in Arizona remember he said this was the hardest time of his life because nobody invited him to preach in Arizona he moves out there and none of the preachers will let him come preach the prophet of God and they're all afraid he's going to start a church and pull all their church members away he didn't do that he didn't go out there for that he said I'll leave it ler Pastor will read it to you where we we're to meet at if the Lord willing that is the Lord willing I have no leading for them all these invitations just simply going out to try to do whatever I can okay so he's out in Arizona he says I have no lead eating but I'm just going out doing whatever I can so this coming year if we got to the spot where we feel like I don't know what God's leading me to do well let's at least do something until God shows us what to do remember Church what was the what was the worst thing with the parable of talents what was the worst thing it was bearing talent in the ground right that's the worst thing we can do is do nothing and what did Jesus say he said you Wicked and slothful servant he said you should at least put my money in with the bankers you I could have got some interest on that the worst thing we can do is do nothing now don't don't get me wrong if you're in a if you have family and friends serving them is definitely that's definitely God's will for your life that's definitely part of it I want you to see that here sometimes brother Ram knew exactly what God called him to do other times he followed the leading of somebody else that he knew was led of the Lord and other times he had no leading and he was just doing something Hallelujah is anybody encouraged tonight by God's grace all right couple all right let's bow our heads amen glad to hear that this really encouraged me so that's why I thought I'd preach it to you if it blessed me I thought it would bless the church let's bow our heads father God
