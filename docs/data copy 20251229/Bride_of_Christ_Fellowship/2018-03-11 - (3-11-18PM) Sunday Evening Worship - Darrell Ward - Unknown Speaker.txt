forward to this and so enjoyed this morning's message what a wonderful powerful message we're so grateful I just felt different leaving this place this morning so I'm very thankful for that that's why I went the Word of God to do to me every time praise the Lord changed my life more and more amen can't you see the bride Elijah it's just about hold I see the bride standing at the door this world is the will I'm ready for deliverance Lord in this all before amen praise the Lord there's something about going home amen you know the thing about going to heaven when we go to heaven we're not going to a place we've never in we're just going back home you know the Lord allows me to travel a little bit and been to a lot of places and met a lot of wonderful people but there's always something about the night before when it's time to go home you know you there's the many a sleepless night that thank you brother many sleepless night that afraid oversleep missed the plane you know inside you get up every two hours make sure you've not overslept and time you get on the plane you're about dead but you're going home you know and but the most wonderful thing about this trip home we don't have to worry about being late we'll be right on time amen amen and the thing you know we are we are consuming the vitamins for a body change a man and you know like Enoch walked with God and he was not because God took him and you know you think of all the times that Enoch walked with God I wonder what they talked about whatever it was they talked about it gave Enoch enough faith that when God said I I'm gonna go home me Knox he'll I'll just go with you amen and so he must have caught some kind of revelation that he had been a part of God to begin with man and so he just could go back to where he came from and so may the Lord reach the blush we certainly enjoyed being here first time we've been up this this part of Ohio before but we've we find it very warm and we appreciate all that was done for us the the food the room that was given that we could rest in and may God richly bless you be a prayer and we trust if we don't see you no more on this side it will be seeing you on the other side amen because I believe by by God's grace I'll be there amen only by His grace amen you know i someone Samia you know to pray for him son brother I'm sick will you pray for me you know and I just sit back and said His grace is sufficient and it is is that not right if we if we can find the grace of God for our lives that's sufficient for all that we have need of the grace of Almighty God if you have your Bibles this evening turn with us to the book of st. John and I think brother Smith told me last night that something folks have to travel and so we don't want to keep you long and oh you got to drive back this evening or and so we just have a simple little fault here that the Lord put on our hearts and we trusted to be a blessing to you we want to read from the book of st. John chapter 20 verse 21 and we just certainly wonderful to be here this afternoon amen sonna kind of goes long lives with what we looked at this morning and yet just a little bit different but we trusted to be a blessing to you something be said to help you and it courage you along the way amen the Bible says this in st. John 20:21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost amen let us bow our heads you said brother no that's not script that's not much Scripture but I believe it's enough amen amen Heavenly Father Lord once again we discounted such an honor together here with your people Lord and in your presence and we thank you dear God for the Liberty we felt here this morning to bring your word Lord knowing dear God that your word having its preeminence in our lives what would bring a subject to that word Lord even as Mary said being unto me Lord we pray also father may your word do that which is sent to accomplish in our lives father we pray and Lord we just ask that as we look upon the word tonight Lord may it quicken to our hearts Lord that we would leave here with a desire Lord to serve you better to be a better witness dear God to be to be a better Christian Lord not only to the world but to our husbands and to our wives and to our sons and our daughters Lord that then others dear God might see you father for Lord truly if they see me they'll see a failure Lord if he see me God they'll see a life of mistakes but God if they can only see you or you're the same yesterday today and forever god and may our lives lord not projector motives and our objectives father but made only project you we pray Lord father God may our lives line up to your word Lord we pray bless our brother Jesse here Lord the congregation god we asked Lord a special blessing upon them and Lord may there be a light Lord here in this community dear God we pray and father may great signs and wonders be wrote at the hands of the believers dear God and Lord I ask your father mayor enviable break out God once more that would shake this city Lord we pray father we know that the well tree Bible that we spoke of this morning started from a child if I understand it right Lord that just reached up and grabbed a hold of the faith of God Lord and it created such a stir that a revival broke out it Oh God we don't need ten thousand to have a revival we just need one so God that set on fire with a Holy Ghost Lord and God I pray Lord shake Akron Ohio once more god we pray for that glory for we asked he sings in Jesus name and the bride says Amen god bless you you may be seated this afternoon I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on sent by the father sent by the father you know brother Branham told the story of the master violinist and I know we've all heard that story we've listened to it heard it on tapes but he talked about how that they had an old violin that there's gonna auction off and they wanted to sell him but nobody wanted this finally and it kind of had some scars on it a little bit dusty kind of out of tune and so the auctioneer he's gonna auction off this violin and so he held him up before the people and he said who'll give me $100 and everybody just looked at him he said I'd he'll give me $50 and they just looked at him and $25 and they just looked at him and I thought you know I've preached in that church before it hurt of people just kind of look at you you know and and so he got on down he said $20 and $15 and $10 and nobody would make a bid on the valley and no body wanted the violin and so the auctioneer seemed that he wasn't going to get a bid on he said come on folks are you even looking at he said who would just give me a dollar would anybody just give me a dollar and nobody wanted to bid on the valley and the so he said well going once going twice before I take it off the market does anybody want it and finally the opposite in the back an old gray-haired man stood up and he stepped out of the audience and he said may I see the violin that he picked up the violin and he began to take a rag and he wiped all the dust off of it and he reached into his pocket and he pulled out some rosin and he Rosalind up the bow and he began to tune it up and he stuck it up under his chin and he began to strike across the strings that whole volley and begin to play down at the cross where my Savior died and as you begin to play the Spiller Lord begin to move into the building and people begin to cry their eyes begin to tear up and and the auctioneer caught the moment and he begin to say now who will give me $50 and he'll give me $100 a 500 a thousand 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 and the Hulk the valley just kept going up and going up in value now what was that what was that what caused that violin from just a few minutes ago we have just been an old piece of wood that nobody wanted to all of a sudden becoming a priceless instrument what was it what done it what what moved the people like that and the prophet of God said what it was was the difference was this that the master the master the one who knew the volleying he said the one who had been the valley and he knew how to get out of it what was in it you see he was the creator of the violin hallelujah and he knew how to get out of this instrument what was in the instrument you see the violin was only the expression of the master who built it he had within himself this certain music he had within himself these certain sounds that he wanted to express that I bet he didn't have an instrument that would express it the piano couldn't do it the guitar couldn't do it the drugs could not make the sound that he wanted it to make it so he had this image he had this sound within him and so he he under inspiration he began to create an instrument that would express what was in him you see the violin became the very inspiration of the master the the heart the very fat passion of the violinists was expressed through that Valley a man he created himself this instrument that would Express the sound that was within you and with that in mind let me say this afternoon that God was in Christ doing what God was in Christ expressing himself to the world God was expressing himself to the world through Jesus Christ moment had seen the father in any time amen because the father was a spirit but only the begotten of the father had declared him Jesus declared he is here but not only did he declare that he's here he defined that he's in here and he made God was in Christ expressing himself to the world what his attitude was or his thought of the world was how he lived the world was all expressed through Jesus Christ he so loved the world that he laid down his own life for it and the only way that God could die as a mortal he had to become immortal so God was in Christ expressing his thoughts to the world as we read this morning Jeremiah 29:11 said I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected in a man God said I have these thoughts towards you when I think of you I don't think of evil oh god I want to make you shout this afternoon I don't think of evil when I think of you I think of peace I think of dead thoughts oh man it meant sometimes you know we think a little bit about ourself we we see our weaknesses we see our failures we see our struggles and sometimes we don't think of myself exactly right but if we could ever cast them what I think about myself and take what God thinks about me amen sometimes we get undermined well if our church can be like this church or if our church was like that at church said we would have a better Church but God made us the way he wanted us to be nobody can take your place amen you know sometimes young people get in my will if I look like this person here I would be more popular if I had their color eyes or if I had their color hair but you see God made us exactly the way that he wanted us hey man he made you see us just started thinking well you know if we had a bigger crowd we could have a bigger service that's not true amen but the devil will make us think that way well we're just a small crowd so we can't really do anything for God God don't need a house for God just needs words so they've said have got to get one person in his head yeah turn the world upside to hell amen God said and I said I'm not thoughts are not your thoughts at the Lord neither are my ways your ways God said I don't think like you think amen my thoughts are not your thoughts what the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts in your thoughts God made us just the way he wanted us to be there's a certain note there's a certain - there's a certain song that God wants to play out of our life that no one else can play God of notice the way he wants to use to say man God will bring us down a certain Road just show others say hey I can bring anybody from anywhere I could take a drunk and make a preacher out of told somebody I could take a failure and make them a success I am God the Creator I could do what I wanted him very much hallelujah glory be to God God made us just the way he wanted us today hey man Oh hallelujah you know you think well ha I brother down you just don't understand that I had these thoughts about myself well cast down our thoughts and take me or I'll destroy you one time that there was a homeless person laying on the street and an artist walked off you said sir I'd like to paint you I'll pay you gosh it sure ain't got no money paint me so the artist was painting knew he made me look over any minute painting and he got then he said here sir take this money and the guy said wait a minute if you painted me just let me see the painting he said oh sure and he turned it around now this was a bum laying in the street raggedy clothes but when he turned the picture around it was a fine well-dressed young man squares all six-pack abs you know just well-dressed well-groomed and that the homeless guy said who is that and the artist said that's you he said me that's me he said well you see that's the way I see you and the burglars ever said if that's the man you see then that's the man I'll be a man we live in ourselves as homeless sometimes why I got this if we can ever see yourself the way God sees us you know I was similar the other day I was looking at some work I did it impressed me at all I just be honest with you I looked at that I didn't see nothing you know they say art is in the eye of the beholder aha I must have had mine shut because this just looked like a butcher that's what it looked like my fault I looked at that the first thought came to my mind was my dog could paint better than that I'm being honest I looked at that I thought they look like some first grader had finger painted this picture I said what is that doing here and then I got to looking at it you know what it was worth 104 million dollars I thought my goodness isn't that lovely 104 million dollars I thought why is that picture worth so much money and then I look closer you know what it was a Picasso a Picasso you see it wasn't ho going to God it wasn't what the painting looked like it was the one who painted it we might not look like much to the world but what they failed to see is the signature that's on their name sons and daughters of the Most High God mrs. Jesus Christ the Bride of Christ where are my manners gonna make fun of us we may not look like much to them but the signature we have the name above all names very man oh yeah baby to God hallelujah you see God has signed his name to our life amen he made you the way he wanted you for the job that he wanted you to do we think sometimes why do we have such struggles why do we have such trials in her life you know Bevin talked about his little girl Sharon Rose and how she suffered before she died until her eyes crossed in her head but you see you think why why would a man of God have to experience something like that did you see it mo did something in the Prophet that the Prophet said from that time on that was never a cross-eyed child come on the platform but what he didn't think I was a little girl you see it put something in his heart that when he saw that he could you see you can't help somebody until you can for somebody you've got to have compassion for somebody that's what the world's dying for is that compassion and he said there wasn't a cross that job at one time across the platform but what God healed him without even the prayer why he was molded that way God moded him because God wanted to express that through him and he made him for the job that he needed to do amen so we got a choice the second we can either think our thoughts which are not very good most of the time or we can take his thoughts God said my thoughts are not your thoughts unless God's thoughts and your thoughts would be the same thoughts now God's gonna change his thoughts to fit you but he will change your thoughts to fit his [Applause] amen you said without killing man think God stops I think so I think the Bible tells us there let me show you what I mean who created the animals that's right it's not a trick question God did God created the animals it's funny yes question huh it's not a trick question God created the animals but who named them all of you now how did Adam know what to name that animal that God created because Adam had the same badge it's God be a man Oh Adam said you're a monkey you're a cheetah you're a bear you're an eagle and God said amen that's exactly what I was thinking you know God they say Adam come to come here son come here so you're doing a good job daddy's proud of me man just one little thing you called that right there an elephant that son that elephant that's a mouse now watch it and watch it he'd never done that he said you're a cheetah you're a monkey you're a barrier an eagle hey God said amen that's exactly what I was thinking and God had a middle son of God who stood in this day and he said I no longer call you Church I no longer call you Methodist I no longer call you bamboo but I call you the bride of Jesus Christ and God said that's exactly what I was thinking booyah hey man the Bible says in second Corinthians 5:19 to wit God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation amen the Bible said God Himself dwelt in jesus christ jesus said the father dwells in me so if you can find out what God thinks about mankind you can find out what Jesus said about mankind and you know what the father thought about mankind because he was the expression of God's thoughts even the father himself on Mount Transfiguration what did he say this is my beloved son he there ye Tim don't hear nothing else don't listen to no other voice hear what he says here you didn't say hear you then hear um listen to no other voice not even your own if it's contrary to his words come on amen but you said this morning that the bride would be the final voice but you should hear him though here you live that's exactly right don't you understand what it is the voice of the last day in the bride it's his voice in her are you saying the same thing jesus said I'm the light of the world did he turn say you're in the light of the world so who's the light in the world Jesus are you did Jesus suffer from amnesia did he forget what he said no he was given us a revelation he said on the light of the world then he said no the light of the world what is it it's Christ in us a man reflected himself making himself let's say yesterday today and forever amen we can find out through the life of Jesus Christ what God's attitude was towards the sinner what is attitude worse towards the sick when his attitude was towards the prostitute to the gambler to the beggar we can find out God's permanent attitude towards these same matters today because he's the same yesterday today and forever so whatever God thought about that through Jesus Christ God thinks that same thoughts through his bride because Jesus Christ was God's thoughts expressed on the earth he was the expression of what God was thinking amen his attitude towards the sinner he forgave him his attitude towards the sick he'll do his attitude towards the prostitute he changed them his attitude towards the gambler he delivered them you know what I thought about these things look to Jesus Christ for he was the very heart of God expressed amen amen Jesus Christ was the expression of how God wanted man to live on the earth let me say that again Jesus Christ was the expression of how God wanted man to live on the earth when Adam fell in the garden he fell from the position that God intended for man to be on the earth what was course when he come to earth he was a god man that's exactly right he was a man when he stood at Lazarus grave and well but when he threw his shoulders back and said Lazarus come forth that was more than a man that was God speaking he was a man when he tried to rest from the boat cause he was tired but when he stood up and put his foot on the bow and stretched forth his hand and said peace be still that was more than a man that was God manifested in flesh God speaking to his creation and that's the way God intends for us to live upon the earth while as a man but as a god man a new race a super race of people right man with the spoken word of God but their Lord manifested by them say what you see done these things times in my ministry you'll see it done in the fullness of the blood very much Oh hallelujah hey man well Jesus came to Laodicea age of Israel he was so different from what they were used to but it wasn't the way he dressed he dressed like everybody else it was the way he lived amen if she was so different that they said what manner of man is this if you're looking up it's what tribe what nation what race a man who you you know I hate you smart I'm from Tennessee I'm a hillbilly but just one thing I know watermelon produces watermelon is that not true cucumber seed produces cucumbers if you go out and plant cucumbers Eden you get beans they put the wrong seat in the envelope ain't no cucumbers he produced beans every kind after its kind come on somebody cucumber seed produces cucumber dogs produces dogs and cats produces cats so if God was to have an offspring would they not be gods well think about it it's just simplicity it's just God and simplicity did not the Bible say ye are gods Amen hallelujah made in the image of God amen he was so different to say what men are men it wasn't it looks it wasn't it closed what was it like that violin the master had built Jesus was built by the word to express God's thoughts towards man what made him so different he was sent by the father to be that expression what did Jesus say himself I always do that which is pleasing to my father I got not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me when did he tell Mary when she said to him just a young boy in the temple she said your father and I have sought you with tears but the world yet young corrected the error he said know ye not I must be about my father's business what was the father's business but then to take the Word of God oh then Isaiah said what Moses said he was the fulfillment of the words of the Prophet and he said I must be about my father's business that's the secret of the message now where is the bride to do in this last night we must be about the Father's business hallelujah to vindicate Malachi 4 route 1730 revelations King 7 that make the message River oh man hallelujah oh boy to God you come to do the will of the Father how did the father send him the father that sent him where in him and with him amen the father that sent Jesus came in him and worked through him jesus said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do for they will tell you who I am amen amen Jesus after his resurrection he appeared unto his disciples and he gave them the great commission Galliard all the world to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents they shall drink deadly things and they will not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that's what he said here ye here then he said this as the father hath sent me even so send I you the father that sent the son went with the son and was in the Sun and the Jesus ascends us goes with us and is in us taking what making him to say yesterday today and forever amen he just changed his mask like a great pray what somebody would have four or five different parts it's the same person they just changed their masks and the god that was in the sun the dog that was in the group was now in the bride making them worn by the same word by the same spirit by the same life by the same gun a wood bone of my bone flesh of my flesh the groom and the bride uniting as one the same ministry amen Oh glory to God the Father sent me even so send I you amen even to the end of the world and the works that I do shall you do also and greater works than these greater works but message you can't do nothing greater and raise the dead put-put aizen's in somebody's head I didn't gotten alive but what it means is more works more what did the prophet of God say he's done more in my little ministry than he did in his own doing what fulfilling st. John 14:12 the works I do show you do also and greater works why because that the groom was one body but the bride is a mini membered body all over the world signs and wonders are being done what did Elijah have a double portion of the largest Eric what did Elijah say to him if you see me when I go you can have what you asked for what do you wanna last you you followed me all these years you follow me through all these pools what do you want he didn't even bat an eye he saw Elijah do great things he could have said I want a ministry just like yours but that's not what he said he said I want a double portion is that not true and did he get it did he get what he asked for yes because the Prophet said Elijah did four miracles and he lasted an eight oh boy to God that's another message for another time but who a man a man the last he lived he sent back to the church on the day of Pentecost and birth that church by his life the Spirit of God in his church one for what did he do it for why did he come in to us for Hemme got the Holy Ghost this afternoon why do we have it you ever thought about that he's God he can do what he wants to sis Tucker said who wants to go to heaven raise your hand okay I'm right raised her hand you stand over here everybody else you go over there he's God who are we to tell God how to run his business the God didn't do that he didn't do that he said a son he bled and died for us he saved us of our sins he justified us not only the free works of grace No Fozzy Seca father's not only st. us he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is his very life his spirit the pulsation of the Spirit of God hallelujah the Holy Ghost dog's life he gave me but why did he do that he didn't have to do it but he did why did he give us his life to continue his works to make him the same yesterday today and forever we don't have to point back to 65 to make God the same some of us wasn't even born I was but most of you wasn't born brother Jesse at 65 I know you wouldn't you're too young looking huh we don't have to go all the way back before Jesse was born to make God the same somebody needs to make him the same today he's the same today if we don't make Jesus Christ the same today we care our Commission a very Mario it's right here on brother Jesse's whoa Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how are we making the same by continuous works today What did he say I always do that which pleases my father I come not to do my own will but the will of the Father who has sent me he sends his church the same way that God sent him the God that City went with him and was eating and Christ that since the church goes with the church and his in the church the very same works so then we see now that we are sent by the father sent by the father you are God's attitude you are God's thoughts expressed to a dying generation who see understand will not here by chance we're not even here as church members we are here as sons and daughters of God God placed us for such a time as this to be the expression of his thoughts for this age and you are God's attitude expressed you are God's thoughts on display to this dying generation think of it friends go into all the world your mission feel your mission feel you may never go to the Philippines you may never go to New Zealand you may never go to Norway by God's grace

today I come through the line at Walmart just a humble little simple people but I saw something real it may be your school it may be where you work you're sitting on the father to express to those around you his love his mercy His grace his forgiveness his joy his peace his protection the father has sent you to be a witness that others see Jesus you see sometimes you think people though you know if I had a million dollars man I would really help the Lord you weren't helping no more if you had a million than you would if you had a hundred it's not the amount we have it's the desire we have to do it sometimes all it takes all it takes is a card in the mail sometimes all it takes the text thinking about you today brother just come on my heart won't you know I'm praying for you I read just the other day where a homeless man was standing in front of Dunkin Donuts asking for change and a guy went in to get him some breakfast and the man came in and he was looking at the menu and he was counting the coins to see if he had enough to buy him something to eat the man was watching me said hey buddy get in front of me huh I'll get you something to eat get whatever you want I'll pay for it and the man ordered him some breakfast to me he turned around with his food and nobody wanted this man to sit with him cuz he's homeless his clothes wouldn't clean and the guy who bought the food said hey buddy said you can sit with me come on you can sit over here with me and they sit down and begin to talk and when the man got ready to go he said sir can I see the receipt and the man handing to receipt in the the homeless guy wrote on the receipt and gave it to the guy he said I've got to go thank you so much and when he got up and went out of the Dunkin Donuts the man looked at the receipt and it said this today who's gonna kill myself who didn't wanna live anymore who start a fight but because of your kindness I don't want to hurt myself all it took was a breakfast for the glory God my daughter Jessica we was one day was at McDonald's and I put him to the wind and I said how much is the food of the person behind me they said it's $14 or whatever it was I said I want to buy it I want to buy their food and the girl the girls at McDonald's she said really I said yes it'll be all right just take it out take it out of my credit card and so we got her food and we drove off and we was going up the road Jessica you know she kind of cried she don't say hold on she said daddy so why did you do that you don't know them people why did you do that and I looked at the rearview mirror and I saw the car coming it was coming up pretty fast and when it brought it beside me they wrote down the window and they waved and they had a big smile on their faces good thank you thank you and I told Jessica sitting did you see the smile to be Jesus as the father has sent me even so Sid are you to be a witness of his mercy I was grace of his role suffered the father has sent me like that Oh violin we may not look like much to them maybe kind of old-fashioned maybe we're at attuned to the modern Korean thank God the master let the master take us into his hands if our life is out of tune with his word many tune us up take the rosin of the Holy Spirit rosin up her old dry bows maybe I should say bones and he can play Amazing Grace through our lives who will be Jesus to the cashier at Walmart sometimes all it takes is just to speak to them you know bourbon said the sweetest words you'll ever hear is your own name it sometimes all it takes just thank you mark appreciate that buddy have a good day at you care you remember the bedroom said he was going he's up there on that on that why are they we I think was getting ready take his own life he took the glove off for no no no wasn't no that's not it he was on any slipped he almost fell off from the pole and he said a woman screamed that's the story I was thinking about he was climbing a pole you know he's a he was a lion and he was climbing this pole to work on it and he slipped and he almost fell and he said a woman let out a scream and he said I always always appreciated that because she cared just by her scream it showed she cared let him take our lives let him Tunis up that her heart song with singing Amazing Grace as a father sent me even so send out you how did Jesus come as we get ready to close how did Jesus come he was God's love gift to the world Behrman said he was the only true original Christmas present that's what he said he was God's present to you to die of humanity God wrapped himself in a Christmas present he was God's present then as the father has sent me even so see now you then do you realize you are a gift to Laodicea a gift God wrapped himself in humanity once again not the humanity of the body of Jesus but the humanity of the body of the bride she's God's love gift to blonde I gotta see that the world would see Jesus you know in closing I heard a story it's always stayed with me there was some businessman over in New York and they lived in New Jersey and you know it's New Jersey's just right across the river they're from New York so a lot of people working in in New York but they they take his little puddle jump her flats is what we call where you just go up level out and land and they fly back into New Jersey they work all week in New York and then fly home on the weekend and so these men they were businessmen and they're told to I've said now Friday night we'll meet we have a big cookout so they'd planned this big cookout for Friday evening but work had went longer than what they thought and they got to the airport late anybody's ever been to the airport late you know there's only one way to get to your gate as run and they were running and they come around the corner of the terminal and they saw this girl but it was too late she had an apple cart she was selling apples and they ran right over the top of her they knocked the card over knocked the girl off the students do with her apples went everywhere but they kept on running because they were late but when they got to the late gate one of them got the feeling bad and he told his buddy said hey you guys go on so I'm gonna go back and check on that girl they said you better come on our wives are expecting us he said tell my wife what happened she'll understand tell her I'll catch the letter flat I'll see her tonight and he goes back and when he goes back to where the little girl was she's still in the floor crying baby been to New York they're not too friendly up there just being honest with you I'm much like the south everybody's friendly in the south and when it got the worst she's actually was stealing the floor she was still weeping as she was going would somebody please help me but somebody please help me and he noticed for the first time that this little girl was blind she said I'll help you he started picking up her apples and he set the stool up he said here no you sit right here I'll I'll take care of your apples and he started picking him up he turned the apple cart up and he picked up all the apples and all the ones it was bruised he set him off to the side so she wouldn't sell a bad apple and all the ones that were good he cleaned him up with his handkerchief and stacked them back up he reached into his pocket he pulled out $20 and he laid it in her hand he said here's a $20 bill it's more than enough to cover the apples that was bruised he said I want you to know we're sorry I we didn't mean to knock you over we was running late and we asked you to forgive us but you're okay now you're back in business and here's the money and I need to go see about my plane but I want you to know that I'm sorry and as he turned to leave this little girl spoke for the first time and she said mister they said yes and she said are you Jesus and he said oh yeah I follow you I follow him but she said I was just wondering because I was in the floor crying and I was praying I said Jesus would you help me pick up my apples and you started picking up my apples and I just wondered if perhaps he was him now say this friend in closing can we live that kind of life then if my neighbor was blind they couldn't see my belt buckle I couldn't see my Malachi 4 license plate I couldn't see my wife wearing a dress if my neighbor was blind do I live such a life that my blind neighbor could still see Jesus as the father has sent me even so he was the heart of God expressed when God gave us Jesus Christ he gave us his very hard let us show his love his mercy His grace no God knows my heart if I was to die they rolled my body up here y'all had a funeral but just I don't care if he ever knows I ever preached interested in some time I don't care sister they ever know how many places I go to how many services a I thank God for everything allows me to do but that's not where the emphasis is but if I roll my body up here you know what I would won't say no for me not how much I travel not how many places not how many sermons have preached but that won't somebody to say hopefully my children or my wife that they would say oh Jesus Jesus can we live that life can we live such a life as that not within our cell friends there's no way we could ever do that within ourselves because he's not called us to reform so it's not well I want to try to do better there's only one way that that could ever live to us is for us to die to ourselves and be born again of his spirit that the world would see Jesus once again a man as the father has sent me even so send I you let the master this afternoon let him take us into his hands Betty motors and shapers wipe the dust of lay out of seal half of us oh we're going to have a few scars that just shows we've been in the battle but what about scars sometimes the scars it's what gives the furniture character but let our lives play Amazing Grace why would he do that for us because he looked down through Calvary and he said he was worth it he thought I was worth Savin so he came and changed my life he thought I was worth keeping so he cleaned me up inside he thought I was to die for so he sacrificed his life so I could be free so I could be oh so I could tell everyone I know he thought I was worth saving so he came and changed my life he thought I was worth keeping a cure so he cleaned me up inside he thought I was to die for so he sacrificed his life so I could be free so I could be oh so I could tell everyone I know he thought I was worth saving Oh Lord Jesus Oh Lord Jesus father no it's just a simple thought this afternoon Lord but God we can have all the deep mysteries of God Lord we could go into the deep things of God and spend days exploring and we're so grateful for those things God that's been made known to us Lord will not be living at all the opening of the seals and the mysteries being revealed God but oh god if we can't live this Lord if we can't be this Lord what good is the mysteries the Lord did prophet said you want to see what a man is look at what he marries they learned if you're taking a bride to yourself she must be like you Lord for she will reflect your character as your choice Lord Father let us humble ourselves down God but I can't do it myself so I surrendered to you the hood and ovalle and it never kicked up a fuss when the master picked it up it's just yielded to the stroke of the master they brought forth a song that was in his heart O God this afternoon Lord take each other Cynthia hands God may the tool

Lord modus & Shakers father God hold us Lord Oh the position of that volleying under the chin of the master Lord all great Jehovah take us under your wing granny Lord God I remember years ago I come in from a meeting it was really late at night about 3:30 in the morning I knew my girls would be getting up in just a few hours to go to school and I didn't want to go upstairs and wake up my wife so I have an old green chair there and got me a cup of coffee set out in that chair just thought I'd wait to the Sun come up and don't ever forget this I begin to think about the service and we had a big prayer line that night and I was thinking about all the people that came through the prayer line and I was asking God once again to meet their need bless I was just different ones that come to my mind a different request sitting there watching the Sun begin to break up over the hills of Tennessee all at once I heard a noise upstairs it was my youngest one ally she come bouncing down the steps getting ready for school and getting ready for breakfast our little extended area of the kitchen like a little Dean was where I was sitting so she come running into the kitchen and she looked right at me she turned back the end of the kitchen and she don't it just dawned on her that I was sitting her she spun back around she said daddy she run and jumped up in my lap I said did you miss me she said uh-huh I said you've been good well and daddy was gone she's like first second Greg she said uh-huh uh-huh oh ask mama that question I said I love you she said I love you too daddy but then she just laid her head on my chest neither one ever said another word because love has its own language sometimes words getting away so she's laying on my chest and all of a sudden she said daddy I can hear your heartbeat said it's going don't don't don't don't don't don't I'd often thought about that friends but sometimes the world can be a little scary but while we're in this presence like we feel right now that's just come up and daddy's lap their head against his bosom like the violinist put the volume under his chin let's just draw up real close to father listen to his heart meet it beats out Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever don't you love you miss effort isn't he wonderful amen in moments like these I sing out a song I sing out a love song - gee Jesus in moments like my I lift up my heads to see see [Music] [Music] we would not what my daughter was hurt my wife was tired and she had slipped down a little room that they gave us to rest in and of setting up with Jessica she's a little bit restless that night and the nurse took her up her bed and she had all these tubes in her body and coming out of her stomach she put her in my arms set her and I was rocking her I was looking at her she was so hurt I began to sing that song right there in moments like these after 68 days in the hospital we brought our baby home she was walking to get it's all can again you were seeing again we come into the house and close the door and all the folks the news people everybody had left I began to shake the safes in moments like these because you see friends whether we're in the deepest Valley weather or the highest mountain his love is just the same door just as the father has sent me so sitting on you you'd be the heartbeat of God to this generation may the Lord bless you certainly enjoyed being here just something was said to help you I don't know about you but we are all saying down where I'm from God squeezes a man's heart the Chiefs comes out his
