then Lord willing we'll move on from that back in January I told you I kind of wanted to preach on some of the winds around the message right now dealing with the fivefold ministry and a couple Wednesday's ago I we were looking at that but I'd like to just look at one more time by the grace of Lord so let's go to ephesians 4:11 by the grace of god feegans 4:11 worried 11 to 16 fusions 411 is 16 tonight I'm not sure which one I'm gonna preach on I got like three or four sermons sitting there I'm not sure which ones I'm not gonna make any promises but I'll try to keep it short because I don't want to wear out myself that's my promise to God and my wife's like well why don't you sit down in a chair I'm like cuz if I get up here behind the pulpit I'll start you know pounding the pulpit you know preaching so hard but anyways Asians 411 I just love the Lord always want to have zeal for the Lord amen balance it out with wisdom I always want to have zeal praise God fusions 411 and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ let's read 14 together on three one two three that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive now I read 15 and 60 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying itself of itself in love amen let's just have our word of Prayer let's just bow our heads one more time Heavenly Father we reading these words they're 2000 years old but Lord the life behind them the spear behind them has no age is eternal we're thankful for eternal life Lord let eternal life speak to us help me to humble myself and yield to you and Lord may each one of us he owed to You Lord God that the life of this were be broken unto us O God help us and strengthen us today too the hour we're living in Oh God and may it strengthen this part of the body Lord as it edifies itself in love in Jesus Christ's name from the church said Amen god bless you being seen to praise the Lord so by God's grace I think I've said all the thank-yous and done all the announcements I think I'm ready to preach now so praise the Lord I don't forget anything but doesn't it feel good to be back in here by God's grace and not to worry about people shooting hoops over there and walking around with half naked you know and all that kind of stuff just thankful for we can all be shut in here in the cleft of the rock all's you gotta worry about is cars driving by or you know a landscape blower you know blowing mulch out of the way or whatever that's all we gotta worry about here by God's grace so we're thankful you know that very thankful for God's love and His mercy so that's I got part 15 here and then like I said tonight we could look at more of number six and number seven tonight or there's there's Ecclesiastes sermons there's proverbs sermons I got revelation six sermons kind of ready to go I just kind of got to see which one liked to preach and if not we'll just pray tonight because one thing we need more of is prayer amen and and if you're concerned you'll fall asleep or if I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep I'll say Haven somebody just come slap me on the back a little bit there keep me awake but I know we all get tired after eatin but you know we do want to just draw closer to the Lord amen so pardon me so we read our text here and I just want to briefly review part 14 real quick as I preach it to Wednesday's ago remember the Scofield Bible there's three themes we're on the third theme we preached every verse up to this point up to chapter four and the reason behind this was because I knew you know and I know the Holy Spirit's revealed it to you too that if we're supposed to have the faith of the Apostolic fathers we better know what the Apostolic fathers said we better know what they wrote so we started in Galatians in 20 15 and 16 and then Ephesians I took a little time off and now I just feeling led to get back into it remember back in January I said I want to preach on these winds that are rising up around Jeffersonville so this is the morning I'm going to do that so I'm gonna do it in love you know the Bible said when you're really a true Christian you speak the truth in love and you're not attacking individuals you know you're just watching out for spirits because like when you're in the midst of the trial you know many times you're not sure well is this a spirit on somebody or not you know or is a spirit on me you know you're not quite sure so in the midst of it you want to be kind and gracious you want to search your heart and then so that's what we'll do you know by the grace of the Lord so we looked at we saw our exalted position in Christ were seated in heavenly places in Christ we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all those beautiful scriptures and there's one body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and now we're in the walk and warfare of the believer now two Wednesdays ago we basically taught three things the seven fold benefits of the fivefold ministry and then the attacks on the fivefold ministry and the reality of the home church so I just want to revisit those briefly the word perfect means equipped so the the fivefold ministry being brings the perfection of the Saints or it equips you it if you really catch what's being preached it will give you the tools you need to overcome it perfects you it equips you it gives you what you need to overcome second it gives the work of the ministry it will help you work the ministry third it will build up the body help them to grow up spiritually fourth it will bring agreement among the body and I see that amongst the preachers I fellowship with and all the ones I've gone to preach for I see more unity than division amongst all of us I see plenty of unity if we have though disagreements we just don't talk right about them because it's really not on a major doctrine it's always on a minor so so I see more agreement all the time and I hope you do too by God's grace well and then the Bible said it brings knowledge and that word knowledge means precise truth it will bring the actual deep truth of God unto the portion or the measure of the maturity of Christ so whatever measure we are we're supposed to have the the fivefold ministry bring us to the exact knowledge we need in order to mature into the the measure of a Christian we're supposed to be praise God amen and then if we do that then we'll learn to speak the truth and love if we receive the preaching from the fivefold ministry and we'll be fitly joined together and then we will and when we're joined together in a body like this we will edify one another will strengthen each other right as I've told you before just you come into church I don't care how bad spiritually you are but just you come into Church edifies me then if I get to shake your hand and fellowship you that's even more edification but just seeing you here well praise the Lord they're not sick or they're you know they're not battling things or they're not backslidden or something like that just seeing the Saints in the house of God is enough to edify the body it's a chance remember this is a hospital so if we all were all sick throughout the week we all go through little spiritual battles we ought to come here to get well praise God and then we but and how do we do that we fitly joined together the the body Ana Phi's itself it heals itself in love right here that's why the first thing when people backside they generally leave church generally not always but they they leave that ability to be healed or strengthened or that spirit has such a control over them that they they now stay away from the love they now stay away from the nutrients or the spiritual vitamins we're supposed to run to those vitamins amen and we're supposed to be pepped up right here by the preaching of the word amen and this message will go a little deeper so you have to bear with me I hope you can catch it if not just you know listen to it again now well if we are truly receiving from the fivefold ministry we will not be immature will not be tossed or agitated like waves well what do I believe here what's about this what about that we won't be carried on people's opinions or or driven in doubt I don't know and I'm not sure what to do and we won't be deceived or led astray if we're truly feeding on the fivefold ministry right and church you've seen it every false doctrine and I'm going to name something a little bit like polygamy seven thunders they all get off and they all get led astray in some sin whether it's money or power or sex or whatever it is they all get led astray in something but when we can live a holy life that we can see that the holy spirits inside of us amen that's one thing they can't do they cannot live the holy life of a spirit-filled Christian hallelujah but that's what we're supposed to live by the grace of God and that's what we do when we feed on the fivefold ministry the right way cuz it's Jesus's gifts jesus said it's more beneficial than I leave so I can send down these gifts and that will perfect it by that will equip the body and it'll help us to all grow in unity and every all the Christians will come into the full measure the full maturity of Christ that I would like to them to come into amen through the preaching of the fivefold ministry that's the Word of God and that my friends will never change how many be this word will never change it will never change its never been God's pattern to change this pattern this is God's eternal padua to the eternal but everlasting pattern until the millennium amen now and we looked at the attacks on the fivefold ministry and I do apologize for the next slides are gonna be real small but the attacks I've seen is they want less live preaching but God's pattern can't change God always use a living man to keep the gardens they say the fivefold is failing but the real bride has no condemnation they say brother Branham is your pastor but if you do that you have no living accountability there's no one that's alive to you to be accountable for because Paul told Timothy to warn them that are unruly and administer church order like jesus said in matthew 18 a tape can't go to you and correct you if you're wrong right Paul told Timothy to rebuke them that sin before all and then also when an attack is worshiping brother Branham saying every word is thus saith the Lord and but brother Branham said that's tommyrot and then that really puts all the anointing on brother Branham and it actually it's Nicollet ISM it puts all the anointing on him and none on anybody else but if you've got the Holy Ghost you got the same anointing that was on him not the same gifts but the same anointing and then you know the attack is they you know with phones and internet and everything they try to see her so many voices they can't even hear what the Shepards been feeding them right now but we saw the power of the home church as well the home church is the most powerful weapon for cleansing and that's tight by the waters of separation they be sprinkled on the third day Wednesday and sprinkled on the seven as well amen Sunday and what's more powerful is it more powerful to be excited to revived every two months six months a year or every single time you gather in the house of the Lord what's a true test of your maturity it's how you behave day in and day out in your walk with Jesus Christ right and now brother man taught the same love I'm gonna go through these real quickly bro BAM said you don't have to you to love the Lord you ought to go to church you have to tell people that they'll walk through rain they'll go they'll walk through death to go to church they love it they just got to get there it's their life if they don't they just feel like they're perishing he said they go there to worship and they go home refreshed he said oh he's talking about how you know a mother may complain I got to get I got to get the kids up and ready and go to church he said you've never touched the resurrection brother when the resurrection come into your heart you longed to go to church there's something you just can't keep away from it on the inside now this one's really small so don't strain your eyes well Bram said for if you love God you can't they couldn't wire you away from church they couldn't chain you away they couldn't hide a believer from God he said just stop and watch your life if you love the world better than you love prayer-meeting if you'd rather watch a television program than to pray there's something wrong with you if you'd rather take a sunday afternoon ride instead of going to church well I just need to relax I can't gum the second service well you understand right he said there's something wrong with you somewhere because where your heart is there your treasures will be also see your heart is built into it he says well Ram says talks about spiritual discernment he said we ought to be going from one revival to another the bonfires of God's glory built in every Church in every place we ought to feel a bonfire here this morning every Church should have a bonfire where we all gather around the hot hotness of God's love and the warmth of his love and his spirit we ought to gather round and get refreshed in God's presence and he says cry out this is what we can do cry out to God for spiritual power and spiritual discernment that's why we come together they've cry out for those things he says he said we must love in our hearts to come to church if we don't love to love to come to church and love God he says you imagine a man saying he loved his wife and he hadn't seen her for a long time pass right by and say well I'll see her some other time or a wife saying she loves her husband or a parent saying they love her child why it shows I think our expressions we should be constantly longing to be in worship anywhere to worship the Lord I don't care if it's out at the dirty old YMCA I don't care who air it is we should long to be in worship amen if we got the Spirit of God don't say home if God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way out then I tell you it's time you got to pray because we're in the last days I'm gonna skip past that here's one I love this one he said the Holy Spirit is letting we must let the Holy Spirit do the work of his office within you and creating in you a new life and making you so hungry to go to church that you can't stay away from church that's what the Holy Spirit will create in us and see we all when we all come to God we also hungry to come to church but Satan battles us and we lose it a little bit that hunger well we've got to battle back we've got to put on the full armor of God and battle back and be a so hungry to go to hear the preaching at the house of God into worship God with the songs and the glory amen that's exactly right he says if the life of Christ is in you you just long to go praise God so it's a very very simple question if the life who is the life of Christ in you if it is you longed to go to church I just want to go over these the Spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship the Spirit of God I guess that's why the Spirit of God is trying to get me to drive everyone to do the same thing here or whatever church people are streaming in I'm trying to get them to do the same thing drive them to the church that they should be attending right because live-streaming is not the end-all answer that's not the final answer it's just a temporary service when people can't make it but the ultimate goal is to get them in a home church praise God find their place he says you come to hear the message and the message is the Holy Spirit taking the Word of God and giving it to you praise the Lord if you love God you'd be at church you've got to get back to the church back to the Bible back to Christ how many love God that's why you're here amen but the man said have a church home or your die so I'm using some different other slides here just want to review maybe of 10-15 minutes he says you die without the fivefold ministry brother BAM says he says now remember this after this services afternoon you probably go back to your churches for tonight service I'll try early so you can do so sir brother ma'am didn't want the people missing their evening service at their home Church if I was in the city around I'd attend to these these churches here I really would I'm not saying that they never told me to say this there's some fine men real brothers and then each of you that accepted Christ if they didn't get your name why don't you look them up for Christian baptism and let them lead you on to the baptism of the holy ghost now how many people want to be led to the Holy Ghost now that's a that's a whole different story it's great if you already got it but if you don't have it it's great to recognize and say Lord lead me to the Holy Ghost praise God this is how a prophet would work in a local church find a pastor and then let him lead you to the Holy Ghost praise the God he says if you don't have a church see you'll die spiritually you'll just wind it away you'll be one of those what do we call let's go back there just a moment at slide twenty four you'll be one of these you'll be immature you're dwindle away you'll be tossed you'll be carried hesitant opinions deceive led astray if you don't have a home church praise God I'm glad to have a home church now I just want to do tithes and offerings again just briefly because I've had some questions about this here but Ram said I absolutely believe every person should stand their post of duty when their pastors their preaching or evangelist or something I think they ought to standard their posts of duty they also support that church with everything they got in them with their ties with their offerings with anything they're called to do be willing and happy if your pastor asks you to do something in your church you should do it that's good but don't let that just be the only thing get inoculated first that's what I'm trying to tell you you get the Holy Spirit first then the rest of it comes on alright and there's a reason church there's sometimes trouble with people many times because they're not born again right because if you get the Holy Ghost first it'll take care of everything else romance that eyes go to your own church not the Branham campaign ties are your first obligation to God in your church this is the 90s is in California 1959 I feel like this that a member of a church their first obligation is with their tithes and offerings is to support their church if your members of these fine churches that's represented here you support your church that's your first duty to God bring your tithes and offerings in the storehouse that's Malachi - that's your first duty to God and the storehouse you surely know what that is it's where you get your food so there's where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to your church and not let's say not ready not to an evangelist like me Ray's God it's not to an evangelist it's to the local church every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but to have some place where you go to church and you call it your church I'm so glad I can say this is my church I go to church here somewhere where you pay your tithe and somewhere that you help support the cause I love this take your choice so take a choice but here's what you have to do you have to discern the pastor spirit and guess what I'm trying to discern your spirit - I don't want rebel spirits in this church so we're all saying holy spirit help me to discern everybody's spirit here he said that then don't never dis fellowship with the other man because he don't belong with your group discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ I think that's absolutely true in other words lord help me to judge that pastor help me to judge that brother and sister the church let me see if their cause is truly Christ the word I'm open anytime you discern my spirit anytime you what my cause is Jesus Christ I hope you can see that by the grace of the Lord I hope no one that goes these fine churches around here will miss their services tomorrow night I hope they don't do it if they gotta post a duty stand at that that you stand at your post of duty at your church wherever you go to pay your tithing into it and you love your pastor and pray for him if you need to be prayed for ask him he's a man of God he'll pray for you and he and God will answer his prayer just as God will answer mine or anyone elses because after all it's your own faith in God that does the work but I've never exalted himself above the local pastor they're all in one Accord and he realized sheep had a certain Shepherd or a certain flock where they needed to stay with their pastor amen he says I want you to find these churches your church of your own denomination go there Church of your choice and of course if you have no church we'd be glad to have you tomorrow night but if your church is having service tomorrow night that's your duty that's your post of duty in your church we never want to shirk their own church never but I never wanted to take people either local church to come to his special meetings we never want any we would never want anybody to take money if they would put it in their own church and sponsor these meetings you put your own money in your own church if you have extra offering that month and you like to give it to the special meetings or a poor Widow woman that's what you give the poor with a woman but you support this church so we can help others amen glory your time and offering goes into your own church oh my if you feel to help in one of these meetings or something after your own church is taken care of that's fine but we never want to take one cent from any Church we're trying to help that church we're trying to do all we can that you'll be a better member of that church no matter what Church it is we want you to be a real loyal member and serve the Lord Jesus with all your heart I know a lot already radio a lot of radio talk with the brothers has radio programs they want to ride to them so they can get your address and send you offerings and things you won't get a letter like that friend and I believe that your money belongs in your church not to brother branham your money belongs in your church just exactly where it belongs and you put in your church your sightings in the sabor your church I'm just trying to help you don't have to send one thing just send it everything's free now let's look at the winds of doctrine is that okay for a little review I preached out like three years ago so I just thought I'd review it if you hadn't heard that but I just love it because I'm a pastor so God's called me at at a local church and so when this this topic is just dear to my heart because that's where God's called me you know mothers I mean I'm sure the scriptures on proverbs 31 are so dear to you right dad's you know your scriptures or whatever whatever may be the musicians you know those scriptures are so dear to you well that those are really dear to me because that's where God's called me and placed me but I also recognize that the strength of every Christian is how they worship God service in and service out in their local home Church now let's look at the winds of doctrine around the Branham Tabernacle it's been moving since 2015 when they got when they when the former pastor resigned and they elected a new pastor but I just want to look at this briefly and I love all those pastors I love all them just let me say that but remember Abraham said this in 1963 don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is the target where Satan has got every gun in Hell trained on it he'll cause one person who's something that's contrary to what the other one thinks he's doing that he is up to it that's his business if you can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another and say well listen did you know so-and-so did don't you listen to it don't you listen to it that's all that's the devil that's see it's saying don't you believe it so it seems like the prophets saying Satan is gonna try to get in the tabernacle and try to get people pitted against each other gossiping about each other he goes on to say if there's anything that somebody's done wrong pray for them and don't pray in a selfish way and say I know it's my duty I've got to pray for that brother you ever said a selfish prayer I'm sure we all have he said you take it to your heart really down for that sister and just talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you'll find them right back in the service again see because after all we're headed towards the setting of the Sun so this is not a prophecy by just I don't know why brother Aaron would say that that the tabernacle is going to lose its strength and then he talks about how spirits come in the church and he goes on to talk about the rapture he said they'll be so or the rapture it'll just be so quietly that nobody would know nothing about it well they say that little Tabernacle in a place called Jeffersonville there were so many of the members that went missing so in the same breath he says he's gonna lose his strength he he also believes some would be raptured from that church so it's just interesting it's not a prophecy but I just want to share that with you I don't know why you know God allowed brother BAM to say that but the but here's the four reasons I want to look at here four give me about 45 more minutes here these are the four I've seen rise up since I've been in the message and most most most obviously the last three years since the leadership changed at Branham Tabernacle for the first thing is wrong that I believe that I think they've gotten off the word is they used a certain type of Joseph of the Old Testament I'm gonna go through each one the second is many of them believe that every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord the third thing is a misinterpretation I heard of what house will you build me where they say that brother Branham needs to get back in every pulpit that he's not in every pulpit but I'd say his message is in this pulpit even though a tape recorders not in this pulpit his message is in this pulpit because it's not my message it's the Bible message but they're saying put the tape back in the pulpit and I said God never heard ain't it that way so we'll go get to that and the fourth thing is they say the tape boys so the men who just go and take tapes overseas and don't preach is the true fivefold ministry and replacing the false five in full ministry of live preachers so I think you can see why I had to preach this because it's off the word and church I you know it's either one of two things it's either sweet people dear precious Souls and I believe we're gonna be saved that have got a wrong spirit or it's the or it's the Antichrist spirit and they're really attacking and and they're attacking true true sons and daughters of God it's one of the other so I believe it's this they're all sweet they're just a little off the word a little bit okay that's what I believe now there may be some like in every Church there could be there could be serpent seed in every Church but don't ever let the devil tell you that praise God say devil I'm here I'm just here to serve Jesus Christ I didn't go looking for this message this message found me even if I was born under it this message found me praise God Amen I'm just blessed to be born under think about all the people that were born under Timothy was born into to think of all these people all of all of John and Polycarp and all these different ones they were just born into it praise God see so it's a blessing it's a blessing be born into it hallelujah let's look at the type of Joseph now I'm going to be quoting literal quote so I and I listen I spent six hours at the library studying yesterday because my car was getting fixed and it's still not fixed anyways I sat there for six hours I listened to all these things to confirm these are actual statements that people are making from the Branham tabernacle but this one goes back before this move in 2001 an article written from voice of God called here I stand it contains a type that brother Branham never used so they say that that bro Graham's son Joseph is a type of Joseph of the Old Testament but this is wrong because it types the bride as either Egypt or Joseph's brother rather than typing the bride as Joseph's Gentile life as an F okay so the air behind this is they've added to the word or message or they're misinterpreting the message and let me prove it to you here brother man oh now remember brother ham says you must not do three things with the scripture you must not misinterpret the word you must not miss misplace it and you must not dislocate it or else what does it do it throws you into a full confusion and a chaos agitated on the waters every wind of doctrine blowing you from this opinion blow into that opinion don't get me wrong you know a lot of these people that that have now gone to Jeffersonville they've gone there because they've been hurt by preachers who weren't burned again and shame on those preachers who were burned again because they got them off into false doctrine the mysteries of the people a true man of God won't do that a true man of God will stay with the word amen but see many of them are so hurt because that's you can hear their you can hear their screams and cries you can just sense it like they're saying we don't need we just need brother branham we just need the message he won't give us false doctrine well that's true he won't but that's not God's pattern God's pattern is to anoint brother branham prepared people that would walk in his footsteps after he left the scene praise God amen but I think you understand so here's the literal quote it says you might be eating stolen bread my friend so if you're what they were saying is if you listen to a tape that wasn't produced by voice of God it's soul and bread but it's not because there's a famine among the bride or because I've schemed to keep it through from your table as someone have you to believe the food has been stored up why should the bride be starving the greeneries are stocked food is available in 45 languages so see there this is a this is a scripture they're pulling from Genesis 41 where there was famine all over the face of the earth and Joseph opened all the storehouses so see they're placing the bride as Egypt starving but see Joseph's wife was never serving glory she was she was always in the temple with Joseph amen it's just the wrong type you know just misinterpreting the word and the that might prove they're not preachers because they're handling the word and misinterpreting the word because it's a gift of God that rightly divides the word not a man it's the gift of God hallelujah so see Joseph's wife Joseph's wife a Senath was always in the palace type in the Gentile bride she wasn't starving show me a scripture where she started she's not Egypt has correctly typed so the correct type is Egypt is typed to the world running to and fro around the world searching for food which fulfills the prophecy of Amos 8:11 and 12 and Joseph's brethren are correctly tight as the 144,000 that's the correct type because brother Ham tells us well here's there's the verse behold the days come saith the Lord God I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the North even in the east they shall run to and fro to seek the world Lord and shall not find it the world is the one that starving we're not starving we've got fresh bread men hallelujah the bride is not starving she's feasting on the Word of God she is at the run around the world she can get fresh bread right from her local church amen that's the way God designed it praise God now you can be blessed in a special services of course but the point is you don't have to wander all around you have to go somewhere else to get a revival you can get a revival right now praise God that's how God ordained it so see brother Branham repeatedly said Joseph the Old Testament types Jesus Christ for Messiah or Christ will reveal himself to his brother in the 144,000 so that it's the heir of either adding to the word or misinterpreting the word and the program says in the church age but plainly let's examine the life of Joseph while he was in Egypt for it is here where we see him as the perfect type of Christ not my son which we respect his son godly man a wonderful businessman wonderful does a tremendous job I love all those tracts I love the books it's it's true it's tremendous he does a fantastic job but brother I've never said that Joseph typed his son he never said that if you don't like the church age book here's another quote where it says the same thing in a regular sermon I see one before me now his name's Joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ he's born a prophet he was a prophet okay so see we you and I understand brother Brandon was a man and that had he had his own hopes I'm gonna show you some quotes this might shock you to put on your shock proof vest for a minute brother Branham wanted Billy Paul to be a preacher and a full prophet just like him he so badly wanted Billy Paul to see visions and even pray that God let Billy Paul see visions like me he also said his Joseph from the Minneapolis prayer experience was with him the whole time Billy Paul so you remember in Minnesota in Minneapolis no man was praying in the closet he just read about Joseph as the Lord what thank you for a man like Joseph and the Holy Spirit told him you're gonna have a Joseph that was around 1950 or 49 I can't member which one it was well in 1951 brother Branham thought that it was Billy Paul but at later God sent him an actual Joseph and I'm going to show you the quotes so see even prophets even God though God gives ambitions and things he doesn't always explain it he lets them wrestle it out see he puts us on the same basis right brother Ram didn't have it any easier than we have in fact he had it harder than we had because there's with more gifts come more responsibility look what he says my background being so sinful as I explained my people I'm gonna skip down and maybe my little boy would be a fully a prophet sent from God I pray to that so brother man would pray and this is a 1951 Joseph wasn't born till 55 so 1951 he's a his boy Billy Paul he's praying God make Milli Paul prophet then I went when I meet went to meet the little baby speaking of Sarah cuz say this Sarah was born in 51 a nurse from the Mayo I've been healed of cancer when the baby was brought come to meet it instead of the Spirit falling to the baby it fell back this way again and I believe it's just ahead of me what I've asked for I believe God has it just ahead I believe I'll see it and that's what I pray for so brother I was praying for the anointing of a prophet to fall on his son but then brother Ham had a daughter and so he said it didn't go on Sarah I went back to Billy Paul now you've all heard brother brother brother Billy Paul's testimony he's not a preacher and he's not a prophet and the church said but brother and prayed make him a full prophet just like you would pray right make my son or daughter or make them a real child of God give them all the spiritual gifts and blessings oh that's not he's not done my little boy with this now soon to be 16 years old this is Billy Paul he seemed to be a good boy he minded me was very lovely little fella I talked him about being baptized and making his public confession of Christ he live good at everything little fella but about a week after that I talked or walked into the house and he come without me asking him saying daddy I want to be a Christian I want to serve the Lord my Joseph was right with me when I didn't know it this little baby that I thought would be Joseph is a little girl and I called her Sarah so see brother man thought well this next baby's gonna be Joseph but it wasn't just a boy so he name is Sarah so in his mind he thought well maybe that experience I had maybe God was already telling me already had my Joseph with me he's wrestling with the will of God are glad to know that brother branham had to wrestle to understand God's will just like you do amen glory he's I've had my Joseph with me this whole time Billy Paul and it wasn't it wasn't he said I'm a boy and a girl either which way it went would be all right so I wanted a boy as far as he could be a minister of the gospel and I'll be that god is calling my little boy back there gonna be a minister of the gospel see bro Graham believed it but he wasn't called to be a minister thank you thank you seeing the wisdom of God now I understand if you ask God God will give you this out of your heart I don't believe it the little baby Sarah would have been born to have come up to the age of a minister Jesus will be here before that time I believe so brother BAM so he's so trying to make this make sense in his mind he's saying well yeah this this baby Sarah could not have been a boy because G is gonna be here before he's old enough to preach see how he's just try he's just trying to understand God's will for his life is there any sin in this no he never said thus saith the Lord this next baby is gonna be joseffer he never said the say Lord Billy Paul is gonna be a prophecy we've gotta let brother branham be brother branham be a man now look I've asked two of Joseph's close friends which they've told me I didn't ask them if they they told me they were Joseph's close friends as a child if he ever spoke thus say the Lord and both said no so it's just interesting just you know because brother Bram believed and prayed he would be a prophet now look what he prayed in 56 this is after Joseph is born and I trust that the prophetic or whatever may be the gift of God that has been so solemnly given will rest upon either Billy or Joseph or one what when I leave that God will continue the ministry after I pass beyond the scene has Joseph or Billy done the same ministry as brother Branham no they don't call up in a prayer line and discern and everybody rejoices and they get weak and the but he prayed it would happen and that's okay he who wouldn't want to see that gift continued now we all want to but God knew it wasn't God knew that son of man already been given to the Jews Samaritans and Gentiles and after that that was the last sign of the Gentiles and that was thus saith the Lord to see he prayed God just let this a ministry fall on Billy Paul or let it fall on Joseph and it hasn't look what he says here this isn't 57 all night long I couldn't get that opossum off my mind the next morning early I went out and I started out little Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe take my place someday little Rebecca was gonna take brother branham's place seeing visions she's seen her first vision just recently because she dreamed about the opossum all night and then God healed the opossum so brother man thought well perhaps she'll take my place someday she envisions I don't know if she did does anybody know do you know sister Karen okay I don't know I never heard of sister Rebeka having all kinds of dreams of vision I'm just saying I'm just trying to show you how brother Branham was a man and he wanted all of his children to take his place someday even his daughter Rebecca could come back this way now look he's got Rebecca up in the prayer line a little girl he said come back this way honey stop right here there's my little girl so who someday will be a prophetess also he just believed it he just hoped she'd be a prophetess but I you know I've never heard her say thus saith Lord has anybody ever heard Rebecca I know she's passed now but see this was just brother branham's desire I hope she's a prophetess someday he she saw a dream it happened she must be a prophet there's nothing wrong with that that was just his desire he didn't say they'll say the Lord she's gonna be he just said he hoped she would be so he had Rebekah come up and lay hands let my little girl lay hands on you there remember when she was a teenager she had the devil on her she slammed the door mother and said that was the devil slamming the door in her mom's face but here before the devil gets on her he has her praying in the prayer lines for sick people because he's a man let's let let's let brother man be a man so can everybody see that that the type of Joseph's camera I see that that doesn't fit the Bible that doesn't fit any quotes doesn't the Bible but that's something they believe in jeffersonville but that's fine they're allowed to believe whatever they want but I believe it gets dangerous because you start misusing types and shadows inhuman now you now you have beliefs that aren't exactly from the scripture and I say that with all the love in my heart I should you guys were there William and brother Aaron and brother Jose we were there we all talked about it you know a lot of these things when didn't come to my mind when they were the minutes of talking about it or else I would have brought him up but I did tell them I said well I said every word I don't leave everywhere as I said the Lord I said I said it takes the gift to rightly divide the word of truth that's what I told them because that was my that was my only question I had he said you have any questions I said yes I do is everywhere brother branham say thus saith the Lord and I was I was they were very nice they were some of the sweetest people you'd ever want to meet but see this is just where we're different and these are wins Church this is a win going around if you make Joseph a type of of Joseph of the Old Testament you've got all kits God got some chaos yeah some now you're starving and you you have to live off of them but that's the way nothing god never had it's not on earthly headquarters it's the heavenly headquarters amen we appreciate that the printing and the DVDs in the micro SD card we appreciate all that but we do not lean on them our headquarters is in heaven or our leader sits on the throne in heaven amen see but that type can exalt Joseph to take in the place of Christ in people's lives and we all we've all heard of people that knew that there's a brother in Guyana who was at the meetings we preached back in 2000 was a 2008 the first time I went and he's now left preaching and not only plays tapes and he basically takes every word Joseph says is thus saith the Lord and he won't forbid people to be in baptize you know by any other anyone else except him they got to come through the Joseph Church now most people are not like that I'm just giving you example if you don't take these things these wins of doctrine are gonna carry people farther and further away from the Word of God is that okay it's with love and you brothers know that we love though those are some of the sweetest people you want to meet so the second thing is it's recently come about every word they say is thus saith the Lord and when we were there the three brothers are witnesses they believed that their they believed every word is they'll say the Lord because they're fearful they don't want to take away anything they're not sure what is the sale order what isn't so they just make it all the saith the Lord but see we by fear we live by faith God is not giving us a spirit of fear and I think that was the exact word he used I think he said I'm scared we're scared that we don't want to make something not thus saith Lord if it is so see we don't want to live by fear now I understand they might be saying godly fear but still you can't make every word a man says born in sin you can't make a man infallible who's born in sin Jesus Christ was born by the Holy Ghost amen he wasn't born in sin it's a whole different story to see but I appreciate that respect I do I do so Salman brother Anna's family are on record and bold about saying every word he said was thus saith the Lord I have the links if you want to view them there's there's two links online so this is an air it's either a serious air due to immaturity of precious persons or see Antichrist spirit deifying William Branham stealing the worship from Jesus Christ so all that's needed is just the repentance I'm sorry I just got off the word the same thing happened when brother Branham was on the earth they they believed he was the Messiah you know so they asked now we've gone through this many times they asked brother Branham did you announce that a million African Americans would be killed because brother man had mentioned that earlier that Martin Luther King jr. would lead them to a deathtrap and he said I always told you be careful see that's just the human side he says always if there's anything that goes forth it will speak it's thus saith the Lord brother Mannis said no I was just talking about Martin Luther King jr. and then he says I have no prophecy on this I have nothing on it from the Lord he but when he speaks it I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord he said I don't know about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say that's just my opinion just like Rebecca she's gonna be a prophetess and she'll take my place someday that's just his opinion Billy Paul is my Joseph that was just his opinion does every understand in 1962 people were saying brother Branham they were saying brother Branham says you can men can leave your wives and hunt for a spiritual mate and then I'm perfectly infallible there's he said Oh some of the awfulest things you ever heard he said then they were prophesying saying one man should leave his wife and go marry another and now this church knows that we don't stand for tommyrot as that it's tommyrot when you say every word he says is thus saith the Lord and I'm not being critical this didn't come to me I wish it would came to me when we were sitting there I would have shared that with this I wish it just innit it didn't I was nervous and I just I want to be respectful and I really wanted to CERN his spear like rubberband said discern his spirit got a good spirit but just off the word scared fearful that's what that's what discerned to me that's what the Holy Spirit in me discerned they're just fearful they just maybe they don't well they obviously they don't have the gift to rightly divide the word so it's awful it's tommyrot when you make but everything brother branham says thus saith the lord because he's the only one that says everything he says is infallible praise God he's the only one the Lord Jesus I remember brother man mix things up on tapes one time he said there were seven weeks between the feast of weeks and the trumpets he said how he said I'll probably hear from it he knew he made mistakes often on tape so he says I always hear from it when I make a mistake on the tape he said but if you happen to catch it on your tape remember look in the Bible if there's a mistake Church just look in the Bible see it doesn't we don't to be scared we should just make sure remember the Bible says what must have preacher do he must study and make himself approved unto who God Jesus so a minister does not come preach until he's been in the prayer closet with Christ and Christ has approved this message he just doesn't guess and hope this is the right thing he gets in there the spirit anointing he comes out here preaches it to the people and the sheep rejoice the Sheep er fed they're edified they're strengthened that's God's Way praise God but it takes a gift to do that takes a gift of God now God knows I never thought I was gonna be a pastor you can ask my wife she knew me in high school did you ever think I was gonna be a pastor honey no nope so it's just a gift of God it was laying in there the whole time and just had to wait on the Lord and he brought it out it's God's Way buh-bam says the absolute is the holy spirit he'll not share his glory with anyone it's our ability only belongs to its Christ who not share that with anyone else so Cobra ham says the evil spirits will not reason when someone is and we've seen this you know recently in our church and other times you know in the past as well when someone has the evil spirit they will not move from their position they're so convinced they're right they won't repent now somebody repents that means they just got off of the line a little bit and God's delivered to them of that evil spirit but if they will not repent of it it's because an evil spirits on them and anyone that says you know they believe every word brother Branham said they don't believe every word man said if they got an evil spirit on them bro BAM said there was people worshipping him and they said the men believe me they said they believed every word I said how do you believe me then if I tell you then we got the word then we got to the word then they begin to see well sure we didn't believe you or we'd have listened to what you said so we could only say we believe brother Branham when we do what he tells us to do program says see they actually thought they were right sincerely and one of them spirits gets on you that's got it see you'll absolutely believe it I don't care you nobody can tell you any different that's when you know someone has a real demon on them you can't you can't reason with them you can't talk about it they're just fully off the word because they worship that thing they worship that demon no matter how much the word says so you just won't believe it anyhow if you want to be that way go ahead I'm having my own way see it shows you're anointed with the wrong spirit that's why we always got to be humble Church no matter what we believe Lord make me humble that I can be corrected if I'm wrong but prove it by the mouth of two or three witnesses so how do you know what's thus saith the Lord well brother Branham will say thus saith the Lord or like they did before they had prophets how did that how did John Wesley know he had thus saith the Lord how did Martin Luther know he had the state the Lord because he had in the mouth of two or three witnesses in the Bible and his preaching if rightly divided that that was the word of truth he was not a prophet so how did he know he had to take it back to this scripture by the Word of God the Holy Spirit did it by the word the two or three witnesses God anointed it that's how he knew it was thus saith the Lord praise God there's no fear because God has given us the spirit of power love and a sound mind I hope you don't come to church fearful you come to church fearful you you and I better sit down we better open our Bibles and have a good Bible buy a good Bible study I'm not about a big long Bible study because as far as I know I haven't preciate anything wrong and if I have and somebody come show me about it I don't come to church scared other than just let you know fear in God's presence you know wanting to please God when I don't come but you're scared I come to church under the anointing I've I've got my message approved of God as I was just studying I prayed I fasted I've skipped meals I know where I'm at I know what God showed me and I'd only bring what God has shown me amen and if I if it's something I don't know I'd say yeah this is my opinion this is my thought on I could be wrong this is my thought thoroughly it misinterpreting the message brother man preach called what house will you build me I forgot me yeah build me sorry so in this message one of my Rams children claimed that brother Branham doesn't have a place in the pulpit say and I disagree brother Branham has his message has a place in this pulpit I only preach his message praise God but here's I want you to hear the literal quote from November 2015 he said let's read between the lines and I have the link here if you want listen to it it is not so today that in this message it's the same thing if you try to encourage a minister to play the tapes in their church you are so misunderstood brother Branham doesn't have a pulpit he doesn't have a place he's not welcome no more we need a they say we need a live ministry and this brother says the tapes is the lightest ministry there is so their claim is that playing a tape is more of a live ministry than live preachers and I disagree I just humbly disagree with that brother Branham never taught that brother BAM said when I'm he never said when I'm gone you just play all the tapes because my ministry is more alive than yours he never said that so see again it's misinterpreting the word or miss misunderstanding brother Branham and the Word of God because remember now my wife was reading and shared us with me and about blew me out of my seat here look at when Moses is dying look what look what God said get the up in this mountain of Abram and see the land which I've given unto the children of Israel and when that was seen it that also shall be gathered with our people as Aaron thy brother was gathered for he rebelled against my commandment the deserts of Zin in the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before their eyes that is the water of Mara ba and kadish in the wilderness of zin so remember Moses couldn't go over because he lifted up himself and Moses spake and Lord saying let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh what's his last prayer said a man over the congregation not that was a stone right which may go out before them which may go in before them and may lead them out and which may also bring them in that the congregation Lord be not as sheep which have no Shepherd so the tables have stone themselves the ark themselves alone was not enough they had the ark the ark was God's presence but that wasn't enough Moses said give them a man to lead them give them a living man I'm gonna die give them a living man and how we know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we've got the Ark you know we got the word we got the Holy Ghost we've got that but God says set a man to lead them the living people need to see a living testimony hallelujah Amen exactly right God doesn't want sheep having no Shepherd you and I were sheep we've got to have a shepherd we've gotta have somebody to lead us some voice some single voice to lead the Sheep of God amongst all these wolves and he sent before him Aliza the priest and before all the congregation and give him charge of the sight of God in their sight and thou shalt put some of I honor amen but some of Moses is anointing on the next man hallelujah and that all the congregation of children Israel may be obedient so put some holy anointing on Joshua like it was on Moses so that the people will obey God's man amen that's our desire is just for God for the people to see me just I'm just God's man I just want to be God's man I just want all the people to obey or be into one thing and that's the message of the hour amen and I've seen I've seen enough supernatural to know enough that God's anointed me and give me a little bit of honor I got about this much on her brother branham he's got about I got about this much but I'll take whatever God gives now I'm happy about it like I said last week I'll just double that honor honest invest in that honor so much maybe I'll double that praise God then he can let me rule over two cities or whatever you know whatever God would have we just want to be faithful with what God's given us so that's the scripture you know you know that they did it in front of all the congregation that's why brother Brooks ordained me to be the pastor here somebody a before me who ordained me here that's that's why this is the type this is what you do and then one man moves on and he places and he places his hands on him and ordains it for the people praise God Deborah understand all right now this is of course he took okay he took Joshua ordained him I'm gonna skip past that so here's the exact quote when you shut that prophet out of the pulpit and say that's not a live ministry I've got something to tell you Dimas I mean this person name calls anyone who doesn't play tapes cause them Dimas now I'm her Dimas left Paul because he loved the present world more they loved the message of the hour see now we're getting serious here we're getting name called D misses because we don't play tapes and we have live preachers now to be fair later on the same message the the preacher says which he calls himself a preacher the preacher says you know we're not to condemn people we need to pray for people that are different than us which is good but I just I want to let you know there's name-calling going on but I'm I know I'm going to get it for that but I'm not against nothing but I'm for this word I'm poor this message I'm for this prophet in this is his pulpit his pulpit I'm glad I got a revelation that that's my revelation that's his message amen we're not a demas Church I've left all the things in the world to follow Paul's message I'm not following the things of the world I've left everything I used to be in the world I've left the world I know that I left the world I know the kind of like the devil knows the life I live amen he knows what kind of life I live all that I give to this how I love the word how I love Jesus Christ and just want to do what's right for Jesus Christ I haven't left the things of God I'm right with the things of God hey man and that's okay you know maybe I made a mistake sometime and you know maybe I named called somebody Lord forgive me I never want to couldn't I don't name call anybody so III I could offer forgiveness I can I can be kind and sweet to brother branham never said every pulpit was his if you take it the right way I'll balance it out so my dad said I'm I like this our brother Smith here I thought maybe he was speaking to me maybe he said I met him your pastor a lovely brother I don't say that because I'm standing in his pulpit but he is I hope I'm a lovely brother so maybe in here now the next one he said usually I have the courtesy not to mention doctrine in a man's pulpit see but you see brother I never said every pulpits mine I've never said when I'm gone you make every pulpit my pulpit and play tapes and nobody preaches he never said that now brother Brad let me balance it out cuz bro Ram did say every pulpit is the Evangelist but he said the world is their pulpit too so if evangelist just want to preach from here there's more to the world than just this pulpit right here how about go down in the corner and preach a little bit how about go to the park and preach a little bit how about preached by the business center down there how about preach outside of Giant Eagle so see the ax man just goes to all the world so your Pope it's the whole world yes sir 31 years I've stood behind the desk here and around the world as I have claimed the world to be my pulpit so see we gotta balance it brother man says you know I'm evangelist so the whole world is my pulpit but he was never saying well I every Pope it's mine and I'm the only one who needs to preach he never said that now look what he says in 57 he tells the church he says the foam complete authority the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see that's not the Bible order there's no one above the outer I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville so he would seal he wasn't really the pastor there because he says it's between you and the pastor even in the Branham Tabernacle because he was not the pastor he was out being evangelist so see he never exalted himself into a position that wasn't according to the word okay I hope that's I hope that's okay I hope you understand that he said now to carry on we've got to put footprints here on the sands of time that others can see if Paul had it had went on the way he did then John would have known how to follow if John hadn't followed or went on the on Polycarp when I have known out of foul if Polycarp when that went on Iranian would have known how to follow if I rainiest wouldn't have went on Martin wouldn't have known how to follow see what I mean each one has to put footprints on the sands of time so the idea that only tapes should be played from every pulpit was not what brother Branham was teaching in the sermon what house will you build me in 1965 brother Branham was not saying every pulpit was his this is out of context it's not rightly divided it's possible this family member maybe is not a faith for gifted preacher as he's name calling I don't know you know perhaps he just made a mistake but at the end of this sermon what house will you build me brother branham ordained Perry green as the pastor and then sat down and let the pastor preach and you can read it in that book I gave you actually the Prophet read it it's in there brother brother Peregrine explains the whole thing so see the current the current Brandon family is trying to say well see he know Perry green was trying to let brother ran him up there so so that that all the churches today know we're supposed to let brother Ram have this pulpit but in reality brother Branham was just here's what he was saying he said I just want to make a few announcements when brother Ham stepped up there it was just for announcements it wasn't even to preach but see they they they so misinterpret the quotes to fit their own agenda you see France I'm just gonna make a few announcements I don't want to take brother Green's time here what I thought every pulpit was his pulpit I don't want to take the pastor's time is what he's saying you see and you see how slick it is you see I I'm sorry I should say slick I want to make it sound like they're doing on purpose the pore pressures people probably are not doing on purpose they're probably just deceived yeah yeah that's right there you go it's like the sick of the devil is but I just want you to see that there it's it's it's it if you really study these things ya be real careful we got to take everything we hear back to the word now at the end of the sermon I'm not gonna I'm gonna skip that one but the end of sermon brother Peregrine says brother Ram can you ordain me and then he prays he says god bless you brother Perry carry the Word of God and brother Perry preach the message after that so see there's no hidden message in what house will you build me where brother I'm saying see I need to be back in every pulpit and every public that doesn't have in me he's not a true church he's not saying that he's actually establishing biblical apostolic authority that we already have that's what he's actually doing let me try to finish your mom I'm just going for him brother I'm never ordained brother Nevel or Peregrine to play tapes in his absence that never happened at the brown tabernacle they always had a live preacher preaching in fact brother Neville did live preaching fulfilling the dream of sister Collins who saw brother Neville serving the most delicious food that had been serving all long live preaching of the Bible revelation of the message and this is on the tape you can hear this on the tape where brother man says sister Collins dreamed a dream here at the church and there's a feeding a wedding fixing to take place aren't you glad you're a part of that wedding amen hallelujah and when she did she saw the bridegroom coming perfect but the bride wasn't very perfect yet it was the bride so now that's the church and there was like a communion a service going on like a dinner being set and it kind of got next her because that brother Neville was serving a dinner in the church but she said it was the best food she'd ever seen she was so hungry but she thought maybe that in the dream that she shouldn't he shouldn't serve it and she and brother Willer was going to go to the ranch house and eat and when they did the light on the right side went out now you know what that is my man tells us what that is now the food the bride isn't perfect but the bridegroom is perfect the bride is not perfect yet but the food that was being given was not literal food it's the spiritual food that you've been having all along amen glory so that's what's actually happening when program was out preaching brother Neville was preaching the message and God liken it unto brother Neville feeding the most delicious Starbucks and giant eagle you could ever eat that's my favorite you might be McDonald's or Wendy's but the most delicious food you could think of was the preaching of the message of brother brand and this is in 62 the seals aren't even open yet that means the glory of the Godhead and water baptism and serpent seed church ages all these revelations are delicious spiritual food amen and it's the most delicious food on the earth hallelujah and it wasn't playing a tape it was the preaching another man anointed with the same anointing as that man the same honor was upon this man and it's the greatest food they could ever eat amen but look see there's that spirit the tabernacle she was going to leave and I better go up to the ranch house to eat because as preachers serving me live preaching see on that spear hangs around you see that the spirit hangs around I'm scared of a preacher preaching me a live preacher preaching the message I better leave this church and go eat somewhere else brother Branham says no this is the food you've been receiving all along well glory to God thank you Jesus don't you love the Lord I love this message it doesn't get off the Word of God it stays in the Word of God now look how brother man so in 1965 this is August 28th brother Neville preached the morning message and brother BAM listing that mighty message this morning brother Neville brought us so brother ant would sit there and listen to brother Neville the pastor and they'd get up and say that was a mighty message he preached why'd he say sit down brother Neville play my tapes why did he say that because that's not apostolic pattern look what he said did you know brother did you know a brother Neville had a radio broadcast where he preached every Sunday did you know that I'm sorry Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9:30 he preached for 30 minutes every Saturday on the radio well brother Jesse you should stay off YouTube and you should stop trying to reach in those people by preaching should I or should I keep trying to reach people look what he says thank you brother Neville is understood that the Neville trio is one of the best true is the nation's sure that's right I doubt that brother never says I doubt that brother brand the congregation laughs now how many heard the broadcast yesterday I'm an old veteran preachers over 20 years old and I've heard lots of sermons Bible I heard one of the most appropriate sermons for the day that we're living I heard it yesterday by our pastor brother Neville you who missed that you missed a great treasure that was dearly in my heart now he only had 30 minutes to preach it so he had to sing in there the trio had to sing they had to do announcements and he had to preach so it wasn't even a full thirty thirty minute sermon and he said that was a treasure for this day in 1957 now brother Neville's announced with this program on his program rather I wish that every listener would listen to that program why do you say listen just to my tapes don't listen to a live preacher don't listen to radio preaching he said no now he doesn't tell me this but I never was so blessed in listening to a program as I was last Saturday how many heard that message that was a masterpiece WL RP 9 o'clock until 9:30 each Saturday morning the Neville Trio and I was speaking to the brother who takes the recordings brother Leo which is in the room and he says so carried away with it that he didn't he said say who is this preacher he was he said he has the radio hun and brother gene or some of them said his brother Neville this is his time and it really was wonderful not only that but everyone he so supported the local pass from the ministry every sermon he preached is wonderful this one in particular was a masterpiece it's delicious food isn't a church isn't the message delicious food to you don't you enjoy the food of God that he's feeding you the message the hour oh I tell you the reason I love to hear brother Neville preach not mainly because he's a good preacher but because I know that he lives what he preaches now rather you would live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be more effective brother Branham is it true that no one should preach but you mercy no every man that feels a call of God on his life getting the ministry start preaching we need them why didn't he say no you should just play tapes we need live preachers who are preaching the Word of God he says any man that's anointed all the world should preach the gospel I'm just one bable any man that Scott called of God needs to preach the gospel last one I'm trying to close your eye really I'm trying to push my 45 minutes up oh I got three more minutes okay I like wow that's I've been trying to go fast on purpose I don't hear you guys I wear myself out is this helping my God's grace you see I hear these things Church and I mean I'm in here in these the last three years I'm just kind of storing them up josè knows we've talked about it over and over again I've been storing them up on waiting for the right time to preach it but I felt like this would be a good time you know when we're all back in and we're all church family again and there's no more or just right back to our regular selves it kind of all came together so I hope this is helpful because we remember Jesus said it's gonna be so close it would deceive the very elect Evora possible now that's between that's between wise virgin and foolish virgin because the why the foolish version are gonna do try to get the oil oh we're gonna get the Holy Ghost we're here the Holy Ghost but the wise already got it amen she's already got it praising if you know got it get it now praise the Lord because they're gonna start getting in Simon sent me a video of a woman preacher in Dallas and she's she's holding up brother branham's supernatural books and telling the tent I can share the video if you want with with you and she take a whole hour to preach about the ministry brother Branham and she was saying that this ministry she said she had a dream and the Lord told her this ministry is gonna repeat itself with a double anointing and so she's praying for a church well let's receive that anointing from brother branham's ministry that foolish version is trying to get the oil so where should we be at now maybe 10 more years maybe 2030 it could be a hundred years it don't matter but the fact is they're looking at the message saying my that's a mighty move of the Holy Spirit we want that we want that we should be saying we've got it give us more of it praise God I don't have enough I wasn't Laura praise God it's the most delicious food Lord I'm not gonna complain about your table he's even brother Neville in 57 without all the seals revelations were still feeding the most delicious food could possibly eat thus water baptism and Godhead in Church ages it's so delicious hallelujah oh I think I know where I'm standing Church so this last one is again I believe Rome tape boys or the fivefold ministry head here's the quote this is from September about a year ago yeah you're going they say the message to the hour is the spirit and I agree the Holy Spirit will show us what the message is from the Bible but in the the message of the rapture BAM said the the message is the scripture that's God fulfilling right now that's the message the scripture God is fulfilling right now by the Holy Spirit is the message of the hour that's the message it is the token Rahab as a type of the bride's day in the well some tape boy slipped in there which is speaking of Jericho the two spies that went to Jericho that's what those two messengers did that's for the bride she had to show her token she said I'm a tape Church that's the token well I thought the message I thought the spear was a token but now you're making a fake Church the the token which one is it is it your tape Church or is it the Holy Spirit which one is it so now they got two tokens see but they wouldn't say that but that's what they've created I'd say it's really important to say we're a taped Church see this pressure they're putting on the people where we preach the token is the baptismal he goes you must be sealed unto the day of your Redemption not just to the next revival the day of your Redemption amen you know seal Satan out we put so much pressure on that but now they're putting pressure the token is the tape Church and I can let you listen to it I'd listen to it myself yesterday I listened to it I typed out I stopped it every ten seconds to talk about all these words for you that's how much I want you to know what they're saying this is not it's not this is not the truth of God this is their opinion but they're okay it's allowed to have your own opinion we just want to show respect and love let me say though something every church in this message wanted or not you're a tape Church if you believe this message you're a tape Church that's just the way it is we are a real Chait tape Church he also told us the way of the fivefold ministry I believe in a true fivefold ministry men he said men preach this message but they got to catch the vision that you've got to play the tapes or this this brother saying every message preacher that's still preaching hasn't caught the vision of the Holy Spirit yet that playing the tapes is the token hmm he says you've got to when you say that that's going to bring a lot of controversy and the devil's been beating me up on this he said all week why would the devil beat him up about saying that I think it was to me and just I think that was just his conscience his own conscience was beating him up because it was wrong a tape Church is not the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the token there's a true five in a false five fold and then this is this parts good you know this preacher went through all the false doctrine so this is why people are clinging to tape churches now because they've seen so much trash with millenniums on now polygamy Purusha seven thunders all the mistakes in the message all these things are saying now look now this is dangerous and look what it says what was the commission of the angel - brother Graham to get the people to believe you they say I believe it I don't care what's on them tapes I believe it now that is dangerous that's blind faith like that that means I'm not even gonna take it back to the Bible we've had a family leave this church because I said that I said my absolute is the Bible cuz that's her brother Bramson well the man said God's ultimate is the Bible amen God's ultimate is the Bible other words God won't do anything outside this word God what's your absolute the tapes no God would say my absolute is my word the tapes contain a lot of the words absolutes but not everything on the tape is the absolute but see this is and the people go to rejoicing shouting I deposit and just listen to clapping for a minute that time then they'll say okay sit down sit down sit down Center that's that's not my brother Anton's brother man said to take everything he said take it back to the word he said if I've got it wrong he said show me in the scripture I'm wrong you see that and this is a big movement this is huge he said I don't I understand I know now this is this part is true if God gives you a revelation if God gives you revelation you don't have to explain it understand it just believe it but that's not true for every word on programs tapes you can't say that because he was not infallible so see they encouraged blind faith because they're so scared of getting into seven thunders or so scared of getting in this or that they just encouraged blind faith then see and here's what I think they exalt brother brand they say there's no greater anointing than when it's coming from the voice of God in other words preacher sit down my brother Brandon preach there's no greater anointing than that now I'll say this brother Rams anointing was way way more than any preacher I've ever known and that's why it should be he's one of the stars in the he's one of seven stars in the hand of Jesus nobody's gonna top that anointing but just playing a tape is not guarantee the anointing even if you play a tape you've got to believe what the tape is saying praise God but God's way to raise faith is not by just a tape of playing of a dead person it's by a live preacher who's under the anointing of the Holy Spirit as a leader to the people raising their faith that's God's pattern a noise has been that pattern it'll always be God's pattern amen that's the way to do it but of course tapes can raise your faith but see how they exalt he's the only voice he's greatest anointing no greater voice yet brother Branham says the voice will be in the bride at the end time brother Brad said and look away to Jesus I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ of the world he knew he knew he's going off the scene he said I may not do it so he didn't the message are two separate things he's a man the message is God's revelation of this hour amen I'm almost done let me see just to make you see give you a comfort and let me let me put a smile on your face I only got a few more slides ago yeah maybe ten for the smile of my face - they say Joshua's fivefold ministry was his messengers the tape boys that fivefold ministry went and a woman found they found the woman that believed brother Branham never said the tape boys were the fivefold ministry in the sermon the token he did say the tape boys went out to find Rahab in the token but he never said they were the fivefold ministry I looked it up so in Joshua's day the two messengers did not replace Aaron's priesthood they wouldn't only pointed to it there was only forgiveness through the blood that that ministry offered the same today so they're they're exalting you know they're assaulting the two messengers for Rahab they're exalting them greater than the priesthood of Aaron but you can't do that the waters of separation in order for Ray had to get in the church he had to come to the waters of separation and go see the priest just like everybody else amen to see they add to the word and then see that starts breaking all the other word because they're adding their own interpretation to it well you can get Holy Ghost sealed and sanctified without a preacher just play a tape no you can't it's always through the body how did the Holy Ghost move did the Holy Ghost move by just reading the letters of Paul no Paul went and preached right Peter went and preached and the Holy Ghost fell a live preacher that's how the but that's how life moves from one living vessel to another praise God right the exact quote then they played her Rahab a tape and that's what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do don't condemn them pray for them so I like this you know he's saying don't condemn those that preaches pray for them but but then again we're called you know demons and things like that so our thing is not to call names back just to love and pray just keep loving your heart so there seems to be a great confusion about what the message is there group sees it as every word on every tape but they also claim it's the Holy Spirit it can't be both for their mistakes on the tapes as brother man often admitted and then there's only three quotes on tape services and two of them brother Ram says go to a church the third the the people had no church by them so he said okay go ahead and play a tape if you have no church around you yeah go ahead and play a tape but if you have a church around you remember brother Branham said if they only believe one thing that Jesus was divine all the rest of us wrong I'd go to that church brother and would not sit home and play tapes if they just took if the Catholic Church's believe one thing that Jesus was God I'll go to that church amen that was brother branham's example you never encouraged Oh get away from all the preachers just go to the tape service he never encouraged that he said if I can't get a hold off I'll take a slice I hope you got a whole loaf this morning I was studying like I was gonna preach a whole loaf this morning is that's what I felt and show him that I'm doing my part I'm gonna go listen worship and show him I'm doing my part I want him to know I'm alive I want everybody to know what side I'm on now this is a quote where brother I was talking about Gina Leo they moved out to Arizona and started the church and they used to make tapes program said what a greater thing God has did for them than to make tape see it takes guidance of the Holy Spirit to guide a little group to go like this this morning and keep them together in harmony unity and still clean to the message now we know they later got off the word tremendously but program was making the point it's a greater thing to Pastor a flock and guide people than it is just to make tapes it's a greater thing because barbra have said the minister has the highest office in the world there's no higher office one time I text that to somebody who's a tape person he said no you're wrong show me that quote I send the quote he said I stand corrected I said well I appreciate your humility we're not just shooting off the hip and I wonder if rogram said this this is this is what he preached and then most importantly this is what he lived this is what brother Branham lived this is the apostolic order I think this might be my last one so many people writes me questions about divorce marriage and divorce and the tangle the church I always refer them back and say ask your pastor people wrote me letters what about this what about that I refer the letter back you'll get it your see your pastor on those things because after all he's your shepherd he's the one that God sent to watch over you and we might disagree about it and then that will cause a confusion the last thing Moran wanted was confusion in the local churches so he didn't want to put his voice in there if a pastors preaching something different he wanted to all the sheep to be in one Accord he didn't want confusion amongst the people of God now I like it - I like it I'll say this I like what other preachers come in and I'm not here and then they'll preach something I like when the brothers whoever asked me about it when I'm back I like that cuz I because that means you you you really are being very respectful and you want to know what I think about that I like that because you know we might differ on little things but I like how you asked me that because we don't want any confusion we all want to be in one Accord all right so I'd rather tell your pastor to tell rather your pastor tell you about marriage and divorce he's God's servant to and he's equipped to do that I think I got a couple more now remember Brown did not consider himself the past of every believer I know it's been long hot no member cuz he says this he says I won't always be your pastor in future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride allow those you know all these people in Jeffersonville they say brother Branham is their pastor he can't be because he's not living you have to be living to be a pastor now you'll keep that if your that's your office yeah you'll keep that forever you know Samuel say to prophet but a dead man can't be your pastor so have you a living pastor someone who can watch over your soul remember the Good Samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him into the end that's the church so this is the hospital of sin or Fe and gave the man their two pence and told him if he needed any more he'd pay him when he come so the pastors got two pence he's able to doctor up if he's a man of God if he's a man of God that stands on the Word of God he's got what God give him the spirit and the word hallelujah is that right how is it were to worship in spirit and in truth and the word is the truth is that right so do we come to church to be doctored that's how we should come so Malachi when you're ready just come to the piano here I believe that is alasc yep that's the last one I just had to get this off my heart was it a blessing Church are you understand and this as I said this is not to attack anybody I'm not gonna miss I'm not gonna name call anybody but I am gonna call out the effects of what these false doctrines do they're gonna cause confusion chaos eventually something's gonna come up because they're breaking the Word of God either exalting brother Branham too high like I said breaking the word something has to happen there has to be a there's a sowing of a bad seed there has to be a reaping somewhere and we've seen it with all the other moves something's gonna happen I don't know but you just gotta give it time he's got to pray with love in our hearts so I hope this was a blessing by the grace of God this is why I so have a burden for the local church his brother Brandon had such a burden for the local church hey man because he was a true prophet he was a Bible prophet praise the Lord well I hope this takes away any confusion ready any anything any misunderstandings about anything I just want to be clear with what brother BAM taught here let's just bow our heads here Heavenly Father thank you for your grace oh I've gone a little over it's already one o'clock for each hour and a half thank you Lord for your mercy Lord God your word promises and if the true fivefold ministry preaches they will not fail they'll be overcomers and all seven of those blessings will occur Lord that's my prayer for this church I just wanted them to see we have nothing to worry about we should be swayed by other voices and other movements we should look for a bonfire movement of the Holy Ghost in our home church hey Laurie a revival after revival going on in our church how do I know you Jesus father this is your word I was trying to defend it or stay with it be painful to it I believe you prove this message to me as I studied and prayed yesterday and actually for months now off and on I've studied myself to prove that the God as a workman rightly dividing the word thank you Jesus [Music] ah Lord let these Saints be able to stand where there's no winds of John driving them around and then be mature let them grow up speak the truth of love and all things and edify build up one another in love the love of Jesus Christ we thank you Lord for your great mercy thank you for your long-suffering and all ripe rain what I have I don't believe most of these people that believe these things put them out there I don't believe they're bad people they're sweet people loving I devoted dedicated sweet and wonderful people lord I just pray you'd help them or not to see what is the truth and what you're coughin at your topic may they have a revelation of Christ hey thank you help us Lord to be an example Church up us the low enough note each other every respect forgive always say nice things about what they love what another [Music] let us be real sanctified Holy Ghost filled sense looking for the coming of Jesus Christ and if you tarry may we leave footprints on these Akron sands that the next generation can know how to serve Jesus Christ Alleluia amen thank you for those who have before us Perry green these other brothers who have gone before us and paved the way it showed us what your prophet said and what the Bible says do not thank you look your great mercy love you all declare in Jesus Christ's name 'search said I feel like ah burdens lifted I've been wanting to warn you for like two years I can now feel I just wanted to get that off and if you have any questions if you want to watch those videos you're more than welcome just make just keep a good spirit about yourself we're no better than anybody church bird you are we Who am I let the Lord all the
