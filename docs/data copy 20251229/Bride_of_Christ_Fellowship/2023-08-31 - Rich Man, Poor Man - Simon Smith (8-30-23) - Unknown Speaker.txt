Samuel sorry 2 Samuel I'm sorry 1st Samuel chapter 2 1st Samuel chapter 2 1 Samuel chapter 2 let's read verse 1 through 8 here and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoices in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the Lord there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock likee unto our God

to their wedding that was one sweet wedding I want to tell you I just talked about it all the way home I was I think I told who I told many people about said I just went to this the tiny wedding it

thank you for the invitation that was and we're excited for the Newly Weds and all that the special times as the prophet go I call that I would call that a golden memory so anyhow let's get into this uh word here I want to focus tonight and I I could do a PowerPoint but I'm not going to I do have a little thing you know life takes us by storm and um and sometimes I think I spoke too soon when I became a come to the message of the hour and became a real Christian you know one that tried to live clean and righteous and I always told the Lord I said Lord whatever you put before me I'll do it you know and there's a lot put before me and I try to do all of it which is overwhelming and uh we don't I'm I'm trying to just take it it's a struggle to cut back you know and uh you don't want to do it uh but I trust the Lord sees our my heart you know and we want to do things for his glory to help others to be an example of a Christian Spirit you know one willing to sacrifice and give what they can and do what they can for for others so I'd like to speak tonight by the grace of God on a topic called Rich Man Poor Man and my brother Paul is the the youngest of six and he's a uh he's a business major a finance major uh growing up and seeing the man that he's become has really impressed me he's very very I would call very successful in uh the the area he lives in uh his salary and and his mindset I watch him I I in a way I'm envious of the way he's built you know he's a he thinks bigger than you know most me I from a from the beginning you know I just always uh even when I was in college I I want to be a teacher and uh science teacher and then uh and then uh the Lord called me out of that and I just do Bible studies I teach the Bible and uh but I watch my younger brother and and I watch how he deals with finances I watch how he do does business and he told me he said he said brother he goes I listen to a book I read a book called a rich uh Rich Dad Poor Dad that's where I kind of got the inspiration of this uh uh uh study and in this book he the man I didn't read it but he just I'm just break this down from what Paul said he just showed me how the man was uh bringing kind of Parables and showing U the difference between as growing up as a son or maybe as a daughter I'll say like that growing up and being under a certain man okay brother Malachi is blessed to have a father uh many had the fathers here blessed by God's grace to have a man under uh uh you were under and has watched and have learned and how to be maybe a dad how however you say like that then um but as in the book it would probably go that a man would watch a young boy would watch how a father and he would deal with a poor father and a a father who was always poor and he he'd make this bad decision he'd make this bad decision he'd do this business deal wrong or he would always quit his jobs or this or that or however and the man uh and this young man would always and he grew up underneath a Poor Dad and then uh the other and another analogy another boy would grow up and he was under a manity he watched his father uh who had amassed all this wisdom in life and maybe he went to college and he studied hard and he learned about finances and he learned about uh equations and how the compound interest and and how to make business deals and how to do this and this and how that man would uh go and flip this house and go and uh uh do this and do that with the the the wisdom and the mind that God gave him in the board just watching and seeing and the example that this man this wise man would set before this boy would in turn show him what a rich dad would do what how in other words now that I'm a young man I can see and watch and learn from my father who's very very rich and and and and and I like this and a wise man a wise young man would go before his Rich Dad and and and and say Dad and and he would I I like I like this when I was young in apprenticeship I would go to my boss and say Chuck what about what would I do in this situation why because I wanted his wisdom I wanted his knowledge I wanted to understand how this worked I want to understand how a closed system heating would work a a closed heating system work how a closed plumbing system would work and how how an open system would work and what what is about this and what about that and I learned and I had to watch many times a very I was like this learning you have to be very patient because he's not going to let you take over a job right away he's not going to let you just jump right in and you're the man in charge you have to be very very the the the the eagerness the desire to become what someone much knowledgeable uh uh someone who has much experience takes time yes yes sir you have to make many many mistakes you might have to make a thousand mistakes to make that one most important decision right to make that decision the right decision there and that will just shoot you like a rocket into who knows what kind of spheres right right amen and dealing with this topic of a Rich Man Poor Man I I was thinking about this and I thought and many thoughts were coming to my M mind you know and but one thing I noticed in the scripture because I went I tried to bring it back to the scripture and I know this might be simple but I want you to apply this to your lives amen amen notice what when Hannah prayed she was in the spirit because how do you know she was in the spirit because it's recorded as the word of God that's right amen and this actually was a prophecy this is literally she was she was literally in full like as full I like as the holy the Holy Ghost was upon her right yes sir I'll say like that just like David was was was playing the harp and the Holy Ghost was upon me he brought forth the words of God Amen notice in in in Genesis 4:1 when Eve said gotten a man from the Lord and never said that she was in prayer and in fasting or she was playing a harp she just spoke out but here we see a woman who is seeking the very face of God in the house of God Amen right and it said the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich and bringeth low and lifteth up amen right amen amen now here's something you have to do in your life each one of you at a certain age a certain position in life a certain uh uh Blue Collar White Collar high collar low collar no collar whatever you want to [Laughter] say and you are are who you are for a reason sister could you pull up this scripture I want to show you the scripture yes Ecclesiastes 9 10 and 11 and I've watched this through my entire life it blows my mind every time I see it because I'm me I'm going through what God has placed the footsteps of the righteous are ordered my the steps I take every day I had no choice righten look at this whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest this is your opportunity that's right this is your chance right here Amen brother B said he said if I had a thousand A Million Lives he says I Give Them All to Jesus Christ and we we only had one life right but so do you youve got one life you got one shot at this amen now look at verse 11 I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all right amen you just happen to be at a certain place you had just have to be born at a certain time right if you're rich if you're poor you had no choice in it yes sir right if you're tall if you're short you had no choice in it I battle that I do but time and chance happen to them all right there's one sister Lena and brother uh Austin Austin we're up there and it was during that day somewhere he was saying something about was that your your your vows or something just how did we he said how did you know that I mean that we would meet and was that the song or something something he he was just saying how they he he left here went out there met you time and chance and then he came back and said hey come over here and you time and chance is everything yes yes think about what God has how how what what things that had to have happened in your life to be where you are now amen amen and the and God Of Heaven ordained this for you that's right amen amen I was I'm dealing with people overseas and they need money they need money they money and it's weighed me so much I yelled at one today over the phone I said brother I don't know why you were born in such and such country but I know this if you were born there you were ordained to be there and you better get to praying to find out what God's purpose for you there is amen and I've been very kind and then sometimes I just have to blow up Bible says be angry and sin not right you don't think America's got it coming it's coming here we got to be prepared time and chance happeneth to them all amen I'll say like this one time I I was reading an article and this is the carnal mind the carnal mind of scientists of a psychologist uh of whoever and they did a study on on the on the facial features of soldiers and did that impact their their a a chance of staying alive during the war totally carnal in other words just saying in other words depending on how handsome a man was did they were they more uh did they have more kills did they live longer did they did more of the handsome men survive because they're more physically fit and at the end of their study it said their jawline their big chests their muscles none of that none of that came into play on survival in war right right time and chance cometh to them all sir there could have been the Burly 6'1 guy going out there with like 18 AR 15s on on their backs with ammo strapped this way strapped that way not knives in his boots knives in his in his I mean he's might have a sword stuck in there somewhere and he'll Mar he'll March right under the front lines and the first thing you know he's the first guy get hit in the head and drops while the skinny guy with the with the chicken breast over there hiding in the trenches he'll just just shoot to survive and my God he goes [Laughter] home time and chance happeneth to them all I read this article and I was just like Blown Away who is the guy who is the carnal think look at the wisdom of man the carnal thinking that said just because a man's born this way and he's this way or that way that that's going to has anything to do with his outcome has nothing to do with his outcome it blew me away Rich Man Poor Man you know the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 9:22 he says to the weak became I weak and that I might gain the weak I and I'm and I I am made all things to all men that I might be by all means save some and this I do for the gospel sake that I might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain amen saints of God we are we have heard the word we're all what every time every movement you are running for the kingdom absolutely Hallelujah sisters you have the greatest witness in this hour because what the hair and dress is a lightning torch I say that it is a torch among the world you just walk out there and I'm right now working on in in Bowling GRE State University and if you can imagine what these college girls what it is UN I'm just like I was in college but just but it's beyond now it's it's it's and you sisters walk like Queens of God Amen you walk like the Bride of of Christ Hallelujah if you I mean it it would it would be it's unreal he says and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temper in all things he says now they that do it obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible Crown therefore so therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air in other words sints of God when we go into battle and we live life we just don't hope we just don't hope we're going to do this we don't have SS of God we have to have purpose we got to a motive and we've got to what have the ability what to yield of the Holy Ghost what so we can accomplish what he wants to accomplish through your lives amen and we know how and the only way anything's going to get done is but by the spirit of God absolutely sure amen and how does he say to do this he says but I keep under my body he says and bring it into subjection in other words don't let this worry you don't let don't if if there's desires there or however don't let this thing run out of control put it into subjection right you've got to keep this thing at Bay Physical Realm and spiritual realm amen now let's continue on here we see in Galatians 5 the Bible says that they they were Bewitched right the Bible says he says you did run well he says who did hinder you they should not obey the truth Rich Man Poor Man they started out wealthy I'll say this spiritually spiritually they had the truth of God but someone came in and started what planting seeds of discrepancy that's right therefore taking what the Bible talks about uh he says making he says this persuasion cometh not of him that cth un you a little leav leth the whole lump right now naturally it works the same way the natural is always a type of the spiritual if a man has a if a young man outside this brother Malachi's our young man outside of Zion here brother M's a young man he's watched his father he's watch he's he's he's playing the piano and he wants to make and he's he's got a level head on his shoulders he he's a servant of Christ he's got the Holy Ghost those sort of things that say that and and he like now he's waiting he say Lord God direct my footsteps Lord and he always puts the Lord before him why because he's watched his father do these things he's watched his father up here praying he's watched his father up preaching going overseas however uh doing making videos all those things and now in his mind he's Lord God I want to serve you just in the fervor as my father did right and he's going and if he's a good man he's a good good boy he's going to want to serve the Lord Jesus Christ right so now he's got to ask and say Lord God what would you have for my life what would you have me to do because I want to what Prosper your kingdom Lord amen amen amen and if he can do that in the spiritual I say this the Bible said what he said seeky first the kingdom of God first right and then all these things will be added unto you so if he can find his calling in life and and it's God L and it's spirit-led and all those sort of things God is going to add to him all these other things amen but we've got to find the leading of the Lord first amen what is he called to do oh on is he called to teach is he is he called to open a dojo is he called to open is he called to be a teacher is he called to to to just play piano what is he calling he's got to find this right and I believe if he seeks god with a sincere heart he will find it right and then once he finds and gets in the perfect will of God watch the things that God does on the side I on the back burner the Lord starts adding this and starts adding this and starts adding this and starts because what he's put the Lord first and he's faithful yes to whom is faithful with little will be faithful in much amen amen now let's continue on here I don't have much but we're going to we're going to run with it right now one of the Beautiful Things uh is is dealing with literally you have no Parton this we have no Parton this we're just born we just woke I mean my earliest days uh memories were like in Holgate and and probably like three or four maybe maybe five was my earliest memories but what was going on before then I I don't even remember what's going on I hear my mom tell stories I was angry at my brothers and my mom and all those sort of things I was you know I was born first and then boom Sam a camcom and then I'm just out with the dogs right just playing with the dogs it's probably why I love dogs so much cuz I had no one else to play with for the first two or three years just me the dog right oh brother s figured you out yeah that's that's it now he says now notice what it says here in Romans 9 he says what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid and he's dealing with st St Paul's dealing with with Cain I'm sorry uh with Esau and Jacob and the Bible said he loved one and hated the other before they were even born that's right he says for he saith unto Moses he say I'll have com I'll have mercy on whom I have mercy says and I'll have compassion on whom I have compassion so then it's not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy amen amen if God has given you Mercy amen I would say that you are blessed from the foundation of the world to find the mercy of God Amen he's faithful that's a special place right there that's the place I want to be that's the place you want to be amen it's found in the mercy of God worthy of judgment and the Lord says no you can't touch my one child there amen can't touch my son you can't touch my daughter amen no sir amen now one another one pro I just like when I was studying this on the way here I was looking at the scripture I'm just like there's so much said about this and I I think the Book of Proverbs would be a spectacular book to read about this he says now a good day name is rather to be chosen than great riches you mean to be a Bill Gates or a Marcus Zuckerberg or one of those High UPS it's better to have a good name yes look at the mindset of this the wisest man he says I'd rather have a name like David beloved of the Lord or name like Solomon or name like Isaac after is better to have a good name than all the riches of the world amen amen amen look what you mothers and fathers can do to your child you can make them richer than the richest people on the Earth just by giving them a good name amen hallelujah well brother that's that's that that doesn't make any sense don't don't look with this don't think with this look at the word of God hallelujah amen amen you young sisters and but Malachi someday you'll get married Lord willing and you'll have that first baby and the greatest the greatest thing you can do says I name you Malachi Jr but I'll call you number [Laughter] two that would be a great you can literally set the destiny of his life from that point right there yes sir right the power what of your words making someone Rich that's right simple but absolutely impacts the rest of their days brother J you know you know how that works in our family right the name meant everything it'll make or break you that's right that's righten he says the good name is rather to be chosen in great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the Lord is the maker of them all right right if you ever go down to Florida South Carolina you go on the coastline you see these big yachts and big nice houses and this and this just think to yourself they're going to have to meet the very God that you've accepted that's right amen and when you walk past those things pray for them that they would find the word of God that the Holy Ghost would deal with them because that's all they're going to have right is this big natural stuff Proverbs 23:4 says labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom so if someone is literally trying to become wealthy trying to acquire all the gold and silver make their bank account this and this get their retirement to hear this this if they're trying to do that that's their own wisdom why because our mindset is what following the holy ghost following God Lord because remember the Bible says well I literally had this quote on the way here and the prophet of God said he says he says I could never he says be a rich man he says because every time I see a poor person I'm always handing out money I'm always giving seeing these babies with no food or no clothes he say I'm always giving out he I just couldn't be rich he says because I give it all away amen labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves Wings they fly away as an eagle toward Heaven that's right because what all the wealth of the world is God's it all goes right back to him we are just what stewards we're managers of what God gives us amen and that's what we're accounted that's how we this simple but we're just trying to do a little teaching tonight Proverbs 28:20 a faithful man shall abound with blessing but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent there's no G quick Rich schemes that's the truth and a I'll say like this a man just went to a certain kind of a party and he met certain rich men and the man knows he's rich man he says he says he told me he said he said Simon he said said I've never met an honest millionaire wow they always have to EAS that's just how they do it that's how why because they're trying to make haste to become rich yeah right now notice in Proverbs 10:3 I'll start at verse two Treasures of wickedness profit nothing but the righteous deliver from Death the Lord will will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famine he says but he casteth away the substance of the wicked he becometh poor that deal with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich now over times let's say brother Malai says say Dad I'm feeling like business I want to go into the real estate and he starts just boom the Lord blessed him start getting the house here he flips it or sells it however makes profit profet and he just then he starts I'm not going residential I'm going commercial real estate he starts selling million dollar this million dollar this this he just the commission start coming in but if he keeps his hand on that and he keeps working that system he keeps working working working eventually he will acquire that but of course we know his whole mind will be on Christ at doing that right he'll remember the fatherless he'll remember the widows and he will behind the scenes he will do in secret now remember who was the Gentile that got visited first the uh Italian band right Cornelius right and the angel of God come to him and said he says he says Thou Art I'm just paraphrase he says Thou Art a faithful man he says you have given alms to the poor in secret I'm just paraphrasing he said God blessed him with an angel visitation because he's been so faithful so on fire for God and he's done so much for so many people that God said it's time now you receive salvation CU he was faithful what God gave him amen amen he says he that he that becometh poor deal with a slack hand but the hand of the D becomes rich I'll say it like this same with the spiritual right yes that's why we have to what pray and read the word of God because this this book right here will make you rich amen my sister-in-law sometimes my sister sorry oh yeah my sister-in-law and my wife they will get together and they'll just watch a little video here and there right and there's one called the badier wait no no Lumber the lumber Baron they watch this Lumber Barry mov right and the story goes is that this man who had this big business the secret to his business all of the wealth of his business was hidden in the badier which is one of these little things on the side of the house goes up and it's like a little secret place right up in the attic or however it was and as The Story Goes and all those sort of things somebody hears about the big riches that are up in this thing and they try and break in and steal it they try and they're foiled they try and break in and steal it this this they poison the husband he dies and all this all this nonsense right but the sun goes up in the the badier and he doesn't find anything but he finds a little book and the business starts failing because the father's dies and the the son's like I'm going to make this business great again and he gets into this book and it shows him how he made all these deals and how to how to work this number and how to work this and this and that as the story would end is the that riches that that L the family lore that they had there all this riches up in that thing was literally the the mystery was it was in that book how to make money how to make a business run properly was all in that book and saints of God we were given the book to Supreme riches amen right here right this is what we've been given but we've got to have a diligent hand right amen now let's continue on here in 2 Samuel 12:1 he says and the Lord sent Nath Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city one rich and one poor think about the saints of God here was a rich man who is a seed of God anointed rich man and here was a poor man seed of God and still anointed as well he was so anointed that when this man would go under the armies and he would he was but he was under one of the Valiant men of David right top 30 right he would go in there Uriah would fight and this and this he would he had Victory after Victory and he was a warrior and he was a seed of God and David had even greater victories than Uriah right right David more anointed thisiss greater victories and at one time they were both poor right right and God elevated one so much so that he became Rich where did David make a mistake before he became Rich you don't see him do those sort of things right but once he acquired the natural sub how many wives how much uh gold and silver the kingdom all those sort of things once he waxed the rich right something happened to him good good brother but the poor man was faithful because he was depending on God Alone amen he had nothing he all he put his life on the line every day there was no luxury for them he was such a man of God that when the king says come over here he says he says come and drink with me he said then go go home there lay with your wife he said he say my men he says are in the field he said they're dying David they're they're waiting for me they're waiting for one of their captains to get back and lead the charge and he would not take luxury he rejected a Leisure Time and here David in his leisure time in his Leo to I like this that was his Leo toan moment he fell right and he sacrificed the poor man and took what he had good the deceitfulness of riches the Bible said that was the fourth ground what does it say let's look at this he said he that receiveth the seed among the Thorns is he that heareth the word and and the cares of the world anybody go see David over in uh uh Pennsylvania you see David get the throne he's like King down he goes hey some and so's attacking come on guys right he comes back with the King's throne he's like yep that's this one go this one he gets on his throne and how they dramatizes he sit on the throne hey someone's attacking that goes out again he comes back kills another king and puts that crown on top of that crown and it goes on and on and shows how he 10 20 times and by the last time he's just like another Crown he was so Victorious God had blessed him so much right that it didn't mean as much to him yeah right and you see the time before he fell and he says the haveit are upon you David he's like guys go take care of it and he starts drinking his wine he got drunk right and in that time is when he fell the car of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and becometh un fruitful now notice this I want to read this quote here he says when you women begin to want and I'm not bless no you're going to see what this goes he says want to begin like the rest of the woman there is something wrong when you men you ministers try to become like a pattern after somebody else when you business businessmen try to do business on the scale that somebody else would do it on because they're prosperous Prosperity doesn't always represent success in Christ right yeah sometimes very much the contrary see right now Pride he got lifted up you're talking about Uzziah what a great fellow I am oh I got lifted up you got all this he says I'll try to take a place in the ministers so here is a king trying to take place of a priest and now the prophet of God is dealing with what businessmen he says now as I said before again he says businessmen businessmen are not preachers we preachers have enough time to try to keep this thing straight let alone businessmen you're all businessmen not ministers and don't take the place of one or try to because you're not called for such I've heard rumors here that some businessmen actually persuade their pastor and push this and push that due to the amount of ties they go on and they do this and that and however right and I want to say I want to tell this next story here I was talking to someone and this is one of the moments where I literally saw the Fulfillment I could literally feel what Christ saw when he was bringing this Parable I was talking to someone and I told them to do a certain thing because I was going to do a certain thing first I come to the place and what I told the person to do they did not do it but in the miid of me coming there and I'm like what are you doing the person said well I just prayed for such and such and the testimony just happened and at that moment the testimony me nothing and as I I yelled at the person I said why did you do this and they said well look and the guys and the guy the other guy they were talking to said yeah but they prayed and this happened and literally my mind was back in Matthew 7 Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name cast out Devils done many wonderful works but the Bible called them workers of iniquity right and at that moment I could understand why Christ will reject some and not others yeah it's not about testimonies though they are good it's not about healings though they are good right Mark 16 and Matthew 7 literally the same kind of people doing the same signs wonders and miracles but the difference was one obeyed the word obeyed the commandment and the other one did not amen saints of God that was terrifying I stood there and I'm like now I know how God feels I literally know how they L said brother they just prayed and this happened Supernatural like I said they did not listen I just totally just went and I'm thinking Lord God have mercy it was a scary time it was literally I was just literally just going this is what it's going to be like the lack Saul when King Saul Samuel shows up Samuel says have you obeyed the word of the Lord he says I have obeyed the word of God and Samuel says well what are these sheep bleeding in my ears right thinking they did what God told them to do and did not do it that's right remember the prophet of God he said he says it doesn't matter your your fastings your prayers or this he says the bride will be in the word all the way y than God if you don't see the signs Wonder Miracles like you like pray for them but just be obedient to the word of the Lord amen obedience is what God wants he wants I'll say like this well me and brother Jesse the only husband's here so I like it when I go home I tell I said babe can you do this and this and this and she's like okay and when she does it I'm just like that's right I'm like I got power why because she was obedient now do I ask her to go lift 300 lb barbells and move uh railroad ties no I said hey did you water the plants our two tomato plants and then she said no I said hey can you water them okay she'll grab her yellow booket bucket and just go and then outside but the C OB obedience and we see a willing heart amen amen you know sometimes does God call you to go out in the jungles and uh and save the Heathen the cannibals and all those sort of things has anyone got that call in this church at all sister lady I'm going to anoint a man to marry you and he's going to be a missionary the Amazon hopefully not but if the Lord would anoint that to happen back up and go and you will be more safe in the will of God through obedience right then you would be safe staying right here in akan Ohio right brother her and her husband could say hey uh her husband say Hey Dad called Jess Dad hey can me and me and Lydia live in a tiny house in the backyard Jess is like sure absolutely but if he's got a call in his heart to go to the Amazon they had better go yeah right there'll be more danger living in a tiny house in your backyard and they would be right in the midst of the cannibal Community right I'm not prophesying just just give an example now I keep thinking rich Man Poor Man and here's where I got the inspiration for this in Amos 84 Amos 84 and saints of God I want to emphasize this heavy and especially for and when I think of this I think of myself and I want to be better as a teacher of the word of God Amos 8:4 hear this oh ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail now I want you to think on this spiritually saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn so notice these business owners these people who have the corn or the meal I say this and what does the meal or the corn represent Jesus Christ and the Sabbath and we set forth wheat making the epha small so this little basket they're going to measure this weats in transaction for money they're going to make this basket this amount they're going to get and they're going to make it just a little bit smaller so the people get less than they think they're getting they think they're getting an equal trade they think they're getting all their money worth right but what else do they do and the shekele great it was a weight and measure and falsifying the balance es by deceit so notice these guys right here now think about spiritually what they're going to lessen what you get not only it's be one thing if they had the right weight and still tricked you but they're going to give you a weight that's even I like this heavier so that you're going to get less and you're going to have to give more for it sounds like inflation oh yeah that's exactly right but if you think about this spiritually and this is where the danger that ministers and I'll say this all Christians have yes their battle is will we bring all that God there's how many sermons 1,200 1300 sermons maybe we want to look at if we teach on a topic we want to look at every quote I want to find every scripture I can on the C to certain topic and I want to teach it the very best give the angle here and according to the ability that God has given each person they want to teach it and preach it in such a way that they can say step back from the altar from the the the desk there and say I've taught it the very best I can see it amen amen but I wonder if we SS of God then that's why the Le is supposed to have the nine spiritual gifts in operation to what to keep the church clean to keep this thing clean so that they can go and listen to a c whoever gets behind here or if you go out to another special meeting or this or however to a camp however is this Minister telling the full story that's right I think it was a couple maybe a year ago or however I I I heard often times sometimes ministers say he's they say the prophet said he says what he says I've seen nothing but the coming of the Lord so literally said they're telling people there's nothing to go through just the coming of the Lord's going to come and they're going to be raptured and that's it the prophet said I have seen nothing but the coming Lord SS of God and I found the quote after that he said he say the Lord did not say this but I don't see anything else but he said the Lord did not say this amen good but if you study all the quotes a brother just sent me a text a quote and it said that the church will go through Great Tribulation not tribulation but great persecution at the time of the the mark of the beast we have to be ready look at every quote and what does the Holy Ghost want us to grab from these amen he said that we might buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yay and we sell The Refuge of the wheat they're going to come and they're going to preach behind the pulpit and the people are going to go out thinking they heard the word of God and yet they've been stolen here and stolen here right thinking they're getting rich when they're getting poor right that's right good that's he says making the EPA small this is Gil he says a dry measurement that held three uh scabs and about the bush of ours with which they measured their grain and their wheat so that besides the exorbitant price they re ired they did not give due measure they did not tell them everything they could possibly tell them and of course the great shekele or making the shekele great he says this was made a little heavier than it should be and so of course the money weighed again it was too light and the poor were obligated to make up with more and thus they cheated them both in measure and in their money but notice there's two of them there's two things here the epha and the shackle there's the there's the food there's the food and there's the money and if you look at the bottom of this as he goes on in Amos 8 it says he says and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord God that I will cause the sun to go down at noon and will darken the Earth in a clear day and I'll turn your feast in the morning and all your songs and Lamentations I bring a sackcloth upon the loins and baldness upon every head and I'll make it as the morning of an only son and the end thereof is a bitter day and behold the days come say the Lord that I will send a famine in the land there's coming a Time saints of God where the word of God will not they'll be looking for the truth that's right I wonder if it's even in the message of the hour they'll be looking for the truth yes sir right here the prophet God said he says he said God cannot mix hybrid religion with himself he can't reproduce the Holy Ghost cannot reproduce himself with hybrid Doctrine a hybrid religion right amen so that's why that's why we in other words that's why we have to receive the Holy Ghost is because the Holy Ghost will lead and guide you into all truth amen so if there's something false if the if the leav had been waxed great and there's leaven put in this meal the Holy Ghost is going to pin point every false Doctrine he's going to get this out when he came the first time he Sanctified and when he comes the second time we will be Sanctified amen absolutely all faults will be made right what will get all that LE out and you will have the original pure seed word amen amen amen yes he says they he says behold the day comes well send a famine to land not Famine of bread nor of thirst for water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord of thus sayeth the Lord amen amen now now here's what the the scripture says literally he says Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a small so depending what well lets way up and the man goes who he's got two in there and he grabs the heavy one if he wants to make a little B more on this deal but if it was one of his friends he grabs the right one the smaller one and makes just an even deal he said Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures a great and a small notice making the the epha small however but Thou shalt have a perfect and just we a perfect and just measure shalt thou have the Lord thy God may be lengthened in the land which the Lord hath given thee for all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an Abomination to the Lord thy God what is nanism what is the first four seals reveal the Antichrist spirit in the church right yes sir if that spirit is present with any in any assembly there is somewhere the the the scales are off yes yes sir these people overseas you know what they're doing they're they're asking me constantly but Simon please send we're waiting on you I said you need to start waiting on God that's right amen amen me I asked for help I asked I when I need something I ask the Lord Jesus Christ and I wait and he always e sometimes he doesn't answer because maybe I don't need it but when he answers I know it because he gives you exactly what you asked for am amen now I just heard a testimony and this couple left a certain church and they sat in this church for a while in the they would have evangelist after evangelist and evangelist all evangelists for years and years and years that's all they brought in and the person said brother Simon I just live streamed another church he said I learned more in 30 minutes than I did in three years that's right why because there's a false balance in that church that's right brother right what is the true balance in a local assembly and he gave some Apostles and he gave some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers this is the true balance you got to have all five there for what AB balance for what the perfecting of the Saints amen if you're not feating this line throw if you're not having the vangel the pastor not the pastor but the the the Apostle all those all those four running through here you're not going to have a balanced diet that's right and that and that that man left because he was not getting fed for the perfecting of the Saints and for the work of the ministry in other words every service they're trying to get the people and yet they don't know one thing about Doctrine that's right brother they can't prove one one Doctrine thing with the quotes or and bring it to the scripture that's right they can't bring their quotes to the scripture yes sir they don't know the Bible is the absolute that's right he says for the proect perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of Faith so all five these are needed for the unity of the faith amen why because there's some things the pastor is going to preach and teach that no one else is ever going to touch and the Evangelist is going to come out and what is what does the true word born evang evangelist do come and set you on fire you feel convicted you get up to the altar you start praying and say Lord God forgive me of all my sins get me get all get the Devils off me amen and then say Lord I'm going to win souls I'm going to win souls and fire you up that's right and then boom he's on the road might have the Apostle come in tell you all what God's doing overseas here and how this church started how this church and the testimonies this boy's raised and this hand grew back and all just why because we need to hear those things amen we need to hear what God is doing on every front of his campaign Hallelujah in this war there's all kinds of generals not generals soldiers there's all kind of soldiers out there right and each one has a commission each one has a testimony each one has their way I think their office amen amen and here's a pastor stays right here and just plugs away and plugs away and feeds the flock feeds the Lambs feeds the Sheep amen and what for he he says from whom the whole body fitly joined together I'll say like this now why do we need the fivefold till we all come to Unity Faith right that we hence for be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every window in other words without the fivefold you're not going to know what doctr is true what's not because no one's going to teach it to you that's right one time we had evangelist come out and he read a scripture and he's like he's like wait it was like a punch line for him and we're just like we're sitting there we're going uh explain it what you what are you trying to get to and he's and he read it again he's like don't you guys I see it and we're like no and it was a silent moment for him why because he's not called to teach he's called there what to evangelize and I was just going okay don't leave the teaching for other people CU and he couldn't even explain it he didn't explain it and I'm like okay well okay well then then he went back to evangelizing well okay that's what we needed so I had to talk with the go Pastor like where was he going I was like I'm not sure where he was going okay am on now let's continue on here what do we got here we're almost to an hour so let me let me jump here in Matthew 13:34 Matthew 13:34 says all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable he spake not unto them them you know this is right in the midst there of the right after the seven parables in Matthew 13 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by a prophet saying I will open my mouth and Parables I will utter things which I kept secret from the foundations of the world now why did Jesus do this why did he bring forth those Parables Pastor Jesse's got an entire book on this why did he bring forth these Parables because if you turn to Psalms 49:1 yes and to the chief musician of Psalm of the song sons of Kora hear this all ye people in other words he that hath ears yeah amen give ear all ye inhabitants of the world notice to the world that's not to Jew Jews that's to Gentiles amen the mysteries in Revelations 13 were what I'm sorry Matthew 13 were to the Gentiles amen amen both high low and high rich and poor together my mouth shall speak of wisdom and meditation of my heart shall be of understanding amen why would now notice he says I will incline my ear to a parable I will open my dark saying upon the harp so all these Parables what was Christ bringing Matthew 13 was literally a prophecy fulfilled what of David playing his harp and he said this is it within the like this when David played his heart and he said what he says I will incline my ear to Parable to a parable I will open my dark saying when he Sayang that within that scripture is seven Mysteries amen that's right this contains seven Mysteries that were opened up in the new amen and it all become what getting in the spirit playing on the harp that's right he says where therefore should I fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall Compass upon me that they trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitudes of their riches none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a ransom for him for the Redemption of their soul is precious what's precious what's more precious than anything the Redemption of the Soul when Jesus when the baby was born he he says little baby Jesus grew up into a young boy say hey I've got this gold frankincense and myrr I'm going to redeem my people I got the gold that's right he didn't say that in other words for the Redemption what was the most did did Jesus come with a a full inheritance of of of of all the the silver and gold and the crows and jewels and all that were those decks around him from the day one no God sent the most precious thing was what himself right silver and gold cannot redeem us hallelujah it was the blood of almighty God the very vessel of Jesus is what redeemed us that was what purchased our souls it's not carnal anything right he says for the Redemption of your soul is precious and it ceaseth forever the Redemption of our souls in Ephesians 3 and 7 almost done here he says wherefore he says I am made a minister according to the gift of the works of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am am less than the least of all the saints in this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ amen who is a rich man or a poor man we no other age let's just say it for what it is no other age was given the revelation of the of the first six seals that's right no other age no other age fully understood original sin no other age had the full Revelation I'll say of what we're coming to SS of God we have been given so much spiritually MH amen and yet the things of the world blind us from what we have right yes sir sometimes sometimes like a a man knows I'm a Christian they come and ask me a spiritual question and I just start rattling off and they're just going whoa I've never heard that's amazing and I'm thinking that's nothing but to them it was so precious just like one time at at the job the at the I was like at our shop the shop manager asked me a question about the Great Tribulation and I got down on the concrete floor and I took a a white stone and I started drawing the entire time on with the Bible and the guy's just sitting there going he looks at the other guys go side he goes guys every time I ask him a question I learn so much and I'm thinking this is just ABCs but to him he was like that's in your head and I'm like no no there's a lot more to so the understanding the revelation of this is so precious SS of God Amen you are so I mean when sister Lydia brought down and broke down the Lamb's Book of Life study I'm just like this girl is loaded to the Tilt I mean to the hilt or how you going say tilt or Hilter what the kilt right to the to the dress now the unsearchable riches of Christ now notice in Romans 1133 oh the depths of the riches both of wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out right amen you may not see it in your own eyes but because of what you were called to and chosen to you are the wealthiest people on the face of the Earth amen amen amen saints of God well think about this if the natural types the spiritual if we have the Rockefellers and such and such and such have become the trillion trillion and they don't even mention them guys they're trillion Bond trillion betray if they're that rich in the natural how rich is the bride of Christ right you've got to we've got to keep this in perspective way it say when you look at yourself use just ways that's right good have the right balance and use the balance of the word of God Amen say Lord God you sent the seventh angel right you s brought these Mysteries and we are now the richest people on the f face of the Earth amen right amen that's just the truth and maybe tonight you guys be laying down on your bed thinking like Lord I understand everything I thank you for it and not only that but to know that Jesus loves you I know I know a minister right there he just went on to have a little Jubilee with the Lord for a whole week I said brother what did God show you what happened he said brother he goes I just come back with the revelation Jesus loves me and I said that's a great Revelation amen what's the Revelation I know I like what I know that I know that I know if you know that Jesus loves you that's it that's right it's a finished work when he reveals that to you you know you are one of his amen yes now let's continue let's finish this off here by God's now Ian Revelations 3:17 we know this he says because thou sayest I am re Rich increased with goods and I've need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich good good now I rattle off the Mysteries the revelations but that's not the real gold now those are those are beautiful that's riches sure The unsearchable Riches of Christ but what does the what does the Holy Ghost mean by this scripture right here buy of me gold Tri in the fire that thou mayest be rich he says now these days people have plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind it was the gold that was bought that bought men's lives and destroyed them we see that every day the effects of the economy the wickedness people struggling in America struggling right I just saw posted where was the American dream at it's gone than is gone you have to have that you have to catch the heavenly vision right now you've got to catch this thing that you were what part of that bride and the prophet God broke and and saw the the the the moving of the Bride up you've got to you got to see yourself there that was me not the ones in the back in our line but the ones that are standing and marching and says right uh uh I'm one of them amen right Hallelujah he says he says it was the the gold that bought men's lives and destroyed him it was the gold that warped and twisted human what does the natural go do it twists human character for it is the root is the love was the root of all evil so if false go I like this if natural gold twists human character right what will the what is the true gold amen but there is a gold of God he says that the tri your faith be much more precious than gold that that perishes the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction he says that is the right kind of gold amen hallelujah that's right so literally I can catch all the mysteries of God I can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the character on me the character the very life that Christ expressed out of you is literally the richest thing you could have the gold the wealth that God wants to give you is his own life is his own character amen let's weigh these things correct from here on out Hallelujah if you something horrible takes place in your life and you don't lash out and you don't speak evil of this don't speak evil that and you say all is well thank you Jesus me and my wife just got a new little puppy and when the first two weeks I had a bad dream that that dog died I don't have children so this my be and I says Lord if that was of you I will love you still I will love you still Lord whatever you take blessed be the name of the Lord that's right though he slay me yes shall I love him he says the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction that is the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is Rich it is complacent it has more affluence of the major criteria of spirituality the evidence of God's blessing the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine well how do we know who know brother Kim my pastor just preached a sermon how do we know what is right in the message or something to that lines is it because we have the biggest church the best choir the most well-known Pastor the prophet said the evidence they say the evidence of God's blessing correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based upon how many Rich folks are involved in it right yeah he said you better come to it before it's too late and buy me gold tried in the fire fire and truly be rich are we getting it listen to me he says Naked physically came to the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it I say it like this I was teaching on Bible study sorry I'm making you tired thank you for standing God bless you look at these sweet Honeys just soldiers I was doing a bible study on Monday nights now with a new with a family now not new but family cuz they wanted to go through for a certain new family member and I started just teaching and in the first three nights first three Mondays they were so blown away by the things now they've been the message since early 90s they heard stuff they never heard before and to us oh yeah absolutely we can just write it off our heads and now I'll just give an example the four gospels were the type of the four zoons which produces which protects the Holy Ghost the book of Acts right they're like that the prophet said that is that in the Bible and I did a bible study on it and they're like I've never heard that yet in the message been everywhere in the world never even heard it and I kept thinking it's like I might not be a very popular minister or teacher but I see the just one little effect I can have on a family is like what giving them the amen so then what will we what will we take with us he says we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be his whose character was molded by suffering and by the F fiery furnace of Affliction or will be the softness of this characterless leoan people that's right so you want to be a rich man rich woman poor man Rich Man follow Christ through the Hall of critics stick with your pastor seek the Holy Ghost and God will bring the fiery trials they're coming the fiery trials are you guys getting young you've been out in the workforce a little bit you've seen some things it gets worse fiery trials will come and you're going to sit in a situation you're like Lord how do I get out of this and you he puts them there so you can pray through right and not just pray through and not see nothing and still trust him and then at the end you see a great Deliverance amen and a lot of times it doesn't happen the way you think but once you say that prayer we know that God is going to work it out Hallelujah he says it is up to each one of us for in that every man will bear his own own burden let's stand Rich Man Poor Man rich woman poor woman Proverbs 31:10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies there you go sisters what was it the character of Christ is the gold the way you treat God the way you treat your husband is the the character is far above rubies hallelujah amen at the end it says Proverbs 31:29 many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all you see what we're going to produce at the end we are going to be far greater by manifestation than all the rest it'll be the final move of the Holy Ghost favor is deceitful beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised he says likewise you wives 1 Peter 3:1 be in be in subjection on your own husbands that if any obey not the word they may also without the word be won by the conversation of the wives just the way I carry myself and talk softly and always caring and just being sweet and kind in everything you can win win the loss without the word acting a certain kind of way while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be of the outward adorning of planting of the hail hair the wearing of gold and a putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart there's your character right there the gold that's the gold right there the hidden man of the heart which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of God of great price amen amen you want to be rich sisters act like this that's right brothers be like Christ as well amen amen for after this manner in the whole old time the holy woman also trusted in God Ador themselves the Bible says there is is that maketh himself Rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches good if God tells you to give give well I'm out of this and I'm out of this Checker I'm out of this just give now why would I say that now think about this 2 Corinthians 8:9 for we know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich the god of Heaven though he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor yes that ye through his poverty might be rich my goodness hallelujah what other rich man has ever done this right name one philanthropist who literally gave everything lived on the streets walked around for three years not a one has ever done it that's right yet the god of Heaven and Earth was the richest he is he is wealth right why because what's real gold character he is goldall the natural types of spiritual every wants the gold guess what they don't they want the natural but they don't want the spiritual that's right brother yet for your sakes he became poor this scripture just jump down I'm like unreal it's amazing what he did for us hallelujah let me read this last last portion here I'm sorry for keeping you I know retired you guys got we all got school work and 2 Corinthians 6:4 I love this and this is everyone this is St Paul's testimony but this is each one of your lives when you talk to someone tomorrow when you are around someone tomorrow whether your husband children co-workers anyone brothers sisters second Corinthians 64 but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in Necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments and tumults in labors and watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love un fign by the word of Truth by the power of God by the AR of the righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet it's true Hallelujah he says as unknown yet well known as dying and behold we live we chastened and not killed and sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many Rich amen do you want the rich is that if you have received in this hour from God himself what through our Prophet you become very wealthy do we not want to make others rich as well Hallelujah and show them the way to what that goal that character of God Amen we all want that amen amen hallelujah as having nothing and yet possessing all things you have not because you ask not amen let's say a word of prayer thank you I know little Long window there as a little teacher let's bow our heads and think these things as we say this prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we they've been so faithful God lord

Lord yes Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen for All Hearts minds and soul is clear we trust this was edifying we've got to get our eyes off this natural I'm confronted with it every day this goal that goal worried about this we're saints of God we've got to let these things drop and realize what we have and let the Lord work this stuff through us to where we become Soul Saving machines not word but in power demonstration all want that amen we want lives changed we want God to use us in such a way remember at the time of harvest we need laborers amen well I'm just a sister you can win souls just by the way you talk and speak just by the way you act yes how gentle and kind just the the feminine attribute of Adam anointed by the Holy Ghost ghost is a powerful force to be reckoned with yes amen let's just sing a song here as Pastor Jess would come we sing make me more like you Lord or how make me more like him SS of God I want my character I want to be I want to be so much like Christ you know a lot of people think when they become Christians that everybody everybody in the church is going to love them or everybody in the message is going to love them and you're going to find favor with all you brothers and sisters that's that's not the case a lot of times what kind of character should we have I'll say it like this when two brothers or two sisters get to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and one has this Viewpoint and the other one has this Viewpoint and and yet they still don't agree on things we don't want to get upset and say ah I just leave saints of God people are who they are I can only see what God allows me to see that's it that's all I can see I can't ground another anything that's hidden is still hidden in the mind of God towards me brother Jess
