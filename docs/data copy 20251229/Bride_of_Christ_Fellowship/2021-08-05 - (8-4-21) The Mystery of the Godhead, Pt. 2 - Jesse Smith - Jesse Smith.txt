========================================

praise god let's take our bibles tonight thank you musicians appreciate you mankind lydia thank you for your faithful musician work there praise the lord let's go to uh a few scriptures here let's start with colossians 2 i'd like to look at the godhead again tonight by the grace of the lord you know i had a friend last night i sent him a free copy of the book and he's a trinitarian and he started reading it last night he said wow he said i'm really enjoying this chapter on the godhead i said i'm preaching on it if you want to come but maybe he'll listen in later you know by the grace of the lord but he and i have had great talks over the years in fact he's one of the gentlemen we talked bible club with but uh he can see a lot of christ in our lives and he's expressed that over the years and i'm just trusting god to do that also my mother-in-law is reading the book uh listening to it with her with her husband there um so we're thankful and you never know who's gonna listen to that's the great thing and just you just put it out there and and see what the lord does with it praise god it's his seed it's his word praise god he's going to do something with that his word cannot return void so i'm just excited to see you know what the lord will do with it and of course i hope hopefully you've had a chance to read through a little bit or maybe flip through it and maybe praying about starting reading it or something like that i hope it's a blessing to you as well of course you've heard it preached like i said i i don't feel bad if you don't read it cause you heard it preached but uh the some of the preachers have told me they said it's going to be a good reference for us so when we need to find information and scriptures to teach things they said it's going to be a great reference so i said praise the lord and uh i had a gentleman just emailed me from up north and he said wow he says it sounds like the holy spirit is writing it he said he said it doesn't sound like a man's writing it sounds like god's writing it from the perspective of the word he said it sounds like the word is writing it i said well i said i couldn't ask for a better compliment than that praise god i'm not looking for compliments i'm looking for souls helped right but just to get a little bit of feedback there this week i'm thankful for that and i'm thankful for those who have uh received it already and are looking into a little bit by god's grace so colossians chapter two then we want to read uh sister who is memory verse i forgot to read it on sunday sister so i'm sorry about that it's just a wonderful scripture i mean all of them are i mean i remember sister naomi's my wife's you know they're just all great scriptures there they're such wonderful truce that we want written on the fleshy tables of our hearts colossians two verse two we'll read two and three now lord willing i should get 30 of my books in the mail tomorrow if they come on schedule and after that i'm going to start praying about you know possibly going out to denominations because i've been waiting to have books you know because if they ask for them i want to have them um so one if they come in tomorrow or friday or something i'm going to start praying about possibly doing that um so i want to talk to like mj and stephen and see if can they i want to see if they can do a 1 pm service or not you know like if they can't do it well then i'll just have to have guest ministers come in you know for the morning or something like that um i really want to go out to these ones who've never heard it and give them a chance praise god aren't you glad you got a chance to hear it praise god i'm so thankful for the uh the life-changing power of this word praise god colossians two verse two let's read two and three together and then we'll go to our member verse jeremiah 29 colossians 2 verse 2 and 3. let's read this on three one two three that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge praise god aren't you glad for god's wisdom if you have wisdom you got it from god the father you got it from you got it from jesus christ you got it from the holy ghost because these three are one praise god all the wisdom of god dwells in the godhead so let's go to jeremiah 29 thank you jeremiah 29 we'll do 11 12 and 13. thank god that he will be found when we seek him praise god what a what a promise what a blessing let's read this on three one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart praise god may god has blessed you reading his word you may be seated here praise god okay so eventually i'll i have a a few slides well you know i might as well get them up here right now i'll just start there so yeah you can switch over i have just a couple of things to show um i have a few videos i may show as well um just to kind of follow up on last week and last week i was really stirred up by the things happening political um and i just want to maybe i got a little video i can share on that a little bit more on that by the grace of the lord um i was really upset by that last week i'm sure you could tell i was just kind of like really frustrated with that um but then brother william told me you know that's already been going on in his country for years and years and years you know but to me it's heartbreaking you know it's i know it is for you too and uh but to see it you know to see no justice it makes me weak it makes me cry to see justice cannot be carried out and that's what god wants to see god wants to see our hearts you know bleed he won't see our hearts cry when there's no justice you know he wants us to see us intercede when there's no one that will intercede so uh let's just look at this here i'll set a timer here by god's grace i try to do like 45 minutes or something like that see how that goes um so i just want to briefly uh review real quick uh part one look at the main points you know we saw at least five out of seven billion are uh idol worshipers worshipping more than one god at least then you have you know muslims they believe in one person but it's the wrong god so you have uh almost all seven billion worshiping the wrong god or gods we are a very very small minority that believes god is one person and will not divide the divinity into three persons so we are very thankful to be a part of this small group we are a very very tiny group and we saw how god chooses the words if god if god has pure words which all of god's words are pure then we must use his words and his words are manifestation right one god manifested in three ways and so we must use god's holy word anyone who changes them is called and gonna be called a liar anyone who adds or takes away will have their their name taken out of the book or plagues added to them in the lake of fire right so we are not going to add to the word we're just going to take what the word says okay and so then we last week we looked at we started looking at the eight problems of the trinity uh the first one is it's adds to the bible right it's not even taught in scripture even theologians admit that i'm just going to look at my notes here briefly and just kind of go over there but we saw that the words triune and trinity depending on their definition they're not bad words they're not bible words but they're just uh other way other words to say threefold right or three in one but if you apply it to persons it's paganism if you apply it to manifestations it's right it's okay but still the bible never used those words so we can see how brother adam was right to say trinitarianism is of the devil because that word and the definition and the dogma isn't even found in scripture it's an addition to the word of god and we saw how uh we saw how i guess we can just skip ahead here you know let me let me just skip ahead a little bit we saw how uh you know the trinity uh of of three persons is just paganism rebranded my friend said it's just a rebranding of the of the egyptian uh trinity right it's just rebranded and now it's got the name father son holy ghost uh the titles so they've they've just rebranded paganism and made three separate co-equal co-eternal persons which is unscriptural right uh totally on scripture as we as we saw uh secondly we saw how jesus and all the bible writers always use hebrew monotheism in other words they understood the godhead the same way the jews did jesus said we know what we worship salvation is of the jews jesus never said three persons right he always kept it and the apostles never argued about it the apostles never argued no he's two no he's three no he's four they never argued about it he was always just one person and then we haven't we didn't look at this last week but that we saw in previous weeks that athanasian creed has at least six contradictions okay uh and we looked at them with the kids bible study now look at this it was written in the 6th century so almost 500 years over 500 years after the last apostle died it took them 500 years to come up with a way to understand god but yet it contradicted the what the bible said about god and you would think any intelligent person would think if someone changes god after 500 years they're wrong if anyone changes anything about god after one year they're wrong right we know the baptism was changed 70 years after jesus we know the word trinity was introduced 150 years after jesus and now this total creed total contradicting creed now 500 years after jesus makes it official that they want to worship doctrines and commandments of men rather than the word of god but we're saying only what paul said praise god we're preaching paul's gospel hallelujah we're not giving out leaven infused bread we're giving out unleavened bread tonight praise god we will not we will not serve the harlot's bread right when a harlot has relations what does she do the good man of the house is gone the bible said she makes a table of food she makes uh makes everything smell good you know she makes her bed she makes the table and everything and she invites the man and said the good man's gone i got food here i did my sacrifices i did all these things well that's just like the roman catholic church right while jesus's body is gone they feed their uh they feed the churches and the countries they they fornicate with they feed them their unholy bread it's leaven infused bread right and that's where the bible said they make love with their creeds and there are doctors and he and jesus said i'll cast them and all their children and all those that fortigate them into a bed of destruction aren't you glad church that's not your resting place amen your resting place is in the shelter of almighty god under the shadow of his wings amen hallelujah your shelter is under the wings of jehovah's eagle praise god but they're shelters in the bed of a harlot that's right i know that's rough but that's the truth especially when you see where it come from we don't come from the roman catholicism it comes from the first church of rome right uh which is uh ended up being the roman catholic church we'll we'll preach on that next the next mystery is the last one it's the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks now brother random uh already preached the seven uh church ages right so the candlesticks the bread but the bread here the bread gives us more revelation about that praise god we get more revelation about the church ages right uh we can dig deeper into history and pull out more things and so we can see that the bible names 12 mysteries praise god and so we're thankful that we can feast on those right we have the light of those church ages but we need to feast on the word of those church ages praise god the fresh bread of those churches we have the light of them shining that light shining in our hearts the light of the holy spirit praise god our lamps are burning with the same oil that fell on the day of pentecost amen hallelujah we're burning with that same fire praise god hallelujah thank god with the same oil the same fire the same christ standing in the midst of the seven golden candlestick he's here tonight amen oh before starting to feel good praise god amen we know that he's he's here praise god he's here he promised to be here and so see the leaven just spreading and spreading in more right it first spread to false baptism then it spread to the wrong terminology and then it spread to creeds 500 years later look where we are 1800 years after now you've got hail mary's and worshiping and kissing idols it's total paganism amen catholicism is total paganism praise god and few there be that find it but ours we have the privilege of calling saying come out of her my people that you not partake of that paganistic system praise god it's paganism rebranded ah see it's confusion and creeds always limit god see when they say when they say they're co-equal and co-eternal when they say they're co-equal that limits god right because the son says the father is greater than i that limits the knowledge that limits god and it makes it confusing but that's babylon for you babylon is confusion but god is not the author of confusion praise god you won't find that terminology in the bible we're not going to well i'll just go over them real quickly uh the creed says we worship a god in trinity jesus said we worship god in spirit and truth the creed says the son is uncreated the bible said jesus is the beginning of the creation of god the creed says the son is unlimited but jesus said i can do nothing except the father shows me praise god the creed says the son is of the father alone but the bible said the holy ghost conceived jesus amen the creed says none is greater none is less than another but jesus says the father is greater than i as we said the creed says god is three persons but the bible said jesus is the express image of his person amen one person praise god the invisible person has an image an express reproduction uh express image and that's the son jesus hallelujah thank god now just to make it clear again children and see i was remember i went through this last week but i want the children to say here's the lie part here they say they say the father is not the holy spirit that's a total lie and you have to say and they'll call you and i'm going to show this they call us heretics for denying this lie that's satan's always tactic the thing they're accusing of is what they're actually guilty of always i find it with all those people that leave the message they call me disingenuous they're the ones that are disingenuous right i got proof for that but i'm not going to get in that tonight i'll make sure the live stream is off when i say that because i don't have to argue about i'm not here to argue you know but just to make it plain i don't need more pressure in my life but you know uh see the father they say the father is not the holy spirit but yet they're both god that's a complete contradiction it's it's illogical it's insane they're completely insane right so see children this is a lie from hell the father is the holy spirit because jesus prayed holy father amen the father's holy praise god amen and the bible said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby your seal to the day of your redemption there's not two spirits right there's not ten spirits there's one spirit and god is the holy spirit he said i am the holy one of israel amen jesus said that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth praise god so this is a total lie and so i just want to show that just so you have that in your mind there and remember church a a a contradiction is defined as a statement of a position opposite to one already made so they say say they say the father is god the holy spirit's god but they say the father is not the holy spirit well this is a contradiction to what they already said right that's what a contradiction is right so uh i just want you to keep that in mind here that that this is what they claim and they're bold with it they're getting more bold both both seeds are maturing this is maturing time we're laying in the prince of the sun getting more humble getting more like christ but they're standing in defiance to the sun and they're getting more bull with it and more air get with it all the time attacking us i'm going to show it to you at the end and i can't show the video because they're probably going to give me a strike on youtube again so i have to stop that i'll just have to show it at the end because these people are just crazy they're just crazy uh anyway so jesus said holy father so the father is the holy spirit right uh if not jesus had two fathers right and then uh if this is true then then jesus had two persons living in the one person i'm just reviewing these real quick right and why does a co-e why does a co why does an all-powerful person need two other all-powerful persons to live inside of him if he's all-powerful if he's already fully eternal and fully god why does he need two other persons that are fully god to come and live inside of him that gives him three minds instead of one but our god is not three-minute our god has one mind and his ways are higher than our ways his ways are way higher than trinitarian ways and thoughts amen their thoughts are so low they think three minds are in one mind a bunch of nonsense i confronted that man on believe the sign and he just you know he just kind of i'm not going to say much about that but it's on the debate all right it's on the debate see they deny that they they when they're on trinitarians it's okay but when they they're confronted with it they deny it just like the democrats right just like well just like most democrats and most republicans right they'll say one thing but when confronted they do the other it's just total flip-flop lies and no and these blind people don't even care but church god is watching the bible said god is a witness in your home relationships god is also a witness in everything that we do he's watching from heaven church and these people are going to reap what they sow did you see that one person that made that one person made an evil thing about president trump a few years ago like a real violent thing and now she's got cancer just a few years after doing this it was like a stunt it was a really wicked stunt she did now she's got cancer just it's just you know sad very sad but remember church trinitarianism is the breaking the first commandment let's read that let's go to exodus chapter 20 please got your bibles there of course this is mount sinai when the law was given this member was about uh well you know i better not say that i'm not quite sure actually let me not say that uh exodus 20 verse one i there's a there's a thing i was studying so i better hold off on that chapter 20 verse 1. and god spake all these words saying i am the lord thy god which i brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me thou shalt have no other gods before me now i've talked to trinitarians i told you this story we used to ride together and carpool when we only had one car back in cuyahoga falls and they both and they all all three of them in the car admitted they knew the father and son but they didn't know the holy ghost really well now what what is that that means they already have two two persons above one person but god said don't put anybody in front of me well which one is it apparently they have two in front of one and if one is equally co-equal god like the others well then they've broken the commandment because they have two they know all about but they don't understand that holy spirit that great holy ghost that we talk about that we rejoice in they don't understand that but thank god we understand it praise god it's the presence of jesus christ in our souls and also in our midst anointing our minds anointing our bodies to carry out his will hallelujah they'll convict you and say something's going to happen at church today right it'll convince you like go speak to that person go pray for that sick person right give that person a love offering or something like that it'll speak to you it'll lead you it'll guide you it'll give you words to say you didn't even plan on saying praise god it'll give you dreams you didn't ask for praise god the foretell the future that's what the holy ghost is he puts god's word in your mouth amen and in your heart praise god but see they break this because they have at least two before the third and northern gods before me they break this first commandment so they're guilty of the first and what about all the others their children are disobedient married two three times cut their hair abominations i mean come on now the fourth uh there's eight problems now actually there's probably nine i thought about it later so if i ever re if i ever revise the book then revise the book rather the ninth problem will be all the fruits that the trinity uh doctrine has caused all the bad fruits in other words all the evils of the roman catholic church so because they started with the trinity at the beginning now what do they got they got this awful child molestation problem on both not just priests but nuns too that came out in 2018. they they they investigated these uh uh all all the uh uh all the priests in pennsylvania they investigate and they found like over a thousand victims and then they found just priests and then they started getting all these leaks of nuns doing the same thing wicked told it's totally infiltrated with wickedness right it's a it's an epidemic they say an epidemic of abuse right because power without character is satanic amen we've seen the politics we see it in the churches you see it everywhere a man's got to have christian character or he's going to pervert and abuse the power that's been placed inside of his hand thank god for the washing powers of the blood of jesus christ amen that's that's what we as have we all have some power here of some authority i have a lot of empowered authority but i'm yielded to the holy spirit i'm asking god to use me help me to yield every one of my actions and all my desires to his will and to treat everybody like they're all the saints of god with kindness and respect praise god hallelujah so the so that would be the eight that would be the ninth problem if i'd ever do a revision but the fourth is there's so many contradictions and inconsistencies amongst trinitarians like i showed you uh they rotate now here i've got a slide on this one okay so if you look up triatheism and webster dictionary this is a really weak definition but it's the only one i could find i didn't have a lot of time to addre had to drive to columbus the doctrine so the tritheism is the doctrine that the father-son only goes are three distinct gods now the word i want you to notice is distinct that means separate now when i first came to the message these evangelicals tried to talk me out of it so they said jesse god is a trinity so he had this pastor from the chapel handed me his thesis so it's a big report you have to write before they approve you as a pastor and in the thesis he said god exists in three equal beings eternally three distinct beings eternally that means he's always going to be three beings in church all they did was take out that word and put beings that's all he did in other words they are literally using the definition of triatheism three gods and just taking out the offensive word god and putting distinct being in there same thing say it's the exact same thing now other definitions from other dictionaries i've read they say that three co equal person or gods that exist distinctly and i looked at that when i saw that brother i bought i wanted i scanned it but i wanted to throw in the trash but i didn't cause i want to keep it as evidence and i'm glad i did because i still got it to show people don't if you ask a trinitarian they'll say no i don't believe that because they've never studied it see because they teach all these things and they it's just they just shovel these lies down they're just like this okay when's the super bowl party when are you gonna feed me when's the skating party yeah that's fine uh when's the video game party that's that's what they're waiting for when's the movie gonna start that that's what they're waiting for they're not really hungry for the word of god but the bible said we are we should be more noble searching the scriptures daily whether these things are so that's what a real noble christian does that's what a real royal seat of abraham does searches the bible scripture daily but they don't do that they just pass out a pamphlet all right let's go to the browns game let's go to the cavs game let's go drinking let's go out to the parties that's exactly that's what they did when i was in school and it's gotta be worse now it's gotta be way worse now that's how it was 20 years ago when i was there it's got to be a lot worse so i want you to see that that's that's the definition now remember they rotate church they rotate between tritheism and modalism modalism is just same god changing his form but modalism has some bad definition to it we'll get to that here soon and they rotate and church it's a fulfillment of ephesians where it says their children tossed to and fro carried on every wind of doctrine the same ones that say yeah god sometimes we see god try theism sometimes we see modalism the same ones say well yeah women can preach homosexuals can be pastors see because they're carried about they're tossed by every wind of doctrine they're tossed on homosexuality they're tossed on the godhead they're tossed on baptism sprinkling's okay you know sprinkling babies they baptize babies for what sin they haven't done any sins why they repent they haven't done anything but see they're just tossed to and fro but you and i stand there like a rack of ages we stand there anchor despite the storms of life we say anchored with the truth of god's word and nothing can move us because we're anchored to heaven praise god amen now the fifth problem is they uh the catholics didn't affirm the holy spirit as divine until 381 a.d oh my mercy almost 250 years right after christ they finally decide oh yeah maybe the holy spirit's divine too but remember the bible said in acts chapter 5 ananias lied to the holy ghost and god it was the same one same person so it took them 350 years to figure out what peter knew instantly praise god now six they're artwork right oh i'm going backwards okay yeah their artwork is deceptive right and the bible says that we ought not to think the godhead is like on the gold silver stone graven by art and man's device this is by man's device this is not that's inspired i don't care if the man was catholic or not it's inspired catholic men translated the bible like erasmus he was a wonderfully used by god to make the english bible that we have are so blessed to have right now that many women died for praise god god used a catholic praise god god can use whoever he wants right he can use whoever he wants so see that's not inspired that's inspired praise god because god come down and give us a cloud in the shape of a pyramid praise god hallelujah so we see and we see the bible never shows three thrones or three beings it only shows jesus christ okay now seventh they use fear tactics okay get your bible go to galatians 5 20. galatians 5 20. now here are the two fear tactics they're using they accuse us of heresy and they say we're going to hell and my friends didn't tell me this but when my trinitarian friends didn't come to my wedding i think that's the reason why because they don't want nothing to do with me because they say i'm a heretic because i reject their man-made dogma right what's a heretic well let's look in the scripture galatians 5 20. this is serious church serious now you know and you know church it goes the other way too we have just as much biblical right to call trinitarians heretics because they've added on words to god they've taken triathism and they've just changed one word and they got the same definition right and yes we do separate ourselves from them as we should but see the rest of their life proves that they may not inherit the kingdom of god because they allow adultery fornication homosexuality stealing lying all these evils that they commit they just let it go in the church instead of cleaning it out that's why their tables are full of vomit as we saw on sunday thank god thank god our tables are full of bread and wine praise god amen the the right communion uh symbols by the grace of the lord galatians 5 20 idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations rash strifes traditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and the like of which i tell you before as i've told you in time past they which do such things shall say together not inherit the kingdom of god the dominion of god they will not inherit it it means that means they'll miss the millennium right and they may even go to hell right somebody could because some of these people could could have been guilty of that right but they could repent at the last minute they could be foolish virgin but they won't inherit the millennium they have to just be raised up at the end of the white throne judgment with no reward as we saw that's what the bible says no reward you can lose all your reward right not not a holy ghost-filled saint now but the foolish virgin can lose all the reward church faint not because your work and labor in the lord is not in vain praise god and the bible so what is it the greek defines it as following their own teachings or tenants okay so they want to see any group that get their own things and cause the people to follow their heretics and they won't give up they won't inherit millennium crews they're not safe their servers are not born again not a repent of that they want to be said okay i'll go to uh the next one uh uh first corinthians i'm kind of first corinthians 11 18. yeah go to that one first corinthians 11 18. i didn't freshen up on one of these scriptures here billy branham calls it freshening up on this one first corinthians 11 18. sometimes i forget this sometimes i wonder why don't why do my trinitarian friends do that i wonder is it because they consider me a heretic verse 18 first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions on you and i partly believe it there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you okay so god allows heresies to spring up in the church to manifest or show who's who who's foolish virgin who's make believer who's unbeliever right we had that a few years ago when when the uh one of our precious brothers in christ left us they train he said can i come in and and bring my teachings and stand and and give a testimony for 30 minutes i said absolutely not you're not coming here don't even come you're not going to come here and spill your heresy that's what it was i didn't realize at the time but that's what it was right because they're saying keep your ties give your tithes to the old lady don't have to go to church don't eat a pastor the rap and what they believe now the rapture already happened that's what they believe that's why they were making fun of me on the text about the rapture making fun of me and preachers who believe in the we're going to meet have a meeting in the air right it was just so so sad mocking me and a group text right with some of the brothers it's just so sad that's what heretics do though they have their own tenants right and the bible says it manifests which side they're on so it shouldn't discourage us it should encourage us that we're in the right amen and we've got to stand up for truth praise god that's the first tactic you're a heretic well i can look at them and say well you're a heretic according to paul right because you're following your own tenant three persons is not in the bible you say your soul and scriptura but by scripture alone you don't have a scripture that says three persons you're just trying to weave it in there make it say that that's not what it says say what the bible says right hallelujah the second fear tact is this saying it's been said for a thousand years try to explain the trinity you'll lose your mind try to deny it and you'll lose your soul in other words you're going to hell if you don't confess to trinity nothing could be further than the truth god will not send anyone to hell who will not add to the word god will save them amen if you if you stand up for the word if you believe only the word that's a good sign you are saved amen see they convince try to convince people they use fear to try to motivate blind faith oh if you don't believe every word on the tape uh you're not the royal seed of abraham that's the same lying spirit and you know i found a quote where uh the son of the prophet brother william the son of the prophet corrects his dad on on a tape i just heard it corrects his dead yeah how can you correct thus saith the lord and guess what i saved it i saved it i did a screenshot and i saved him he corrects his dead because brother branham said he said i don't see anything hindering the coming of the lord and his son says well see he said see he was just looking at that day but look he said more time has passed so here we are today he said thank god we're still here today he's correcting his dad no no every word is thus saith the lord you can't correct you're dead how can you correct somebody who's infallible hello see they are so blocks that's what the that's what the that's what the antichrist spirit does it blinds you you can't even see your own sin you can't even see your own contradiction but thank god we've got the eyes out salvage the holy spirit amen we can see when we're wrong we can confess when we're wrong we can the holy spirit will bring it to our attention if we made a mistake because we don't want to live dishonest we want to be honest hallelujah they're so dishonest they can't even recognize i'm correcting the one who has thus saith the lord i got it let me see if i got it right here i won't play it yet but i'll play afterwards did i save that one if not i can play it no that's not it i i didn't save it so i will say that oh yeah i saved the screenshot yeah there's a screenshot so i got this sermon saved i saved the link to it i saved the link but i can play at the end just bear with me here okay good all right all right yeah it's amazing i'm just driving the car i'm like what he just corrected his debt and i was washing dishes that's what i was he's just how can he correct his dad he can't do that every word is thus saith the lord but that's what you do when you uh have false doctrine the bible said you're entrapped you're ensnared they're in their own they're in the snare of satan taken by him at his own will because they gave into his will right if they wanted to they could kick that devil out of the house and say this is my house but devil's come in he's stolen the goods he's stolen the sincerity he's stolen the truth praise god he's stolen the right he's the rightly divided word from these people and now they're caught in these snares they don't even realize they're uh contradicting their own beliefs see church and this is the thing with the trinity you and i we don't deny anything the bible says about the father son and holy ghost we believe all of it praise god we just deny the lies on the creeds amen we just deny their creed documents and their uh their councils and all the trash like that we don't deny one thing the bible says about the godhead so we have no fear of going to hell amen the bible said salvation is a free gift and i accepted it amen it's a free it was a free gift i just have to believe and i believe jesus christ is the son of god and i believe he died for my sins and i believe by his stripes i'm healed amen and i'm on my way to heaven shouting the victory hallelujah i've got victory in jesus amen thank the lord and my last and eighth evidence was brother branham cain with thus saith the lord trinitarianism is of the devil what a thought my okay um yes okay uh i'm at 30 okay i got 12 more minutes and then we'll at 45 i'll cut it off and i'll show you a few videos okay i'll show you that i've been preaching real hard and my voice hurts i was gonna try not to preach so hard tonight here so you know how that goes i'm just trying to be uh take care of myself over time school is coming up you know we'll be working pretty soon now as i close here give me a few minutes of closure and then we'll watch some videos i want to prove it to you just so you can see it this trinity is getting more serious all the time like the more i watch people like preachers on youtube whatever the more the trinitarian preachers condemn us or anyone for saying god's on a trinity right it's got to get more more pressure right it's got to be more trinity's the way truth is away turn his way look what brother manson all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements where they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or in the head now do you see that with new york this week they just announced if you don't have the covered papers you can't get into a restaurant that's new york city that's going to it's going to start in a couple weeks i think like that look now look that's discrimination right we're going back to the ways that we abolish we're going back to that now it's just discrimination of a vaccine that don't even work right they say you get the vaccine put on a mask yet they're letting 200 000 immigrants have come in just this month or last month rather july and most of them got covered they're saying you wear a mess kid you're five years old wear a mask we'll let 200 000 people with kovid come in bunch of devils they're a bunch of liars a bunch of hypocrites is what they are it's all about power they just want to keep their power right the reason they're letting them in is because they're losing all the voters nobody wants to vote for democrats anymore because they're a bunch of liars defund the police right the green new green deal stop using gasoline and yeah and fuel and yet they're the ones flying around the world in the planes i mean these it's just total insanity these people are totally insane but see we're starting to see it right we're starting to see this is getting closer now i'm going to show you a video where that january 6 commission last week they specifically called these insurrectionists christians specifically to see how they're starting to connect because they're church they're all catholics they're not christians they're all catholics and where the catholics what's their main thing trinity father son holy ghost whatever they do there they can't bless themselves god won't bless them for that the only way they get blessed is to stop being cursed but they're not going to stop being cursed they're going to keep sinning they're going to keep doing all that wickedness right but that's why i was so moved last week just sad and frustrated this mark in the head means they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is what's the what's the one doctor brother branham feels led to mention here the one thing what could it be speaking in tongues the evidence no no trinity because that's the mother's favorite that's what she started back way back when so she could break that first commandment right now she can start having multiple gods multiple persons and church remember mary is higher than the son because mary is the mother of god mother of god and that pope francis said it church i don't know if you've seen it but uh last year pope francis said it he said we fly to mary because we know uh jesus won't turn down his mother so that's why we fly to mary in prayer and they say that's what that's what the catechism says fly to the mother that's why they pray to mary more than jesus you know it just proves they don't know jesus see i know jesus i don't know mary but i know jesus paul said we don't know jesus after the flesh anymore we know him after the spirit praise god so that's why we feel comfortable praying to jesus amen and not to marry i don't think jesus said he is the father he is the way the truth and the life hallelujah he said the comforter will come in my name and he'll speak he'll bring everything that i said to your remembrance hallelujah that's why we don't pray to mary she can't help us but see they've exalted mary said look that no other guys before me right there it is right there now mary's above the trinity no other gods before me look at that just caught it right there no other gods and they're the god mary which pope was it um i think it was pope john ii he dedicated his entire pontificate to mary so they have like a pope robe that they wear and it has like inscriptions on it his head something like i'm in mary's hands or i'm mary's servant that was the one a couple popes ago like three popes ago or two pups ago benedict and then pope john paul ii yeah so two popes to go and his whole i saw the video i wish i would have saved it now but i could find it his whole thing was i'm all about mary i'm i'm mary's child basically i'm married servant i'm mary slave paul now interesting he's named pope john paul but paul said i'm a prisoner of christ not a prisoner of mary they're such contradictory liars amen that's what they are but the holy ghost don't lie the holy ghost always tells the truth praise god and we are prisoners of jesus christ amen hallelujah so the mark in the forehead is going to be trinitarianism etc i wonder what other doctrines they'll use probably women can preach right catholics are almost getting to the spot where women can be priests almost they're almost there that's interesting but they're almost there trinitarianism what else you know oh eternal hell that's one of them for sure they all believe in eternal hell how is god gonna con eternally torment somebody for 15 years of sin a 15 year old boy or elvis 50 he died when he's 56 how could god torment him for eternity for only 56 years of sin that's true and unusual punishment god is way more merciful than that the bible said they're made to be taken and destroyed destroyed so no more it's going to go back to the beginning when there was no evil hallelujah it's got to go back all the way back to purity praise god all the way back to the beginning where's all holiness god in his thoughts praise god that's you and i the thoughts of god express amen having fellowship with god amen the mark in the hand means do what the church says with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride we don't know to what extent right it may differ there's already persecution all around the world for christians we don't know to what extent it'll be we want to be ready and we know the anointing will be there when we need it god's anointing is always there when he needs it whenever he's fulfilling his word he always sends the anointing he prepares the people praise god he'll drive us to that amen or shall i say like this is a leader he'll lead us to it because the bible said we're like lambs delivered every day for the slaughter we're already trying to die every day he's already leading us to self-crucifixion in our wills every day so see that's why i want to close it last week i just forgot but i want to bring that up to your attention here that this is the main thing so satan says i'm going to put a mark on those message believers i got to make them believe the trinity now look now oh yeah the next one look at the next one brother brandon said did i get that up there okay no this is the same one this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will snatch away his bride from the great marriage supper of the lamb amen that fits all the types right esther i mean you could find all the types i preached on i think there's eight types of the bride all the types all fit before destruction before evil god always delivers the woman rahab right we can start going through some of these god always delivers it now let me pull up the app here here's what i want to say the pressure does say it the lord he said you think them nominations ever break up their denomination and come back to the word it's thus saith the lord they won't sorry i didn't have time to get this one here so it's it's uh anointed when's the end times i got that one memorized i've used it so many times yeah it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for it's thus saith the lord oh now i lost it come on man oh and now what's going on here okay i'm just i'm just not good with the app sorry they're going to do it it's thus saith the lord they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus saith the lord they won't they'll go will they go to the antichrist exactly it's thus saith the lord they will so why are you saying about it i have to be a witness and so do you so the point i'm making is right now seventh-day adventists and jehovah's witnesses they're cults right but they still believe god's not a trinity now according to this it's thus saith the lord they're gonna just give up on the well it's okay trinity's okay when the pressure comes down you either die i'm taking your money you can't eat i'm taking your work you either die or you accept the trinity oh they'll say okay trinity's okay we're we're brothers yeah brothers of satan right children of hell so it's even going to make such staunch witnessing people right like the jehovah's witnesses are known for witnessing door to door it's even going to make them uh give up this so-called thing now church see that's what we got we have to have rock solid faith we got to have revelation that cannot be moved now no matter what temptation comes we are going to stay with thus saith the lord the bible see like i said whether it comes in my generation my children or grandchildren or the lord terry you know whatever happens whenever this comes down and it's going to do it it's going to come down to persecution right eventually in america it's not saint the lord i'll show that quote next it's going to come down to this you've got to believe our train you got to eat our bread i'm not eating wiggle tail bread i'm not going to eat vomit covered bread who would eat vomit covered bread i'm not going to try to get gross tonight but who in their right mind would eat them but that's there that's what they're saying you either die or come and eat at our vomit covered table we'll take none of it praise god i like what brother said martin luther took that table the kosher and he threw over the table well that's what we would do before the rapture we'd throw over their table and say we're not eating your trash we'll stand with jesus and then jesus comes and snatches us away praise god before they can pull carry out their cowardly plot brother branham says and this is their big thing their bread their horse bread their mother harlot food their their daily bread of leaven that they want to feed everybody that's the mark in the forehead accept our trinity accept our three persons never i could never do that that was one of the easiest ones to accept oh the bible don't say it oh that of course i don't believe that i never knew what it meant right we never knew what it meant but if the bible doesn't say it then we don't believe it if the bible says it then everybody shouts a hearty amen i'ma say it again everybody shouts to hearty amen amen hallelujah that's right so you mark it down church we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things they did in pagan roman years ago first thus saith the lord now see what it is it's setting on a beast of power that roman power is in america and look what they got i got a catholic president now right the roman power is at the head of this beast out of the land again again it is here at the very at the very uh height of all this corruption the roman catholic church is now in charge again right all their other wicked leaders are all catholic pelosi biden you name it all these people are all catholics that's not christian at all they don't claim to be let me see i think i got one more note here uh me just a second here i'll look at my notes i thought i wrote something down here okay no i i guess not no i guess not okay um so let me close the videos that was 45 minutes look at that so live streamers i love you god bless you if you're our home church we love you hope to see you soon very soon by the grace of god those without a home church may lord richly bless you as well thank you okay
