church because they they see my mistakes and they just look over him and they said oh he just made a mistake that's okay it's brother Jim they love me and I pray to God you love me enough to look look over my mistakes tonight and my shortcomings amen 1st Samuel chapter 7 beginning at the 3D verse we find these words Samuel how many know Samuel was a prophet tonight Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts and put away the strange gods and astroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines the Philistines was the enemy of God's people amen how many knows we got an enemy too we can't put a title to them but it's the devil amen and all as demons amen but the he gives them people a promise and he's not going to promise them something that he wouldn't promise US he's not going to give them a promise and say well that's just for them no this is a promise for God's people amen how many believes we're God's people tonight let look at it in that direction tonight as we look into these things if he he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines and the children of Israel did put away balum and astroth and served the Lord only and Samuel said gather all Israel to mispah I'm not sure I say that right I I murder these Bible names so just forgive me and I will pray for you unto the Lord and they gathered together to mispa and Drew water and poured out before the Lord and fasted on that day and said there amen we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judged the children of Israel in mispah and when the Philistines heard that the children were gathered together in mispah the lord of the Philistines went up against Israel and the children of Israel heard it and they were afraid of the Philistines and the children of Israel said to Samuel cease not to cry unto the Lord for us that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines and Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a burnt offering holy unto the Lord and Samuel cried un the lord of the of Israel and the Lord God heard him aren't you glad to know that we can cry unto that God tonight tonight and you'll hear us amen and Samuel was offering up and as Samuel was offering up the the the burnt offering the Philistines Drew near to battle against Israel but the Lord thundered a great Thunder out on that day upon the Philistines and discomforted them and they were smitten before Israel and the men of Israel went to mispah and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they came to bethar amen and Samuel took a stone own and he set it between mispah and Shen and called the name of it Ebenezer saying hitherto hath the Lord helped us hither to hath the Lord I want to preach tonight on the hither to God I want to preach on hither to hath the Lord helped us amen there it is I knew there'd be one here some place amen hither too hath the Lord helped let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father we come tonight and ask Lord God that you would just once again guard my lips Lord God am me let it not be a man's thought Lord Lord God but I believe Lord the spirit of God Amen directed me to go this way tonight Lord God to encourage the people Lord to encourage our hearts as brother Jesse said to revive our faith tonight Lord God Amen we want our faith revived I want my faith revived tonight I want my strength revived tonight Lord God I pray tonight that these words that you placed on this page don't just become something of the past something that we read and a thing of history but Lord God let it be an everpresent word to us tonight Lord God a present help in the time of trouble father God we realize there's trouble all around Lord God there's trouble Amen in each one of our lives but Lord God we know that thou art a God Amen that hither to has helped us and will continue to do so father God we come to you tonight Lord God asking youd have your way among us as we commit our time and ourselves and these people into thy hands in Jesus name amen you can be seated tonight man I want to look at that thought again tonight and U I don't know I just take Liberty sometimes with things the way I see it and uh and it kind of types out you know brother Braham said he was a typologist how many knows he said he was a typologist he looked at some things I said I never saw that as a type like that but you know what he'd Ed these things and he would type them out and I do that sometimes too me and I find a great blessing of it because the the prophet go also said the word is of a manifold interpretation you can say Well it means this or it means that I mean I'm sure it does but it could also mean this or it could also mean that so I want to look at a different May meaning that maybe you've looked at if you've ever read this scripture we find here that Samuel is a prophet how many knows we' had prophet in our day amen and they had a Samuel come the prophet of God he spake un how many knows the word of God always comes to the prophet amen so here it is the word of God Amen is who they are appealing to he said Samuel spake un the house of God to return unto the Lord with all your hearts and put away the strange Gods from before among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines the word of God is coming to the people telling them how to be escaped how how to escape their enemies he's coming through a man by the name of of of Samuel but he's still the word of God still comes to the prophet and it's the word of God that's telling them this isn't just some man's idea he's got an idea from the Lord the word always speaks to his Prophet he's telling them how to be delivered he's not telling them something he hasn't told us too in this hour we've had a prophet in our day tell us the same thing amen you got to turn away from your sin turn away from all those things turn away from serving different God and serve me only amen how many wantes to do that tonight you know I think sometimes we get some Gods set before himen they get in our way amen and he saw the problem the prophet saw the problem he saw that same problem in our day and he said the children of Israel did put away balam and astroth and serve the Lord only how many put away the gods of the old man how many put away the gods of the old man and are trying to serve God to the best of your ability tonight glory amen that means the devil's defeated no he says right here the devil was still fighting or he might be defeated in your life but that doesn't mean he won't come and bother you that doesn't mean he won't come and bother your mind amen it wasn't me he won't come to try and put fear in your heart you know that brother BR said that is the weapon the devil uses most effectively against the bride is fear he tried to get you to fear oh I got a sickness oh I got this I got that oh there's a situation I don't know and fear starts to grip your heart but Church what we got to do is look back here and look at this word and say hither to God had delivered me he will continue to deliver me because he's the same yesterday today and forever how many believes that tonight they put away the God God forgave them of their sins God put them on the right path but the devil was right there Amen to attack them Samuel said gather all the Israel to mbah I will pray for you unto the Lord amen and he gathered together to misbah and they drew water and they poured it out before the Lord and fasted on that day and he said there and and said there we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judged amen their judgment was passed upon their sins right there that day when the water was poured out how many know there's the Wasing washing water of the word that was poured out for you and me in this hour amen it was poured out and he said right there I offered my I offered up my sacrifice of of the bloody lamb amen and the water washed my sins away and the blood amen covered them amen how many you're glad for that tonight oh I like that amen he says and he gathered the children he drew the water poured it out and fasted that day and he says and we have sined they confessed their sins the sin was judged there the water washed them away the wash and water the word but was delivering the people from their enemy amen and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at mispah the lord of the Philistines went up against Israel and the children of Israel heard it they were afraid of the philis now wait a second it just said they were forgiven of their sins he said if you get if you'll do this he says the enemy amen he will deliver you from your en enemy how many have confessed your sins trusted in the blood been Washed by the Water of the word amen you got the same promise tonight he will deliver you from your enemies if you'll live for him amen I don't know about you but that encourages my faith tonight amen that's why we're here to revive our faith amen I want my faith revived amen oh but church amen that doesn't make the devil go away he's still going to be here brother B say you're going to fight him every day of your life until you leave this place how many believes that tonight he said they were afraid how many know your sins are gone how many know that you've been forgiven how many knows it's under the blood but sometime fear still grips your heart yes sir how many knows what I'm talking about how many have been fear you don't have to raise your hand but I wonder how many have been fearful just in the last day or two right I wonder how many had a fear am even today right huh I know I did I know I did I know my my not sinss are under the blood but that doesn't make the enemy go away amen when I see the enemy gather when I get sick when I see some trouble come on Amen the fear starts to grip my heart amen he said they were afraid of the enemy amen we don't have to fear that enemy he is a toothless tiger he's a he's a he's a bee without a stinger the prophet of God said how many knows God Christ pull it at Calvary amen the bloody lamb took care of it amen oh I like that he says if we're afraid they were afraid of the Philistines amen the enemy of the people amen amen we don't have to fear the Philistines amen we just have to fear the enemy of the people which is the devil amen your your adversary the devil amen he's going about like a roaring line he's coming about amen and the children of Israel said to Samuel they cried out to the word amen cease not to cry unto the Lord God for us that we shall save us out of the hand of the Philistines I like this the prophet of God took a suckling lamb aren't you glad there was a lamb offered up for your for your sacrifice aren't you glad when you can fear you can look back to the lamb the prophet of God here is pointing he took a suckling lamb and he offered it up a type of Jesus Christ in our day a lamb that's been offered up for my sins amen a lamb has been offered up for my deliverance from the enemy amen he offered he took a suckling lamb and offered it up the burnt offering while holy unto the Lord and Samuel Cried unto the Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him oh Hallelujah he told Israel just put your trust in the blood of the lamb and God will hear your prayer tonight amen I don't know what you're fighting I don't know the battle I don't know the enemy that's attacking you but if you'll trust in the blood of the Lamb he will deliver you tonight hallelujah oh it makes an old man feel good Heen it makes you say you're not an old man you know I tell my wife I said I don't want to lose my train of thought but I just thought about being old amen I I look down at my hands sometimes and I say who put those on my arms who put them old thing down there I'm not used to seeing that he man but you know what it don't matter he man it can make an old man feel young it can it can it can take away all the stress it can take away the tiredness am it can take away the aches and pain it can take away the fear of the enemy amen hallelujah thank God for the lamb amen it was offered up holy for the people of Israel amen that made the Devil Run oh wait a second did it oh it'll make him run if you'll put your trust in it if you'll put your faith in it amen and when Samuel when he was offering up amen the burnt offering the Philistines Drew new Drew nigh to battle against Israel I don't care if your trust is in the blood the enemy will still draw nigh to fight you how many knows what I'm talking about amen I believe you're all covered by the blood of Jesus Christ I want to believe that tonight amen but you know what that doesn't cause amen that doesn't cease the enemy from coming and battling against you it doesn't give keep him from am me giving you problems and giving you a me circumstances that you don't know why allowed to happen in your life it doesn't help you for keep you from getting sick sometimes it doesn't keep you amen from having a change hold your back amen how many you ever felt like you've been bound got some chains amen I got I got news there's a chain breaker here tonight amen how do you know brother Jim because I used to be bound by that Old Devil but he set me free hither too he'll still do it amen how many believes that tonight oh hither to the Lord has helped me he will continue to help me because he's the same yesterday today and forever I am the Lord I Chang not amen hallelujah oh what a mighty God we serve tonight thank you Lord Lord amen mean if that don't excite you something's wrong amen and Samuel W when he was off that the enemy still came the enemy still came amen but I want you to know when the enemy came in that condition amen I didn't have to fight my battle I just trusted in I put my faith in the one who has offered up for me I didn't fight the battle amen he said the Lord thundered out against the enemy the Lord thundered out against the enemy and the Lord amen put the enemy to flight amen the Lord strengthen the children of God Amen to fight that enemy with the weapon he put in our hands what is it it's the revealed word of God for this hour amen hallelujah oh how about you amen I got a promise he said if you'll serve him only I'm not talking about serving some man's idea of the word I'm talking about serve him only talking about the word of God for this hour has been revealed and not by some you know we we all throw off on the denomination but there's a lot of denominations right inside what we call the message of the hour oh if you're not in my Camp I won't hear you if you're not in my Camp I won't preach you he oh Church my my Prophet told me there's only one Camp he says and you draw a big circle when they draw me out I just draw back in Hallelujah glory amen amen there's one word one God one Faith one baptism amen and that word is Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh I like that it make an old man feel young he says but the Lord fought the Battle and the enemy was smitten before Israel before the children of God don't you realize tonight church I don't care what battle you're fighting the enemy has already been smitten before you who fought my battle he fought my battle when did he fighted 2,000 years ago on Calvary he fought my battle hallelujah hallelujah and here I really like this part I said you just allow me to have some Liberty I get kind of goofy sometimes he said the word of God makes me happy he said and the men of Israel went out of mispah and they pursued that devil me don't let him follow you he said resist the devil and he will flee from it doesn't say run from the devil he said he said the men of mispa pursued the devil they pursued the Philistines it's time for us to pursue them that devil when he comes after me we do Warfare we say Lord I'm coming at him with the word of God oh but you're sicken but by his stripes I'm healed amen oh but you're a sinner oh but the bloody lamb he took my sins away tonight they washed me by the water of the word I stand Here delivered from God tonight hallelujah how many really believes that CH if we'll just take that to heart we won't be discouraged we won't need our faith build up amen just believe God's word amen but I like this he said the children of Israel went out of mpan pursued the Philistines and smoked them until they came to bethar now you brother Brian Hawkins got me doing this but when I see a word that I don't know I look it up I get the dictionary out what's bethar mean what's bethar mean in the Hebrew does anybody know man maybe you're smart than I am I I don't know I had to look it up but I like what it starts to mean amen oh oh glory amen I just I feel good brother Jesse I feel good amen I was so scared when I was coming through that door I said oh why did brother Jesse call me why didn't he call one of these other ministers why didn't he call me why did he just let cam do them all amen I was watching cam the other day amen the Sunday service he we talk about the denomination of Sol denominational ways he was preaching I don't know if anybody saw it or not but it was good I didn't get to finish it but it was good that I said that God will be preaching tonight that to me amen but I want I like this he said they came under be until they came under bethcar that Hebrew word for that mean the house of lambs he they they came to the house of lambs and it says the house of exaltation the house of Leaping about and I got to thinking you know my mind got to thinking about why we ought to be leaping about tonight why why it'll make an old man about amen the guy next door right up the road for me there's a guy that raises sheep or used to raise sheep The Man passed away but you know he'd have those sheep and those sheep would be born those sheep would be born Amen in the barn in the early spring amen he'd keep them in there but then along about Springtime he would set them free and you know what they did they walked out of the barn they said oh this is nice I think I'll lay no they got woohoo glory amen I'm free I'm no longer bound I'm no longer in the morning they begin to LEAP about you know what when these people chase the enemy to Beth car they began to LEAP about they begin to Rejoice why because the enemy Was Defeated they were no longer under bondage they were set free amen I think God had them go to the right place they chased them all the way to bethar when they came under Beth car they came under that anointing they begin to LEAP they begin to praise God Amen why wouldn't we praise him tonight Hallelujah it said then Samuel took a stone amen here's the prophet what did he do he took a stone and he set it between mispa and Shen and he called the name of it Ebenezer that word Ebenezer means a rock or a stone of help amen it's a stone of help amen what does a rock brother Bram said that rock is a type of a revelation he gave him a revelation heymen listen what he said he set that stone there he called it ebenzer a stone of help he gave him a rock of Revelation amen he says and saying hitherto the Lord ha helped us amen up until this point look what God has done he said hither to God's helped us hither to God set us free hither to God's give us reason to rejoice and leap about like a lamb Heen why because I got a revelation that my God was able to deliver me when I couldn't do it myself when I couldn't set myself free I had a God that could amen amen that's the kind of God we serve tonight amen he doesn't change how many knows that Malachi 3:6 says I am the Lord I change not therefore thy son thou sons of Jacob what was it that was the children of Israel the sons of Jacob are not consumed how many children of God do we got here tonight you're not consumed tonight because he hadn't changed the same God that delivered him there the same same God that gave him reason to Rejoice the same God that washed him in the blood of the Lamb the same God that gave us a revelation tonight a prophet gave me the same Revelation that I have that same Freedom Hallelujah God how many got it tonight oh Lord I just can't help but just rejoice when I think about these things amen how many know brother Braham I got chastised for this by a preacher one time and brother Jesse I hope it's okay amen but I quote Charles Spurgeon sometimes how many's ever quoted Charles Spurgeon amen I looked it up when after I got chastised I said did brother brandham ever talk about Charles Spurgeon and I found where brother brandham said you know and I'm not with this oh the greatest of all time preachers I know what you what your pastor teaches on that and I know that amen but I read in that message amen where the prophet of God said he says there he says there's never been any greater preachers the likes of the spurge spons and then he goes on and he starts to name I can't remember the message it was in amen but he said the likes of the Spurgeon and and he goes down and names all those oldtime preachers he says they preach the word of God there had never been any like them and there never had been any a preach that like they have or will there ever be he says I thought wow that's putting them up there pretty high amen he say they preach the word of God with power amen and I thought I'm not ashamed to quote a man that brother Bram said amen preach the the word of God with power and conviction amen if it's okay if I just read a little bit of what Spurgeon says about this hither to God has been with us oh I like it it encouraged me amen I mean he didn't say all this stuff that I said that was old brother Jim's head amen but I tell you what I believe it was God inspiring brother Jim's head amen but listen to what Charles Spurgeon said hither to that the Lord helped us he was quot in 1st Samuel 7:12 that word hither to seems like a hand pointing in the direction of the past now if you've ever read Spurgeon you know he gets real flowery and I'm not going to read all the flowery stuff but but you got to read between like kind of like reading the prophet of God Amen if you go he uh well I mean yeah but you don't read all that you just read the thought amen is that okay I'm not going to read all the flowery stuff I'm going to paraphrase Charles Spurgeon tonight I'm not going to make him say something he didn't say don't worry he said the word hither to seems to be a hand pointing in the direction of the past maybe 20 70 years yet hither to the Lord hath helped us what he saying look at what we've had look at what we've come through I ask has anybody ever been helped here by the Lord up until this point has anybody ever been delivered has anybody ever been saved has anybody ever been healed has anybody ever had their emotions healed has anybody ever been delivered from a torment of the enemy hither to the Lord has helped you amen you know he's a deliverer you know he's the way maker tonight how many believes he's still a way maker tonight hether too the Lord has helped us through poverty through wealth through sickness amen through Health at home amen he said at work at school Amen in in honor in dishonor in perplexity and joy and trials and Triumph and prayer and Temptation oh man he keeps going on and on and on and on he's helped us in every one of these areas how many say Amen hither to in all of this the Lord has helped us amen I experienced the help of the Lord in so many areas of my life tonight amen when I was deep de like in a depression over certain things amen when my mom and dad passed I needed strength and I couldn't get it amen I was their caregiver till the day they died amen and it got to the point where I was crying out to God God I need strength I need strength send me some strength lord I can't do this amen and my daughter which by the way she's here she come on all the way from Tennessee her mama's birthday was the 31st not she not here amen but there at my house amen she come all the way from her mom for her mama's birthday but I called my daughter up and I said amen Grandpa's pretty bad I don't know how much longer and Grandma's real bad and she had cancer and dad had had heart disease and kidney disease and and you name it he had diabetes and I was trying to take care of them in the end stage of life amen and I was get to the point where I said oh God why is this coming on me I'm trying to do everything I know to do amen and it just feel I was discouraged oh but when I was discouraged I said send me some help I called my daughter I said Lori I said you've got to come home I can't take care of grandma and dad at the same time I can't do it I need some help I'm going to lose my mind she said we'll be there Monday that was a Friday night that night at midnight my dad took his last breath and he went home to be with God went home to be with the Lord I called my daughter and she was there within 12 hours she was at my house and helped me for the next 3 weeks before my mama passed away amen what was it amen hither to God has helped me hither too he answered my prayer when I said Lord I need strength he gave me strength amen you might have gone through some real trials you might have gone through some real losses amen church amen I don't know I know Sister Chris has gone through some losses me she might not have lost her mom or her daddy but she lost a little baby here not long ago she went through but guess what she sits here tonight delivered she sits here tonight strengthened she sits here tonight Hallelujah too God and he'll do it again amen how many believes that tonight it's not only a hand point to the past but church it's a handpoint to the present amen oh I thank God for what he's done amen how many thankful for what he's done hither too oh but church I know one thing he didn't change amen he didn't change my situation may change amen but if he's done it hither to he'll do it all the way how many believes that tonight that's the kind of God we serve encourage you tonight he said we delight and looking down the long list of blessings and mercies received from the Lord in the past he put it a little flowery more flowery than that amen if you've read spurge you know what I'm talking about he gets into the birds and the trees and looking down through the a get amen he was talking about all the Glorious thing God had done for us in the past amen but he said the word also points forward oh I like that amen that word hither to not just points to the past but it points forward it points forward for when a man gets to a certain place in a journey he writes hither to but the Journey's not over amen he said like that he points he says he said get to a certain point he writes down hither to we've come through this hither to we've done that he says but he's not yet at the end how many know Church we're not yet at the end we're not yet at the End Amen hither too doesn't just point to the past but it points to a god that'll take us all the way to the end tonight amen amen there's still a distance to go amen spurge just said I I'm going say Amen there's a distance to go tonight amen more trials more Joys he more trials bring more Joys he says more Temptations bring more triumphs amen Heen more prayers bring more answer to prayers amen how many love it when you get an answer to prayer amen you wouldn't be praying if God didn't give you reason to pray amen we haven't reached the end I prayed God heard my prayer what it say hallelujah God ear is not depth that he cannot hear his arm is not short that he cannot find us amen he knows right where you're at tonight amen hallelujah he says more he said more tempt more triumphs more prayers more answered prayers more toils more strength more fights more victories how many want a victory tonight amen everybody wants a victory but nobody wants to fight he allows the fights to come our way so that we can experience the victory amen amen and when we get to the victory we chase that enemy all the way to Beth car amen The House of the L we can shout and rejoice amen hallelujah we can go around jumping around amen we can Rejoice amen glory you're going to have more trials you're going to have more troubles amen how many say Amen to that in John 6:13 Jesus said in the world you're going to have tribulation I'm not telling you something you don't already know you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world ah you're going to have them but be of good cheer you don't have to fight the battle the Lord can Thunder out he will overcome amen he already has overcome amen Heen the enemy Was Defeated 2,000 years ago when he said it is finished amen I can look at that devil and I say you are are finished amen you can't corit me any longer amen hallelujah and if I he says he shall deliver you out of I've overcome the world and if I have I will again because Malachi 3:6 says I am the Lord I change not am me Hebrews 138 says he's the same yesterday today and forever how many say Amen to that amen amen amen oh what what courage that ought to build what what faith that ought to build in the the bride of Christ tonight amen is it okay to read quotes here amen I read quotes sometimes because they help me understand the word they help me understand what's going on listen here what brother Bram said hither to amen the Lord has helped us how many believes he has up to this pointen but hither to God Amen points to the fact that we haven't got to the end yet and that God is still with us hither to he helped us he's right here helping us today and he will help us tomorrow amen how many believes that he said I want you to listen to this brother brandom says the problem is don't miss this study it good man has always been this way amen he Praises God for what he has done hither too how many thank God for what he's done we all praise him for it he said you know this quote he been you could probably finish it for me he looks forward to what he will do

baren all her life Abraham never looked at what he saw he never looked at his oldness he never looked at the wrinkles he never looked at the deadness of Sarah's womb he looked to an unseen God oh Church you might not be able to see him working but guess what the god that hither to amen brought you this far will take you all the way amen he said I looked he said he looked to an unseen God and what did he saw what did he see he saw the promise he saw Isaac amen how many can see the Promise tonight oh amen is right but listen to what he said when he saw Isaac by faith he saw Isaac and he looked after looking under the Unseen he called those things that were not as though they were and he got a glimpse of the Unseen and by faith he saw it and the Bible says that we that he endured as seeing the invisible god with him he saw the invisible god with him all along the road he saw him from hither to all along the road until the baby was born he saw the promise of God in his life amen

didn't change his ways but the word says where he is how do you see him brother Jim I see him in the word that's how I see God in his word I see him promised in the manifestation of the word in my life amen when he heals me there's a manifestation of God in my life God Is A Healer amen he's always present there's something that stabilized when what he said once a man gets a visit of that invisible God and knows that that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions oh church amen you want to be stabilized not blown about by every wind of doctrine that come down through the he said he may just catch a vision of the unchangeable God Amen the unseeable God Amen the invisible God in the time of distress and trouble he's still there he it still make him look upward amen it still makes that man who's got that Vision look upward and the the things that are happening around him and not at the things are happening around

past and he will continue to deliver in the future how many believes it tonight he said now it's a lesson for us to look to what Abraham did and not only to believe it but to make ready for it I said everybody believes that oh yeah yeah I believe it God's I believe God's a way maker I believe it God can make your body young again I believe I'm really believing for that one he said but make preparations for it make preparation if you really believe it you'll make preparations for it guess what Heen brother Bram said Abraham went out getting the bird dieye diapers and the pins and getting

prime of my life amen said brother Jim you're crazy amen leave me alone I'm happy this way amen he said the lesson is to look what Abraham did not to the thing but only he did he believed and made ready for it because he had considered he who had told him that was able to keep the promise that he had told him he didn't consider his nature he didn't consider his hundred years old his physical being he didn't consider all that at all the deadness of Sarah's womb his wife he just considered what the promise said right and the promise said to me if you put away all the other gods if you'll repent amen and plead the blood of Jesus Christ he says he will deliver you out of the hand of every one of your enemies brother brand said that last enemy is death we don't even have to fear that amen there's no death to the believer how many believes that oh this old body might be laid down but guess what amen this life lives on Amen he said the writer of the Divine commentary tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong giving God the glory amen oh what a person he was I said oh what a people ought we to be if we are that Royal Seed of Abraham how many claims to be tonight amen he said today there's no need there's no need of even trying to approach amen that kind of Faith intellectually we can try in our mind to understand this message we can try in our mind to understand how that I'm going to have a baby when I'm 100 years old how I'm going to do this when I'm 100 years old I can't he said it has to come by faith he says

out amen I only got four more papers here is that okay sir amen I just get excited all this ain't on the paper it just comes as you're up here right Jesse amen hallelujah Faith the six sense brother he says that's what the church has done to the six sense that God has put in him he just placed Faith way off in the Miracles and signs amen all those things he pushed that way back there he said all those things that contacts God gives him and it gives him the Holy Ghost he's place that way over there or way back over Yonder somewhere till it has just become a dead Faith say oh look what God did look what God did in brother bam day look what God why isn't he doing that in our day church amen it's because we got to get ourselves quitting looking at the wrong things we got to get ourselves like

other thing to prepare your heart Lord God prepare my heart today I want to get down on my knees I want to cry out to you I want to spend time in prayer amen oh brother Jim if I do that I'd be late for work am me get up early amen hallelujah Heen that's what he said here he said prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines amen you want that kind of Faith to believe you will amen just do it one time amen amen he says that's right he says it becomes a dead Faith because it's placed over on something that's right he says he don't know how to use his faith you say well God's A Healer I said oh yeah well what about that if he's a he he he was a Healer he still is a Healer how do you know he's a Healer well brother Jim I got healed one time when I was sick and they the doctors couldn't heal me God healed me he's a Healer well if he was a Healer he still is a Healer that's your faith in that church amen that's what the word says he's the same yesterday he said if he ever was a savior hither to he still is a savior tonight amen is that right oh Lord God save me save me I already did I already did amen he's still a savior tonight if he was a god he's still God you see it's the lack of faith that's been preached here's that quote that's been preached into the people that makes them let that six sense lay over there dormant if he ever was a deliver deliver he will deliver tonight how many have been delivered let me encourage you tonight he'll deliver you again amen he is a way maker have you ever been in a problem you just didn't know which way to turn and my God is a way maker tonight amen if he ever was a way maker hither to he still is a way maker if he ever was a chain breaker he still is a chain
