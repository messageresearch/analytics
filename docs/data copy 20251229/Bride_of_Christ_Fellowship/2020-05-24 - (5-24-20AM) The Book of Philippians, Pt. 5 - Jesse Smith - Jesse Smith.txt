know eternal life know the person of eternal life let's go to Philippians chapter 1 we like to continue with this series on the book of Philippians chapter 1 I believe we'll start at verse 19 and then we'll read our memory verse 4 may by God's grace yes sir verse 19 we finished Sunday night with verse 18 how Paul was Paul was rejoicing whether Christ was preached with sincerity or pretense he was just rejoicing that Christ was being preached praise God that's why if my family members if they're you know some of my family members not in the message if they're in a church today I rejoice praise God they might be wearing shorts right some of my family members might be wearing a modest clothing but thank God Christ is being preached and all that the father has given me will come praise God what a great consolation that we have my what a blessing praise God verse 19 I read on 19 20 and 21 I'll just read that myself then we'll read the memory verse together for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain let's go to Isaiah 12 verse 2 and for the Amen if you can for next week for June can you get the memory verse ready you and your wife maybe pray about it and look forward to that by God's grace Isaiah 12 verse 2 Isaiah 12 verse 2 that's 3 . 2 3 4 and 5 and that's the Holy Spirit to write this upon our hearts and these times and every time we're not afraid and because the Lord is our strength the Lord is our song praise God verse 2 let's begin on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he had done excellent things this is known in all the earth let's have one word of Prayer let's just bow our heads again ask the Lord if you have a need on your heart just making known unto God our God is supernatural he works in Supernatural ways in times and seasons he's to every detail of our lives so let's just ask the Holy Spirit to move Heavenly Father we love you Lord we surrender to you we've read your word we worship You Father God were blessed by the reading of this memory verse in our text Lord truly for us to live is Christ as we live here as we breathe and as we continue our Christian journey on this earth we could say we're living in Christ and yet Lord to die would be gain father so we're grateful Lord for all the blessings now that we can live and experience in in knowing you on this earth but Lord we're also looking forward to the great blessings to come Lord God the great the great blessings that are to come Lord as when we pass beyond this veil Lord and we go beyond this curtain Lord to the next dimension Lord God where Lord there's perfect love where it's beyond sublime Lord God where Lord there's no fear there's there's no pain God there's no suffering oh god we thank you for all

cleaned out Lord vessels as well God that we all might grow in grace and knowledge of you in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord I do have some slides ericaceous so you can put it up there by God's grace II enjoyed that song special let's give our sister around pause praise God we normally clap for all the specials but I forgot to clap after that one so thank the Lord appreciate all the this all the songs brother amen 1 Bob on the other new songs for beautiful songs praise God don't you love all those my oh my what is he what is heaven gonna be like I thought that for they may gonna be like with off praying and the shippin and the glory and the choirs of angels and multitudes times multitudes of angels just singing and falling down the 24 elders will fall down and throw crowns at the feet of Jesus what is that gonna be like with a bang as we wave those palms and worship and sing and Christ comes out and we just see him why what is it gonna be like oh it's gonna be greater than anything we've seen here by God's grace and so we are looking forward to that day what a glorious day to know Christ and the power of his resurrection praise God so let's look here as we look at our scriptures and we will ask the Lord here to help us we're gonna continue this message here our little series oops sorry about that and we want to stay in the thought we want to stay in the channel of Paul the Holy Spirit that Paul's riding with and the Lord will help us to understand this I trust the first four parts have been a blessing to you they've been a real blessing to me and my whole inspiration behind this was because we know the saints when brother man went beyond the curtain of time we're saying we're resting on Paul's gospel well we need to know Paul's gospel we need to be familiar with it and most importantly we need to live at praise God and so God is helping us to do that and Paul you know in Chapter 1 is a beautiful chapter where he says he's confident that God who started the work will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ and he's continuing that in our lives and and Paul said that as we looked at last week pause prayer for you is that you would grow in your knowledge of God and your judgment that was his one prayer in verse 9 and then in verse 10 that so you could approve what is excellent you know a lot of people I'll say like this a lot of people which is good a lot of Christians will spend money to buy software that will keep pornography off their phone in their devices or they'll buy software that will keep you know evil images off of their their email system right there's all kinds of software that kind of purges and cleans out your your internet experience and that that's a good thing but really God wants the Holy Spirit in your life to be the the cleaning age of everything in your life God in other words you have to pay any money for it praise God God has given you a free software a spiritual software amen it gets downloaded into your soul praise God Amen it gets written upon stead of written on as a computer chip or something like that it's written upon the fleshly tables of your soul praise God and so that's what Paul is asking I'm sorry praying for that you and I would approve the excellent things that everything like program preached would pass through the thinking man's filter praise God and we would be able to approve what is excellent what is right what would a what would a wise virgin and for us that's that's our main question what would have a wise virgin approve in their church what would a wise virgin approve in their lives praise God and that's how we want to pray that's how we want to live amen and that's how we want to operate is that every day we can we can live by that motto that we only want to approve we only want to allow what what God would allow praise God and you know we reach or trusting God and we know God will do that for us he says that we will and if we do that Paul says in verse 10 you'll be sincere and you'll be without a fence now people will make up things you've done and maybe you made a mistake against somebody but once you say I'm sorry you're you're without offence praise God and you know of course your enemies will always make up things against you or accuse you of things but in God's eyes and through the blood of Jesus Christ we are without offence Paul said have all possible with all your strength he said live with peace with all men praise God try to go through this life and leading a quiet humble simple life a live at peace with all men because really Church the Spirit within you is either the Holy Spirit or the unclean spirit the Antichrist spirit and if the Holy Spirit's in you you're seeking for peace you're seeking for victory amen you're seeking for fellowship with God you're not on the attack mode all the time now some of us like me and preachers like Paul said some of us are appointed to defend the faith and so some of us are on the front lines you know attacking false doctrine with the sword of the Spirit now so are you and your daily life praise God but I'm talking about in our daily walk we should be striving for peace in our families peace in our churches praise God peace on our job or in the school we should be prisoners of peace amen we should be champions of peace and then there's times when we must you know we must defend our faith and we must fight against any we must cast down anything that exalts itself against the Word of God amen and we must fight but but you know we either fill with one spirit or the other amen and so uh you know and even I'll say like this even a foolish virgin Church even she can have the Holy Spirit in her spirit all the time because you have three parts right body spirit soul so even though the foolish virgin doesn't have it in her soul that's not her nature she's not she's not fully yielded over to the leadership of the Holy Spirit she can still have the anointing in her mind right because she's smart enough not to flirt with the devil she's virgin right she don't have interactions and intercourse with with idols and worship and things like that so she had she has some anointing in her human sphere but it hasn't dropped down to her soul where she can be guided into all truth amen and every promise she reads in the book she'll say amen to it and she'll live it praise God that's what separates us from every other church we should look at the Bible and say and not just say well Paul just wrote that just for the Corinthians no that was just for them to have long hair no it's for Bible believers today and you and you'd be surprised that's one big thing that separates us the length of hair right we had a piano teacher years ago but one of the reasons she stopped teaching our children was because she found out that we believe that women shouldn't cut their hair and women women women shouldn't wear makeup so what we lost in piano teacher God gave us in anointing praise God because look at Malachi Lydia now praise God you see so God like sister sang about God will always provide amen you said that the test you go through the trials you go through our just tests God wants to see if you'll stand and if you'll stand he'll provide and make a way praise God amen yeah thank the Lord so see and then he says if you if you live this way and verse 11 you'll be filled with the fruit of the Holy Spirit and the fruits are very rare most people don't express them because they don't believe they don't have the seed quicken of the Holy Ghost the seed of God has to fall into the soul and then it's got to be quickened by the word amen and so most people don't even have the fruits of faith right or the fruits of self-control like this here's a good example for the amen mang we know pastors right in the nominations you're you guys were raised in the church that's why I'm using you as an example they all say they're Christians but then they'll go and they'll go to movies right where is their fruit of self-control they don't have enough self-control to not feed that Hollywood devil machine their hard-earned money and then they'll let that pump they'll let them pump all those evil thoughts into their minds and enjoy the fornication and all things like that if they didn't enjoy it they wouldn't be there right because if you were really born again the Bible said flee from any appearance of evil praise God and Joseph ran from that pot of first life and if they really have the Holy Ghost way they'd run it out of that movie theater when they saw naked woman praise God they would it's the same thing Jesus said it's the same thing whether you commit the act or just look at it it's the same thing fornication adultery so thank God the Holy Ghost keeps us out of there totally praise God it's a very good determining division between the wise thank God were wise and the foolish praise God now I hope they repent that if not they're gonna be guilty of that right it's gonna be very hard for them to be saved but so see even the fruit they're just one of the nine brother-sister that's just one of the nine fruits of self-control they don't have enough self-control to stay out of that evil theater but you and I some huh somehow we got enough control we don't even let our bodies or children go in there where'd you get that self-control it's from the sea Church where'd you get that fruit of self-control was from the seed my father planted in my soul and then he watered it praise God and then it brought forth its fruit and people can look and say that's a real genuine that's a taste and see that the Lord is good that's a real godly fruit of the Holy Spirit it's so rare you don't see it very often hallelujah and then you know last evening or last Sunday evening we looked at the next verses 12 down to 18 Paul understood church everything in his life was to further the gospel you know I think his sister or Brenda you know or doctor's appointments and things like that you know when sister Brenda is able to go to those and you know and different ones of us that have different hospital trouble the reason we're there is to testify to that doctor right Paul the reason Paul was in prison he said is so that all the palace heard about Jesus Christ we just read that last week the reason you get sick the reason all these things happen is so somebody can get blessed by God for helping you and that you can testify and glorify the Lord Amen and tell them about Jesus amen and there are some times you get sick because it's your fault you don't sleep enough you don't drink enough water you don't eat healthy you catch a germ right and you shouldn't medicine didn't wash your hands that's a big important thing now should wash your hands but see even in our sickness even Paul said everything is working together for good praise God for the furtherance of the gospel so that people know that God is in control amen and Paul said and he said but yet the haters look at him and they find a reason to despise him but Paul said you know he said I'm here to defend the gospel he said either way Isis beached whether people are being a showboat whether pretending or whether they're really sincere when they're preaching he said their way Jesus Christ is being preached and I'm gonna rejoice amen now that's the theatre where Paul would have no doubt seen that they're in a Philip I now I'm gonna I may get to these quotes later I got some quotes I want to share with you if I ever I just had him on my heart I've been wanting to share him with you but let's just let's go to us 18 as we ended there I'm just kind of waiting for the leadership of the Holy Spirit now in those verses Paul's in a palace in prison he said everybody knew where everybody knew the message because of him he was there and it was the further the gospel and he was defending God's revelation and he rejoiced that their you know Christ was being preached whether in sincerity in nonsense City and now in verse 19 let's read it he says for I know that through this turn I'm sure this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ so Paul's expecting to be released from prison amen hallelujah and how is Paul expecting to get out through your prayers through their prayers how is he expecting how are you expecting to get out of trouble amen by our prayers amen that's why you come up here after service amen you want the saints of God you know God hears his children's prayers amen and he said you're praying that the Holy Spirit will be supplied to me that means an incremental daily portion of the anointing of God Church you and I we need to remember our souls are born again thank God but your mind needs a daily filling of the Holy Spirit Paul said I know somebody's praying for me because every day I get a fresh supply of the Holy Spirit I like my coffee every morning I need us fresh supply every morning if I start getting low I get a little nervous now how much more if I get nervous if I don't have coffee how much more should we be concerned that we need a anointing of God amen you know how if I'm really low on coffee brother Brian I'll make sure it gets here Express Delivery my get it here a couple you get as fast as as I can right two days isn't enough I need it tomorrow that's a supply their supply and the Saints were saying God's supply Paul's need give him the revelation as he's in that prison given boldness to witness to those thugs right those prison thugs that are beating him and mocking him and given him moldy bread give him anointing so he can be a real witness of Christ he said I know I'm gonna be delivered to Saint salvation like bang he's not wondering if he's gonna be saved he's he's talking about I'm gonna be delivered out of this prison you are you really think Paul was wondering if he was gonna be saved or not he'd met Jesus Christ for three years and a rave yeah he didn't seem Christ and taught him the Word of God through the Old Testament so he could write the new he knew he was saying my he knew he was a chosen vessel he said but I know your prayers are gonna bring me out of prison and he didn't get out he'd shipped into another prison and he went to house arrest you know in Rome he did now I want to make sure you notice the power of prayer we've got to really make sure that we keep you know and ask God to help us in times of trouble in moments of uncertainty may we learn to pray and call Jesus on the scene listen you know I got those group texts you know like I send to the church the groups if you need a prayer request type it in there just put it in there I know group text can be sometimes annoying especially when you can't get off one and you see all those things pop up come on come on I've asked people can you please remove me from this group text I'm not into this anymore I wasn't I didn't ask to be in this but the point is if you need people to pray call me text me text the group somebody praise God if you if it will help your faith to know that bangs praying for you our sister who are amen if it will help your faith reach out and ask for prayer because it helped all amen it helped the church age messenger the prophet of God it helped him to know the Saints are praying for me I know I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna be delivered and I know they're praying for me to get a fresh anointing can you imagine where they men the conversations sometimes you know they were chained to those soldiers there you know whether in prison house arrest sometimes they'd be chained and can you imagine some of those guys who just reach over and what could Paul do they elbow him they'd smack them they would mistreat him and all these things and he's asking he's saying please pray for me he said I know you're gonna pray for me because I need strength I need a portion of the Holy Spirit I want this whole president know that Jesus Christ died for their sins and raised for their salvation remember at one place incur things he said I chose to come amongst you not knowing anything but Jesus Christ and him crucified so see he Paul knew if I can he said I become all things to all men that I might save some to the Jews I become like a Jew to the Greek I become like a Greek to the weak I become like I'm weak whatever situation I'm in I choose to be all things to all men that somebody might be saved amen that's why when I fellowship with a man I can fellowship with Pentecostals or Presbyterians who have nothing they have no emotion because I've been in both of those churches I was very faithful Presbyterian member and when I was in college because that's what the chapel is up here down the road that mega church that's a Presbyterian Church and I fit in real good there brother bang for a while but after I'm like I'm really hungry I'm getting I'm getting really hungry this milk isn't enough for me I need meat and that's all reaching out for the Baptist doctrine is a little bit more media so more thick you know maybe it was like a smoothie you know so they they had like Nilka at at that church and then I got I got ready for a smoothie and they had chunks of a smoothie in there chunks of fruits well after that Simon came over and brought me a steak a porterhouse steak can I say like that on the Serpent's eat amen and that's exactly what I really started to Ewing sister Karen I really had to chew on that one for a while that was really something that's the first sermon I ever heard was Serpent's eat and since I'm there I think I'll just go back to that thought that's right I didn't even really mean to preach that this morning as I was studying let's look at the second one right here uh it just came to me that a lot of people disagree with the Serpent's II because of Genesis 4:1 I'm gonna read it to you just cuz I I can get it real quick it's right to begin the book and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord now people will look at this and they will say we'll see it wasn't a serpent seed because that's when he knew and you know I've waited on that and I know brother Ram said you know program points it out and says that every man is from the Lord right every man whether it's Judas or Cain their life comes from God now Cain's nature though came from the serpent and his spiritual nature came from the serpent he didn't take God's nature he could have God offered it right God offered him salvation but you know now as I was studying this morning the argument that they give is that seat everything is literal in chapter 3 chapter 3 is literal so it was a literal tree is the literal fruit probably apple right or apricot where the Brian right that's what they say so see they think it's literal and so see they see well chapter 4:1 is literal so see chapter 3 must be literal and it just kind of dropped in my spirit this morning as I was studying and I felt like it was a revelation that God can switch from symbolic to literal whenever he wants so what we know is chapter 3 is symbolic it wasn't a literal Tree of Life it wasn't a literal tree of knowledge of good evil brother Ram said the tree of life was Jesus Christ and brother name said the the tree of knowledge get evil was the spirit of Lucifer the light bear he was the less whose name means Lucifer means light bear he was the most beautiful of all the angels he was he had tablets he had pipes that were built into him his stone all the beautiful stones were covered and he was right there are costs because remember he had two cherubs right covering the throne he was the anointed cherub that covereth he look across at Michael I think it was Michael I could be wrong I think it was my cuz Michaels Archangel and Michael and Lucifer were the ones battling brace God and Lucifer after a few thousand years or maybe million years brother amen he looked after and said you know I'm just a little bit more handsome than Mike oh my goodness look at me I just look my pipes and Mike you know what Tavor it means there it means a tambourine how did say Lucifer had the tambourine and we love the tambourine but he perverted it so that actual word means tambourine so Satan is like leading them and he said let's worship the Lord and he just heard all the angels and pretty soon he thought well since I'm more handsome other people he said I deserve I need to be like the Most High I want to exalt my I want to throne and I want to exalt it above the stars of God I want I want people shouting my name right and so he's able because he's the accuser of the Brethren Johnny he's able to go off and talk to like a third eye can you imagine a third of millions and innumerable numbers of angels he was so slick brother bang he could he could talk and accuse Michael did you see Michael do this I can't believe he wasn't singing as loud as me he's not looking he's not even as handsome as me he said you should join my church and the first church split was in heaven via the most beautiful preacher of all the most handsome preacher of all Lucifer Abel he's such a good liar he's such a good accused to be careful when people are accused and other people cuz Satan is the father of that iniquity brother Brian was found in his heart iniquity means wickedness when you know what the new right also means lawlessness he finally decided one day related I'm not going to obey God's law I think I deserve this now how can he think that because God was so humble God was so great God wasn't showing all of his power as planned yet right God even hid the cross from Lucifer because the Bible said the princes of this world would not have crucified our Lord had they known what was going to happen a man yeah I'm kind of off my subject now I hope that's okay I just felt led not at some point I want to preach it so he does that and he's able to convince a third of them he's able to convince the third one of angels to come over to his side and we know the rest of the war are getting that later by God's grace but I wanted to get back to this thought chapter three Satan has the tree of knowledge good evil chapter three is all symbolic and then in Chapter four switches back brother amen to literal and people say see chapter four is literal the rest is literal well how many know that God switches between symbolic and literal all the time he can do it in the same chapter he don't have to wait to the next chapter but if you are if you want an example of a next chapter I'll give you one let's go to revelation 17 revelation 17 is almost I'm sorry in many ways symbolic but it's also literal in there so see the Holy Spirit can switch back at any time I'll tell you Church God is so wise he hides it from the eyes and the wise and prudent but he reveals to us his children that one earn and really want the truth hallelujah he hides it from the wise and the scholars but he reveals it to those who want to obey the Word of God his children revelation 17 verse 4 the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and drills jewels having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication is this literal brother bang or symbolic what do you think I'm putting or putting on the spot today brother so is the Roman Catholic Church one literal woman or is this symbolic what do you think everybody symbolic the Roman Catholic Church is not just one woman right a lot easier for us just one woman huh but nothing's too hard for God right but let me show you in the same chapter glory verse 9 we get to literal praise God see God switches back from symbolic the literal symbolical intro so it proves you can't understand God with your mind you need the mind of Christ and that's what Paul said that's what we got we have the mind of Jesus Christ amen verse 9 and here is the mind which hath the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth God didn't have to tell us this symbol he didn't have to tell us the revelation of the symbol Didion he could have just said it seven seven heads that would was I'm sorry I forget already yeah the heads God God could have left it oh this beast has seven heads and that many could have moved on and talked about something else but he told us the literal interpretation of the symbol in the very same very same sentence the very same scripture so see Church don't let Genesis 4:1 stumble us these guys think then gals now these guys and gals think they're so smart but nobody's smarter than Jesus well said I didn't come up with that serpent seed he said the angel the Lord told me that I didn't any of the age of the Lord deliver this message amen and for innocent members serpentine doesn't save you it just shines more light at the thing we're trying to see a men hallelujah we don't expect people to everybody to believe that but I expect the bride to believe that because she's got more light right hurr hurr hurr hurr hurr flashlights really working good praise God it's really shining bright on the Word of God and she can see oh this is literal in chapter 3 I'm sorry symbolic in chapter 3 and then it goes too literal and you know in Revelation 18 then he calls her in verse 10 18 10 standing afar off Babylon that mighty City for in one hour thy judgment come amen he jumps back from symbolic to literal literally now she's a City the Vatican City amen and she's going to be destroyed in one hour amen so see Church that's the wisdom of the Holy Spirit boy that just I felt like it fell down from heaven I just started I shook my head like this blaming I know I've been wondered about Genesis and I wrote it I wrote it I was learning about this in 2015 brother Brian and God just dropped that down this morning five years later amen the Bible says wait upon the Lord and he'll renew your strength amen just wait upon these revelations wait on these think wait and God will give you the answer because he's guiding us into all truth just wait just give us some time he'll open it up and make it so crystal clear now I got all these answers and I can't wait to I can't wait for somebody ask me that question because man didn't tell me this the Holy Spirit whispered it down to me I said they're literally thinking how how could it be symbolic and then literal and then it just felt like he just dropped I just started to smile and shaking my head I wrote the dust thank you lord five years is nothing to wait because God does everything in a perfect timing now so you know just so you know to let me just say this we were riding in the band a few weeks ago and my tutor are looking at the National Geographic for kids it's from September 2017 that was kind of you know I'm just meditating on the word and then I think a case sure one of them said daddy did you know snakes once had legs and I thought that's right I forgot about that another kind they make him like like Eve would think he's attractive right I shows you it's a carnal mind he was just like a man in fact he was more handsome than Adam right that Fitness that fit Satan's character he was more muscular he was more stronger he was bigger than Adam because the Bible said after the curse God said Eve your desire which means you know what it means longing or craving your desire is now gonna be to your husband before it wasn't really meant it was at first but then through seeing this handsome serpent this whenever this figure on two feet she got so but guile the Bible says she got so seduced and deceived looking at a member she said she looked at the fruit salt was good for food that's spiritual food and to be desired to make one wise and she made love to the serpent he didn't look like that he was more beautiful just like Satan's always in deception right and then as soon as this happens God comes out and says there's two seeds here and that seed means offspring or children so whatever fruit they ate it caused two immediate offsprings is that right now the reef doctor not was just remind I found this article too this was two different articles NPR recorded it in 2015 how snakes lost their legs God's Word is right I don't care what these demons say I don't care if they got PhDs if they're really out of scientists sister Donna one day they're gonna find out that this word is right they can't explain how a donkey talk they can't explain how God parted the Red Sea but one day they're gonna find out it was right amen the longer they study their science and their laboratories they're going to find that this word has all the answers this word is truth it's forever settled in heaven amen as they're breaking into God's laboratory they're gonna find out God's Word is right and then the University of Georgia had took the same information and they just laid their headline was blueprints forelimbs encoded in the snake genome in other words the DNA of snakes it has the ability to support limbs and they don't find that in any other animal that doesn't have arms and legs already it's the only animal on earth going that has genetic ability that it can support arms and legs but yet for some reason it doesn't have arms and legs that's because God cursed it amen that's because God said you're gonna go on your belly right and lick the dust of the earth all the days of your life but yet God left in there for us to find amen for us to know it because it backs up what we're trying to see I remember I don't have it here but in 1995 the Journal of forensic science reported that one woman had twins by two different men it's called hetero paternal super super fun dication or something like that it's really close it's pretty close to that but I tried to find the pictures this morning I didn't have enough time to find it but I just thought I'd bring that out today does that help by God's grace I mean it might not have been on your list of like I'd like to hear a serpent's he preached today but I just was waiting for the right moment and I was saying holy spirit just let me to preach it when at the right time so I hope that's a blessing praise God and while I'm there let me preach on this other thing too okay just so I can say I want to preach in the last three weeks I just keep forgetting there is a false doctrine going around and it's it's from the tape Church people saying rapturing faith is on the tapes and they use that brother van to say see we got a play the taste not you preachers preach now my first thought was well let me go see where brother Brennan said rapturing faith is on the tapes go ahead and look it's not on the tapes so for years both Johnny we've been here rapture pages all the days raps everybody rat mate I never said except that's not really a quote looks like we got some more studying up to do Church yeah I just thought it out this year too so I'm I've repeated that too now there's a balance in here don't get me wrong I'm gonna get to that there's a balance but that exact quote is not on the tapes here's the quote they're talking about this is from right before 63 the day before he preached serves as the end time and now I believe she's ready to strike that final climax yonder to bring forth a faith that will rapture the church into glory and she's laying in the messages the church I'm I looked at I looked it up that whole sermon for the word take brother Branham wasn't even talking about the tapes this message is word that could mean anything it can mean the sermons it could mean the Bible it could mean the tapes brother Branham never literally says it's on the tape we're really at the end time we've talked about it and everything but the thing has moved up upon us now now let me say this don't get all lazy on God and don't think that rapture and faith couldn't strike in our day you say brother Jesse that's been my how many years has that been that's almost been 60 years but it's closer than it's ever been Church don't let the devil rule you to sleep just go to sleep just take a nap let's be awake let's be looking for the rapture pretty soon she's gonna strike that final climax see Church we are climbing our faith is climbing and our revelation is climbing and when it gets to its height God's going to pull out rad same thing and that's gonna send her into the latter rain anointing and that's gonna bring her up in the air to meet Jesus amen see the bride is climbing see she's growing in her knowledge she's growing in her judgment she's growing cuz he's waiting to strike that final climax how do ya rapturing faith I will say this but men did say rapturing faith is rain our tapes rain not exactly not that I can tell now let me say like this does the rain come when you're listening to a tape sure oh yeah I've had many times I listen programs sermons I'll just start weeping sister Diane I was just saying praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah you've heard people they're listening to brother Branham in the prayer line and that program will call their name and they'll get healed I've heard three or four testimonies about that I've never had it happen to me but different times I've heard different people say that yes the rain falls as we're playing the tape but this a you know first of all that quotes not even on the message praise God and we're not going to idolize the tape we're gonna we're gonna worship Jesus Christ amen we thank God for the tape the tape and the Bible and everything just points us to one thing the person of Jesus Christ amen brother man says God's not gonna plant a new church he's gonna bring the original back to the original seed and the seed is the Holy Ghost the Word of God how is he going to do it in Joel 223 by the former rain that's a teaching rain next will come the harvest rain or rap stirring faith so the left ratcheting bait for the mangas we're gonna be in church we're gonna be in our homes and we're gonna feel it rain and praise god this gets wet in here amen I feel blessings coming down from heaven amen rapturing faith is rain amen we're getting a lot of rain this week I mean you think we're getting too much I felt like we got a little too much that's okay farmers need it thank God I'm not complaining I need a lot of food I got a big family but the Holy Ghost when you when we're in the rapture starts coming sister Karen it's gonna be like rain amen we're gonna feel it all around this I feel it now praise God I feel I want to feel it in my soul I want to feel it in my mind and I want to feel it all my body praise God cuz it's gonna swallow up this body amen hallelujah death will be swallowed up in life the life of this rain one of these days sister Brenda it's gonna start raining hallelujah it's gonna rain down from heaven you might be listening to the tape at the time of it or brother amen you might be sleeping like jesus said they'll be two sleeping and one of you is gonna leave with the rain the other one's gonna stay it might just rain on your side of the bed praise God if I just raid on your side of the machine at the job he meant but either way brother BAE wherever those predestinate seats are the rains gonna find you amen and so are you it's gonna quicken you up to the sky to meet your husband in the air usually rains aren't so selective right but this rain is gonna be super selective just like the lighting goes to right everywhere else brother amen was all darkness except there's this there's this cloud there's this pillar of light coming down upon Goshen I wonder if they could walk to the edge of the the light and darkness and savor right there darkness starts can you imagine and that's how the reign of God is going to be brother Brian whether I'm on the job whether I'm in the car wherever I'm in the airplane if I'm in the grave amen no matter where I am that rain is going to hit me it's gonna bring forth a new body and I'll go see Jesus in the air it's gonna be a selective rain I was just metal wall there and there's a big rock column and how's the rain and the rain will wrap around then if you're worried about it don't be worried God can send he can make it he'll make that rain somehow get to you and they'll get to your soul and they'll raise your faith in such a rap string faith that you you'll know it's there you'll feel it all around your soul praise God pardon me this is token not the first time he preached it two months after he preached it in Jeffersonville I'm looking for a time of a break forth of the Spirit of God I notice he didn't say tape although there's nothing wrong it like you said you might be listening to the tape at the time of the rapture I hope we are because our family listens to it every night we listen to ten minutes of mother Bram I'll talk about it and you know then what we'll sing and pray and everything that I hope it happens my heart listen to the tape it don't matter to me praise God he said in the last days that were living now for another surge a surge named Johnny Smith electric he knows what electric surges anybody ever got zapped by electricity that's a surge yeah amen bang Bang's honest I got pricked one time you know I was I think that's too close to them suck my finger in there on accident I got pricked with one time that's not not any fun brother says it's a surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for what a rapturing face I'm not expecting the I'm not expecting a surge of volume on the tape that'd be good I'm expecting a surge of my soul praise God that's where I'm expecting the surge I'm expecting a surge of you know I get more more computers with more messages I'm not expecting that I'm inspecting a surge of power a surge of faith to see I'm trying to rightly divide that we're yeah we're gonna still to the tapes but it's not like they say where it has to be on the tape and no preachers preaching oh how silly is that just before it comes and everything is sitting right straight in order for that and I believe we're at that time now where the word should have preeminence whereas the word say preachers need to sit down it never says that so we got to give the word preeminence he said the church is just moving up Holy Ghost power is the holy smokes that we're justified by you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing faith they're saying the tape tape tape but man saying Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost hmm remember a tape can be good it can raise your faith but they're making the source of it the tape the source is not to tape my friend that tape had a source the sources heavens headquarters praise God the throne of Jesus Christ that's the source of the rain as we move up moving up right into heavenly places in Christ Jesus are you moving up with your knowledge of God are you moving up in your your discernment for God your judgments forgot you should be moving up right we should be moving up better able to judge excellent things from things that are not excellent okay never ego now I'll get to that okay now I'm already about an hour so let me set my timer ten minutes okay give me ten moon rise I really been taking you along the last few weeks so here now hopefully I don't open I'll feel this so remember Paul's expecting this I hope that's okay sometimes I just feel so burned I got to get those thoughts out I hope they are a blessing to you it's my daily bread I don't know about you it's my daily bread praise God I notice now verse 20 let's close here 10 more minutes okay yeah Philippians 1:20 we read 19 oh ha they lujah or just so you know I did get that date I'm gonna debate that rod Bergen guy from leave aside September 12th on a Saturday I'm gonna debate him but it's a different format he wanted a new format so we're in a debate with 10 questions and answers so I'm gonna write out ten questions give them to him beforehand he can answer him he's gonna write out ten questions that's just the way I like it I like to study before I'm asked a question although I don't mind being asked questions I'd rather much rather study and pray where they've been right so that's September 12th looking forward to that by God's ease ah you know I even said last week I believe that God sent me to defend this message I believe that with all my heart brother Brian God sent me to defend that that's what Paul said I am appointed to defend the message I think every preacher is don't you I mean God told me rightly divide the word of truth that's what he's talking to me by they meant he said if you're a preacher rightly divided you got to divide this is right this is just opinion this is thus saith the Lord this has word this doesn't praise God blippi ins 120 now remember he just said I need your prayers then I'll get out of here and he knew God was gonna do it and then also I need your prayers to get a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit so you can be saved sealed baptized filled with Holy Ghost with amen but we need a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit we're at right here we get so weak in our minds don't we church aren't you ashamed of yourself so I was ashamed of myself this week why why am I so discouraged how come I don't feel like praying and now here's somebody preach on that I was excited to pray this morning you know like I'm ashamed of myself how come I wasn't mom see because God lets us go through those trials to show us the need to renew our minds God wants us always hungry and thirsting for righteousness he said I know this will turn to my salvation I know I'm gonna get out of here and I know your prayers are gonna make sure I get more of the Holy Spirit for my mind verse 20 according to what the earnest expansion my hope was he had a hope he was hoping that in nothing I shall be ashamed oh god help us here but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ should be magnified in my body whether it be by life or death look at that church what was pause one hope his main hope here was that he would be unashamed of the message and boldly present Jesus Christ in life or death don't you want that let's say God let you die on a deathbed don't you want your last words on your deathbed to be praised God I love you Jesus I'll see you I'll see you on heaven I'll meet you at the eastern gate praise God oh don't you want Jesus Christ to be magnified whether you live or whether you die that's what Paul says he says but my earnest hope is that I will be unashamed and everyone will know that Jesus Christ is being magnified in my life so see to magnify Christ that means he's I'm sorry he said in my body yes in my body so listen we can't have the excuse well I'm born again in my soul but you know I'm having a mind battle right now I don't feel like raising my hands no Paul said let my body that means what any men it's got to flow out of the soul into the mind and you gonna let it flow out into the body where people can see it praise God now can be by the things you do or the things you refuse to do I refuse to bow like the three Hebrew children said amen they saw they magnify God by not bowing amen I don't know yeah I noticed Church Paul did I skip it yeah I skipped it Paul Paul's not expecting for God to come down and shake the jail again he already had that happen and Philip I he wasn't saying you know I listen God if God did it once he can do it again he wasn't looking at because Paul knew there's a time and season for everything there's a time to do America like that but he knew by his wisdom but they meant the same time for a great big miracle this is a time for the people to pray and work a different miracle that the prayers of the Saints get me out of here instead of my worship now we like to say O God you did it once do it again right we all said it you did it once you brought this person up you heal me what's healed me again that might that might happen but we got to be so humble and understanding of God's ways and will and time and season that we say like the three Hebrew children even if he don't rescue me I won't worship the devil I'll be obedient to Christ I'll be true he don't say nothing about shaking prisons and getting out of the prison he was gonna come out the natural way sister de niro I think it was Nero Nero was gonna have to say Paul you're innocent go ahead go we're gonna send you off to this other person he was gonna go this ain't the regular way all of the other prisoners but brother bang while he was there ba he was there standing before Nero and saying before on the Caesar he wanted Jesus Christ to be magnified in his body how could that happen if there's gonna be no miracle sister Naomi it's gonna have to be through the lips it's gonna be have to be through his testimony through his nature through his character through the way he talks to the leaders what other way are you gonna witness to your people on your job can you do a miracle and prove a miracle right there for your people you know you can pray that God does America on the job but if God doesn't choose to do a miracle on your job or your family what can you pray Jesus be Magne five in my body let me be so bold for you let me be so unashamed of this word and this message that everybody sees that I'm your true servant oh yeah thank the Lord so through this but the Brian Paul makes it clear we don't have to have a miracle of some some supernatural destruction of buildings or weather patterns or anything like that although I believe in that Karen seen that in her life I've seen it too I spoke to a storm one time it don't have to be in that but Paul says it's going to be in my unashamed my bold witness for Jesus Christ that's how I'm going to make him known so we have to submit our whole body now if we're gonna magnify Christ that means that's to enlarge enlarge Christ through your body make Christ so great through the things you say your attitudes the things you do the way you live your life what you turn down and what you exploit you approve amen magnify Christ in your body this is what Paul says and then he says he's noble these notable words some preachers call these the greatest some people call Philippians one the greatest chapter in the Bible now I think as Isaiah 53 but it's all good you know what I mean it's all eternal but Paul says my prayer is that I'll be bold unashamed he said because for me to live is Christ and to die is gain look at the next verse 22 but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall choose I what not for I am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better there's no words to describe it where they men you can't describe eternity can you you just have to say it's far better than this but RAM said it's beyond sublime there's no other way to describe it and that's that conversation he was having let's go back to that conversation one of that one of the prisoners said I'm gonna kill you Paul Paul would say praise God I gain by going to heaven then he said I'm gonna let you live I'm gonna beat you up I'm gonna let you live he said then for me to live is Christ and the prisoners like what can I do with this guy nothing you can't touch his leg until God takes him amen right you can hurt and beat him but just like job they can't take your life Satan can't touch your life until God said come on home come up son it's your time to enter the gates of heaven come and be received and come and look upon the face of the one you have loved there's my timer let's stand to our feet praise God living here is service for Christ we experience the presence of Jesus Christ but to die its gain you actually gain the person of Christ well Jesse Hauser 2020 going like Christ because for me to live is Christ I've told all those brothers they were laughing at me on the phone I was talking to a couple couple brothers I was saying this coronavirus has been nothing but a blessing to me I got more time with my family I got more time in my study more time at home I got more money I got more time to make videos got more time to write about the Bible for me to live is Christ now God might have let you go through a sickness right and that's part of God's plan but even that even in that we should be able to say for me to live is Christ but to die it is gain what if brother hey man got we're looking like a brother branham look how he left this scene it was so humble right it was so humble car accident he lays there for a few days and then dies on Christmas Eve but guess what church we lost but he gained the people lost the prophet of God but the Prophet gain Christ amen had he stayed his mission his mission was done has he said he stayed here I god raised him up for the bank it would have been more fruit to the kingdom of God but God had already decided he's finished he's preached his seven seals glory he's operating the third Pole he spoken the word he's taught the word remember the third pole is the revelation of the word - he preached eternally lost no doubt people there that couldn't get saved he done all this and his life had had been finished as the testimony had he lived it would be to Christ but to die he would have great gain now as our musicians come let me talk about this here musicians have you come up now I've had a lot of questions about the beyond the curtain of time thoughts I never wondered about the curtain of time for some reason he couldn't see Jesus but yeah Paul says to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord what does that mean does that mean brother Rams vision was wrong no it just means it's a mystery and God's gonna show it to us one day praise God there are different answers brother bang it could be the voice said he couldn't see Jesus because perhaps he never really died he was still alive his body stayed there but his soul no know how that works actually not sure how that works I'm not sure if his soul stayed there for about your but he never really died I don't know if perhaps the multitude was with Jesus member they came running the brother branham I don't know if you have to die and then be present with Jesus by thrown and then they ran over here just to see him just to give him this experience I don't know maybe that could be it maybe you just see Jesus when you arrive after you die and then you go off to join the other Saints or maybe president with the Lord means when you get boat when you when you die and you go to that sixth dimension then you're just dwelling amongst a holy presence the presence of the Lord not the body of the Lord now really Church does it really matter which one of these it is doesn't really matter we know to be absent from the earth from this body is to be present with the Lord however God interprets that let's leave it up to him how many want this life to count for Jesus Christ how many want your life to be fruitful for Christ and yet you know if God takes you you know accidents can happen they happen the message remember a couple years ago pastors children were in a plane and it dropped the brother from Texas McGary out of nowhere his young son in his 20s in a plane just dropped in in the Arizona desert none of us are guaranteed anything church that's why we must live for Christ now and then when God takes us far better far better things await us let's bow our heads for word of Prayer how many would say bro Jessie pray with me that I'll magnify Christ in my body and that my life will be one word Christ very bad that's my prayer for me to live in 2020 sister Beatrice is Christ what's your 2020 like Christ what was my 2019 like Christ it's all about the anointing right he's the Anointed One Christ means you know what for me to live is the anointing but denies gain god bless those hands let's pray a church pray for one another create somebody pray for me one person play for me I'll pray for everybody here let's pray for each other Heavenly Father it's a joy to be in your house today Lord what a privilege Oh God we have the mind of Christ thank you Lord and the Holy Spirit is come and given us a supply this morning Lord God you supplied us with an anointing dear done you supply us with a daily portion of our daily bread thank you lord other you saw the hands that

Christ by what they do and what they abstain from [Music] whether we live or die it's a win-win situation dear God because if we keep living in 2020 and then 2021 Lord willing our lives will be Christ

fruits of the spirit that people see Jesus Christ magnified let us be unashamed let us be bold for the gospel of Jesus Christ thank you Jesus as we worship Lord let your spirit anoint us for in your presence is fullness of joy and you inhabit the praises of your people whether in life or death our life is Christ in Jesus Christ the church said let's just thank the Lord can we let's just praise
