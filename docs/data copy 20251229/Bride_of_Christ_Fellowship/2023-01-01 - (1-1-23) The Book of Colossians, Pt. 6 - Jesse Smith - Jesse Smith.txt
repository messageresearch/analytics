========================================

Colossians chapter 2 verse 1. I want to read down to verse 7 Colossians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7. Lord willing tonight I'd like to preach on the love of God kind of tonight to kind of go back to that the disciple whom Jesus loves series I got a few thoughts on that last night and so girls for Sunday school will probably push it back to next week I want to kind of preach tonight on the love of God okay maybe we can do some dancing tonight by God's grace if that's okay Hallelujah Colossians chapter 2 verse 1. we left off last time on verse 3. so I want to read one two one through three rather as a review and then we're going to focus here on four five six and seven praise God I'll read one through six and then we'll I'll read verse 7. for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for many or for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge look how they're hidden there praise God we're talking about that weren't we brother Chris on Wednesday night God hides himself I showed you the scripture in Isaiah verily thou art a God that hideth thyself so God hides himself he reveals himself and then he hides himself at seasons of our lives and that's when we know when he's hiding that's when it's our turn to go seek and find him praise God like we talked about the isolation series sometimes we're isolated to God to test Us and other times we're isolated with him to seek the Lord verse 4 and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit join and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as you have received of Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him and let's read verse 7 together ready one two three rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding Theron with Thanksgiving amen let's have a word of prayer if you have anything on your heart let's just make it known unto God you know we had four unspoken needs and I'm sure there's others let's just pray together father God we want to see Miracles this year Lord God we want to see Giants fall Lord God and of course we're speaking of spiritual Giants or mountains that need to be moved so we come in the mighty name of Jesus Christ thank you for raising our faith oh God and giving us the Lord another year to worship and love you and serve you so God we give you thanks and praise Hallelujah we believe we'll see Miracles this year father God because you're merciful and you are the miracle working God and these signs follow them that believe Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord they're not works that we would boast of but Lord we would boast in the cross Lord God and the love of God and Lord we would be just standing there when the Holy Ghost moves in a miracle in our lives so God we're just trusting in you Lord God we're rejoicing in you we're thankful Lord for your promises Lord you are here today Lord God your presence is among us we feel your presence oh God your sacredness the Holiness of God so we ask that the great holy spirit will move today God For Your Glory Hallelujah let the the prince of God be felt by each and every person Lord God help me to yield to you may each and every person yield to you as we start this New Year bless your people in the name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God Hallelujah so I want to begin here with this thought and we'll Lord willing try to get through this chapter here today by God's grace we'll kind of see how far we can get and like I said I want to look at the love of God you know more tonight by God's grace I'm just studying a little bit last night and a few different scriptures come to my mind that I hadn't thought about before and so we want to go that route here by God's grace so you can switch over here we're looking at part six here remember you know this chapter here deals with uh some of the heresies that Paul had to warn the Colossians of and remember this was a church Paul had never been to he never seen them you know face to face but he talked to epiphris and epiphrist was constantly praying for them and so church if the Holy Spirit puts somebody on your heart to constantly pray for then you can probably recognize that's your ministry that's that's the person that you need to be in prayer for so epipherals had had the Colossians on his heart all the time praise God and so you know you got to see you know who is God placing on your heart what is the burden that God has given you praise God hallelujah and so you know we look at our lives and we see you know this is the burden I have you have a burden for this ministry or I have a burden for that Ministry I've got a real burden for that that people you know I don't know how many times brother Brian Hawkins has texted me and he's like I just got you guys on my heart you know I'm just praying for you guys and and numerous times I've been wanting to ask him to come and preach you know and uh you know I just know I just feel like that's a good example he said you guys are always on my heart and look how God has used him amongst us you know to be a wonderful blessing and I just think it's beautiful you know the Lord put certain people on your hearts there are certain burdens that are on your heart that God has called you to do praise God and there's certain people you gotta you gotta watch over there are certain people you gotta text them and remind them and and you gotta you gotta follow up with them and call them and how are they how are you doing and and some so some people it's going to be your responsibility God wants you to be a faithful Steward over them God wants you to be a help to those people aren't you glad I'm sure you and I can recognize different people in in your in Our Lives who have been a great help to us I know brother Craig Moore has been a great one you know brother Brooks and and brother Jim Shoemake different ones that have called me and now brother Brian Hawkins have called me and encouraged me at certain times in my life each one of you you know I'm sure God has used you to encourage me no doubt at some point but uh I just love this how Paul never met them but he felt the burden he felt the Holy Spirit talk through epipheris to him and then the spirit of God you know anointed Paul here to write and give them warnings here and of course then you know all this Christian instruction on how they work to live their lives Hallelujah and so and as I said last time you know uh this this city was going to be destroyed in less than 10 years they would rebuild it but then it would of course be destroyed again or just they'd move on but the spiritual disaster has far outweighed the natural and so in other words your soul is more valuable than the physical things that we have praise God God is more concerned about your soul making it hallelujah amen whether we lose things naturally or whether our houses are burned out or whether our cars are getting are totaled you know God's not really interested in those things God is interested in your soul praise God like the Bible says I would that you prosper in health even as your soul prospers praise God God wants your soul to prosper God wants your body to be strong uh so your soul can find the will of God hallelujah amen so you can accomplish the purpose of God for your life Hallelujah and so you know remember the Bible says God will judge our hearts by the gospel that he gave to Paul and this of course is the Judgment standard so Colossians again is the the Judgment standard I'm just quickly going through these and you know we looked at the outline of chapter one Paul greeted them Paul prayed for them he looked at the Supreme deity of Christ so this is something they were you know people in the church would struggle at uh at colossi they struggled you know maybe some were more like trinitarians or maybe some were uh somewhere maybe the two persons but Paul had to let them see that Jesus Christ is God in the flesh Hallelujah that's a good question we talked to we had a Bible study Malachi who was there where the Bible say this week on Wednesday morning with my friend jacorian and he asked me he said somebody asked him who is Jesus and how would how would he respond so I gave him the scriptures Jesus is God in the flesh Hallelujah Jesus is the word of God made flesh Hallelujah and so we can see that this church needed instruction on the godhead thank God they did because we need instruction on the godhead and then he goes through the power of the Cross and and notice this is all focusing on Christ and and then Paul ends chapter 1 with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the mystery that was hid from ages and it's Christ in you the hope of glory this is what Moses couldn't have this is what David and Solomon couldn't have Hallelujah this is something that Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Isaiah couldn't have but you and I are privileged to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God and Paul said it was been hidden from ages but now it's it's revealed in US Christ in us the hope of glory praise God and we've looked at verse one through three now we saw all the treasures of God are in Christ every treasure that we desire today is in Christ and the Bible said they're hidden so there's going to be seasons of Our Lives where we have to be digging in the word of God we got to go looking forward we're going to have to we have to do more than just come to church although come to church is a necessary thing but we're gonna have to spend some more time digging in the word of God we're going to spend some more time seeking Christ ourselves amen you know in the individual setting this is the we'd say the Corporal this is the body set not the Corporal but this is the community setting of Christ but in our individual lives we're gonna have to spend time seeking God because in Christ is every treasure that we desire now you might be looking for a different treasure today that I'm looking for but we're all looking for Treasures in Christ today Hallelujah like if someone's sick like Jose he's looking for The Treasure of Divine Healing well if my body's well I'm not maybe looking for that treasure I'm looking for maybe for wisdom or a revelation or an interpretation of a dream or something you know I'm looking for more than that and so we understand that God has all these things hidden in Christ and every treasure everything that we would uh consider a treasure on this Earth is hidden in Christ so that means our bank accounts are not their Treasures amen although we thank God we have a place to save our money amen that's really not their treasure because we can go look at our bank account and we can visit the bank and we can see it online but but that's not in Christ every treasure is in Christ Hallelujah and so the Treasure of God are the fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God the anointings of the Holy Spirit the wisdom of God the will of God I say the perfect will of God is The Treasure of God hallelujah and so we wanted to finish chapter two I think we'll get through chapter two today uh by God's grace and so remember Paul had a great fight or conflict he wanted them to know the great fight he was fighting for them in prayer he wasn't with them and see church you can fight for people in spiritual ways even though you're not with them Hallelujah you know like I'm sure Austin wishes he could be you know with some of I'm sure he wished he could have been with his grandma and grandpa out there in Arizona or the grandma out there you know when she was dying there right I'm sure uh Lena wishes she could be with her family out there in Arizona but we have to understand even though we're not there we can still fight for them in prayer because Paul never there's no record upon ever meeting them but Paul said I have a great fight for you I'm fighting the fight for you praise God Amen Hallelujah each one of us had people praying for us when we weren't really serving God the way we ought to been each one of us had a someone who had a conflict for us praise God and they were burdened by the Holy Spirit and so so now that we're mature Believers we have to see who is God placing on our hearts amen What conflict do I have who am I praying for who am I concerned about who is God leading me to pray for and so we see this is not for prophets because epiphris was not a prophet but he had the Colossians out of burden on his heart for them praise God and so he was able to devote prayer for them amen amen so again we see Church the power of Prayer Paul said I have a great contention I'm fighting a fight for you in prayer Hallelujah even though you've never seen me face to face okay now the fight was in verse two that your hearts might be knit together in love and that's why this all goes back to love love is the Capstone on the individual God is love love is the Fulfillment of all the law Amen to love God with all your heart soul mind and strength this is the greatest commandment and to love your neighbor as yourself Hallelujah so what was Paul's great fight it was that the people would be knitted together in love they would be unified our lives would be sown together right Lydia is pretty good at sewing right and but is it is it a quick thing or does it take time Lydia lots of time you know Lydia thought about you know maybe I'll be a seamstress you know but realize you know the hours it's not worth it for the hours you invest in it you don't get paid enough right that's why they got machines to do that but if you just yourself you know would try to make money it's a very slow process it's a lot of work and most people don't do that unless they have lots of machines because you just can't make enough money and see that's how it is today Church you know God is knitting our hearts together God is sowing our hearts together one service at a time one year at a time Hallelujah he's knitting our heart like uh like I was telling uh sister or Beatrice and Naomi you know I picked up the girls for the you know uh the play dates I said well it only took us about seven years to do this you know you see how it takes time you know you you got to build a friendship right God has to knit our hearts together right you know it takes it takes years to develop trust it does that's why you never want to lose it right because it's hard to get back it takes years uh to to knit people's hearts together and to really feel like a family praise God you know there are certain people you know that we've had come to the church and we never really felt really connected with them you know they're only here for a little while then you know hopefully it's a good experience I believe it was a good experience for all of them but you know you never maybe really feel the genuine connection but Paul says the prayer his prayer was that our hearts would be sewn together amen it's a long process it's a hard process it's not easy it's not a glamorous process many times I walk in there and Lydia I walk into my office after working she's got all these patterns laid out on the floor The Remnant and it's just if she's bending over and making I don't even not even sure what she's doing but she's got to cut out all the patterns and everything and it's a slow process but then you see on Christmas morning when the girls wake up and they get the new dresses and you see the smile on their faces when you see the end product of all the labors oh that's what God's doing together he's knitting together the body of Christ amen hallelujah knitting us together it's it doesn't you know it's it's difficult at first but slowly but surely over the course of years and months you know our hearts Are knitted together and this was Paul's prayer I went to church whose hearts are sewn together praise God Hallelujah and of course you know the type of the wise and Bush virgin right as a part of the uh of the remnant of the cloth right you have the cloth and uh and the part you use that's the chosen part that's the elected part Lydia cuts out this part this is the main part of the fabric this is the part I'm using and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ she's the one who's who's cut out she's the part that's going to be used she's the part that's going to be raptured amen hallelujah and the foolish virgin is the remnant they're the ones that's going to be left behind because they didn't they didn't uh they didn't have the oil ready right they were supposed to be prepared but God had the wise virgin prepared she was cut out she was the she was the the group that was was chosen praise God she was ordained she was predestinated praise God hallelujah so God want Paul's prayer is that their hearts will be knit together in love that we would the Bible said in verse 2 that we would uh have all unto all Riches of the full understand full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ so when our hearts are knit together in love we recognize the mystery of the godhead how great God is and then the Bible said in humor hid all the treasures everybody say all Treasures ready all Treasures in in the godhead are all Treasures of wisdom and knowledge okay so now we're here here in verse four and this I say lest any man should beguile you with entice enticing words so Paul has a burden for them he's praying for them that they'd be knit together in love but what's happening men are coming around and of course then it could be women too men and women are coming around and they're having conversations with the church members trying to beguile them that's how it always is Satan anoints somebody and they'll get he'll talk with somebody they'll start uh sharing something different that's outside of what's been being preached and to start pulling people away right it's always somebody's influence that starts talking and and Satan slowly Works them down and gets their defenses down and they accept a lie right it's always that way someone talks them out of the truth say church if you can be talked out of the truth and you never had the truth praise God Hallelujah if you can be talked out of a of the the kingdom of God you never were part of the kingdom of God because the Bible said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen amen hallelujah thank God and Satan is always using men and women to try to give them enticing or these are persuasive words my they can really talk these people can really talk and come up with such persuasive and and uh convincing words oh this just sounds right Church it don't sound right unless it's unless it's coming from the word of God is that right but here's what was dividing the church it was making them not love each other first men men and women were persuading them and it was actually breaking their bonds of love and so Paul said this is I'm saying all the treasures are in Christ and you have to be careful because men and women are saying persuasive things that are not in Christ and now Paul's going to go in to some of these examples of how people are being uh pulled away from Christ now uh before we go there though I want to read II Corinthians 11 20. I preached this in the doctrines of devils series here last year thank God we've had good faithful ministers come through our church Hallelujah God's given me Grace you know like I told you that remember last year I showed this preacher and remember I showed you he preached 24 false doctrines in one sermon and somebody asked me and said you need to have him come to the church and I said I'll pray about it and I prayed about it and I did not feel led to have him come and the reason I didn't feel like to have him come was because he don't have a pastor and the church said yeah he had all these testimonies all these Miracles church that don't mean nothing to me if you don't obey the word of God Hallelujah and then now it's been Vindicated that I was right so that that's God's grace that's God's grace who is it that tries to spoil people it's false preachers amen II Corinthians 11 20. because one time I surely knew you know there's there's times there's there's certain times your life you know God's with you that was one time I already knew God was with me Hallelujah they said you need to have them come I'm like I don't feel led if that guy don't obey the word of God he's older than me he's been preaching longer me and he don't obey the word and he don't he don't belong here now look the Corinthians did this for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage they were allowing preachers to bring them into bondage to sin if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man Smite you on the face the Corinthians were letting preachers disrespect them right and bring them into bondage like one thing that false preacher did is he tried to get a man who's not been healed to try to condemn himself it was his fault he wasn't being healed and the man knew right away that wasn't right because God had showed him that wasn't right see that was Satan on that man trying to bind that man into condemnation but the Bible said there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah oh it's beautiful that's how we always know Church no matter how persuasive their testimonies how persuasive their words how smooth they can talk let's see who obeys the word of God Amen brother man said when you got the Holy Ghost you're in the word all the way praise God Glory yeah verse 5. for though I be absent in the flesh Paul says yet I'm with you in the spirit now this is quite a statement joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ I believe Paul would say the same thing if he was here today he say my you look at our church he's saying I'm beholding your order you're a very orderly church amen you're a very steadfast Church Hallelujah everybody's in position praise God everybody's firm in the faith everybody's holding on praise God nobody's wavering and leaving church for months at a time and going out and getting drunk and coming back no sir we've got order Hallelujah we've got steadfastness we're sincere hallelujah we're founded upon the rock of Christ amen Glory now Church isn't this interesting the spirit of God in our souls allows us to be in other gatherings even though we're not physically there like you remember brother Williams last words when he was leaving it was a goodbye he said even though I'm in Ghana he said I'll be with you in the spirit and I was like I was just going to preach on that it's exactly right there's something about it if the spirit and that's why you know I listen to other services online from message churches and I feel like I'm there I can say amen and in one way I am the spirit of God inside of me is there praise God and I enjoy the word of God that I'm hearing I'm enjoying the worship and I'm enjoying the dancing and the shouting and the praising of God and it's like I'm there praise God hallelujah because the Bible says we can be there we're absent in the flesh but we can be present in the spirit praise God now that's a deep thing it's a mysterious thing I don't want to go too far on that but Paul says I can be present there in the spirit even though I'm not present in the physical body praise God now this also gives me another a blessing you know you know over the years I've had different friends and and uh they get mad at me if I don't keep in touch with them no not everybody but there's some I've had some different friends that have criticized me and the reason I know it's wrong is because they've come back later and repented of it and so uh you know we can't let Satan condemn us where you know we're not staying in contact with every single person Church you and I can't do everything praise God as we saw a few weeks ago we can only do what we can do praise God Hallelujah we can't do everything I can't do everything now we should do what we can do we should do all that we can do but we can't do everything praise God in other words we have limits and this scripture gives me a great blessing I can't be in contact with every Christian I can't pray for this gives me a lot of relief I can't pray for every prayer request that comes in brother Brandon couldn't do it either right but we should do the ones we know God is leading us to do Hallelujah we should be as faithful as we can right but this helps us get the pressure off of our lives right Paul never saw them yet he could be happy for them hallelujah it's like those friends you have as friends you have you cannot see them for a couple years and then see them and you pick up right where you left off that's somebody that really loves you that's somebody who's not jealous see there's no jealousy in the body of Christ the only jealousy is God is jealous of our worship amen the Bible says that amen his spirit is jealous to end me praise God God in other words God's one God wants our love God wants our worship he deserves our worship praise God but this verse frees me from from feeling like I have to take care of other people at other churches I don't really have to do that my responsibility is to my flock praise God Amen like I said I've had friends that have said really harsh things to me because I didn't keep in touch with them where whereas other friends I I don't keep in touch with them but then when I see them it's right back we just go right back to the joy that we have together see I've learned I've got a I've had to mature as a Christian I can't let Satan get me with jealousy I can't let Satan get me with condemnation because there is no condemnation to me just say devil you can't condemn me the blood of Jesus Christ has already Justified me come on Church Hallelujah Satan you can't put guilt on me I'm forgiven praise God Hallelujah my spirit even though I'm not there my spirit's with them praise God I don't know how that's possible I don't know it's that Divine attribute it's that Eternal attribute of the spirit of God in your soul it's still with them and church your prayers are just as powerful praise God see there's no jealousy in the body of Christ Paul was praying for their love to knit to knit themselves together praise God even though he's never with them may you be knitted in love may you keep the love in the church Hallelujah and we see God loves order God loves steadfastness God wants you and I in our positions praise God this is how we overcome enticing words this is we oh how we overcome people trying to persuade us to leave the Bible you overcome it by being knit together to the Christian family Hallelujah stay stay in love with Christ stay in love with God's people this is how you overcome enticing words praise God you stay in your position you stay in order you stay steadfast in the word of God now this is a beautiful thought here in verses 6 and 7 we see how we see Paul's wisdom here this is how you stay steadfast you walk with Christ just as you did at the beginning so this is like a first love scripture because he says as you receive Christ walking in him so go back to when you first received Christ how did you receive him Paul said just as you received him walk in him now church that's why I like these Sunday night bible studies because it kind of takes me back to when we first come in the message right because when you first come in what did you want the word of God all the time the word the word the word sit down and teach me the word of God I've got questions give me answers amen that's why there's something special about Bible studies Paul had a hired house and for a year and a half or two years Paul took everybody in for Bible studies and sat them and taught them the word of God a man who is a prophet of God hallelujah love doing Bible studies there's something about sitting down opening your Bible and saying Holy Spirit reveal it to me praise God teach me the word of God oh because I know in you is hid I know in this Bible is hid all the Treasures of the Mysteries and the blessings and the the infinite wisdom of God hallelujah oh my God thank God see how did you receive Christ well first you got rooted in Christ and then you were built up in Christ and you became established in the faith this only comes from sound teaching and it's a beautiful symbolism uh for beginning your walk with God and I want to share this for brother Chris brother Chris you know you and I Jesus told a parable you and I are like one of these grounds your heart is like one of these grounds brother Chris it's in Matthew 13 and also Luke chapter 8 the parable of the four grounds you and I are one of these grounds now the one we want to do is down here bro this is the ground we want to be we want to be a good and honest heart Jesus says the word preach is like a seed right when you hear the word of God it's like a seed is being spread it's being scattered and planted on your heart and you got to make sure you take care of that seed you can't neglect that seed and the church said you cannot neglect that seed even now you can't neglect the word of God that's being preached to us you've got to receive it with a good heart and an honest heart praise God not an evil heart and not a dishonest heart so Paul's warning them you know there's going to be philosophers come there's going to be legalists come there's going to be all these vain uh men tried to beguile and deceive you he said but make sure as you receive Christ that's how you continue serving Christ in other words keep your heart free we say from the weeds right that that pull away uh from your love for God keep your heart honest before God Amen keep your heart in a good condition don't let the cares of Life distract you from the seed of God hallelujah so brother Chris you're one of these four right we're one of these four either we keep all the the uh we keep the word of God with the good honest heart the Thorns Jesus says our cares of the world like money Fame popularity you know women men relationships you know anything that uh bitterness anything anything that would take away your Devotion to God is like a thorn and so we can't let things grow up in our lives we've got to just be we've got to be good Master Gardeners praise God we got to keep the weeds out of our lives this is what's going to keep us strong in the faith we've got to be able to see when is someone trying to plant um you know I've been in contact with this individual or this I watch this video we got to be careful and make sure they're not planning a false seat of corruption in our minds a seat of discrepancy brother man caught it right so this is the person who's totally faithful to Jesus this is the wise virgin this is the foolish version they still have a growth but it doesn't produce all the it doesn't produce fruit it just grows and this is the Wayside uh I'm sorry this is the Stony ground that's the Wayside the Wayside is people that hear the gospel they never believe it the Stony is where we've seen people can be a Stony ground for years and years and years a Stony ground is where they don't have the root of Christ they don't have the ground of a good heart they got a Stony heart and and then when uh when offenses come then then they get offended by the word of God and they forsake the word of God right so when it comes like we've seen when it comes down to who's first family or church they choose family instead of church that's a Stony heart of ground right because they they're offended by the word of God the word of God says put God first put God first but they don't do that they put the family first and it leads into sin in their lives but Paul said if you started off as a good ground continue that's a good ground praise God be rooted in Christ praise God let Christ be your source of strength praise God let Christ be the source of all your vitamins and and and all your minerals praise God in your water and everything you need let Christ satisfy every need that you have praise God let Christ Build You Up into a strong Christian praise God be careful what other men and women say with their enticing words this was the battles these Colossians were going to face and so God had to raise up a prophet to correct him now brother now getting on this teaching this is why we need good Bible teaching every church needs good Bible teaching Bible teaching is a little treacherous at your little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it now let me give an example brother Brandon said I know this example because it happened in a church in Minnesota program has one quote where he says the pastor is the husband of the church and so see if there's no Bible if there's no Bible teaching to back that up here's what the pastor did in Minnesota he's still a pastor there he said well I'm the husband to the church so that means he made all the decisions for every family he would call the family in and say you buy this car don't buy this car he would he would ordain the marriages yeah he's still Pastor I met him before and he said no he said this is your daughter well she's got to marry that person or you need to sell this and give this money to the church oh yeah it's real it's right here in America that's where you know if you know we hear these quotes and it's true in one sense you know where the pastor is is guiding the church because he brings the word of God but he's not a husband over the church like like uh like they're trying to teach Like a Shepherd like a pastor's or Shepherd right he's like The Shepherd of the Sheep but this but without Bible teaching it becomes a control it becomes a Antichrist nickel-laden Spirit praise God that controls the people I mean praise God that's the truth not praise God they're doing Antichrist things that's what I mean but that happened it's happening now in America and no wonder people leave them leave those message churches and say well I'm out of the message that never was the message amen they're preaching Antichrist teaching this is the message the Bible's the message the love of God is the message the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the message praise God so that's why teaching you got to be very careful what you teach the quote you use the scripture you use you got to always go back make sure it's in the Bible praise God oh just like remember just like in the book of Acts this idea came to me as soon as they all came in what did the members do they went out and sold their lands the preachers never told them to do that God let them do that but see with this guy's Church in Minnesota he would have said oh no you got to go sell your land or don't sell your land that's not what the Bible said the Bible said those Believers just felt led to do it and they did it and God bless the church praise God see it's you being led to the Holy Spirit it's you have it's you hearing from God Amen it's you it's you and I every individual hearing what the spirit says to the churches praise God that's just one example just you know to give you some examples oh like that sermon you know of the man who preached the 24 false doctrines he was taking all these uh quotes and misconstruing them and uh he he was saying there was uh he was saying there's like a trial going on in heaven right now and and the Saints could lose their position in heaven impossible impossible remember I preached everybody's long ago but I saw the 24 false doctrines see that's because teaching he was trying to teach but he didn't have a gift to teach yeah right it's treacherous you got to be really careful when you're instructing people what to do you got to be really careful you got to make sure if you got a quote I got a scripture right here to back it up praise God amen teaching is a little treacherous you know he said kind of walking out on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it would be a good idea to kind of bring the church to what I think a complete understanding position of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think preaching is a wonderful thing I believe sometimes brother Beeler that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now look at that teaching can go beyond preaching that's what we're getting a lot in the message today which I'm glad some message churches are having revivals but they're basically just preaching God's A Healer believe in miracles step in your position you know those are all good things but teaching actually goes beyond that teaching will show you your position in the body of Christ and then you stay there in your your position and then you fulfill the will of God for your life amen Hallelujah he says preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word I think conviction might be a better word but same we understand it shows we're lost going to Hell Without Christ right but teaching places a man positioning what he is we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so see we've got to know which position now it's easy for brothers and sisters like I was sharing with Chris he asked me about women preachers this week why can't women preach you know I showed them about Adam and Eve and the law and the New Testament just like Paul says but Church you know sisters uh how how free that you feel right because you never have to worry am I called to preach right and is that nice sisters to know that you know Brothers have the more battle with that you know am I called to preach what's my position what's my position uh but see when when you hear the word of God preach when you're taught the word of God rather when you're taught the word of God you find your position remember that map I showed last year with the Joshua series you know just you know it's like it's like God is leading into you into your promised land and you've got to possess all your land and teaching will show you these are my gifts these are the relationships I need to have in my life this is my occupation this is what I've been called to do and teaching will place you in there because the Bible gives you instruction and you know what to do because the Bible shows you what to do praise God Amen it's not going to give you something outside the word of God it's going to show you something inside the word of God Hallelujah now verse 8 beware so here's a prophet of God filled with the Holy Ghost one of the stars in Jesus hand and he says beware be careful about people beguiling you with fancy words persuasive words beware unless any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ who is Christ Christ is the word so we have to make sure everything we hear of philosophy everything we hear about a tradition everything about uh principles of the world rudiments means principles it has to have a foundation in Christ beware because this is how Satan tries to deceive many even in the church this Paul's not writing to people outside the church this is the church amen so he lists four things here where people can be deceived now let me read this here's some Modern uh philosophies that we've got to battle today atheism is a claim that there's no God and we know what the Bible says about that a fool says there is no God right but there will be people in the message does God even is God even real was God really with brother Branham or not how can you go from worshiping God and trusting God and then you get deceived well I don't even know if there is a God I don't even know if God was with brother Brandon or not how could you do that Paul said Beware evil spirits will work on people's minds it's the greatest battle ever fall and you ought to thank God if you've got to sound mind today praise God it's the greatest battle ever fall is to keep your sanity in your mind Hallelujah they can go from believing Acts 2 38 they can believe Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30 and then years later I don't even know if there's a God anymore how can you get to that spot because the devil's come in and you did not beware of his lies Church the Bible says how many I love I love when people come up and say I want a closer walk with God God because it's an easy answer you want a closer walk with God draw an eye to God and God is the word you got to spend more time with God what's my answer I want to be closer to God you got to spend more time with God I got a real good Bible answer for you right now you want to be close to God spend time with God but these people over years they don't see they just come to church and that's good that but that's a feeding praise God you got to go home and you got to make it live in your home praise God you got to have prayer services in your home amen where people shout and scream that's a beautiful testimony last night Hallelujah you got to praise God you got to lift you got to feel the prince of God all around you praise God on the job in the home wherever you are in the school you want to feel God's presence wherever you are praise God but they go for years and they don't they no longer feel presence of God at home no longer feel God's Presence at work no longer feel God's presence anywhere because they're slowly talked out of it the second one is agnostic how many heard of agnostics agnostics they their whole premise is there could be a God but there might not be we don't know for sure and if there is one we can't know him yeah it's kind of like on the fence it's like there could be I don't know and if there is we can't know them but the Bible says we can know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings amen job said I've heard but now I see amen hallelujah praise God we can know God Amen we can know him by his spirit and by the word of God hallelujah but see these people well you can't really know God in the message you know you really can't understand him is there a god I don't know you know I I guess I'd rather just serve God and just in case when I die if there is a God maybe he'll let me into heaven that's no God shows up there is going to be a judgment everyone is going to have a judgment day for their their their beliefs their deeds whether it was good or evil we're all coming down to judgment and may God help us to be judged now so there's no judgment later there's just rewards later praise God every deed will come into judgment the Bible says every deed so atheism agnosticism you can't know God oh yes you can oh yeah Hallelujah I know him I mean no Jesus praise God I talked to him this morning I'm gonna tell you all right good old song I love that song brother I talked to him today amen thank God Amen see when God answers your prayers you have a dream or a vision or something Supernatural it proves you know Jesus Christ amen amen amen I know him Hallelujah now do I want to know more of course but I know him Hallelujah I know him when that sweet Spirit comes on me praise God I know in the conviction of the Holy Spirit comes on me because it's the spirit of Truth see when you know the truth and you're supposed to do it that's when God's anointing is all over you praise God because it's a spirit of Truth well I shouldn't do this I should do this when you know that's the truth then that's the spirit of God anointing you and the Bible said walk in this mirror and you shall not obey the lust of the flesh praise God so often we're walking the spirit we don't even realize it when we're walking obedience we are walking in the Holy Spirit praise God you know that makes me think of a scripture here let me look it up real quick yeah let's go to uh Luke 5 17. remember Church there's different anointings of the Holy Spirit like I just said we might not even feel the anointing honest but if we're walking obedience and we're purposely trying to not give in the lust of the Flesh and sin throughout the day we are anointed with the Holy Spirit now this one here in Luke 5 17 Malco you want to read that Luke 5 17. I'm sorry you're not there that's okay are you gonna get there sorry about that I thought you were there buddy Luke five you want to read that Luke 5 17. now see here the power of God is a miracle power amen the anointing is just filling the place right it's a different kind of anointing we may not feel like when we're on the job or at home like God is well God is really anointing here right but in this case if the power was there to heal in other words a great anointed to come and people just had to step into that anointing and just agree with that anointing praise God they just had to follow that anointing praise God but all throughout this so this this scripture is a great example of when God's power is just filling a place you know you feel it on your flesh or you're going to cry like I usually cry under those kind of anointings you know but even if it's not you can still be walking in the anointing of the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah and God's power can be there to heal God's power can be there to deliver praise God I just want to encourage you that you're what when you're walking obedience God's spirit is anointing you praise God the power of God is upon you Hallelujah you're you're obeying the word of God God is anointing you he's walking with you he's protecting you he's blessing your life amen may not even feel it we'd say like a great powerful anointing like oh God is sweeping through this room we may not even feel like that but if we're obeying the word of God God's spirit is here praise God Hallelujah so I just want to make sure I read that by God's grace that kind of came on my heart before service now the third type is a modern philosophy today is called empiricists it's a hard one to say empiricists they assume that experience is the basis of knowing all truth so they say well I've never had an experience with Jesus so I don't think he's true see that's a philosophy well if God never raised anybody from the dead then he must not be real see yeah you have to go by an experience they say you've got to have the experience to know right and but that's but everybody has a different experience right not everybody's going to have Noah's experience and we can we can understand a lot of the things he went through but none of us may have that experience none of us may have Moses experience see so these philosophies uh well you know the Satan saying well you've got to have an experience just like me we found that out with the baptism Holy Ghost some people say to God some people don't it doesn't come the same way for everybody but one thing it will produce is the love for the word of God it will guide you into the truth of the word praise God like I love how brother says in the forest seal you might dance you might shout you might speak in tongues he says it doesn't matter what form it comes in as long as you obey the word of God Amen Hallelujah I think that's a beautiful quote I don't care what forms it comes and he says as long as something happens he said that's the main thing praise God oh God just let something happen to each one of us amen something Supernatural happened praise God where I know I'm changed Hallelujah I'm not what I used to be Hallelujah but beware of philosophies well you gotta have the you have to have the same experience you've got to speak something into existence now that's where the seven Thunders went off they said in order to have virtue remember in order to have virtue they said someone has to touch you and then you have to feel that you both of you have to feel the healing go out of you into the other person that's what that's what Joseph Coleman said he's dead and gone now but he was ordained by brother Brandon but then of course he fell away in his false Doctrine he said you don't even have the anointing of virtue unless someone touches you and they get instantly healed and you both feel it that's not that's an experienced thing that's an empirical thing we've got to have this experience no you don't the Bible said do all gifts of healing now who's right the false preacher or the Bible that's pretty easy one answer you see but yet that'll deceive people how do they get deceived by that it's through philosophy and vain deceit they're not focused on Christ amen sounds like I mean they're using Christ scriptures right virtue went out of Christ but without looking at all the other virtue scriptures for example Ruth Boaz said all the people of this city know you're a virtuous woman and she wasn't walking around healing people you're healed you're healed you're healed you're healed that wasn't what she was she was picking up all the wheat or The Barley rather she was just humbly staying in her position amen may God help us to stay in position Hallelujah you gotta look at all the scriptures on virtue that's pretty good sermon it's a good enough sermon to name somebody after I praise God I mean we all want the virtue of God in our lives but see that's how Satan look he can take a scripture in a quote and then he can just deceive the masses with that and then he'll beat you down and and bring you into submission to that right that's what that's what happened in the seven Thunders movement I didn't happen in New York right and then they said if you're not shouting and screaming and dancing every service you're backslidden I know that because uh Craig and Dave and brother Brooks went there and the preachers were blasting them because they weren't worshiping the exact same way they were yeah so see how see how we have to be aware see everything we have to be very careful what's coming across the pulpit and we got to be very careful what we're listening to from other people a holy ghost-filled prophet Paul took his time to tell these people these things so why so they would find all their Treasures in Christ amen thank God find all your Treasures in Christ the next one is the rationalist a rat a rationalist assumes they can reason their way to truth but Church all human mental capacities are limited like here's a tough one with that why do bad things happen to good people see and because people can't reasonably ration this well why was my child born with with this disease why did my child die of cancer like they can't rationalize it so because of this philosophy they just say well God must not be real God must be against me so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna leave Christ but my wife reminded me of a good scripture in Exodus Moses was complaining to God and said I can't talk and God said who made your mouth he said don't you know that I made the lame the Halt and the blind and the church said uh you've got some good good thinking now God make some people deformed because there's some testimony he's going to bring out of that like I was listening to a sermon last night from Louisiana that had a beautiful testimony some message believer got saved and then he died the next year and they're like what that's my best friend he said they went to the funeral it was out in the middle of Mississippi there's no message Church and that he went there the preacher it was like his best one of his best friends that died after a year in the message and they said it right around the table after the funeral they just started talking and four people got saved four people got saved after God had to take home a young man and there's no preacher so God had to send in a preacher there at a funeral and the Bible says don't you know God takes some people young to be able to avoid evil things that may happen later in life a rationalist though can't handle that well that doesn't make any sense to me it doesn't matter what makes sense to us because we are not the author and finisher of this world Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of our faith Hallelujah we just speak this world new existence we don't have control over nothing you can't even keep your heart beaten it's automatic praise God you can't keep anything you can't make enough oxygen you can you can't make yourself live through AI we talk about that you cannot make yourself living on God's in control God's a great one so we must cast aside all rational thoughts and we must accept the word of God hallelujah because we know one thing for sure he created all things and the last one the last main philosophy today is theological liberal liberalism which means truth changes with time and The Church Must therefore adapt to changes in the culture that's where a lot of famous preachers are doing today letting homosexuals into the pulpit right well my like the famous preacher said my view on LGBT is all is evolving Church there's nothing to evolve there's nothing to change because God's word don't change praise God Hallelujah and the Bible said you add to it he said God will add the pledge to your life if you take away from it God takes your name out of The Book of Life how many of these people are going to be in heaven how many famous preacher is going to be very hard for them to get to heaven but we're not ones who are liberal with the word of God we believe the word of God we're traditionalists in other words we just stay with what God's word says amen Hallelujah quite a New Year's Eve or New Year's Day service here got a thought I had a lot of thoughts I had a hard time kind of knowing which way to go today hopefully this is a blessing to you by God's grace now George I want to say this not every tradition you you hold is sinful you know we hear the word tradition we're instantly like oh Traditions are up now that's true with Jesus said traditions of men the Pharisees said she's had traditions of men but you ever read this scripture therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or by an epistle yeah brother Chris epistle is a letter like one of the Apostles would write good question brother so see Paul was telling the Thessalonian icons or Thessalonians he was saying you know if you have a good tradition that you hold and it's a it's a holy thing keep that tradition it might not be written in the word but as long as it don't take you away from Christ there's nothing wrong with it that's called a Christian Liberty praise God like like for example brother bam had those uh sunrise services now not every year he did it he didn't do it later on in the 1960s but he would have a 6 a.m service on Easter morning now how many want to come at 6 30 6 a.m on Easter I'll be waiting for you obviously I'll be calling texting you what are the other notifications off turn on your notifications why is your phone off we got to have church Sunrise Service it's just a tradition you know in the early church I was reading brother Brown said this too in the early church after like a 100 A.D they wouldn't let people get baptized for six months because they were finding so many people get baptized and fall away because they weren't really dedicated so they started tradition it was 180 yeah I was in that Time Magazine it was in that Time magazine article where they baptized the name of Lord Jesus in Rome they found so many people come in and go out come in and go out and so they just made this tradition we're just let's let's be dedicated let's see if they really want to be baptized no I don't know I wasn't there but if that tradition was okay by God then they could have kept that now the Bible says to be baptized right away but then the devil come in and was perverting that so that's just an example I don't know whether it's right or wrong I'm just saying I'm trying to give you an idea of a tradition I want you to see that you know Satan will come in and they'll try to he'll try to get people under condemnation and God doesn't lead us to condemnation God leads us to Freedom you are free in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah you're free to obey all the word of God and have Liberties inside of it so why you know why how do we why is he warning us about these philosophies because in Jesus Christ is all the fullness of God so be careful any other source that we're getting inspiration from or any other source we're getting influenced by be very careful because all of God is in Christ Hallelujah and in Christ is every treasure anything that's valuable during 2023 was already in Christ hallelujah amen any testimony we're going to have this coming year it's going to be valuable it's going to be a treasure because it was in the mind of God first Hallelujah something from the word of God that came out of the word of God and manifested our lives it had to be in Christ first Hallelujah and look at this church you are complete in Christ not philosophies not wisdom of men not traditions of men well you are complete in Christ he is the head of all principality and powers in other words every Power is subject to Jesus Christ Hallelujah now here we get into now the churches the church in colossae or colossi was influenced by Judaism now we're getting into legalism so you're completing Christ in whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision without hands in putting off the body of sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so circumcision was a surgery done on boys to permanently cut away excess flesh and Paul uses a symbolism here you're made perfect in Christ because Christ has cut away your previous sinful life and it's not coming back amen it's permanently cut away you've had a permanent surgery you're complete in Christ amen Hallelujah Paul's saying don't don't find any uh don't find any uh Pleasures in life from the things of the world or philosophies you're complete in Christ Christ completely separated you from your past life and now you're complete you're better you're better with Christ in fact that's all you have is just you and Christ amen buried with him in baptism so we get this illustration baptism means the old Chris was buried right just like the old flesh was put away with circumcision where also you're risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised us from the dead how many raised from the dead today praise God oh yeah absolutely amen things I used to do I do them no more praise God Hallelujah see this is how we overcome philosophies deceitfulness of men and women and also Jewish legalism is all the treasures are in Christ you're buried with him in baptism wherein also you're risen with him through the faith of the operation of God hallelujah who raised him from the dead Hallelujah oh my I mean the difference between the first time I was baptized and the third time I was baptized is unbelievable the first time I was baptized yes I wanted to try to serve God I went down I was so happy when I come up when I was father son Holy Ghost when I was 16 I got baptized in the Assembly of God Church Aunt Betsy was there Dustin might have been there too no I don't think so but I felt good but as soon as I got to the car cam and Cam and Sam turned on 92.5 KISS FM and I specifically remember I just started moving and singing along with those rock songs and that was the end of my walk with God right there it lasted less than an hour but the next time the last time I was baptized the third time I was baptized rather Hallelujah I went there to the waters and brother Brooks I was talking with him I said brother Brooks I deserve to die I deserve to go to hell but Jesus Christ paid my price amen and I'm showing everybody that I'm going to be baptized in Jesus Christ's name today Hallelujah and I drove three hours to be baptized I went down the water I come up and I've been more than a conqueror ever since that day praise God I got in the car and I turned on brother Branham instead of 92.5 KISS FM I turned on some good sermon praise God to listen to the word of God hallelujah the old man is dead a new man is risen a new daughter of God Is Risen through the operation of faith faith trust has come into our Revelations come into your heart your dad's your own life and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus I was looking at some of those knives for circumcision online you should do that sometime not very pleasant if that shivers down my spine I don't know about all of you but I would send shivers down my spine and this is what the word of God does it separates us from our past life it's a complete separation Hallelujah those things are dead our former life was dead and our new life were complete in the new life in Christ Jesus our lord Glory and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you some trespasses and the church said oh let's all say all ready oh see you are forgiven all trespasses God cannot hold things against you right God God cannot say you're Quicken but you're still dead or you're partly Quicken but but part dead no the blood of Jesus Christ in heaven separates you from all your sin right like that Revelation I got about job you're perfect in heaven but you're a process of your work in progress on Earth so you're so perfect in heaven you got a theophany body waiting for you in heaven amen a word body you got a perfect word body waiting for there and the Bible said they always behold the face of the Father in heaven you have a theophany body I have a body waiting there it must be labeled Jesse Smith Liberty and Church age you know 1980 to whatever I don't know whatever it has my spiritual DNA number on there I don't know what number it is maybe my spiritual Social Security number's on there but I've got an eternal body waiting there and as soon as this body would die the soul and the spirit go to that body praise God so in heaven God knows God sees me I'm perfect I'm already completing him praise God Amen I've already got representation I'm already beloved in heaven I'm accepted in heaven Hallelujah I am God's beloved Hallelujah so are you praise God so are you you're dead from your sins and You're Made Alive you're forgiven all your trespasses and the Bible said he blotted out verse 14. he said he blotted out the handwriting that was against you that was your certificate of debt so you had a certificate that said you you owe God all this because of all your sins there was a list of all the wrongs you've done but the Bible said that was blotted out and the Bible said it was against you you had a record of all your wrongs against you but Jesus took it out of the way and he nailed it to his cross amen what do you say on the cross it is finished praise God it is paid for praise God think about that all the things you ever did all the all the all the Commandments you broke Satan had this list and he could accuse you accuse you but God took it and nailed it to Jesus cross and now it's paid for you're redeemed you have a new life a new creature forgiven of everything praise God that's what I call Redemption praise God hallelujah this is what Paul's trying to show them to help them overcome these philosophies can agnosticism wash away all your sins can rationalism rationalism wash away all your sins no can legalism wash away our sins no because as soon as you break one thing oh and I'm going to hell no but the blood of Jesus Christ perfects you praise God forgives all your sins amen forgives all your iniquities praise God he nailed it to the cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them I'm sorry he made a show of them openly triumphing over them now church this word spoil means disarmed Jesus disarmed all the powers that were against you in other words he took away all their ability to be able to attack you right and over I should say like this overcome you all the authority that they had over the Old Testament Saint Satan had all this authority over the Old Testament Saints all that Jesus conquered and he took away the keys of death and Hell praise God Amen he took all those Powers away and that's what I love what the Bible says now if he's took it away their their weapons the Bible said there's no weapon that's formed against us shall prosper praise God Jesus has disarmed them right the only way we fall is when we when we let we open ourselves up to those weapons praise God but the weapons cannot defeat us because we have a greater weapon we have the blood of Jesus Christ we have the word of God hallelujah and our enemies been disarmed and look we've got the word of God we're fighting an enemy who's are we fighting a line with no teeth we're fighting an enemy who is disarmed has no weapons but here we stand with the word of God Amen what a blessing praise oh my church that makes a spiritual battle just look unfair praise God Jesus has disarmed your enemy and you're standing with the armor of God and the sword of the spirit praise God oh God thank God he triumphed over all these enemies I'm trying to get down to this end of this chapter I'm going to try to speed up by God's grace I want to try to get make some progress here verse 16. so because of this because all your sins are forgiven let no man therefore judge you and meet or and drink or respect of a holy day or of a new moon or of Sabbath day of course speaking of Jewish traditions right Paul told those Colossians don't let any man judge you because Jesus paid for all your sins but if there's some certain tradition you do if there's some certain belief you do that helps you feel closer to God you can do it within the liberty of the Holy Spirit remember Paul kept a valve not we don't have time to go there in Acts 18. he let his hair grow long now look at that the very man the very man who said men should not have long hair kept the Nazarite vowel and let his hair grow we don't know how long it went but when he went to Jerusalem the Bible said he shaved his head after the end of his vow was over isn't that something ah now I don't expect you Brothers to have dreads now coming in next year I mean you could do that but you're really pushing it he kept about we don't know how long the vow was but he had the Liberty to keep this Nazarite vow because it helped him feel closer to Jesus now this is the verse I use about you know giving gifts to my children on Christmas like that's why I was talking about amen my Christmas is a sacred time for us we get to we get to sing more about Jesus we get to talk more we read more Bible verses now this year we didn't because Christmas was on a Sunday we come right to church and heard about Jesus well we come here and Pastor Frozen went to my house a little different situation this year but but you see we when we're really forgiven we don't let anybody judge us in other words it doesn't bother me what they say about me because I'm free in Christ I'm not a servant to sin this is a Christian Liberty I have see you got to live above that because it's Satan trying to make you feel discouraged Satan trying to discourage you right Satan's trying to make you feel condemned but if you're in Christ you're a new creature you're complete in Christ and no man will spoil you with vain philosophies or deceits go to Romans 14 5 there see all these Liberties are just Shadows but the real thing is Christ Romans 14 verse 5. got it there Emma you want to read that Emma got it see it doesn't matter if whatever day you esteem more that's your day in other words draw closer to God that day see that's why I was telling my wife I was telling somebody else you know if it's a sin uh if it's wrong for me to give my kids gifts at Christmas well then there's no Christian Liberty then for that day then the Bible would have to consistently condemn that day but the Bible don't condemn that day right so see I don't let other people judge me I let Jesus judge me Hallelujah and because of this because the truth it sets the people free from being condemned it says I'm free from the lies and the philosophies of man see all these things all these Liberties are a shadow to come but the body is Christ the body Believers is Christ Hallelujah now here's the balance for us uh brother Chris First Corinthians 8 13. First Corinthians 8 13. and he's a new believer that's why I called you know his name wherefore if me make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offend in other words we have different Liberties as Christians but if anything we do causes somebody to sin then we should stop doing it like Christians have Liberty to drink wine now the reason was because in those days they didn't have all the water filtering systems like we got today so water many times wasn't good to drink so they had to have watered down wine if I'm not mistaken right that's why Jesus drank wine because that was it was healthier than just straight water right because of all the diseases in there or whatever bacteria whatever you'd have well now today's different now we have Liberty to do that brother Chris but you'll never see me drinking wine except here at Communion oh amen good yeah yeah I'm not I'm just I'm explaining to you a liberty Hallelujah Glory so we have Liberties you know with with uh wine we have liberties with jewelry you know I wrote a book on that liberties with holy days liberties with vows we have all these liberties but we have to make sure everything we do is is Godly and it doesn't cause other people to sin so like with wine if if I went out to Applebee's and somebody saw me drinking a beer there or somebody drink it I wouldn't drink beer but if you saw wine they said oh if a pastor can drink well that means I can go get drunk then that would be a sin for me to do that but if they come into church and I'm drinking wine here and I don't get drunk well then they can't use that against me but if they see me drunk out there at Applebee's well yeah that that's causing other people to sin and that would be wrong that's why you'll never see me drink alcohol except right here see all these Liberties are Shadow things that come but the body is Christ verse 18. let no man deceive you of your reward now see look listen church people that get caught up in some of these things they lose some of their reward in a voluntary humility so it sounds humble but they're really not being humble they're they're legalistic these were Jewish legalists and they worshiped Angels now we have a lot of that with uh the New Apostolic movement which is like the Bethel churches the hill song churches some of these people say they talk to angels well if it says anything outside of the word that's not an angel of God that's a fallen angel and some of them act like their angel is like greater than God or something see now look they look so humble but y'all be careful and they're actually worshiping Angels well I heard from an angel the angel took me here the angel did me there and they're intruding into those things which he had not seen vainly puffed up in his fleshy mind that's why I love the angel that visited brother Brown always pointed him back to the word of God Amen he sent me I'm going to give you two signs just like Moses had two signs amen hallelujah about the tent Vision brother I'm going to preach on this whole thing later the angel said don't you know the tent Vision the in the tent Vision Brother Band went in a little tent and people are going in there coming out getting healed and brother I said what was the tent Vision the angel said don't you know our Lord says go into the prayer closet and pray and when you're and you pray there I'll reward you openly praise God see the angel always has a Bible answer praise God if he's a real angel of the Lord hallelujah but these demonic people they worship the angel and they have a pretend humility but a really humble person obeys the word of God see and not holding the head from which all the body and joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of God so they're beholding Angels they're they're focusing on traditions and philosophies instead of holding on to Christ and increasing in more of the word more of the word more of the word that's what we need all the time not more of my thoughts more of the word of God hallelujah wherefore if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world that means principles of the world like philosophies why as though living in the world are you subject to ordinances see these people are getting taken over by you can't worship at this new moon day you can't eat that you can't drink that you can't do this day see they were getting over they were getting overtaken by deceiving spirits and church let me just say this there is a awful critical spirit going around the message right now it's trying to get people to criticize one another and also criticize brother Branham this is one great thing we're battling right now this critical spirit see but what does the Bible say hold on to Christ he's the head of all things amen he's the head of everything hold on to him if you see and stay connected to the body of Christ get your nourishment get your uh get all your needs met through Christ and the body and increase with the word of God all the time don't let anything take the place of God's word in your life praise God anything take away from your time to feed on God's word so he said don't let people pull you away from the word and subject to their uh their legalism see and then he gives examples like don't touch this don't taste that don't handle that see I remember all the old clean laws the clean and unclean laws of Judaism don't eat don't eat pork now some people shouldn't eat it right your body reacts to it bad you know I just thought Alina yeah I wouldn't even if I ever reacted that way too but see some people make you know legalism out of certain things and so Paul says the reality is Christ Christ is the reality of Liberties in Christ but make Christ the head of all things you do verse 22 which are all which all are to perish with the using see all these natural things they're going to perish and they're after the Commandments of doctrine of men all these Traditions come from Men right they come but we have to have Traditions that come from the word of God from God's word Hallelujah and this is what Paul warned them about not the earthquake in 10 years so see George even like even at the raptures in 10 years right or even if the tribulations in 10 years Paul would say keep your lives clean now hold on to Christ he's the head now amen don't worry about oh the economy is going to fall Paul didn't Paul didn't warn them that the economy was going to crash literally in 10 years he said take care of your spiritual condition amen worry about being in love with Christ worry about being in Christ be complete in him find hidden treasures in Christ Hallelujah economy is going to go up and down right things are going to rise and fall destruction is going to come natural things all these natural disasters he says save yourself from spiritual disasters now here we are a year from this Russian war look everybody's going to say about the bombs and everything here we are a year later now what if we took that whole year worried about Russia we would have been living in fear that's another good example whether they bomb us or not let's serve Jesus Christ yeah I just thought about that I just thought about that now yeah so in other words Satan will make anything I'll make any do anything to get your eyes off of Christ the word but Paul says increase in God find your Treasures in Christ the word don't follow Commandments and doctrines of men which things indeed have a show of wisdom in will worship now this is the bad will worship remember the will of God is remember the will of man is in the soul will worship is like Cain he worships according to his own will but Abel had God's worship praise God not self-will but God's will see all these all these legalistic things all these philosophies they have a form of worship they seem humble and and some of them do cause you to neglect the body see like fasting like over fasting right or doing certain things but it's not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh is that the end of chapter two yes so by God's grace uh chapter 3 we'll look at Lord willing later on by the grace of God so I want to stop right there musicians can come by God's grace and then tonight Lord when I want to preach on a disciple whom Jesus loved part three part two is the one where I had where Austin had a great testimony there so I want to look at part three here tonight by God's grace let's stand to our feet hope you enjoyed chapter two of Colossians praise God hallelujah church is so applicable like I gave with some of those examples so applicable people can hang around the message people can even preach in the message but if Christ isn't their absolute if they don't go back to Christ for every answer every question people can be deceived that's just what Satan wants to beguile people to get their minds off of Christ and get it on something else we've got to keep our minds completely on Christ this year this year praise God let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer Hallelujah father God we thank you for today Lord God we want to thank you for your word Lord God as we said Lord Colossus economy was going to collapse in 10 years literally through an earthquake but Lord your spirit never told the people to Beware of the earthquake your spirit said Beware of vain words doctrines of men philosophies of men [Music] who told them they were complete in Christ and to increase in more of the word of God [Music] or we don't know if there's a atomic missile coming this year or not we don't know we don't know if the economy is going to collapse know one thing we do know is that we are complete in Jesus Christ and Lord we want our hearts knit together in love Hallelujah the Lord as I said Lord through that verse 3. may we find all of our Treasures in Christ Lord just we pray I pray Lord God May everyone's treasure be a spiritual treasure we seek after a spiritual Treasures start this year Lord may we find all the treasures hidden in Christ may we go looking Hallelujah searching and finding Trends in Christ thank you for the people's patience Lord God I pray God you minister to all the needs here tonight give you all the glory Lord bless your people in Jesus Christ's name Saint said family desires prayer more than
