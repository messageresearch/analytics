humbly in Jesus name amen glory to bless you thank you musicians let's take our Bibles I have few places I'll be reading from [Music] let's turn to a class ecclesiastics chapter 3 very very familiar scripture I will just read one verse verse 1. to everything there is a season and a Time to every purpose under the heaven please don't you with me to John chapter 18. verse 36 37. and pilot therefore said unto him a king then and Jesus answered thou says that I am a king to this end was I born and to this course came I into the world that should bear a witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and pilate said unto him what is truth hey when he has said this he went out again unto the Jews and said unto them I find in him no fault at all but have accustomed that you release unto you one at at the Passover will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews then cry day or again saying not this man but Barabbas and I'll just stop there I have few scriptures but we'll read through as we go God richly bless you you may have your seat I want also to thank each one of you for the election for the confidence you have in us to serve as deacons we are here to serve you the leadership of the church is not to be Lord over the Lord's body but to serve the Lord's body so thank you for that confidence and by God's grace we'll do all we can to serve you in everything that we do and we know that we serve the Lord by serving his body amen I'll go a little slow this morning and bear with me I just have a thought that I believe the Lord wanted me to go this direction as a man I struggle with it and there are many topics I can speak about but I believe that's why he wanted us to cover today we'll be talking about purpose maybe not something that Branham covers specifically as one message but as when the law starts to deal with you in an area it's essential to see what the prophet has said about it for the Bible has said about it and as I start to look he actually touched on it all over the place that scripture we read talk about to I I just want to read it exactly the way ecclesiastic the Bible said it to everything there is a season and at time in every purpose under heaven so there is a time that is associated with the purpose it's not just a purpose that is Broad a purpose needs to be attached to a season or a specific time you see the prophet of God I've been going through a series and I think baloney or some of the ministers taught us some time back that is essential as you listen to the word of God or the prophet that you go through in a series so I started listening to messages like uh the spoken word is the Original Seed and after that you have expressions and after that you have the sign of the end time seed and so on and so on so he said God will give a thought to the prophet and he will go over the same thought over and over through multiple services so to capture the whole thought you need to follow how he expanded on it so as I got to the message expressions I took a service in Lethbridge based on the original series The spoken word is the Original Seed but right after that he preached expression which is actually a message that he preached after or together with a funeral of her sister amen and within that message he's talking about the purpose is crucial because our sister served her purpose know what she did not all the activities but the activities needs to be linked to a purpose amen Christian life is not our activities it's not about what we get or don't get it's about purpose so it's crucial for us to know what's our purpose I'll just read the definition according to Webster's 1828 purpose that which a man set before him as an object to be rich or accomplish an end or aim to which the view is directed in any plan measure or exertion we believe that the Supreme Being 18 20 28 the Supreme Being created intelligent beings benevolence and glorious purpose and if so how glorious and benevolent must be his purpose in the Plan of Redemption so God did not do anything haphazardly everything that he did he did it for our purpose and the prophet of God told us that we are here for a purpose you are here in this congregation this morning for a purpose matter of fact there are other people that wanted to be in this service physically but you are ordained to be here for a purpose so don't just sit in to see what happened no you are here for a purpose this is not about the minister this is not about the sun leader or the musicians you are here for a purpose those who are at home they are listening there is a purpose that you are listening to the message there is a purpose what God call you so that needs to be settled within our heart what's our purpose why did God out of the billions chose us but you see when purpose is not known misuse or abused is inevitable if you have little kids they are Masters to use the wrong thing to do whatever they want to do because for them they don't understand the purpose of things can wash clothes in a toilet because she does not know that's not the purpose for it but you know what's sad many adults do the same thing churches the purpose of church is not to sleep I'm not saying so somebody is sleeping but we do it right because we don't understand what is happening when we are in divine presence when angels in Camp around those who fear Him in the congregation of the Lord what is possible I think recently Texas just went through a nice storm and some people actually lost their life because of the wrong use of barbecue trying to use barbecue to hit their homes barbecue generates heat but it's for the wrong pep you are the pastor for those children the way you conduct yourself is a reflection so we have to be strong strong on our knees strong in caring strong in following the Lord you see when Church forget what church is about memories start church is a hospital for The Sinner is a place where Grace can be ministered it's a place where people can be built up not brought down but purpose is what determine our action it's not our action that determine the the purpose purpose determine the action problem in the Sixth Seal he said look there they crucify him the Bible said that's a fall of the greatest words look there Jerusalem the most holy city in the world they the most holy people in the world crucify the most brutal death in the world him the most important person in the world why because they missed their their purpose while he was there they thought he was just there to give them food and here they are sick though he did all of that but his purpose was different his purpose was John 18 when he stood before pilot to to be a witness of Truth but because they missed the purpose they mistreat him and they crucify him but I'm not talking about two thousand years ago all right that's why the prophet of God will say what will you do with this this Christ not Christ two thousand years ago but this Christ because Christ is the word what are we going to do with the word this morning what are we doing with the word this morning one of the first thing the society has done is to remove the purpose of mankind they diluted it they say we come from animals you see animals they don't have the same problem we do they don't have high blood pressure they don't worry about anything because they still follow nature there is something different about Mankind a mankind because we are created in the image of God for a purpose once we miss the purpose everything else become shambled or political systems they forget the purpose why they are created the government the federal government especially their primary responsibility is to protect the citizens but when the power that is given to them is used now to persecute the same citizens because of their belief because of different things it's because they forget the very purpose they are there for when the church forget the purpose the church is raised up for to be a reflection of Jesus Christ to to bring people out of sin out of bondage then we turn our guns inward we saw that in Saul we don't have time to to read it but in first Samuel chapter 21 Saul was King when God anointed David King over Israel instead of Saul using the Army to protect Israel he start to use the same Army to chase after David if we have the spirit of Saul we can pray for deliverance because the spirit of God in David understood that everything that belongs to God needs to be used to embedded the people of God so David never wasted his time to use his energy against Saul but he knew that the rear enemy that Israel has is the Philistine it's the Malachi and so on the Church of the Living God Christians our energy our everything that we are should be used against sin Hallelujah amen because we know whose program we are part of can miss the Revelation the purpose of the sacrifice the sacrifice was not just something nice for them to do the sacrifice was something it speak about an atonement that God wanted them to know do you understand this atonement But Ken did not have the revelation of that moment so he brought fruit because the purpose of the sacrifice was not known but able cut a revelation he caught a revelation that whenever there is sin there has to be a payment for sin because when his parents sin God himself made a sacrifice right away he provided alarm so the children growing up hearing the stories ever believe it that might because it's just like my kids they will ask me things what happened when you were my age I can't remember some of them did you like this did you like that some of the things they were not even made back then but they don't understand so the children able and Ken were asking their parents how was it like to be in the Garden of Eden to wait in the core of the evening for God himself to descend to come and commune and talk to you how was it like to be in the Holy presence and I can hear Adam telling them oh I cannot describe it just like the prophet said Sublime does not touch it Paul said it has not even entered into the heart of man what God has reserved for them that love him so they tell their children about how the garden was like and we have to tell our children about the hope that lay within us that this life is not everything one of these days if the Lord carries this body will be silent forever but there is something within man as job has said when man dies shall he live again so they talk to their children to heaven or the garden is so beautiful oh you love to be there and they say oh papa how long to be there ever will say how can we go back they say here is the key God has made a promise to us he said I will bring you back again there is a way back to God it's a blood is freaking way so able God that revelation so when God ask him for sacrifice he knew the only way back is Through Blood the blood Enoch knew that there is a way back so he consecrated his life the word of God said he had his this testimony amen what was the testimony of Enoch that he pleased the Lord he placed God in everything that he did not partially not haphazardly he please God I just want to jump to Joseph quickly in Genesis uh 45 verse 7 and God said Joseph replied to his Brethren he said God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your life by great Deliverance we'll cover this later this is what Joseph understood the purpose of God sending him was which is truth but when Paul picked the same account up in Hebrew he moved higher Hebrew 11. by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and give commandment concerning his born he knew that there is a purpose greater than all the achievement that Joseph achieved if one of us were to be a prime minister of the most powerful Nation on Earth by none it's not even like you are saying China today Egypt at that point in time was the most powerful Nation on Earth but air all that achievement was nothing compared to the purpose why he was doing it it's not what he achieved it's the purpose why he achieved what he achieved I'll say time will fail us to go about rehab Gideon Samson I'll just stopped on Samsung very quick Samsung was strong because of the presence of God because God's blessing upon his life made him peculiar and many children of God they are peculiar because of God's blessing upon your life but God's blessing upon your life has a purpose he has a vision why he gave you what he gave you he has a purpose why he gave you the abilities he gave you is to use it for his glory if you're a musician is to use it to bless the people of God there are many people that are gifted they just don't use it for the Lord the prophet of God said every Presley was gifted his gift came from God but he used it wrongly he used it to to promote sin and Samson was gifted but he forgot the purpose of his gift his his mother was given a promise that through Samson there will be a deliverer for Israel it's not for him to have all the women that he can but the gift is for him to use them for the Deliverance of Israel Drive but you see when the purpose is unknown it's not known the gift is abuse Paul was A Gifted Man the apostles Paul Was A Gifted Man but he misused what God can do through him until God got hold of his life so we can see that it is important to know the purpose why we are here in that message the faith of Abraham he said God is like a great contractor I'll just read it what I am made out of petroleum Portage calcium my body was laying on Earth before there was anything at all ever on earth when the Holy Spirit went forth before God to brood up upon the Earth abroad mean a coup like a dog Cooling a hand mother when there was nothing but volcanic eruption when God moved the old star around the Sun making potash calcium he was like a great contract or laying out the lumber to build a house you see a great contractor has something in his mind or her mind that he's trying to achieve before they start building a bridge you see a movement around that area and often you may not even know what what are they doing they are removing dirt they are bringing in dirt they are laying bricks and different things they are laying everything that they need for the mission that they have and the prophet is saying God is like a contractor that before anything was built on Earth he lay your body and my body on Earth back then Hallelujah I can run because a contractor everything he bring on site is meticulously calculated he does not want to have a surplus of sun that will be on the way of gravel or cement or river everything needs to be laid at the proper proportion because of the work that he needs to accomplish therefore there is nothing of waste in the plan of a great contractor so when God bless you on Earth he did not make a mistake we are not an accident of father or mother God in his great for knowledge knew that you'll be here at this time he lay your body that you come into manifestation in Leo this year but you see the break in itself is not a purpose our life by themselves is not just the purpose the break needs to work its way into the master plan and you see a great contractor that's not just a bridge for instance it needs cement you need gravel it needs sand in in it rebirth and different calibers and so on you don't just push all of them together and hope a bridge will come out everything needs to lay in in a certain step the material that is needed and the concentration that is needed for this Foundation is different for the finishing when they are doing a bridge work the light cement that would go to the top to make it look pretty if you put it down for your foundation it will not hold so our life I lay in a certain way so that the material needed at a specific time come with the purpose of that time Wesley was not ordained to live in this day and age but you and I are great man of God but this is not their time they were used in a different dispensation for a different purpose so we cannot go and do what Wesley needs to do because we are not built like Wesley we cannot do what Luther has done because we are not built like Luther but here is the thing we can do what we have built to do in this generation the bride is built in this generation not to be Earthbound but you saw into the heaviest praise God you see truly I yes you brothers and sisters you are called into the heaviest they they're anointing for our generation is a flying eagle an eagle does not take pleasure to be on earth Earth is too cumbersome for an ego he comes he eats quickly he doesn't even sit on Earth to eat and you go he quickly come grabs his prey and away he goes why he's a Heavenly bird he's called to sorrow in the heavens but you see if you take an ego and you catch him down long enough he will start to walk right matter of fact you know a modern society in our food chain one of the problem we are eating too many unhealthy food chickens that cannot fly because they are caged in ask yourself are you Cajun do you have a Doctrine or background that is caging you in that you cannot fly into the things of God you cannot accept the word as he come fresh the prophet of God said God is still using his material you raise it up again in the last day God cannot God cannot be defeated his purpose is perfect just as certain as you are born again [Music] amen so we don't have anything to worry about God is moving exactly according to his own plan and purpose but how does God work God purpose he give it to his Prophet that's why Amos 3 7 can say God does not do anything except he revealed to his servant the prophet and you can understand that's why the whole generation we have great we have great buildings in the in the church world great Ministries I think at the latest I was hearing is some of this congregation are like 80 000 people great Manet beautiful the prophet said it's like a hybrid corn is pretty it looks good but there is no life in it and I'm not just talking about them we can have a nice service everything just working right but there is no life in it life is the difference [Music] how do you know there is life in it when it flows according to God's plan God will take his mind and unveil it to the prophet and a prophet who speak it to the generation and it is a responsibility of a pastor to take the same word and break it down to the congregation and the fathers need to take the same word and apply it at home and the mothers need to teach their children how to live that word that's the circle so the question is how how do we know our own purpose how do we know why we are here for you see the way you capture that is to understand what God is doing our purpose is not perfect but he's perfect purpose is perfect so what we need to do is to work our way into the purpose of God we cannot do it on our own it's what he's doing we just need to be surrender to it Joseph did not bring himself to Egypt God allowed Joseph to go to Egypt you can turn to it listen to Ephesians Ephesians chapter 1 and we just read from verse 9. have you been known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so there is one purpose that God has declared that in the dispensation of the fullness of time you gather everything in what in Christ not in a Calgary Living Word Assembly not in any other denomination but in Christ that's the purpose that God has to gather together all things in Christ a Christ is what Christ is the word when you are gathered in the world you have been Gathering and fulfilling the purpose of God but when you move away from the word guess what you are moving away from the very purpose of God you are moving away from what God can do the same age what God wants to bring fullness in the same age Satan is coming to full fruition also is the age of the esses Daniel said Daniel chapter 11 32. and such as such as do weekly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flattery but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploit same age went flattery we gather together people don't know what they are living for they are just living for pleasure they are just living for entertainment but what's their entertainment for what's the purpose behind Bradham said one of the the most deceiving age we are living the seven age is the age that we are living in that people who think they are serving God but they are serving Satan not knowing it because he's using flattery he sits as God in the temple of God and receive worship as God but you see when we don't know what's the purpose of rock and roll Christian rock and roll we can fall for that because they have a purpose they have a purpose their purpose is to entertain your flesh but they will do away with your soul between the two which one is more important maybe we don't entertain you enough at church but we are concerned about your soul because there is something within the heart of human being that is worth more than anything that we have physically the prophet said our soul is worth ten thousand worlds think about it he said man that drink a soup with a spider in it they are going to sue that that restaurant because they just drank something that is going to make their body sick all so bad but we take in all the time Facebook Twitter YouTube all kind of garbage and we just absorb it and we don't wonder what's the purpose of this what's behind us when somebody is telling you gossip ask yourself what's behind this gossip is it going to strengthen you is it going to encourage you with in the in your work with God or it's going to pull you down what's the purpose there is a purpose why he came in Revelation 10 7. but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet there is a purpose when we are why there is a manifestation of the son of man Ministry it's not for entertainment rebuke that generation they just come oh brother who come on on their pulpit and they'll bring somebody and through the word Discerning the thought and their intent brother will say oh you are from here oh you were at a hospital or I can see this happen oh but that says the Lord you are healed oh we like to see that when we are not too tired but he said no that's not a purpose this is the sign of the son of man this is the sign of Luke 17 30. that before the end of the time God has promised that he will return and reveal this the sign of the son of man this is the same sign that God did to Abraham before the change of his body so it's not just the entertainment it's not just what the prophet said or did is why he did it that's why he encouraged us to have spiritual food in due season amen for us you have the result of the end time message you meet the entire condition amen only the end time message will meet that condition so it's good for us to know what God is doing right now or just read one more scripture before I change gear in Matthew 13 37 he answered and said unto them The Good Seed this is the parable of this this uh the width and the tears I know there is the parable of the soul but this one is different the width and the tears I'll just summarize it the Bible said there is a man that one fought to sow and when he saw the seed there came another man behind him dressing black that Soul tears into the same field and after a while both started to spring or to shrunk up and the servant of of the man said unto him will that die we removed the tears he said no leave them alone because there is a time of the Harvest then the disciple came to Jesus Christ and asked him give us or explain to us the parable and he said unto them he that's all the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of of the wicked one the enemy that saw them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world the rivers at the angels as therefore the tales are gathered together to be burned in in the fire social EB at the end of this world the son of Manchester sent forth his angels and they shall guide us out of his kingdom all things that offend them that do iniquity so he has a purpose that he lay out from the beginning until the end so we are now without purpose we are not here just truth in our our Thompson what are we going to do no God has a vision and a purpose of things that he wants to accomplish in this day what we need to do is to find out what does he have to does he want to accomplish and what's our goal in what he wants to accomplish it's not good enough to know that we are at the end of the ages why are we here for brother actually said is like a man hire someone and that man got a little busy if you just go near or go and you put your hand behind your your back and you are just taking it easy he said no that's not the thing to do you need to go to him and say Hey you hire me why did you hire me we are Christian Soldiers we need to know why are we enlist in the army of the Living God what's our position in the Army I'm not talking about rules and titles what is God calling you for amen you see you may be just like that little girl that Israel a Jew girl living in the house with Neymar the prophet was not there to witness to this great man the King was not there but that little girl was there and she realized it is her responsibility to tell her master there is a bomb in Gilead yes we know that in Samaria you cannot heal leper but when you go to Israel there is a prophet and the god of that Prophet can heal this disease how many of you can tell your neighbors I know a God that delivers I know a God that healeth amen nobody else can do that but this little girl she [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] car to witness even when the king heard about it as a Samaria sent forth to the king of Israel and say hey here is my Captain may you make him hold the king rented his his dress and said this king is seeking an occasion against me and sometimes that's what happened a brother a sister says something we misunderstand them and we started to make all kind of conclusions it's because of the and no the king said oh I just heard that there is a God in your land that can heal the King was not aware of it so Elijah needed to go and say there is a God in Israel I just want to turn to the life of Jesus Christ because he's the perfect example that is left us how did he knew his purpose if we follow him we know our purpose also Jesus himself he said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me and brother went on to say that's our purpose in life is to lift lift up before a dying generation of people you see many people got it we have a dying generation we have a generation that is perverted that that has lost their ways but we have a responsibility to lift up Christ before them to live a life of Christ before them that Jesus Christ is still the son of God the savior of the world I'm so happy to know that I live where there is people who believe that along with the thousands that have accepted him as their savior in John 5 19. then answer Jesus and said unto them very verily I said unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he said the father do for what things so ever he do it this also the son do likewise so Christ is telling us the way he lives such a successful life is that his purpose is tied to God's purpose whatever God wants to do Christ is the venue through which he did it and Christ knew that he has no agenda of his own he just surrender who he is to God so that what God wants to do Christ did it what God wants to do in this generation the bride is called to do it that's why the prophet can say she has the mind of God and we can go through many the Apostle Paul Live the same way in Galatians 2 20 he said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live nor yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen we know that we live in the in that day to whom God May known what is the richest of his glory of the mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory that's where we are Christ in us doing his own things for his own purpose we can turn quickly to John John 18. foreign scripture and Palace therefore said unto him a king and Jesus answered thus said that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause my into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of the truth here at my voice so Christ knew exactly his purpose he knew what God placed him here for and he moved to do that and that only in John chapter 20 he he said then Jesus said unto them again peace be unto you as my father sent me even so send I you so when Christ came to the end I'll just summarize quickly in John chapter 18 Jesus Christ was before Pilate and before all of that they were hitting him they were forcing him to talk and he would not speak a word until Palace say hey they say you are a king I doubt a king and he said you said that right I am a king for this for this cause of to this end came right onto the Earth to Bear witness of Truth and Pilots went on to mock him and say hey if you are a king you should defend yourself and he took a pilot you know my kingdom is not of this world otherwise here is a principle my servant would defend me but his kingdom was about to be born his kingdom was about to be born in the heart of the children of God by the spirit of God meaning that when his kingdom is made flesh his children will be able to defend him his children will be able to stand Toe to Toe with the Enemy to say Christ that you crucify the life that was released is on me right now that's why greater than Solomon is here brother can say oh when Christ took the the Bible and he read it that the spirit of God was upon me and he has anointed me to declare the year of Liberty the same thing is being fulfilled right now because God is anointing his people once again to proclaim the the word of God to a dying generation we are commissioned we are anointed for the purpose of God to carry forward the gospel of God why are we so afraid why are we not stepping into the purpose of God and living it and knowing that nothing nothing there is no power in Hell there is no sin stronger enough to hold a Christian because of what not on our own doing because of what Christ has done because he said I'm dying but I'm dying so that my life will be in the bride my life will be in the church all that God was he brought into Christ or that Christ was he pour into the into the church you see why did God anointed Christ with his Spirit when he came down and said hear ye him that adoption that Christ will do everything that the father will do the adoption is not for just a gift for him to do Miracles no their adoption is that you enforce the same power that the father has through the Sun amen and Christ lived his whole life with awareness that he's here for a purpose are we sleeping through life hoping to make it house tomorrow will be all things no we are here in 2021 for our purpose amen don't ask somebody else your purpose I'll just jump there your purpose is discover when you meet him face to face that's the only way not a possible way your parents cannot give you your purpose of life as much as they love you they challenge you they want to help you they cannot every Son of God must meet him personally because it's in that personal encounter with God that you are commissioned said the people of Israel must listen to Moses why because God was with him it's not maybe so he was not pleading for favor from the people he knew where he stand he knew that he was commissioned to take the people from Egypt to the Canaan land we are commissioned to take this gospel to all the world amen we are commission to leave this work word to a Dying World so as Christ stood knowing what the father wants him to do and surrendering his will to the father's will are we willing to do the same thing in the message expression or expressions only the things that fulfill the purpose of God will come into Resurrection we are not saved for 30 years 20 years 15 years for us to just occupy a few God has a plan and a purpose for us why he saved us there is just like a contractor nothing in that field is is there for just leisure most of the time when you go to a construction site You Don't See flowers they are nice but it does not not at that point in time they don't meet the requirement they will be used later for decoration and opening ceremonies but when they are building and bulldozers are moving things there you don't have flowers there there is no decorative Christian in the army of God we are placed here for a purpose and we must get in line to find out what we need to do and why do I need to encourage you because I need you amen without you fulfilling your portion we are not complete amen as Hebrews 11 chapter came to the end all these Great Men all the heroes of Faith they were not completed without us the body of Christ alive today is not completed if each one does not take its own position so we need each other we need to stand we need to you see one of the key things if you are in a in an army I'll use that example there is something called general order and there is specific order when they go to Iraq they will be under a general order to maintain Security First for the Americans and the the West second for maybe Iraqi officials and it goes in in different steps that's the general order which means they don't need a permission if they see something that is going to hurt that general order they can open fire they can do whatever based on the general order anything that conflicts with what they are there for you just bear with me Christians we have a general order not to negotiate with the Enemy we have a general order to say our children will not be subservient to the society that we live in we have a general order that said that says the Lord whatsoever you said amen that we are not going to burden to anything or sickness it's a general order you do not need a permission to carry it out amen you have a general order to Proclaim what is truth amen and there are specific orders a specific order is when they they uh I think president Trump ordered the killing of the general suleimani something like that that was a specific order amen but here is the key if you cannot carry out a general order they will not give you a specific order everybody wants a special assignment but you need to be faithful in the general order before you can receive a specific order so Christ show us an example and he lived Faithfully to what he was caught to do the prophet of the age heals the same way delay a foundation for us that we can follow that's why he can say now for a moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or to join my church or to start some fellowship organ and organization I have never done done that I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual Fellowship between God and man what in man become New Creation in Christ filled with the Holy Spirit and live according to his word that was his Commission you see when you have a revelation when you have your commission when you go to Iraq whatever your commission is you need to fit into the general and any specific order before amen if you go to Iraq to fight for the government the gov we don't halfway just switch and start supporting um the caliphate amen so the church is order through Christ to be a witness of Truth everybody else that come after that needs to follow the same so Paul can say I lay a foundation look therefore how you build on it so the prophet also came built on top of that in an alignment with what Christ did and all the prophets all the apostles until now so when we find our purpose how do we know it is according to the word when it fits in line with what they've done before that here we have our commission to serve the body of Christ we look at how the prophets serve the body of Christ he serve it by establishing a relationship between man and God the time is almost gone amen you see man is God's agent God cannot do anything except he does it through men matter of fact the word tell us that the field is plenteous but the workers are few which means we need to just Avail ourselves to the master Reaper so he can put us in line with what he's doing and his purpose of accomplishing it he gave to each one according to the measure of faith that we have because of that we don't need anybody as position we don't need anybody else at work we need to do what God has called us to do and God has something for each one of us I'll finish with this bear with me for a few few more minutes let's take for instance Abraham I'm reading this from uh paragraph 57 from that time 62. from that time it's a message that Brad Brahman preached I think eight several times trying to get something to the church matter of fact that message was born out of an unexperienced that rabbana had when he went to uh what what we call an insane institution there was a lady that was pretty and so on hey what are the patients and she said how about you start with me and Bradham said you she say yes they say I I I'm losing it and so on and through that the message through that problem ask her what are you living for oh she said nothing she's good for almost nothing and said have you ever thought that you can be married have children and she said oh who marry me but a prophet did not stop there because she did not know her purpose but she's about to know her purpose how when she will meet him the Creator so the prophet knew he didn't need to argue about how to get there until he get her to Christ because Christ will give her her purpose I just come back from Air to Abraham the prophet say Abraham he was an ordinary man he came down from Babylon with his father and he lived and dwell in that land of the champions in the city of Earth probably a farmer an ordinary man he was no special person or a man he was just a man he found Grace in the sight of God and he was 75 I Abraham was no special man according to the prophet but let me ask you this question is Abraham a special man is the father of Faith a special man what make him special is because he come his world come colliding with God and God gave him a purpose what will make a difference in your life I I I can see the time is running and uh we need to go but let me just make this one make Abraham special is because he come in contact with God da alone made him special in his generation there were thousands of men maybe in Earth at that time but we know only about one man Abraham why he came in contact with God God gave him a purpose but here is the key he accepted it so I will turn it around will you accept the purpose of God concerning your life it made a difference in Abraham's life everybody wants to know the end from the beginning but not that's not the way God works the way to know the purpose of God concerning your life is to walk by faith ask God unfold things in front of you you see God came to Abraham and called Abraham and he gave him just one commission get out no explanation get out of the land of your fathers and he obeyed obedience will give you the key to your purpose same thing applied to children go do this why do they have to do it but see obedience if you follow that there will be a nesting to unfold what's the purpose for the bride the bride needs to walk in the things that God has already given her as we walk in the light he will make way where there seem to be no way Abraham just walk with God and Obey what God told him to do and from that that obedience God opened a little more and say the land actually is going to be Canon before he did not know the land but God now gave him a location of the land is going to be Canon now he can move into that land by obeying the world there were many people that followed Abraham but only Abraham knew the purpose why he was walking and God later told him you know the purpose is not even the land the purpose is that in this land of Canaan there will be a city a city that is made by God himself what he only knew about cities that are made by man but for the first time God is unveiling in front of him something greater and say walk in the land and within that land there will be a city that is made by the hand of God talking about actually a city that the Seed of Abraham is going to be ahead of so Abraham walk in the length and the breath of the city of the land looking for this city though the city the actual series for you and I but he walk in obedience and because of that he is called the father of Faith amen when God called him and say sacrifice Isaac he did not tell him oh how all of that is going to unfold but through the natural inheritance that God has given Abraham God is going to elevate his inheritance to even a greater level because through the art of faith God said now I know you love me in blessing I will bless you and I feel shall possess the Gate of his enemies obedience gave him key to the purpose that was greater than what he can see the purpose was greater than what Joseph can see because the purpose was Resurrection the purpose of the trouble of a job was greater than everything that job was seeing because he was speaking about the resurrection we have a purpose for us to unfold for God to unveil that to us we need to walk by faith we need to take a step as he unfold the world we walk in it as we walk in truth he unveiled more truth and he unveiled my truth we don't need to know the end from the beginning we just need to have the god of the end from the beginning God richly bless you for the sake of time I'll just stop here musicians you can come go God has a desire to accomplish in this day his will and purpose through a bride [Music] you see when something gave his all he can stand to the Lord he can accomplish now why he couldn't before he surrendered his heart to Delilah and he used his strength he can carry the gates they can burn their fields but when he surrendered his heart and all that he is to God he destroyed all the Philistines what we need is a surrender heart complete yelling to him and he worked out all purpose all things work together for his own purpose foreign [Music] did problem did not know his commission when he was first called he did not know about the first pool the second pool the third pool but he was obedient to what God unfold before him and God led him from one purpose to the other to the other until the opening of the word what we need sense of God let's stop looking aside let's stop trying to understand everything let's know him to know
