Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light let's turn over to Saint John chapter one foreign chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in a dark in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not let's just bow in prayer gracious Lord Jesus we're just so thankful that you gave us your word we're so thankful that you gave us your light we're so thankful that you gave us your life Lord that's the reason that every one of us stands here today that's the reason everyone is tuned in today because of that life because of that light that desire that you placed in US father that illustration that your Prophet Drew showing the last age with just a little teeny sliver of light father we recognize that light we comprehend it today father we pray that you would just turn back the pages of this word to us Lord that you would just break the bread of life to us fresh once again just like Melchizedek did for Abraham we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this morning you may be seated yeah just want to do a couple of comments about the communion service it's kind of weird I know I apologize um firstly welcome to everyone that's here so nice to see some Fresh Faces so many people I haven't seen for so long God bless you and God bless everyone else who is with us virtually I trust the Lord blesses our service today we were going to have a communion service tonight the Brethren that we're in Lethbridge last weekend came in relative contact to a brother who tested positive for covid so I made the decision to cancel the communion and to basically suggest that everybody that was there get tested just to make sure that we're doing everything that we can to not just be careless I personally want to ensure that we are diligent how we conduct ourselves as an assembly and I really want to encourage how we conduct ourselves individually I know that some of us want to cut corners and I know that some of us have and we need to make sure that we are showing the right example to the world around us that we believe and how do we do that not not just by dressing or talking it's by our actions Our Lives speak volumes we preach a sermon every day of our life when we get around people and you know that much more when we've already testified to people that we believe the word those people examine us closely we need to make sure we're sending a congruent message with what the word says I'm not here to preach on that today I think everybody has a conscience and we know what the word says if there's a law in the land we have to obey it that's that's the word we could certainly have a discussion about it but all I can say is that I know one day I will have to give an account for my actions here in the office that I hold but what's more and I don't mean it to derate the office but what's more is the here and now I have to give an account to my children because I'm a father and my children need to see a congruent message with what I say and not just with what I say but what I do and brothers and sisters if you have children people around you that you love you need to send the same message it can't be we're good Christian people we believe the message of the hour but it's okay to just break the law it's not okay just to break the law we have to speak truth in love brother Peter sent a text to say that one thing he forgot to mention is that he tested negative but not just he but his entire family tested negative they were in direct contact with the Brethren Lethbridge and uh you know it's not about a brother it's a demon it's a demon spirit and and we all come in contact with demon Spirits the Demonic forces are great in this world and we brothers and sisters are that little tiny sliver of light that brother Branham drew that we talked about in the prayer we are that light to this Dying World to this Dark Age it's up to us to make sure that we shine properly so brother Peter wanted to make it known that he was uh he was okay so some of the other brothers they're uh quarantining just being careful to make sure that we're crossing the t's and dotting the eyes it's not an impo imposition I haven't insisted that anybody behaves that way I have simply recommended I've suggested that we just try and be as careful as possible you know what everyone isn't at the same level of faith we might have a great warrior of faith that could go and stand in in in in in extreme radiation and and and not be afraid because of the level of Faith they have and there could be other people they just don't have that level of faith and we if we bring something bad around people who don't have the same level of faith we could potentially put them in Peril and we don't want to do that we want to make sure that we're applying Our Lives to the best of our ability at least that's what I would encourage we all will give an account one day for the standards that we live in our lives you know in James chapter 5 it says just part of the verse but let your yea be ye and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation if you say something today and do something different tomorrow then you're sending a mixed message which creates condemnation which creates iniquity and we don't want to see that in anyone's life but I think brother Steve prayed it well that everything that happens is ordained of the Lord and we can simply ask him to open the doors we can ask him to open up to take these restrictions away from us so we can get together and fellowship the way that we we're used to the way that we want to see how much sweeter will it be after all of this nonsense to fellowship with the Believers to get together and have a church full of people singing the same songs you know that song I'll get carried away when I get carried away you know we we we we're looking about getting excited once we're getting carried away but you know maybe we could look at it the other way that maybe we'll get carried away because we just get too carried away here on this side we just can't contain that excitement we know that Rapture is imminent let's just pray the Lord will open up the door so we can at least just worship together I just hope you can bear with me I I know I've bounced around a lot um I've really been inspired recently by the invisible Union of the bride and I'm just gonna talk a little bit about this one and I know brother Branham takes his text from there but just to set a little bit of a background for where I felt led to go today you know in that message brother Bradham he uh he gets asked you know if you could have any age that you would want to come back to the world and preach in what what age would it be and and it's just amazing because this is what he said in this message the Golden Age brothers and sisters to think that we have the ability to be that light to the darkness in this world and and that Darkness just doesn't comprehend the light you can tell people that God sent a prophet and they'll look at you like you're crazy like you have two heads but this is the Golden Age brothers and sisters the more I I contemplate this the more I think about it I trust it's the same for you the more real it becomes that when we get over to the other side we're going to say how did you make it Noah how did you make it David how did you make it Jeremiah how did you make it Isaiah how did you go through all these different things and they're going to say you know we did by the grace of God but what about you when there was no Grace on Earth just a little tiny sliver of Grace and God lived out through you you know we're going to step into a new day any day now we're about to step into a new day brother Branham said and we're going into a millennial reign in this message marriage and divorce Paul Illustrated it like it was not marriage and divorce sorry an invisible Union of the Bride Paul Illustrated it like marriage and divorce and it pertains to a greater portion and and what that portion is is that we can't be married to the world and to Christ at the same time we can't have a speck of the old ideas the speck of the old tradition we can't have anything of the old and and and and get into the new and and see Christ come into our lives if we do that then he will call us an adulteress and he won't have an adulteress for a wife this message unfolds a great mystery of the prophecy and you know really what I like the little story he talks about in this message he talks about Moody Dwight Moody after reading Romans chapter 7 he runs into the street and the first person he sees he says do you know Grace and they say grace who and he tells them the grace of God do you know the grace of God this is the grace that he's talking about he goes on to say that this grace is the elect lady that's what he's talking about and you know we talked about Mary uh quite a bit recently and we probably will continue to and and Mary was the elected of God she was this Lady of Grace and God also chose an elected lady for his bride and we all understand that and and I know maybe some of this sounds Elementary and I I pray that it just won't be that we'll see it all sort of come together here somewhere along the way but we know that the woman is always a type of the church and brother Branham in this message he says watch the conditions and the conduct of women and you will see where the church is the conduct of women in the world and the conduct of women in the church now just like brother Bradham says in this message I'm not speaking to the people here I'm speaking although I am speaking to the people here I'm not speaking about the people here that's what I mean to say I'm speaking about the church in general the the denominational world that's out there the woman the spiritual bride or what brother Bradham says the so-called claim to be bride and he talks about this woman going on a rampage and and really we look at people who will live a life of divorce and while their living husband is still alive they'll get remarried again and and it's completely contrary to the word and that's what brother Bradham is talking about but but furthermore women will actually go contrary to the word and wear garments that pertain to a man even though the same word Abomination is the exact same definition as homosexuality in the Bible but they just brush right over that and say it's just a cultural thing it's just okay it's kind of a weird thing that people would say that that that verse has any any weight today but where do you stop if you start to filter the word and and take scriptures out and put scriptures in we know in Revelations it says whoever adds or takes away from this scripture the plagues described in this book will be added to them maybe some of these people should go and read the book of Revelation and and see what's coming upon this world but brother Branham says that the spiritual bride that when the spiritual bride there will be a message in the spiritual bride that will sweep out through the land and and we have the opportunity brothers and sisters to be that spiritual bride but I just felt like you know we should just go back to the very beginning and take a look at what God's version of the Bride is and and just see because if if she takes anything if if a woman takes anything from the past and tries to bring it into her marriage the word says that she will be called an adulteress if we try and do that spiritually the word says that we'll be called an adulteress we don't want to do that we don't want to have a living husband and try and get married again we need to make sure that that old person dies and that's what brother Brown was talking about in The Invisible Union of the Bride the old man the old person we have to die out completely unto ourselves to allow Christ to live in our lives and it's exactly with what Paul said I Die daily we have got to be doing that ourselves if not then we could be marked in adultereness and brother Branham he goes on to say it's not so much about about the the natural type he's not throwing off on women specifically saying that women are terrible and and so on and so forth he says so when the church when she tries to mix Creed or denomination that is adultery it's spiritual adultery we cannot try and mix our old ideas maybe a new idea anything that's not contrary to the message of the hour or the word we can't mix it with the Bible if we try and take a a a a a psychological perspective and say you know what I understand this and I can take it and find a way to mix it with the word and mix it with the message and blend it all in and and and present it it will be good it won't be good we only want the message of the hour which is the word of God it's a bit like I use this analogy a little while ago it's a bit like like salad dressing you can make a really nice vinaigrette salad dressing by taking oil and vinegar and mixing them together and and you can stir it really good and and it will be what's called emulsified and it will it'll be little particles all mixed in and it will stay that way for a little while and it will taste really good but just leave it sit there eventually it will Express what's in it and it will separate because it cannot stay together and that's what will happen with the word and people that don't actually get taught the word properly they have that situation happen in their life they can't help it because it separates you can't mix oil and water you can't mix oil and vinegar and keep it together it'll only stay for a little while so the church if it tries to mix a Creed or a denomination one is completely contrary to the other it's pretty uh it's pretty amazing I think myself just to go back and take a look at at Eden and and and to really just examine it and that's what I've been doing so bear with me if we could just turn back to the Book of Genesis in the beginning you know verses one to five God takes the time to express in the word here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth it was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light and that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and we look at that light I have always looked at this and thought you know God turned on the lights he actually created a light that we could see the universe lit up at that point but you know if we go a little further I believe it was let me see here this light that we're talking about I'll just say this it's not it's not a natural light that we perceive when we see the sunrise when we turn on a light switch if we turn over to the Book of John again we can talk about the light I believe that God was referring to John chapter one we'll probably bounce back and forth if you have a marker it might be easier for you John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the same Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the Darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so what we're talking about here isn't necessarily the light that we can perceive with our eyes we're talking about life God spoke and it happened God created life and it happened and I heard somebody say this recently and I I would just like to throw the question out there has anybody else heard this that uh the world was perhaps in a state of a fallen condition after a prior civilization your brother Branham say that somewhere I couldn't find it I heard it and I thought that sounds really intriguing but I just couldn't find it anywhere if anybody knows it I would appreciate it we could we could talk about it but you know in verse 5 day one he called the light day and The Dark Knight and the evening and morning were the first day and uh Saint John verse 1 to 9. we read and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth it not verse 6 there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all man through him might believe I love how he explains this here he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not I'm getting ahead of myself that was the True Light he says which lighteth every man that cometh into the world so he's not speaking of a light like a flashlight a light like the sunshine a light like a torch like they might have had back in John's day he's speaking directly about a life he's speaking about the witness of the Lord Jesus Christ which is I believe what we're talking about over here in the Book of Genesis it's kind of going back and forth but to think the man was sent from God to Bear witness of the light so where are we going with this we know that Isaiah 40 the voice of him that Christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God we know that John the Baptist was the third Elijah anointing in the Bible John the Baptist we know is not Saint John the Revelator the one who rested on Jesus bosom who Jesus loved John the Baptist was the one Prophet that was crying out shining the supernatural light for that day and we know that we've had the fourth Elijah anointing in our day doing the very same thing crying out the very same word crying out shining forth the very same light the same thing we've experienced in our day and you know many people will just dismiss brother Branham and say he's just a wild man he's off on his Doctrine he was really good when he was into the healing campaigns and the signs and wonders were great he was a mighty man of God but boy when he sat down one day and said I am my father are one we have to do away with him as our brother said earlier today I think it was brother Steve praying you know unless you eat eat my body and drink my blood you have no part in me you're a vampire these people are crazy brother Branham was preaching the very same gospel he wasn't preaching anything different but as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ we know brother bradham's commission and that was before on the second coming of Christ and and were so many years down the road now brothers and sisters here we are believing this message it takes Revelation for us to actually understand what we're talking about today this light and and this life and and we're going to go further I just wanted to dwell on this a little bit that what we're talking about it's not necessarily a light like we would perceive with our natural senses it's it's not that um it's verse 15 in Genesis chapter one no verse 14. after the third day Genesis chapter 14. and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years and let them be for lights in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so verse 16 and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good in the evening and the morning were the fourth day so here we see just a little bit further down in scripture after he created all the land and after he created the waters divided the waters with the land created the firmament of the heavens created the firmament of the land he created all the fish in the sea he did all of that actually maybe he didn't create the fish of the sea I apologize but he created the land the Earth the air and then he actually created the light to shine on it but at the beginning here he said that he created the light so I just wanted to clarify that we're talking about a very specific thing and it's a life it's not just a light like we would perceive it it's actually a life but as we go we know that it takes Revelation and we can't just read the Bible and expect to understand it if we just read it comparing chapter and verse brother Branham says the only way that we'll be able to understand the church age book the only way we'll be able to understand the Bible is to read it with spiritual Revelation it takes a revelation we know that when Jesus was here he was with his disciples and he taught them and he said to them you know who are people saying that I am and some said Elias and some said one of the prophets and he said that's nice but who do you say that I am and really it comes down to that brothers and sisters in order for us to understand the word for our day we have got to have that spiritual Revelation in our lives it has to be who do you say that he is today not back there with the disciples we can look back and say that he was Christ the son of the Living God just like Peter said and and say that you know Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it we have Revelation because we saw what Peter said and sure we do we understand that by the grace of God but what is it now to you what does that mean to us today it has to be the Lord Jesus Christ alive in us today that spiritual Revelation it has to be his life that light that we were reading about earlier it has to be him alive in us today it takes spiritual revelation that personal relationship is what we're getting to has to be revealed personally you know in uh in Genesis Genesis 1 verse 6 to 8. he he goes goes on and and I just got way ahead of myself and he creates the firmament and and the land and the Heaven and the atmosphere and then he goes on to divide the dry land from the sea and then he goes on in in verses 11 to 13 which is day three the grass and the herb yielding seed fruit trees whose seed was in itself after its kind he's just going and and creating and and starting at the very Foundation the bottom and working his way up creating all of the living things on earth and as we go I just want to try and and that's why I felt led to go this way so pardon me if if it is a bit weird and maybe even annoying by by how broken up it might sound I just wanted to try and set the example of this if we could have this thought as we talk about it the absolute purity of this creation that God's created no defilement that creation we will see one day just like job said in my flesh I will see him we will see this creation one day maybe not exactly the Garden of Eden maybe not exactly the way it was created here but we will see the purity of it but no defilement so verses 14 to 19 in in Genesis chapter one every living creature in the waters uh 14 to 19 day four yeah we read that sorry told you I got ahead of myself I was right verse 20 to 25 day five every living creature in the waters and every winged foul verses 24 to 25 day six all the living creatures every creeping thing and every cattle after their own kind and God saw that it was good not the end of it verses 26 to 28 where we really want to get to today verse 26 says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image excuse me of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and and gives man a total dominion over all of the Earth every single aspect of his creation now he's placed into the hands of man in in this absolutely pure environment with no defilement and it was after all this creation sorry it's oh my I just seem to be mixing myself up here verse 7 of uh verse seven of chapter two going forwards and the Lord formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul and this scripture here is where it basically Begins the creation of human beings on Earth it's gone from being the spirit Man created in God's Own image in in chapter one of Genesis to chapter 2 now God forming Man Out of the Dust of the ground and creating breath into his nostrils the Breath of Life and man now becomes a living soul and it was after this that God planted a garden verse 8. in Chapter 2 and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and we could just read that and brush right over it and miss exactly what the message is in that one verse I could never explain this as good as brother Aaron McGeary did one time when he was here but I just thought I would I would stop and and talk about it a little bit in my own way and I trust that it will actually everybody might already know this but in this scripture here God planted a garden every tree Pleasant to the site and good for food there's that semicolon there at the end of the food and then it says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that semicolon is a very significant Mark in the middle of that scripture because it's talking about the same thought but it has a totally different meaning it's not herb herb bearing her herb yielding trees it's not trees that are just trees with their own seeds in them they have fruit they bear fruit and and it's food that we eat it's actually speaking about people it's speaking about God and it's speaking about Satan very specifically that semicolon is Big even though it's just a tiny little Mark on the page the Tree of Life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil very two very distinct uh distinct trees out of Jehovah Jireh part 2 1962 Christ that tree that was in the Garden of Eden there were two trees in the Garden of Eden these two trees were set there for birth purpose and when Eve she was the tree of death if she was touched and Christ was the Tree of Life now by the woman comes death by the man come life out of the Ephesian Church age brother Branham says it's about the true trees some have an idea that the two trees in the garden were just two two more trees like unto the rest of those that God had placed there but careful students know that this is not so when John the Baptist cried that the ax is laid was laid to the root of all trees he was not talking of Simply natural trees but of spiritual principles what what we're talking about today is is a restoration Back to Eden and if I had to title it I think that's what I would title it a restoration Back to Eden what we want to do is talk about the creation of man and woman and how God created it and expected it to go and knew that it would actually turn into the fall but he created it with a very specific purpose and I believe I'm sure we all do as well if we stand back and look at it that purpose that God had that heart purpose in the very beginning in Genesis was to set the example for the bride in the very last age this is exactly what we should be looking for now we're going to dig into this a little further I I trust it's not been so broke up that uh we're not together I hope we are what we want to talk about is the voice of God and how that voice of God is is really what we want to get to because the voice of God in the garden was the creative powers that God put inside Adam when he created man and woman and formed them in his own image he created them to have a spoken word birth it was supposed to be a spoken word creation and that's exactly what God set forth in the garden fully knowing though that they would fall and when they did something happened something significant happened and we'll just go over it slowly and and trust that maybe we're setting a foundation for something that the Lord wants us to get into here but it's the voice of God in Genesis 2 the voice of God wasn't just the voice of God speaking it was the voice of God inside Adam when Adam spoke it wasn't Adam speaking his thoughts it was Adam the Son of God speaking God's thoughts he had the mind of Christ and and I just I got so inspired when I saw this could we say that the word was in The Bride right there the spoken word is the Original Seed the word was in the bride and and the bride had the mind of Christ to know what to do with that word but it's interesting because we know that God spoke in the very beginning God spoke God said let there be light and there was light and and and we see it go go through Genesis chapter one and God spoke God said and finally said let us make man in our own image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish in the sea let them have our likeness let them have our spirit let them have our life let them have our light let them have our mind let them have our likeness our character our our our creative ability and he told them replenish the Earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth he told them to go forth and multiply and and replenish the Earth just subdue it be fruitful many times people will look at this and say well yeah that was exactly the way God intended for it to be that it was It was supposed to be according to the uh the relation between a man and a woman but here when this scripture was written they were not separate they were one he hadn't even formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth yet in in Genesis chapter 1. we're talking about the voice of God in the garden and up until well Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 2 it was it was the Lord God and Adam speaking and and when Adam spoke we know that God spoke and in verse 18 the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone I'll make and help meet for him and a couple verses over and he said in verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord had taken from man he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and we know verse 25 says then they were both naked the man and his wife and they weren't ashamed and the reason they weren't ashamed is because they had a holy Veil brother Branham says it very clearly they had the mind of Christ they were not defiled they were still in that absolute perfect environment that one that we long for that one that we we groan to see all creation groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God but they were there and and they just didn't understand the way things were but in in in chapter three there's a major change that happens in the garden it goes from being the voice of God the voice of God in his son which is basically the voice of God to being another voice in the garden that other voice is now one of the beasts of the field has taken on a voice Genesis chapter 3 has two more voices introduced actually because in Genesis chapter 2 it was only God and his son Adam but in Genesis chapter 3 now it's the serpent and the woman now both of those have a voice in the garden how did that happen we know how it happened it was God's plan but we can just go on and read a little bit in in Genesis chapter 3 just to sort of explain this in in Genesis chapter 3 verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of the every tree of the garden we can just pause there and talk about this verse for a little bit the serpent in the garden I'm just probably going to say it bluntly and plainly for everyone because we all know it the serpent in the garden wasn't a snake there was curses handed out and that was the curse for the serpent but how could the snake be cursed to be a snake to remain itself we know that brother Branham taught very clearly that the serpent was an upright being that it had all the attributes of of the human except for a soul and it was a servant it was a help for the man but now Satan who is actually introduced in the garden goes and speaks to the woman through the serpent now Satan has a voice in the garden in this pure State as soon as the serpent spoke that state was defiled but it didn't have to be but it was why because Eve actually listened to that word she listened to that voice instead of listening to the voice that gave her Redemption which was her husband's voice she listened to the serpent she actually gave ear to it and reasoned with it so the serpent he speaks to Eve and says yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden how did this beast of the field know this how did he even understand any of this verse 2 and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said You shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye shall die we know that it was God speaking right up until this time and now the voice has changed now there's that that moment in time that we all contend with Satan hasn't changed his tactics brothers and sisters it's exactly the same way he'll come around and he'll try and reason with us about anything in our lives that's going to be anything to do with the word anything just to get us tripped up it doesn't matter what it is he'll come around and he'll try and reason with us and if we just take one second and reason with him and allow his thought to actually take a hold so that we'll have a mental conversation with him we begin that reasoning technique and he has potential now to have a conversation with us who wants to have a conversation with Satan I certainly don't but he hasn't changed his tactic not one bit he'll come around and he'll say yay sure as the message really said that did the prophet really mean it that way does the word really mean it that way is it you know there's got to be another way that we can do things and and and whatever some sort of reasoning something different something contrary to the word but we know we read it earlier brother Bradham says in the invisible Union of the Bride if we mix anything anything do with the word anything with the message of the hour it's it's adultery it's going to cause death it's not going to cause the right thing and we know where we're going with this discussion right now this story because she gives in because she reasons she's deceived Eve is deceived and so she goes and partakes now of of of this situation with the serpent and and I'm not going to get into it too much but I'm just going to say this she has a relation with with the serpent and it causes a terrible situation and the only Escape she has for it is to run to her husband and get Redemption that's the only Escape she has for this moment in her life and she realizes it and we know that that's the only act that's named in the Bible and there's two kids that come from it and there's actually a word I looked it up brother Mervin actually said it I think in Lethbridge it's it's super fukun dation I think I probably worded it wrong but there's actually a term for it where there can be two separate fathers and two separate children with the same woman it's actually a scientific term and it's real but that's what happened here in the garden the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said he shall not eat it neither shall ye touch it lest ye shall die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil so here the serpent tells her that you will be exactly what you are she is a God right now but because she reasoned with him she was deceived into thinking that she would be something different and so in that moment when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired one to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and we just mentioned how it all sort of happened in in a less descriptive way but really what I want to talk about is not so much the ACT other than the actual taking of those words and taking those words into her innermost being it was the word that she took in and when she took in that word she consumed that word and the Bible isn't Wrong by saying that it was a fruit it was a fruit of Destruction that she took in and ate but it's got the entire world tripped up according to God's plan to say that it's fruit so people will say that it's any kind of fruit except for what it really was but it's it's that word that she took into her life that word that she accepted that word that deceived her that word that that that entered in and caused the fall of mankind it was that word from this new voice in the garden and brothers and sisters Satan wants us to not see when that word comes around into our Gardens we know that we're supposed to create a holy atmosphere in our lives that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and and and we have the opportunity to create create we are creators in our own selves if we have the Holy Ghost in our lives we have the creative ability to set the atmosphere to not be deceived but you know Eve she reasoned and and she let that voice come into her heart Paul has said it very clearly that we need to take every thought into captivity where do thoughts come from from voices people will say you're crazy if you hear voices every one of us hear voices and we hear the voice of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because of the fall and we hear the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives and every single human being I believe has the opportunity to listen to it everyone gets the opportunity to even Cain who was of his father the devil had the opportunity to hear the voice of God but he wouldn't hear it he couldn't hear it even though he heard it with his ears he would not hear it with his heart and and we know that whole story but whose voice do we listen to that makes the difference in our lives and that's really what I wanted to get to and and so we go on in verse 7 of chapter three and the eyes of them both were opened now that veil was lifted that Holy veil was gone and something really significant happened here that veil was lifted but also the creative voice in The Son of God in Adam was now gone he forfeited his right to that voice that creative power of God in his life and that voice left Adam and now went right back to God again his creative ability his godship was now gone and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day how do you hear a voice walking maybe the Lord was singing but we know that he was crying he wasn't crying he was just calling out as a figurative word crying he was calling out Adam what are you doing where are you where are you at Adam because he knew full well where Adam was he wasn't asking are you behind a tree are you behind a rock are you in a cave are you are you on the other side of the garden he wasn't asking any of that he was saying where'd you go Adam you fell from Grace you actually forfeited that creative power that sonship that adoption that you had that I gave you from the beginning you forfeited it back to me you gave it back why did you do that and so he comes and has a conversation with them and what happens immediately it's a finger-pointing contest oh the woman that you gave me she's the one that did it and and she says oh you know the serpent that one who was in the garden that you put there and if try and put it back on God could you imagine we talked about that a while ago trying to put it back on God and say it's your fault you did this brother Bradham says it somewhere that outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we are brute beasts just like the beasts of the field just like the serpent he might not say it that way but just like these animals we we are without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters we don't have any hope we have that hybrid condition going on in our lives that's why the world hungers and thirsts so much after unrighteousness that's why it's such a dark place because that voice of Satan is so prominent in the world so many people speak the voice of Satan it just becomes one voice it becomes this this great mass of darkness and and here we are speaking the voice of God but you know as that voice grows stronger of Satan so does a voice in The Bride so does that voice in The Bride of Jesus Christ and where we're coming to the punch line that we always do before it's time is you know what the word is in the bride she has the mind of Christ and she knows what to do with it because that's what the prophet was sent to tell her it's not just brother branham's opinion saying that it's not just his opinion saying pick up your pen and write it's not just his opinion saying that she has the mind of Christ and knows what to do with the word she has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still and you know what there's people that want to keep still sadly but there's other people that say I've got the voice of God and the mind of Christ in my heart I know that I have thus saith the Lord I believe the word I've met the requirements of the of the word for our day I believe everything that the prophet said about me and the word so what do I have to fear speak the word God doesn't want us to come to him crying Lord please Lord Give Me Lord I need he wants us to speak the word why cry speak and walk forward and watch him bless your path but if we have anything that we're dragging behind us in terms of a a a a an old tradition or an old denominational thing in our lives we're trying to mix it with the word for our day brother Branham said it's it's adultery spiritual adultery and God won't know us we don't want to do that we want to make sure that we have it all right all clean clean slate go right back to Eden Brothers and Sisters right back to the very beginning and you know we we sometimes have things in our lives where we step over Flags we do and we know we do sometimes we'll just say oh it's just a funny feeling brother Branham says it in that message God will not call a man to judgment without first warning him he says that God deals with every single man before he dies and and men will say you know that that was just a funny feeling God speaks to us we need to make sure that we're listening to the right voice that's that's probably the the main point for today whose voice are we listening to in the garden it was either God or Adam speaking then it became the serpent and Eve speaking and you know Adam he had all the creativity creative ability of God he was an amateur God and that's what the prophet said we are it's pretty tough to visualize that in our own flesh to say that we are but it really comes down to whose voice are we listening to and whose voice are we being whose voice are we allowing to speak from our lips through our our lungs through our voice box what is it that we're actually putting out there because if we are amateur Gods we are creating every time we speak the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou verse 9 verse 10 and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked cast out Eden of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman who thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go in dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and if this wasn't exactly what we know to be the truth why would this verse be there and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise thy heel unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and that scripture right there is a real contentious one today boy oh boy just a back part of it the the end of it that the husband shall rule over thee even even now with the word of our day there's still such a strong spirit for the woman to be strong and the woman to have a voice and the woman to be able to use serp Authority in this world and you know it's it's a strong strong spirit and and we cannot really Escape it even with people that we deal with because it's there people hate that scripture right there not just dislike it but hate it because it it it it says that man shall rule over the woman and at now to Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and not me because you gave in to that voice and asked each and of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shout out eat of it all the days of thy life to think about it though the serpent was cursed the woman was cursed but Adam was not cursed the ground was cursed for his sake for years I thought that I was cursed but I'm not I'm not cursed I'm blessed the ground is cursed for my sake I don't have to walk around dragging a ball and chain every time something bad happens to me thinking that God cursed me he didn't curse me he released me from the curse he released me from the bondage of sin and the same thing for every one of us we don't have to worry that we're cursed we're not cursed the woman or the man we do bear the fruit of the Fall we have to go to work and and by the sweat on our face we will actually bring home a living as men and in sorrow and in conception will woman bring forth children there's no way around it it's the scripture but for me this this whole study just really brought this to light and and I'll say it I'll be the first to say it initially when I was coming into the you know we're we're gonna try and figure out how it is to run the church thing I had said that we could have the women speak in church and that was wrong it was wrong but by seeing it this way it actually spells it out so clearly and I'm so thankful that the Lord will actually reveal things to us if we ask him I need a scriptural solution can you show me in your word how this this really works and you know the voice of Eve wasn't supposed to be the way it was she was supposed to submit to her husband the husband was the one who was in control there in the garden husband was the one with the voice not that they didn't communicate and that he didn't love her Adam didn't make her adore Matt at the edge of the garden so he could wipe his feet on her she wasn't his slave she she wasn't there to do every single thing that he wanted to have done although because of the love that he displayed to her I bet you it caused something in her for her realization that she came out of him that she was a part of him she just couldn't get enough goodness to her husband she just wanted to help him to serve him with all of her heart because of the way he loved her which is exactly according to the word she had such a reverence for him because of his undefiled pure love for her and that's exactly what what the word lays out for husbands and wives but you know it's a very difficult thing because many times we can get things out of order in our lives we can get things sort of out of kilter and we can have husbands and wives be at odds and we can have the wife say I I don't have to respect that I don't have to do that because he he hasn't given me anything to respect and I'm so thankful for a pastor that taught it you know what that's not what the word says the word doesn't say that's conditional she has got to respect reverence her husband but husbands have got to love their wives if they don't love their wives if they're not willing to be the one just like Adam to redeem his wife when she needs it how is she going to reverence him we have to be husbands in our home I believe the Lord is really opening this up to me and I'm so thankful it speaks of headship speaks of understanding the order of things that God is in control Christ the head of the church the head of the husband the husband the head of the home the wife the head of the children not the other way around the children are not the head of the home no it can easily get spun that way that's the way the world is the voice of Eve was not really the way it was supposed to be in the garden and in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 it says let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to your serp authority over the man but to be in silence and I just love how he goes right back to the beginning right back to the exactly where we're reading from he says in verse 13 of SEC of First Timothy yeah first Timothy chapter 2 verse 13 for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression but Adam chose to actually redeem her Adam chose willingly to go after his bride and we know that that's been said so many times that it's exactly the same thing for Christ to travel through the ages and come for his bride and every time we hear the word preach it doesn't matter who preaches it if they're preaching the word in truth it's Christ coming for his bride that word that life that light that we talked about that we can't see that light that happened before the actual moon and the sun happened that Supernatural light that's off the spectrum that we could visualize with our senses that light that life is speaking out that's Christ coming through the ages for his bride verse 15 says notwithstanding she shall be saved speaking about the woman now the one who is in the transgression she shall be saved in childbearing by bearing children that shall save her if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety but wasn't child bearing the curse for the woman it's amazing when you look at this it really is for me it's just it's just yeah it's opened up a lot for me but to look at it she is saved through childbirth by giving Offspring to her husband by being truly there a part of the relationship in Genesis 3 16 . greatly I will multiply thy sorrow and conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children it is not easy to have kids but you know what it speaks of it speaks of the restoration the restoration of the Bride tree that one tree in the Garden of Eden and brother Bradham said it in a quote we read I said that it was Christ and that it was Satan brother Branham said that it was Christ and Eve in that quote I'm not going to go back and read it but what I am going to say is that it wasn't a problem until she actually partook of that fruit until she partook of those words that were spoken to her she took those words in from that voice that other voice she listened hearkened onto another voice and when she did that she became the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil she became the tree of death is what brother Branham said but we're talking about the restoration of the Bride tree through childbearing she shall be saved and how does that happen it's it's in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ by taking that word in from the right voice not taken the word from the denomination not taking the word from the pastor not taking the word from Mom and Dad not taking the word from anyone else but take in that word which was spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4 by taking the word that's spoken when we read the word for our day and realize that the Bible and and the message of the hour they say the same thing then the spirit and the bride they are all talk in the same language they're saying that Heavenly language they're saying come Lord Jesus in Hebrews let's turn over to the book of Hebrews chapter 10. Hebrews chapter 10. we'll start reading with verse 11. Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins speaking of the Old Testament priests here but this man Jesus after he had offered one sacrifice for the sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified is anybody here Sanctified today whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there was no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus and by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water understanding that the way back has been made through Christ has has already paid it all Satan wants us to believe that we've got iniquity that we've got sin that we've got all these things but the prophet for our day simply said you never even did it you have the ability to listen to the word to listen to The Prophet The Prophet wasn't just a prophet and and and and and taking his opinion and offering it out there he said she has thus saith the Lord he said you're the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never did it in the first place we bypassed our theophanese to come down here and be proven but how could we ever succeed if we don't understand that he paid it all and because he paid it all we have a clean conscience that we just read so we can draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance not wavering in our faith not having any fear not thinking that I did something yesterday and I might do something tomorrow and and and and and and and and no he settled it all he paid the price brothers and sisters when we come to that place where that voice is the voice that we listen to that voice is the one that we partake of in our lives that's the voice that's going to give us the liberty to know that there's going to be a time where we're going we're just going to get so carried away we're going to get carried away that the Revelation that that these bodies have to contain just won't be able to contain it anymore we've got a full Assurance of faith because he paid it all and this is where it gets into Melchizedek our high priest and and I'm sorry for jumping around but I just had to take this little detour and talk about this how important it is to recognize the voice how important it is to recognize the jot and the Tittle in the scripture and and not read it like it's a newspaper and just allow the Lord to give us Revelation to speak to our hearts so that when we read it we hear his voice speak to us it has to be his voice speaking to us I can say it I can preach it but until it comes becomes a personal thing to the individual it's just my voice it's just me and don't take my voice for it it has to be the Holy Ghost Inside the individual I was so encouraged to hear the brother that I had mentioned brother Fergus Howard he's on a journey and I was able to meet with him it was so wonderful to get together he's 25 years old and just has a hunger for the Lord and and I said is there anything I can do for you and he said I just want Fellowship around real Believers and I just want to get baptized because I want to get rid of the old and get on with the new and I just said my God bless you brother we're here to help what a tremendous thing it is when we get that Revelation when we start to listen to the right voice and we don't give that serpent any room in our lives and and we don't try and get things out of kilter in our lives I don't think we try to get things out of kilter but sometimes we don't try not to get things out of kilter in our lives and we know the word says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways I say Lord help me I don't want to be a double-minded man I want to just continually try and talk about the voice of the word for our day I want to try and and think about these things I want to try and speak about these things I don't want to speak about covet in the problem I want to talk about the solution the the great inoculation of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it doesn't matter Mark 16 says that if we drink any deadly thing it shall not harm us so what do we have to fear brothers and sisters what do we have to fear but fear itself that voice of the serpent coming around and saying well you know maybe you could get kovid I want to be real clear I'm not afraid of covid and I don't think that any one of us should be afraid of covid because really if it is something that's bad and if we get it and we die we win if we're in Christ I'm not saying that we should go and jump off a bridge that's not what I'm saying at all I'm saying that we should not let fear be the motivator let the word be the motivator in our lives speak the word and go forwards and watch the Devils move they have to in Jesus name they don't have an option sometimes I feel like Devils maybe they've got the option to move maybe it's because of that scripture where the disciples who were ordained by God to go out two by two to cast out devils and heal the sick and raise the Dead those disciples they came across the one with epilepsy and they couldn't cast out that devil and they they the dad brought it to Jesus and said what's wrong with your guys your boys they were anointed but they can't touch this one and he grown within himself brothers and sisters we have been restored all the way back all Seven Seals have been opened the one who says that a devil has the opportunity to have a hold I don't know are all the seals open maybe maybe not but we have the ability to have boldness confidence a full Assurance we just read in the word to know that we have faith in our hearts the ability to speak the word to push back on the devil we've been ordained to be the Bride of Jesus Christ we have authority we don't we don't have to be beat up by Devils we don't have to be pushed around we don't know what God's will is for our lives we don't know what his plan is for our lives and ultimately as as the bride would say honey not my will but thy will be done because I know that you know best honey I I reverence you because you love me so much because you have such a love for me because you would lay down your life you would say I'll walk out of the Garden of Eden out of this perfect condition for you so that you could be saved can you imagine that love story brothers and sisters are we that way for our wives you hear stories about men just looking for an excuse to put their wives away that's not the spirit of Christ it's not if we could have that kind of love for our wives my goodness you know Melchizedek he came out to see Abraham serve him communion after the battle after the slaughter of the Kings and I've seen it myself a few times now when the spiritual battle hits real hard because it does it's after the battle that Melchizedek comes around and he serves the bread and the wine he serves the the word the body of Christ and and the wine that causes the stimulation of the Revelation from the word it's after the battle brothers and sisters after we go and we have to fight hard on our knees and fight through all the Devils it's not before he lets us go right into the midst of the fire and that's where he comes through the battle but he is our high priest and he always comes we just need to keep pressing on in verse 23 of Hebrews chapter 10 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering because he is faithful that promised is he faithful hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering you know Abraham he considered not the condition that he was in he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief even though probably all of his servants probably told him he was crazy and and the people around him said really seriously you've got this promise coming he must have looked like an absolute lunatic to the world around him and then when he finally got the promise he said now God told me to go and kill him can you imagine that but he did it because he understood he held fast to the profession of his faith without wavering he didn't waver in it because he is faithful that promised us we know the next few scriptures here verse 24 and 25 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works when we talk to our brothers and our sisters we're talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ can you imagine that what would it be like to maybe time travel and go and talk to Esther after she was Queen can you imagine that anything that she wanted to the half of the Kingdom the king would have given her and here we are the Bride of Jesus Christ how do we see our brothers and our sisters how do we speak about our brothers and our sisters because our brothers and our sisters they might not hear our voice they might not hear that voice that we're giving power to but God does and so does the one behind that voice we need to be certain that it's only the voice of Jesus Christ coming out of our lips when we speak about the Bride of Jesus Christ many times we could speak about somebody else in this world and not have regard for them but the Bride of Jesus Christ wow so brothers and sisters today about quarter to 12 here whose voice are you whose voice are we given power to in our lives when we speak are we are we are we realizing that that the bride tree has been restored all the way back and we'll probably get right into all of that down the road in the future but the profit for our day to tell us that she has thus saith the Lord that she is perfect she never did it in the first place think about what Authority that gives us think about the power that we have at our disposal at our lips but so many times we're caught in this Human Condition by the by the Traditions that we've gone through the hurts that we've experienced the way people have have treated us but remember it's not people that have treated you bad if you've been treated bad it's evil spirits in people that have treated you bad your brother and your sister truly from their heart and soul would never try to treat you bad they would never try to disregard you they would only want to build you up and encourage you to exhort you even more so as they see the day approaching but whose voice are we today in second Peter verse second Peter chapter one sorry Verse 18 and this voice which came from heaven we heard and we were with him in the Holy mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts brothers and sisters that day star arising in our hearts the message of the hour the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through his bride his actual voice to this world the world looks at us and they see us they see human beings and most times I'll say it this way when they look at me they'll see a fail of fallible human being they'll see a wretched person who looks like they're unstable in all of their ways if you look at my natural elements the way that I am just just my my common nature human carnality yes sir that's exactly what I would look like but they don't see who is actually speaking through me they don't see the real me we've heard that said many times I don't see the real you you don't see the real me because the real you and the real me is just a little bit faster than us right now just in another dimension that theophany body it's the spirit that's inside us that we can't see we've just been given this flesh to live through but we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place brothers and sisters as we live out our lives here speaking the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit In Our Lives it's not another person it's the Lord Jesus Christ literally in our lives if we have his spirit and when we speak he speaks we have a more sure word of Prophecy unto this world that we shine his life as a light into the darkness the people around us the the ministry to the bride in the last age is to the total lost just like Noah's day he was preaching to the total lost the people around him probably said God bless you brother Noah you're such a good man such a fine man of God but the ark's crazy people probably say the same thing about the message of the hour and what does that matter to us follow thou hymn we need to keep pressing on there is a place a literal place that we're going to and it's never been closer brothers and sisters never ever been closer Revelations 10 verse 9 and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter isn't that the message of the our brothers and sisters it sounds wonderful many times people people will say it's great but when they get it in there and they say what women can't cut their hair what a garment that pertains to a man what all these different things that we have to contend with in the natural Realm true son and daughter of God is going to say Amen when that unnatural light shines upon that seed Gene of God that was in there before the foundation of the world but you know what in our belly it actually is bitter because this flesh cannot contain it but remember we just read about that more sure word of Prophecy and he says here in verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings and remember John the Revelator here was a type of the Bride not just a prophet not just the prophet he was a type of the Bride is what the prophet for our day said and so brothers and sisters we have that creative ability in us when we have that light when we have that life living out through us when we speak it is exactly what he said here thou must prophesy again before many people's Nations tongues and Kings all of the people that we come in contact with in our lives we are prophesying we are showing them that there is truly going to be a bride there is truly going to be a resurrection and a Rapture because we live he lives also because he lives we live also it's the same thing but because he died we have the ability to rise up and understand who we are brothers and sisters it's a more sure word of Prophecy but to look at this pick up your pen and write it's no accident and I think I just get the feeling and I could be wrong but brothers and sisters it seems almost like there's a fear about that whole entire topic pick up your pen and write and I think there is and the reason there is is because it takes all the power away from Satan it exposes Satan and it gives him no power in our lives because if the word truly says that to pick up your pen and write that she has thus saith the Lord the secret is the word is in the bride and she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with it what devil can stand before you what's devil devil can stand before me what devil could stand before a group of believers who are knit together in love what devil could stand before a family there isn't one because it doesn't matter what happens to this flesh brothers and sisters remember it doesn't matter what happens to this flesh this flesh has to perish one way or another whether we go in a body change this flesh stays here and we go and take on our new theophany bodies or whether we go to the Grave this flesh rots in the grave it doesn't matter this flesh has to rot one way or another but there ain't no devil that's going to hold us in the grave nothing is going to keep us from seeing the goal nothing is going to keep us down from achieving the position that we are ordained to be in which is truly in his throne if we overcome and what do we need to overcome brothers and sisters we don't need to overcome sin and hell and death all of that has already been overcome what we need to do is overcome our own will so we can just simply accept the fact that he did it all that he paid it all all to him I owe if we can do that we've made it we've made it let us hold fast brothers and sisters the profession of our faith without wavering without wavering knowing that when we talk it's our voice but is it really our voice because whose thoughts are driving our voice how how how is our voice actually functioning what are we giving voice to are we speaking the word or are we potentially giving the serpent some voice time are we giving them some air time in our life we're not even doing that airtime is expensive in general how much is their time in the life of a Believer there's no room for Satan to have a voice in our lives brothers and sisters Lord help us she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word I believe there's all kinds of scarecrows around that whole entire discussion because there has been charlatans there has been people that will raise up and and pretend and and and live like we talked about the very beginning people who will say that I'm a good Christian person but then I'll have a double standard I'll do a dirty business deal or or I'll talk bad about someone I'll gossip I'll I'll do this I'll do that and there's a double standard there and you know that stops the power of God in our lives but there is truly an elected bride of Jesus Christ and I believe Satan just hates hearing these words because when she gets the Revelation about who she is the prophet for our day it's prophecy and prophecy has to come to pass it's the word of God it's thus saith the Lord when she gets that Revelation about what she is then the Rapture will go she goes up and he's cast down and his time is over she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with it she has thus saith the Lord we don't have to keep still brothers and sisters if we have the mind of Christ we don't have to not that we have to say I've got Authority so I can I can just get upset and say whatever I want because I've got the mind of Christ and I've got Authority no way no that's where we'll keep still when a devil comes and tries to step on our toes as a father in our home we identify a devil coming into our house we have the responsibility like Adam to redeem our family to kick that devil out to stomp on it to identify it in front of our family to show our children that's a devil and it's not tolerated it's not acceptable in our home we have that responsibility as Believers to understand to discern the spirits is what the word said don't let a scarecrow hold you back from realizing the power of the word in your voice in our voice we don't want the devil to have any room there's there's no there's no room for the serpent not in this Garden there's no room for the serpent we're coming into Springtime and we're going to get into gardening and and seeing all the all the life happen how it just comes naturally we don't need to give Satan any room in our lives brothers and sisters stand stand to your feet with me this morning I just really felt impressed to talk about how the the voice of God how it changed how it went from being a spirit voice to being a natural voice Adam forfeiting his rights to it going back to being a spiritual voice and the prophet for our day coming down from Glory just like we were pulled from him before the foundation of the world that light unto the world and given that voice again and handing it back that Prophet said that all that Adam lost has been restored and what greater what greater responsibility is there to than to have that voice his voice in our in our lives in our minds in our hearts if we could just remember his voice let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I I many times don't understand why things go the way they go when we come to preach and I just trust father that if I obey you that you will bless the word and father I pray that the words that were spoken today Broken as they were that you would just take them and and and make them right in the hearts of your children today Father Lord I pray that you would just be glorified in all that was said and done I pray father that we could Lord begin to recognize that voice and and in our own lives begin to give that voice the preeminence that it desires that voice Lord Jesus that's you forgive me for making it an inanimate object Lord we want to make sure that you speak through us father that we don't give the serpent any time in our lives that we do not allow ourselves to just wander out from behind the blood and wander back in again transgressing you because it's just what we do and we know that you'll bless us you will bless us for a Time but father it's it's just a real Revelation to know that we don't want to just do it because we don't want to be blessed we want to do it because you love us so greatly so much we want to reverence you with our entire lives as your bride because of what you've done for us Lord we came into this world without one hope without one possibility of a chance to ever be redeemed if you did not choose to redeem us Lord so father we just thank you for redeeming us we thank you for giving us your word thank you for sending us a prophet to expound upon that word Lord so that people like me could understand it in in in a way that would just encourage me I pray that the word would just encourage your people today as well father and Lord Jesus most of all that you would be glorified in our lives that we would just give voice to you in such a way that you would just bless us abundantly above all that we could ask or think and we're not talking about money we want to see spiritual Revelation in our lives Lord that's the blessing that I'm asking for that we could stand in the face of the enemy and say no way you can't touch me because I'm God's we pray Lord Jesus that you would just strengthen and encourage each one this morning Father keep your hand upon us Lord watch over the families watch over the children Lord watch over the fathers watch over the mothers watch over the husbands and the wives Lord Jesus father that we could just be a true light a supernatural light to this world of Darkness around us wherever we go whatever we do let us do it unto you father we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen foreign
