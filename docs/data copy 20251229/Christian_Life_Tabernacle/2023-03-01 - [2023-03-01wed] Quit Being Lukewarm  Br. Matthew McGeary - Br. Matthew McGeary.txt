have you just come by our way that we would be able to Worship You Lord in spirit and in truth and to know that our meeting is not in vain for Lord there's people that have gathered all over the face of this nation who are worshiping but we know Lord we've been properly taught that they worship in vain oh God but we're so thankful for the Revelation that you have given us in the evening time Lord that has exposed the Son of Perdition and has revealed the son of man to your bride how we Rejoice how we thank you for this great message how we thank you for this great light Lord without it where would we be we would be so miserable we would be so lost Lord we would too be worshiping in vain Lord but you saw fit to write our name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you send a message Lord to call us out of the chaos Lord and to set us upon the sure word of Revelation in this hour that we can be changed that we can be quickened that we can be born again Lord that we can go into a Rapture oh God we're so thankful tonight we give you all the praise and give you all the glory and all the Adoration Lord for you are most Worthy you're worthy Lord God we just take a moment to tell you that we love

can Lord we commit the people to you pray that you anoint their ears that they might hear Lord move me aside I pray be with those that are unable to be here nor those that are sick and body may you be their portion pray and ask all these things in your most wonderful name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise this wonderful name let's just turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 16 and we'll also be reading out of Hebrews chapter 5. it looks like there's a little sickness that's been going around so if you just look out and you see somebody that's not here just remember them in prayer there's there's ones that I'm looking to see in the house of God and ones that aren't here because of maybe a physical ailment but maybe a spiritual ailment I think we ought to bind and gather bind together by faith and in prayer and start to Envision that one sitting there in that seat and I believe that that will come to fruition amen I don't believe that uh when we say these things or We join together that it's in vain but I believe God honors he honors the prayer of a righteous man a veileth much and if it's according to the word then what hindereth amen let's just read out of Matthew chapter 16 and just uh verse 2 and 4 will try to by God's help to uh just move a in a certain direction uh the scripture would read like this he answered and said on them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but can you not discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left them and departed and also out of Hebrews chapter 5. verse 12-14 for when the time you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by a reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil we just ask a blessing upon the word you may be seated and just reading that last portion of scripture it says but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil so to know what's right and wrong by discernment we ought to be a church that's of full age that we mature that there is a discernment that we have to to be able to know what is right and what is wrong and this look this this goes beyond just a a Discerning between what is out there in the world and knowing all the things of the God of this evil age and all of these things are evil out there and and God has called me out of those things and I recognize um uh that those things are wrong and and now that I've I've turned my heart towards the Lord and I know these things are right but it it as you mature in the Lord it comes down to where it keeps finding and honing down to where you're Discerning between what is right and wrong and I want to say it like this uh the wrong is not always sin it's not always that it would be something uh that we were wrong according to the law but it is is it right for you to do is at the right season is it the right time is it the right attitude is it the right way to go about it see you know brother Branham even preaches a sermon about trying to do a god of service and it not being his will it was if you would say a right thing to do it you want to preach you want to you want to go out you want to restore a fallen brother there's something you want to do but but you know the way you go about it might not be so much be right so there there there's a way of maturity to the believer where we come to a place where we start to have a discernment about us just even the way we talk to somebody or the way we approach them or the way that you witness you know it takes it takes a little bit of time you know you you get on fire for God and you've been set free and and you're zealous and you're going around and after you know after a little while the Lord gives you a little bit more discernment on how to properly approach people and not offend them because there's times oh I've offended a lot of people and you forgive me I'm still doing it I'm trying to learn I I want to have more to discernment because you you want to share something on your heart and it's right and and it's the word of the Lord and and the person needs correction and it's the word and you see it there and it's plain to you it's just as as black and white and so you come to them and you share it on your heart and you find out you got the wrong response you got the wrong reaction because maybe it wasn't done in love you see it wasn't necessarily that it was wrong but it wasn't right and I believe we're coming to a place of maturity where we're growing where we're able to know what is right and what is wrong by discernment and I just want a little take a little bit of time and just reading through some quotes and we'll just see how the uh uh the Lord would just lead us but I want to take out of the church age book the prophet of God would say this he said now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts my I I just I I just love the the word of God it's like a seed every word and every sentence it's a seed if it just blossoms forth with Revelation by The Spirit Well we can just stay right there preaching on that we want to move a little bit further along but Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts read in the book of Acts Christ is continuing the same acts in The Bride of Jesus Christ in this day when the devil tries to say well that was a day gone by or or well that was just in the apostolic days it's really not like that and he tries to read no we believe the word we we believe for the same signs the same wonders for blind eyes to be open uh for for those like at the gate called Beautiful silver and gold high by none but rise up and walk I I am not going to settle for anything short but the full word of God and manifestation in my life I'm not going to settle for reasoning I'm not going to settle for doubt but if the prophet said it I believe it I'm going to discern between right and wrong and I know the word is right and everything the devil has said is alive but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm if you want to know what the Antichrist spirit is trying to do in your life trying to do in this church it is trying to make you lukewarm formal and Powerless that's his whole goal is to make you lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cashed into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it you want to know something the devil cannot stand he cannot stand this little gathering that's taking place in Bedford Texas because we have not gathered according to man's Wisdom we have not gathered according to not to denominations but we have gathered under the revealed word of the hour not something that man has done but something that God has ordained and manifested in this age to you and the devil hates it he can't stand it because when you get a revelation of what God has done in this age then he is powerless before you it's been proven I'll go on record the devil will devil is powerless before the prophet William Branham powerless oh you you think you can go and say well not this time not over here not uh this the prophet that the prophet only did what was revealed to him to do and then as a man though he learned obedience by the things he suffered certainly he didn't always make the right decision but it was an example unto us showing how Christ had come the angel of the Lord had appeared unto the prophet and was going to lead and guide him into his position and his place as the prophet to the age and he taught him how to discern between right and wrong is that right look the prophet learned many hard things and I say it would behoove us to be a student of the message I I've heard it said that a a a smart man learns from his mistakes but a wise man learns from others you know you you can get a lot of life lessons and eternal lessons by studying the life of William Branham and find out where he made mistakes and find out where the Lord was leading him to do something and he was drawn away a Minister's pulling on him this way and that way and things were said and he didn't make the right choice and he had to pay the penalty for that we are not exempt from that as children of God those I love I rebuke and chasten he's bringing us into a place of maturity to be able to discern between right and wrong because we are we have the power of the spoken word but we need to have the mind of Christ to know what to do with it amen he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army well I should read that again last time I checked he was talking about you I mean he's not talking about the church down the road he's not talking about somebody else this message is to you she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army I am not looking church for something in the future everything we have need of has been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ there I am not looking for a squeeze I am not looking for some future Revelation but if we have come in a union to Jesus Christ the word then we have everything we have need of to produce everything that has been spoken concerning you now I just want to focus here uh By God's help if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now notice what he says by God's spirit and we could really labor on on breaking these sentences down and talking about the spirits within the framework of the Christian church but I'm just maybe just start for a foundation I would like to just talk to you about by God's spirit it has to be by God's spirit that we discern and withstand and and maybe just uh we'll just see if God would piece This Together by his grace but Brother David said something I believe Sunday night that just struck me and and and he said quit being lukewarm and that'll be my title tonight quit being lukewarm if we're gonna buy God's spirit discern and withstand we got to stop being lukewarm Church you think we can just dip in and out and then have the right answer and the right discernment just I just kind of rubbed shoulders with the world and I kind of just go this way and that way and all of a sudden when you come up to a problem it doesn't work like that but I believe that there's a life for the believer a life that's that's hidden Christ that that's that's behind the veil where you've come into a union and you're in the Shekinah Glory and there's an atmosphere about you and as you walk with him he he's talking to you and he's leading you and he's guiding you as the prophet would come into his home and and there's the children fussing and it seems the wife is frustrated there was something he was in communion with that was saved just put on the apron he didn't come in there say honey what is this all about huh I had a hard day at work people have been throwing it after me all day long they want my counseling they want this and that and and I'm just totally wore out and this is supposed to be a Haven arrest for me and lo and behold I come home to the home the kids are fussing you haven't even made dinner what is going on right what kind of house is this no no he he recognized I'm a creator I have the power you know my the other day my my you know just been a few days and and I just share my heart you know my something there there was a an infirmity in my in my wife's body and she just uh you know you just hear it and you say honey yes I pray for you and this you know and then the next day and then something just rose up on me on the third day you're like I'm sick and tired of this this thing I I have a right to go take my wife and lay hands on her and tell that Old Devil you ain't gotta right to be here any long I'm claiming my wife I'm claiming her health and something rose up within me I got tired of that thing and now I've staked it upon the word of God and if the devil tries to Puck his head up again I just chop it off with the word of God no it's settled once and for all I've laid it there off the altar I've claimed the word of God it's settled it's all over devil you've been defeated you can stand right there see as a Creator one that's Discerning between right and wrong there he could come into the home and say oh put on the April say oh honey let me just help you with the dishes and what did he do oh I mean we all want some big great thing to do we want to start some Big Revival and and we want to run off over here and run off over there we can't even create an atmosphere in our home we can't even bring the presence of God into our bedroom what's wrong with this church come on we we we hey all that I love I review can chase I believe it's time some of us get chasing I see God forgive me we want to do all these things we want to defeat the Devil we're going to be an invincible Army where's the presence of God in your own home where's the presence of God in your car you keep tuning into that Christian radio and you think the presence of God is going to abide in that car with that nonsense that's garbage the Bride of Jesus Christ has no business listening to that denominational Tommy rot oh yeah you've heard it over here over this Pulpit yes sir I believe there's something far greater I remember my brother David when he first got converted do you want to know the only music he listened to was the prophet of God singing hymns because you know what he could be sure of there wasn't no leaven in that nope no you go by my brother David the only thing you is listen you could just hear the prophet of God just singing he had somebody had compiled a whole track and it was just nothing but brother random singing hymns and singing songs you know what I like that I'll take sides with that I'll take sides with that every day I'd rather lean way that way then some of this stuff way off on the other side with your rock and roll boogie woogie well however we got over here I think it's all right well because we need to have a spirit to discern the traps of the devil what has happened to us I think it's because we're not living in the presence of God we're not living in the position that God has created for the believer to be our creator to create an atmosphere to change a situation I tell you when I'm living close to God and I go into a restaurant and I hear all that music and stuff you know you get a little bit of nervous hey I'm I'm hey I'm preaching to myself right now I'm doing two and two I ain't felt that way in a little bit so that you know what that means hey I need to get back into that place back into that Shekinah Glory shut away from all the things of the world that when you walk into a place it's unnerving does anybody know what I'm talking about you you've been in prayer and you've been experiencing the presence of God and then you go out into the marketplace you go to Walmart and I'll send you like dude I don't even belong here you just don't even feel right being in there but then something's in your heart and you start to have compassion friends we ought to be looking out at this dying generation and say oh God is there something I could say to them you know there's people that are sending up smoke signals all around you that are asking for help try it one day just walk up to say hey I just want to ask a question would you like to be delivered of those you'll find out nine out of ten they don't want to smoke they've all tried and they pick it back it's expensive I was at the store the other day and some person said give me a pack of that or something like it was like 10 bucks or something like man that Demon's really whipping people nowadays it's expensive but we ought to come into a place where we're Discerning between right and wrong we're we're there there's something about us that's different we can create an atmosphere we can approach people out of love when you do something in La out of love brother it changes everything not to satisfy some religious duty if you walk up to somebody and say well do you want to be delivered that's not going to do anything but if there is a genuine love in your heart for the individual that wants to see them delivered they will know the difference that's why Christians get a such a bad name they call them Bible Thumpers because they're just trying to fulfill a religious Duty I went out there today and I tried to Bonk this guy over the head and bonk this guy over there but when you come to somebody with love and have discernment and you can start talking to them about the weather and things that are going you see they're wearing a Cowboys jersey and say oh I see you're a Cowboys fan huh what are you thinking about that and oh friends you do it long enough you you look for the doors see God always opens the door you look for that door you look for that key when they when they say the right thing and all of a sudden you're like oh man I tell you what I I used to get all emotional upset but then God changed my life uh with those things and you'll find out with the right approach you can communicate with somebody and what was the prophet doing every time as Jesus came to the the woman at the well what was he doing he was catching her spirit the prophet of God would say when he would speak to some people what was he doing he was catching their Spirit friends I want to tell you you too can catch somebody's spirit look this is not limited to a prophet it is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ residing in you then if that same spirit that was in Christ Living you it will Quicken your mortal body it will Quicken your mouth it will Quicken your language it will Quicken your thinking it will Quicken your discernment to be able to discern between right and wrong when to speak when not to speak you have thus saith the Lord or we stand still see there's a maturity that we're talking about so by God's spirit we discern and we stand and once again simply put we can start making some great strides if we quit being lukewarm we're led by the spirit we're sealed by the spirit we're quickened by the spirit everything's by the spirit amen that's what Paul would say as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God just moving a little bit further the prophet said if we ever get the true Revelation right we ever get a true revelation of anything what is it going to be by it's going to be by the spirit so just reading this quote a little bit further maybe they're just mixed up we just uh in our preparation I just tried to pull a few things that that God would lay in our heart this was also out of the church age book he says if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it if Revelation is beyond you look friends there's a lot of Revelation that is beyond us if you think for one second we've arrived we got problems we we have not begun to scratch the surface oh we'll start When We Get Over Yonder but right now we're just getting a glimpse we're just getting in Earnest we're just catching a little bit because it's going to take all eternity for this to unfold if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you are ever going to get it I want to take my time on some of these things because God forbid we've become good denominationals we've become good religious people we we've become good at recognizing a quote we've been good at just nodding our head to it but if something can speak to our heart and we can realize that I desire more revelation I I desire the strong meat of the word I desire to be able to discern between what is right and what is wrong he says that is the only way you are ever going to get a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endowment you can endume it you can never even memorize the scripture oh my watch this now you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost now pay attention here you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ oh you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ now I want to move a little bit further and and Satan is going to be right there to condemn you we want to rebuke the devil because we all being predestinated seeds are in a journey the prophet were not born a man we're born a baby we go through a process but the devil is really good on condemning people who are in the process of the holy ghost moving in their life and bringing them through the process whether you're in justification sanctification you've been filled with the Holy Ghost look we have all the types in the Old Testament what Crossing Jordan into the promised land is a type of receiving the Holy Ghost but they really didn't really have much they had to go possess it they had crossed over so when you get the Holy Ghost I mean you're just getting started you're just beginning the battle you're just getting going so there's not this hey look they're still in the wilderness as we've dramatized before could you imagine them all you know the Levites step in there and and the Waters of the Jordans separate and and everybody's crossing over and they're all uh Onward Christian Soldiers and they're marching across could you imagine a group of people over in the promised land looking back at the people in line look at those guys they're still in the wilderness can you believe them backsliders give them a chance give him a chance we have people in different stages and different walks he says you have to receive the Holy Ghost then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God the anointed when no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them now if we can just hold this in our thinking we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the truths of it if I can say it like this we have accepted the message of the hour we have accepted Malachi 4 5. we have accepted the fundamental truth that has been given to us by the messenger of the age right but it's still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there now I want to labor there for a moment because the prophet is telling us that we need to pray for revelation more than anything we ever prayed for is revelation because we can believe the Bible we can believe the message we can believe the truth we can believe the doctrines of it we can believe serpent seed we can believe water baptism oh yes we can believe all of those don't you know that the womb to the spirit is the mind you accept those things into your mind you believe those things you even perceive them you see how it line up but there is a further unfolding he says but it's still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened so what did he say if Revelation is beyond you seek God for it I I really want to challenge us this evening on seeking God for revelation when did we ever get to the place where we've become satisfied with a knowledge and an understanding in our group Gatherings that we haven't come to a place where we're getting desperate before God and crying I say oh God Reveal Your word to me oh it's a storehouse of the riches of glory and if you'll get on your face before God said oh God I want more Revelation I'm seeking for more revelation God unveil your word to me and then watch by the spirit he will Quicken the word and it will become real you know you think about when people really want something you know they a lot of people you know they really want something some people do some crazy stuff you know they might they might uh uh sacrifice time or money or they'll save all their money they'll quit doing other things because oh man I really want to go on to this trip I I really want to go overseas and they stop doing this and they save up all their money and and why because they really want something I'll tell you something that's really profound watch two people fall in love and they they just you know especially long distance relationship I know what I'm talking about oh you just want to be with them you just want to talk to them you know you're at the Gathering or something like that you're like we're selling so they're off in a corner on their phone because the only thing they care about is talking to their sweetheart they just want to be together you can't live without them so you're do you're doing whatever you're making a sacrifice you you quit going over here or going on trips over there and you start saving up your money you start saving up for the wedding you start doing all these things because something means more to you than everything else there's one thing on your mind and one thing alone oh like that that little girl on the ranch when when all the denominational sisters were mocking her and making score but what was she doing she was making herself ready because there was only one thing that mattered to her she said no he told me he gave me his word he put the wedding a band of predestination on my finger and he told me he's coming back for me and that's the only thing that matters I'm an abdressed right I'm gonna live right I'm gonna act right I don't care about everything else that's going on there's only one thing that means anything to me and that's the bridegroom and and they start to focus and there's only one thing that has their their hopes and their dreams and everything occupied is that one goal and they sacrifice they plan uh they tell people they testify they put in their two-week notice at work because everything is going to be history they're just looking for that one thing well friends it's time we do that for our Lord I tell you he's worthy of it he's worthy of every minute he's worthy of every second he's worthy of the honor he's worthy of the glory he's worthy of your time he's worthy of your attention he's worthy of you making the sacrifice he's worthy of you planning to spend time with oh he's worthy of your life if you can get to a place of desperation where the only thing that matters oh friends I don't want to go over there I'm going to skip a meal I'm going to do this I'm gonna get up early in the morning because all I want to do is I want to get away with my Lord I want to let the veil drop down behind me I want to be in the Shekinah Glory I want to feel the presence of God I want to feel this spirit I want to be in communion if you live there and come out of that place in that atmosphere walking in the light walking with that type of discernment then oh you're in tune as our our pastor talked about spiritual maintenance you got to maintenance things to keep them in operating order so just moving a little bit further just talking about getting desperate for revelation for those that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled so just hold that thought seeking for revelation because everything else is a distraction everything else is a distraction from you getting this revelation look all of Satan's Eden every everything that is thrown out there everything that is trying to draw on your attention and your time and to attach itself to your flesh is done in such a way to demand upon your time your tension your energy to keep you from putting your your focus on the main thing revelation the prophet of God would go on to say this he would say oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation now notice how he says by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving Revelation is not a one-time event but it's something that's constant it's something that is continuous it's something that's life-giving or quickening and it's a prevailing Revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father in heaven see Satan wants to distract you he wants to rob you he wants to confuse you he wants to keep you from getting to the place of desperation and really catching a revelation of what is contained in the revelation of those Seven Seals and what's really contained in the revealing of the son of man well I hope that's not too Elementary there there is a power there is a a quickening power there is a continually life-giving prevailing Revelation that has been opened up to the bride through the voice of the seventh angel messenger and it's by that voice that your body is going to be changed it's by that voice oh as Paul said o grave where is your Victory O Death where is your sting I want to tell you it's going to be by The Voice of the seventh angel messenger that has sounded that is going to give you the prevailing Revelation to put death under your feet it's not going to come by any other way than the way that God has ordained it he ordained it according to what he prophesied here data according to the message he ordained it according to the Mysteries that have been revealed by the seventh angel that is the life prevailing giving Revelation that's going to take the bride into a body change and we want to start getting hungry and thirsty for more of it look you know you ever I was thinking of this how the devil wants to distract you and he he he's just wanting to to to get you distracted away from what God has placed you to do ever you ever see a cat like stalking a bird or something yeah Birds just man it's just tweet tweet I'm having a good day look at these seeds over here I'm playing with my friends and little does he know all along I mean slow you know it almost looks like he's not even moving you like watch them like is he moving easy moving watch him long enough and all of a sudden you're like he's closed in 10 feet and that bird doesn't even know what's about to hit him you know the devil is doing the same thing to your life he's watching you well they just had a good service maybe maybe I'm going to keep stalking him a little bit I'm gonna follow him a little bit they had a good day at work okay and he's he's getting closer and closer and all sudden you get home the kids are fussing the wife burnt dinner she she she's trying to change the diaper and and you get home and now what do you mean I got to cook dinner you're supposed to cook that no yeah you'll cook dinner I'll change it I don't want to change that diaper that makes me gag and all of a sudden now's my chance you you see look we we have to get to a place I want to move by God's grace to get to a place where in the small things and then the big things we are Discerning that in all of these things both great and small is not only an opportunity of the devil to try to take you out of the will of God and to take you into something else but it's also an opportunity for for the manifestation of the sons of God to declare what they are made of it is an opportunity that when the chaos breaks loose in the home and things are going right that there ought to be something inside of the believer that said this is my house this is my church this is my car this is my family it ain't no devil gonna take away my joy you ain't gonna take away my happiness you ain't gonna put a bad spirit in this home you ain't gonna put a bad atmosphere in this home why because God give me this house God give me this family and this is mine and I have dominion over the things that God has given me because I'm living in the hour of the manifestation of the sons of God it's an opportunity and he who is faithful in little we all want to call for the resurrection of the Dead We're The Voice well we're the final voice to the generation and at the the voice of the Archangel and and the Archangel is Christ and we've come in a union and he only has our hands as we yield our hands and a voice as healed and we're going to be the very ones to Call of the Dead in Christ forth out of the grave and we we can't even talk to our wife right we we can't even discern between right or wrong in the workplace and as we move a little bit further we got to get to a place of maturity where we recognize the spirits and the framework of the Church oh not our church brother Matthew oh no not our church no no no no no evil spirits working in the framework if if we got that idea we're doing something wrong because if we're right and our Doctrine is right then Allah Hale is fighting against this revelation all our hell is fighting against this church why do you think it's taken us so long to try to build one I'm telling you if we were denominationals we'd have a 50 foot long pipe organ without donations from all the all the state and boy we'd be in some big church somewhere but no that's what's hot we're fighting against spirits and Antichrist spirit and we need to get to the plate friends we're in a Warfare we're in a battle uh don't you realize our brothers and sisters are in a Warfare they're going through a battle and we need one another to be able to look and catch their spirit and be able to discern that my brother and my sister they're going through a battle the devil is really after them I see it in their countenance there's something in their spirit that just ain't right oh God I'm going to go to prayer I'm going to call the wife say oh you know something's on my heart for brother so and so I just feel like they're going through something would you bind together with me in prayer oh if we can get to that place Church where there's a genuine love for one another in the building and we're Discerning the spirits that are working in the church we will be an invincible Army we will work called to it it's our position that cat all of a sudden just Springs at the opportunity you know you think of it when Jesus was fasting for 40 days and 40 nights he didn't come to him while he was under that anointing for the fast so we've we've heard and know that many times when you're it's a god-called faster not even hungry but when he broke that fast when he was weak that's what the scripture has there in Matthew 4 it says when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights and afterward was hungry then the tempter came so you can start knowing that you start looking around and we know in my house I mean I it's just it just I don't know that Old Devil I'd give him a black eye but it just seems like every time you got a minister or or God's putting on your heart something to do for the Lord it just seems all of a sudden this goes wrong and that goes wrong and you just stand back and say and me and my wife will look at you I'm like yeah I know it ain't gonna work devil you're trying to you're just trying to disrupt the plan of God trying to cause some type of confusion trying to distract us from the main goal and the main purpose but you say Old Devil it ain't going to work because he's going to attack you when you're down he's going to attack you when you're hungry he's going to attack you in your weakness and by God's grace we might get to well we might have to save that but we might get to some of those things to where it's in that weakness but but we know that it's in that weakness see that God allows these things he allows you to come into these trials he allows you to come into these places where you experience a weakness because a true overcoming Hallelujah true overcoming is recognizing in that weakness is when now he is made strong look at Paul when when Paul they were out there he I think they had loosed from and I think Paul had warned him not to do it now all of a sudden they're out on a boat and they're like man we haven't seen no stars we haven't seen the moon we haven't seen nothing for 14 days we've just let the ship Drive and the scripture actually says in all hope was lost everybody on that boat were settled we are going to die all hope was gone and guess who was on that boat the messenger of the age in shackles and chains to a Roman that was doomed to die by the rest like the rest of them but he had something going for him that nobody else had going for him because there was a purpose in Paul's life there was a purpose that Paul had to fulfill and there wasn't no storm there wasn't no shipwreck nothing was going to stop Paul from manifesting the purpose that God had placed him on this Earth to manifest and Paul could come out there and stand there in his weakness looking like he had no power at all he could come out there and say Hey I want you boys to be encouraged because the angel of the Lord appeared to me last night it ain't none of you gonna die if you stay on this boat with me according to my word none of you will perish I think it's time to be happy why don't we just go ahead and break out the rations and start to eat because none of us are going to die and did it stop there no it got worse they had to start lightening the ship and soon enough all sudden this the ship got stuck in the rocks and all of a sudden it broke apart and some of the soldiers were talking about man maybe we should kill the guys and chains maybe we shouldn't the one Roman soldiers like no no for the sake of Paul we no let's keep them all alive and then there were some of them on the boat they're like hey man we're putting out the anchors and they were letting down another boat they're on this ship and they were letting down a little Lifeboat and they were going to escape away and Paul looked down and said hey man the only people that are going to live the only people that are going to live is on this boat with the messenger of the age you want to escape you want to go ahead and give some other little Lifeboat and you think you're gonna float off there and you're gonna Escape lady I'll see you and you're gonna escape the storms you're gonna be Shipwrecked you're gonna be dead you're going to be eternally separated from God but if you stay on the boat with the messenger of the age I don't care how bad the storm gets the ship might wreck but you're gonna make it to the shore some of you might be swimming some of you might be floating you may might be hanging onto a board but if you stay with the messenger of the hour You're Gonna Make It To The Shore just stay with the message church just stay with the messenger of the age he was in his weakness it wasn't something that Paul could do but it was something that God had ordained by Paul and he was with them every step of the way it was in his weakness brother random says it comes a time when men forsake men that becomes a crowning time becomes the crowning of a Ministry I believe every son and daughter of God has a crowning time of your ministry I believe every single one of you have a specific Ministry I believe that you young people every single one of you God has ordained you so much that he wrapped his own a Zoe life that old predestinated seed and he deposited in you because there was an expression there was an attribute there was something that he put into you and said oh I have a purpose for the seed and it's going to come into fruition and it's going to manifest the word that I have spoken she's going to be a created word bride in the end time to put death under his feet oh I love it praise the Lord let us win your week the prophet of uh Jesus would say this in Matthew 26 41. Watch and Pray Watch and Pray how many of you are watching and praying that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak church we cannot go to sleep on the fact that this flesh is our worst enemy I believe that is one of our biggest struggles and our biggest battles is Discerning our own self-efforts of when your own self is deceiving you a church we we we really need the spirit Revelation by the spirit to really understand that this pest house is serpent seed I don't know if you know that but none of you had to be taught how to lie there is a nature your first husband you're born in sin there is a nature or if I could say it like a spirit that is contrary to the nature of Christ and so God has positioned you to be the one to take back Dominion over the Earth again look don't worry so much about what is out there take dominion over this and when you get dominion over this then you'll have dominion over that but don't think for one second you're gonna go down the rulebook checklist of your knowledge of the message and all your do's and don'ts and I don't cut my hair and I wear long skirts and and I'm not wearing skinny jeans some of the brothers can say that some can we need the spirit hey come on I'm telling you we church we got to get down rugged if we are going to go into a body change we need to stop some of the nonsense some of the way that we're dressing and some of the way that we're acting and some of the music that we're listening to and some of the friends that we're hanging out with oh I'm telling you I don't know what to do sometimes I sometimes I just say well he said narrow is the gate and few that find it I don't want to have that kind of attitude I just know what God did for me it's a separation from unbelief how can two walk together how can you walk with the Lord Of Glory and continue to do the things that you're doing look that's not condemnation it's the grace of God showing you there's a higher order there's a higher way you don't have to live like that you don't need those things for your joy you don't need those things for your satisfaction but there is a union oh Hallelujah in the Shekinah Glory to where you're changed well you're walking with him and there's a discernment that when that song comes on that boy goes by that girl goes by something in there says no the world is selling a bunch of goods there ought to be a cry in The Bride of Christ's heart that says I'm not buying I don't want what you're selling devil I had a whoo we won't go there cause I I gotta I get all got all riled up on a thought about cancel culture you know the big old cancel here we go cancel culture everything out there cancel this cancel that because if you don't agree with them or if you make a stance that's not in line with their views or their agenda or their narrative you're canceled I want to tell you the devil is so late to that party you come you're such a poser devil my God is the original Castle culture we are not supposed to mix with unbelief we are not supposed to listen to Satan's Lies We are not supposed to mix with the world we are not supposed to marry an unbeliever we are not supposed to stop and listen to the music we're not supposed to go on the websites and the jebusites and the all those lights out there that there's something in Us by the holy ghost that has canceled canceled canceled it doesn't fit our narrative I'm going in a body change I'm going in a Rapture yeah I'm going to cancel that nonsense you got me once devil you got me twice but you ain't going to get me again canceled the devil made an appointment I'm going to cancel it he made an appointment with death canceled I'm going to put death under my feet and go ahead put that six foot of deep dirt over top of me It Ain't Gonna Keep Me I'm gonna come up if I go in the water if I go somewhere else I am coming up his appointment's been canceled why because Jesus Christ The Mighty conqueror anyways we got to start canceling the devil why because the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak I'm too tired to pray I don't have time to listen to a message uh church is too far on a Wednesday night I can stream yeah try try streaming the wedding supper tell me how that one works I don't know I don't know I get fanatical I don't mean to get like this oh and I wouldn't blame it but if by Faith by faith if we can look past the veil and look at Divine promise and believe that Jesus Christ is here right now now like I said I I'm not going to fault for this but if brother Branham was here there would we would have problems but people would be carnal like the pool of Bethesda you think we'd have Windows they'd be broke out because everybody would want to be there oh friends friends trust me trust me I know some people that perceive that when Jesus was a Healer and there was all those people camped around what they do they ripped the roof off they ripped the roof off if if that man that's a hotline to heaven and my family member that's been sick all these years I am going to get him there and what did they do they couldn't get in so what did they do they climbed up they got on the roof and said boys we're going in what are you doing we're going to rip the roof off this place because I got faith look they had faith for the one that had infirmity it's time it's time we come to a place whereas a group of Believers we can have enough faith for the people that don't yes sir I believe the bride is coming into a place where we are an invincible Army and we can start Discerning the little foxes that are spoiling the vine and are making us cold formal and Powerless and we'll just keep going so I'm going to call for the musicians we need Revelation by the spirit that we might be able to discern and withstand it's time we start saying like Jesus when he was a hunger he was weak he was being tempted in a weak moment the tempter came what did he say get behind me devil man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God why did Jesus rebuke Peter Jesus was expressing his heart to the disciples say look this is the very reason and purpose I have come into the world that I I must suffer these things I must die in raise on the third day this is the very word that is spoken concerning me there's nothing that can stop me from the purpose that I've been placed here for and Peter our Lord fire be it from you to manifest what you're here to do that's really what he was telling the Lord but don't don't get confused it's not so much that the Lord was rebuking Peter the individual who he loved but it was the carnality that that that that that that Peter not Discerning the Lord's body if Peter had the Revelation and the discernment to know that this is what what this is what has to be done with the word if he was Discerning the Lord's body and the prophecies and there in that burden Peter would say oh Lord oh I'm with you let me know what I can do but see Peter wasn't discerning the Lord's body he wasn't Discerning the word and many are sick amongst us because we're not Discerning the Lord's body we're too carnal and so why did Jesus do he looked at him and he rebuked the flesh get behind me Satan because you're looking at the things of man you're looking at the things of the natural you don't Savor the things of God and friends we need to look ourself in the mirror I tell look that old guy and say Old Devil get behind me You Are My Own Worst Enemy you're going to worship God you're going to church on Wednesday night you're going to church on Sunday I'm going to the house of God I'm going to have communion I'm going to go into prayer and you bring this flesh under subjection Watch and Pray be vigilant [Music] amen oh we have so many things we want to say to you we got to start doing as our Pastor said we got to do things with purpose we got to read we got to pray take time to get in the presence of the Lord what was our pastor laboring on you have to make a choice now the prophet of God would say this when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against her you you have to disbelieve first you realize that don't don't you realize it's in the DNA of the flesh to believe by the touch taste feel smell see right all the things that you contact your Earthly home you accept it you believe it Olive ladies Satan's eating all these things it's easy for you to grasp and and conceive and and believe and and the word of the Lord has come and say you have to disbelieve all of those things Science Education reasoning we we gotta quit we gotta disbelieve all those things you you have to disbelieve what Satan's Eden has presented as a successful life you have to make a conscious choice and realize that College is not the ticket to a successful life a better job is not the ticket to a successful life getting married oh I finally will be able to overcome that lust devil if I just get married it's better to marry to the that I'll finally be able to be no none of that none of those things are a ticket to a successful life there's many people that have done all those things and even now you're hearing about the most successful people in our economy and our age and what are they doing they're committing suicide because that's not the answer I I love years ago uh my brother David he said it and I I thought it was profound but but he said suicide is just a perversion of the truth because this life is not worth living in the flesh but you're not supposed to take your own life you're supposed to die to yourself and surrender it to Jesus Christ and if you can just Surrender Your Life to Jesus that's the ticket to a successful life you get born again and buy the holy spirit let it lead you and guide you into all truth and all righteousness and by the revelation of the spirit you will discern between what's right and wrong should I take this job should I take this course should I marry this girl should I marry this boy should I get down and pray should I go over here should I stop a moment should I go out and run to the store should I go into the office and just pray for five minutes you see it's a relationship where it's you and the Lord together you're doing something together it's a union we're so busy running off on our own accord with our own plans and allowing this flesh to juristic our day and order our steps but if we can just die to the flesh oh oh let's stand and by God's grace we'll be able to maybe share with you about in that weakness in that weakness [Music] that's where he's strong Paul wanted to be delivered he had that infirmity in his Flash and said oh God delivered me from this infirmity deliver me from this weakness because he he felt oh I if I could just if you would just heal me from this it'll make everything better but what did God say to him he said Paul my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness he said most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmity that the power of Christ May rest upon me I will glory in my weakness because it's in your weakness it's in your weakness [Music] that he's made strong amen let's just sing this [Music] whole Spirit come make us and we turn our eyes from Evil things oh Lord we cast down our Idols oh and Give Us Clean Hands [Music] to another give us pure hearts [Music] and God let us be a generation I see blessings God God let us [Music] just in closing I read this quote out of perfect strength by Perfect weakness now bound God passes the Nobles and gets the weakness God passes those who think there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing to order to work his purpose in their life that's what we get God said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker more you can yield to me the better I can use you the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about your stuff the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to me the more I can use you cause you become weak I'll make my own purpose strong God can make strength out of weakness that's the reason he always does it

word the name of the Lord call upon the word ask the spirit to come and reveal the word to you we don't we're we we're not gather here as people that just heard the message and want to gather here no God came and revealed himself to you and he showed you that this message it's himself and if we started in the spirit how are we going to finish in the flesh we need to keep in the spirit keeping the word keeping Revelation let him make his word every word of God let him make it true to you you said God I can't do this I I you said that you were a deliverer you said you are a Healer I need the revelation of that particular word to be manifested in my body and God will make it true to you that's a promise it's not condemnation it's the word promised word that we can walk in we say that you want me to walk I'd forsake the worldly friends and forsake the things of the world and and he will make it a reality to you he will come and he will take the desires of the world and those friends
