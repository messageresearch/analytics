blessings are tenfold in fact the scripture said a thousandfold and father we are so grateful for that we just ask that we have a wonderful time in your word this evening father because that's really what matters is the word we ask it and they ask you to bless us in jesus precious name we pray amen amen if we have our bibles let's open them up to the word of the lord and we want to go to ii peter as as we um read the third and the fourth verse and and we just have if we have a title tonight we just take it from this scripture partakers of the divine nature partakers of the divine nature now like i say you know you've got to look past looking in the mirror you keep looking in the mirror you will disbelieve but if you look at yourself through the word of god then all things are possible amen so let's just read these scriptures here and uh you know in peter's writing this he says simon peter the first verse a servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ amen this this is a specific epistle to believers amen it's uh wonderful and listen his salutation grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord so here's peter expressing the need of the knowledge of the gospel and then we heard paul saying the same thing may your knowledge and understand increase so and this is just a tie with this morning where we we preach that the opening of your understanding is what leads you into that dynamics of manifesting him it says now he says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue and that you know we read these things very fast but just look what he said according to his divine power so here it is something that's given us what do we know when what have we been calling this divine power we've been calling it what dynamics okay but we've been calling it that that spark that octane so god has something that he's going to give us and give you and so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter whether i have it or i'm expressing it but if i know it's my promise then i've got the earnest of it in the word and therefore i know it's mine to receive so with anticipation i can look for it and then as it reveals to me the things that i might need to do to have it come forth so it's very beautiful but it's according to his power that these things are given to us so it's not not us that's achieving it it's him that's giving it amen billy brought that out beautiful wednesday night he says wherein he says whereby are given unto us so this this divine power has given us to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue okay so those are two things that are promised to virtue is strength whereby are given through this glory and virtue are given to us whereby are given to us exceedingly great and precious promises how many knows what those are i i think i just want to start studying the promises of god we used to have one of these little boxes there's a little glass box and in it was full of promises of god and you pull them out and read them promises of god i recommend everybody get well versed in the promises of god it's your inheritance it's what you have in the bank account it's what you can write checks on it's what you can spend it's everything to you exceedingly great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of divine nature so you're not going to be partakers of divine nature without the precious promises they work hand in hand okay having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening in your precious and holy name we pray amen god bless you may be seated tonight we've we've just been going through god's word and just taking this beautiful easter season message of it is the rising of the sun and we've just been going through it if i could say it this way paragraph by paragraph just like you read your bible in a sense you know when you read your bible that you you start reading maybe through the bible and then there's a verse that stands out to you right and so you color that verse in and some people say every verse that's con to faith i'm going to do blue and every verse that's a a promise i'll i'll do an uh yellow and then another and pretty soon your bible looks like a rainbow because you're just it it just one verse at a time just keeps standing out to you standing out to you and pretty soon you're reading and you've got all those verses and then you come across one that you've never ever underlined before but because of your time in life and your circumstance and where you are all of a sudden that scripture becomes alive to you because the spirit of god is quickening that word in other words he's bringing that portion of the word alive in your life and making it real to you you know and all of a sudden you begin to see and and you know when you first start out on the journey maybe a lot of times maybe there's a lot of conviction and you're seeing a lot of things you're doing wrong and you're dealing with that but as you go on and you begin to grow a little more you find out that there's just not things that you're not supposed to do there's things that you are to do so you move away from the uh the not things to the two things so it's no longer i'm not going to do this i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do this oh i need to quit that i need to change that but you mature and you get to a place that now god can instruct you and that you can be led and you know and i hope that i can do my best that i i never want to ever impress upon you that there's any fear in being led of the spirit of god you know because we can get so theologically bound that we're of no earthly value in other words we're afraid okay does it line up with the message did brother branham say it in all these things and there's nothing that our messenger ever said that contradicted one word of this bible in fact it really was a life that was lived and and so you can read and listen to his sermons but you can also get a gospel by looking at his life you know the themes that he did little statements he made i have a book at home with thousands and thousands of dollars that i've given out my front door you know but he said the scripture says don't let your left hand know what your right hand's doing and so there there's there's there's a whole nother aspect that you begin to move into that if you just you it's it's just not it it's it's i think brother uh tim touched on it this morning in his exhortation that he said there's a freedom and a liberty that a christian lives under and you don't have to be afraid and so as you you do that with your bible and then you mature and now you're feeling led of the lord you know who knows a a scripture might come on your heart today that you know visit visit the widow and the the fatherless and their affliction and then all of a sudden you might that might be quick into your heart have i ever done anything for anybody have ever went help to anybody yeah also the script you might you might read the scripture one day where it says we bear one another's burdens and that might get quickened to you you know i have i been praying for somebody have i really have had somebody on my heart that would bring me uh to a place of intercession because the scripture talks about not a catholic intercession of the saints but that we pray one for mother but one for another we we we uh we bear one another's burdens and we make intercession for one another because you don't want to find yourself that you have a theological and a doctrinal life and the scripture said show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my words so in other words the life that i'm living is testifying to what is really leading me and remember this morning as we read the thing he said if if you're not being quickened to the word of god then something else is quickening you something else is bringing you to life but if it's god that's quickening you he's going to quicken you to his great and precious promises because god can do one thing god can't do is god can't lie he even had that written in the word of god so that we could anchor into that fact that jesus said i am the way the truth the life so we know that that he can't lie so we've got these great precious promises that are is in the word of god so we just want to go through another paragraph tonight and as we we look in to this and so we'll go to paragraph this is where we left off last sunday night and so we'll read a paragraph tonight so we'll read paragraph 217 and we'll just go through a little bit of scripture tonight to get to where that we are and to to how are we going to be partakers of divine nature so to partake of something means like if if you partake in something then you're a part of it you're involved in it you're actually what makes it what it is right so if maybe i can use something carnal but i think the other day some of the believers played some volleyball or or a game like that or if you're in a game maybe whatever type of game that you might play who's ever playing or partaking in the game that's what makes the game you know what i mean i mean there's no partaking in anything that's solitary you know what i'm saying so you have to understand that the concept of a team in essence is every person is partaking and by their position in partaking they make the whole team right you know an army for example that frontline soldier he might have 20 soldiers behind him getting the food there getting the supplies there doing the intel doing the communication so there's all of them become partakers of the same effort so everybody that's partaking produces the same effort and paul brought it out this way he says we are members in particular but we're fitted and joined together into the body of christ each member supplying the need of the other so you've got we if we start to understand that is none of us can individually be partakers of divine nature without it overflowing and making somebody else partakers of divine nature the lord jesus was a healer right but if he never healed somebody or if somebody wasn't sick we would have never seen that healing attribute manifested but when when he when he took the uh i believe it was the mud and he put it on that person's eyes and they they they they saw that young man saw and that's one of the greatest portions of scripture you'll ever want to read makes me just want to read it right now because it makes me rejoice at this young man's answers so he sees and and the first thing everybody says we there's no place on record wherever a person that was born born blind received their sight so the scribes and pharisees call him there and they say by what authority and how did you receive your sight he says wait a minute you guys are the fathers of israel and you don't know by what's power he does it i mean and so they try to question me he says he says well what do you know he says well i know this i was blind but now i see amen thank you you know what they did they threw them out but guess what happened when they got through out somebody came looking for him hey amen amen so don't ever worry when you get throwed out right because there's somebody looking for you amen so it's a great it's a great story but until that was manifested you understand it took that man that was blind to receive his sight that the power that jesus had is manifested so when a word is spoken if it's not manifested and it doesn't become flesh or take form then it you don't know its interpretation you understand that because god interprets his word by bringing it to pass so if he said let there be light and then that's where it ended none of us would know what light was we would guess we would make presumptions we would presume in fact we wouldn't even know what his interpretation of light was or what he meant when he said light but when light came that then it was only by the coming of the light that we knew what he spoke so you understand i'm saying that because i want to make this statement is is that the word of god always has to become flesh in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwell amongst us that's why peter could look at phil he says have i been with you so long and you don't know who i am he who have seen me have seen god because it has to has to take form as long as it's just spoken it it it's not interpreted right as long as it's just spoken then it it it just floats if i can say that but the minute it comes into a form or is manifested not not only is it interpreted but now it's present tense and that's what's beautiful so he says he says here in 217 did you ever see how independent an old eagle walks he don't hop like a vulture see to every to every dead and all the carrion laying on the ground no sir he walks proud shut your mouth oh here's a good dinner over there here no he says now now for me see my desire has changed my appetite is different for men shall not live on world a carrion alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god a genuine quickened eagle lives by that so a real a real eagle lives by the word of god and are his appetites different he wants to live by the word of god and you say you say it is the word of god food yes it's meat it's food it has an effect it changes things and and as we read he said oh and he raised up christ from the grave this paragraph 2 19. dwelling in you has quickened your mortal bodies into his presence so to understand that this quickening power is not an independent anointing that comes on you that's what not what brother branham's teaching he's not teaching it that that it's a third person or it's a blessing there's there's not but one god you understand so a real eagle is quickened into his presence so by divine and precious promises we are quickened into his presence and and so if if we begin to to understand that because we're talking about partaking in divine nature so there's got to be something that takes you from where that you are into the presence of god you you have that there's i wanted to save this scripture but i i i'll just read it now so let's turn to just go straight down the page to peter the first peter where we just read to be partakers of these divine and precious promises and so you know right after he says that he lays out the statue of a perfect man add this add that okay and he says that he who forgets these things forgot he's purchasing but look he says in the tenth earth wherefore the rather brethren giving diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall now listen to this for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ so can entrance will be ministered to you into this kingdom now we read it this morning right in galatians if you will look at i mean colossians if you'll go back and look at this real quick quick and you can in the first and thirteenth verse he says who hath delivered us from the powers of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so you understand you not it's not future tense because that kingdom never passes away so if you're in that kingdom and you have that kingdom life in you you will never pass away so there's an entrance minister deal there's a something that has been given to you that now provides you a pathway or a course or an entrance or a portal into his presence now the every single one of us in here has the opportunity to enter into the presence of god that's beautiful now the first thing that happens to us is we say i'm not worthy to go in there or that's for somebody else or i've done too much my past is a wreck no by the blood of jesus christ our sins go before us and so now we have this entrance ministered to us so there and you that's what's so beautiful people they've rejected this message because of all kinds of doctrinal differences that they have and they don't even understand what it was it was the ministering of the entrance into the rapture it was the token ticket [Music] that allowed you to be partakers of divine nature so we we see now that we're talking about something that's ministered to us and this is when when you grab a hold of this word and understand what it is that is allowing us to do and i want to just emphasize this point this evening without taking uh too very long he said he said oh and he raised up christ from the grave dwelling in you has quickened your mortal bodies into his presence you recognize it you're no longer a scavenger you're an eagle you don't want the things of the world you're a son and daughter of god you're feasting at the fountain and the world knows nothing about it and that's so important because here you are separated out from the world you're feasting on something that nobody else knows about because it was ministered to you by divine revelation you were the recipients that's what he just said here he said why it's given to us exceedingly great and promises according to his divine power has he made an entrance for us into these promises that we can be partakers of divine nature the question is do you want to be a partaker of divine nature i do how do i go there how do i get there and the first thing man always comes up is what do i have to do nothing except believe because without faith it's impossible to please god without accepting it and then possessing it so faith is possession faith is is accepting i i could say i i have something for you and you could say i believe he's got something for me but you'll never come accept it you won't take possession of it you won't accept it as it's for me a lot of us believe the word of god for everybody else i remember i was a really healthy young guy i was logging in the woods i cut timber down big timber timber you could park a pickup truck on bigger than this piano around you know and i walk those logs with my cork boots or spike boots and i'd trim all the limbs off and impact impacted chainsaw and a gallon of gas and a jug up a mountain and and the mountains were like this man i i was just like healthy as all get out but i'd never been healed well in my you know youth i i didn't want to thank god for my health i kept praying oh i'd like to have a miracle i'd like to be healed well i didn't realize i had to get sick before i could get healed so and i've worked in the longwoods almost three and a half years and and i'm working in the longwoods one day and i i that that day we we had cut all the timber we could cut so i was working what we call a choker chain and this kind of choker it was on a great big crane and they'd take this big hook and they'd throw it out in the woods and the guy would land it on the pile and then you go take this big clamp you drag it over there heavy with a big steel cable and you wrap it around the log and then you step back and he draw the log up well so i've done this you know times before and so this time i just got done praying i'd really like to be healed i'd like to know what it's like to be healed i want to partake in that nature so i'm sitting there and this guy drags this log up and there's this little sapling that's bent over like this underneath that tree and the minute he pulled that tree over that sapling came up just like a slingshot and it came up right under my arm right here came up and caught my thumb right here took my arm and shot it right up over the top of my head my glove went flying up my shoulder was all thing and my thumb was broke well i said well all right so i went to church i i end up in service and the words being preached and and all of a sudden i i start believing god and all of a sudden my thumb my thumb was healed my shoulder was healed and i was made well well if i had more revelation i would have already realized i was healed by being healthy but it took that to manifest and so as we read here he says the world knows nothing about it you're drinking it the world knows nothing about it but you're drinking this word you're drinking these promises it's having effect on you it you're drinking it if so you can't sit back and believe this message as theology you've got to understand its food and its drink it gets bread man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so now you see that we've got this great word these great precious promises and we're drinking it somebody knows the world knows nothing about it you're eating hidden manna that the worlds never even know nothing about for you're an eagle you're quickened up where you can get it hallelujah you understand what he does to you by revelation do you understand you what he does by opening the word of god do you understand what he does for us when we get to hear a tape and we hear a mission he's making an entrance for us it's a way it's a way in to divine nature the only way in to divine nature in the presence of god is by the word of god so he's ministering an entrance every time the word of god is spoken it becomes a way for you to enter in to his nature and be a partaker of divine presence how important is the word it's everything everything is done by god's word every word of man's a lie and every word of god is true so he says he says you can't get it down here you've got to get it up here you've got to be quick and lift it up there so it will quicken so you've got to be lifted up so what you begin to understand is that is that obedience to the word makes the word flesh everybody wants to do miracles okay so it's not just healing miracles and casting out of devils you know what i mean but it's the love of god spread about brought in our heart by the holy ghost so every every time that a person sees the word of god hears the word of god believes the word of god and acts upon the word of god they're making that word flesh and brother brandon preached a beautiful message on that very thought called proving his word he predestinates the believer to be there so that he can hear that word and live by that word and therefore now that word becomes flesh as long as it's left here it kills but when it's taken from here and obeyed and followed then it becomes flesh and when the word becomes flesh now your partakers of divine nature because the word is being made flesh in you so now not only is the word here but now it's here so the word was in prophecy right in the old testament and sunday dimes of diverse manners god spoke to the prophets jesus said search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life but they are which testify of me in other words all you have to do is line my actions and what's going on in my life with the scripture and you'll see they're being fulfilled that's right if god ever does one thing one way he always says it's the same so the same applies for you every time you take the word of god and you believe the word of god it's manifested in flesh right well what is sin sin isn't drinking sin is the manifestation in flesh of not believing the word all sin is unbelief in fact there's only one sin that's to disbelieve so all sin if all sin is manifested in the flesh then all word has to be manifested in the flesh too so it's got to come up to pass so we're talking about how do i become partakers of divine nature so man always gets out looking for anointings or a workup or some sort of feeling or driven by emotions you can sit down and read this scripture and the word of god is quickened to you and then and what is good what is sin what is sin the final that word definition of sin in the bible is to know to do good and not to do it in fact obedience is better than sacrifice so all god wants to do is give you an entrance so he reveals his word to you he shows you something in his word it's quickened to you now once it's shown it's quickened but in order to have it become flesh it's got to be obeyed and the minute you do what the word says to do now that words become flesh now you've been lifted up and joined the kingdom of god because the word of god is now living in you and flowing out of you and now has become flesh if the groom was made flesh the bride has to meet may flesh because we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh it's got to come to this beautiful this beautiful place that we're talking so the spirit of god lifts us up into places they don't know about sometimes you have to go into that place all by yourself sometimes you've got to take a promise of god you've got to believe it and you've got to confess it lord you said this i've got to believe it i'm going to act on my belief i'm going to prove that i believe this by the things i say abraham believes he's going to have a baby made him a fool right but what did acting on that promise do for him made him a young man it manifested in the flesh he'll do the same for you i don't care what how dark it looks your entrance and your victory is always in god's word it's the promises precious promises that he's given us as the way to partaking of divine nature and and so as we just read on now in in this last little bit of closing he says it'll quicken what did they do they spoke in another language the bible said they did they spoke in every tongue under heaven think of that now the gospel was going to what go into all the world that was the commission go into all the world and preach the gospel this is a personal side note of mine but this is what it meant to me when i read it you read it whatever it means to you but the gospel is going to go into all the world he said go into all the world and preach the gospel they come out of the upper room endued with power and high and they're speaking in every tongue under heaven what a prophecy fulfilled what what absolutely a prophecy actually the word of god what we just read earlier right what did it what brought that to pass how how did that happen if he remember we what we said he said that's divine revelation of the word made flesh he said watch it was spiritual revealed word that did it what what did they do they obeyed the gospel right they went into the upper room they were endued with power on high and they preached the gospel in every tongue under heaven the word was made flesh oh it's so beautiful now you are that flesh and then this listen to this as we just finish up here he said all once they were so quickened he said he said they spoke in every tongue under heaven could you imagine that them old mortal bodies that in there said well i don't know now whether i can believe it or not all at once look at you i love this message i don't know how this great prophet of god can cram so much in two sentences did you see actually what they he said they were thinking they this they're in this upper room right they're scared to death they they know that there's people out there seeking them because they want to crucify them too they did it's what they wanted to do they were going to wipe him off and all their followers off they thought they had him satan thought he had him when he speared his side but he didn't know one thing he left a stinger in there he left all his power all his sting all his bluff here they are in that upper room they're totally scared to death for they feared the jews and all of a sudden they're sitting there wondering i don't know whether i believe it or not but what are they doing they're obeying the word of god they're doing what he said to do you go there and wait and so they're in there right waiting so what do they do they have a political movement oh yeah they're politicking which only shows that god don't build his church on politics i think we ought to choose matheus i think we ought to choose matthias or who whoever it was and and and the guy said well i used my buddy i want him to be in our group god had another fellow in mind i believe the prophet of god didn't he refer to him as a hook nodes jew or something like that that was making havoc on the church that was the replacement apostle but they thought they'd do some politics and they'd draw some straws and they would fleece the lord and all those things that didn't work and they were all some of them were sitting there thinking just what he said i believe if he said it in fact i have always had a belief in my heart when brother brahms said that he said jesus come out of the wilderness and he went down there and got his friend lazarus to go down to see john how did he know he you know i mean i just think he sat up on that hill and watched it all come to pass he was already up there with john once so i think that he and he knew those things and so you know so here he says well i don't know now whether i can believe it or not and all at once they were so quickened till the bravery of the lion of the tribe of judah fell on them how brave was the lion of the tribe of judah you know how brave he was father thy will be done i'm going to go up there without any doubt i'm going to let them come into light lay down my life that's how brave he was he was brave enough to die for the sins of the world now that's the bravery that's the bravery paul got when ananias prayed for him and he received the sight that's the bravery he got to be thrown in prison and scourged and and i forget he gives a litany of how many times he was scourged how many times he was thrown in prison after all the things he'd been fighting lines and tried being eaten by beasts and all kinds of perils but what was he he was holy ghost brave he had the bravery of the lion of the tribe of judah that's the kind of bravery that's what's promised to us in this day if we will take the entrance into the kingdom of god they were so quick and that they had the the bravery of the lion of the tribe of judah fell on them over that waving sheath oh what eagles come to call its own the eagle has come to call it song that message eagle the fourth beast of the book of revelation the eagle has come to call its own and we'll close with this part here and they love not their lives unto death and there's going to be more who will give their life's blood for this holy ghost gospel and its crimson flood and the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last days the quickening power has got to come quicken them out of these dead denominations and creeds to living word of the living god it's got to quicken them that they're going to take this word and make it flesh now in closing let's turn to revelations the 12th chapter and we're just going to go this read because the prophet of god placed this scripture right here in our day and it's beautiful let's just go to the seventh verse and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the dragon was cast out that old serpent called devil and satan which delivered the whole world as he cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with them and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god for the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night what is the one thing that the accuser can't do is lay anything to the charge of god's elect why because their names are written in heaven but what's he doing he's accusing listen it's beautiful he says it's cut down and they it before our god day night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwelleth in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath a short time i'm telling you what are we seeing we're living right there he takes that scripture and he places it these people are willing to lay down their lives for the word of god even unto death were they willing to lay down their lives and so it it comes to the the very simple thing that we we miss you know it's always the little foxes that spoil the vine but when we can understand and simply sit back with a cool collective understanding of the word of god how do i become partaker of divine nature how can i be the christian that i want to be how can i manifest how can i have these works it comes very simple how can i overcome how can i overcome by the word of god it's the word that gives you entrance it's the word obedience to the word makes that word flesh in you and the word flesh in you is the partaking of divine nature believing and accepting and possessing every promise in the book makes you a partaker of divine nature and it's so simple that it's hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes what do i have to do brother mcgary do what it says what does it quicken you to it quickens you to full obedience to the word i'm going to say that again what is it quicken you to we just read it 10 times it quickens you to full obedience to the word of god people are saying it's going to quicken to give me power it's going to quicken i'm going to raise the dead it's going to quicken i'm going to do this it's going to quicken i'm going to have a manifestation of some great supernatural that's not what it does it quickens you to obedience to the word obedience to the word makes that word manifested in flesh and now you and the word become one and now you're the manifestation of god you've been translated through the entrance of god's word into the divine kingdom and you're there you're living it by simply accepting and possessing the word of god and they just couldn't believe it but you have been given to you it is given to know the mysteries and believe me the simplicity of god's word is so wonderful so lord richly bless you and and i want you to keep me in prayer i'm trying to make a decision on whether to go out and see my mom and and i don't know if all of you know but uh my sister was living with my mother and not trying to air my our my family's dirty laundry but my sister's just has a problem it's a very common amongst irish people to fight alcoholism and my sisters just come real bad with alcohol and we had to put her back into a uh because literally they get alcohol poisoning if they don't go into the doctor you're not even talking about trying to rehab them you're talking about trying to keep them alive and she's got to the place where she really can no longer take care of my mother and so my mom you know is uh she'll be a hundred years old in july so and she still lives by herself she still cooks she's been living by herself here for the last a few weeks or so and different ones have have been trying to go over there and spend some time with her until we can find something that will work and and so leslie and i are praying leslie's going out for sure and i'm praying about going out see if we can find something for my mom and and she's got a nice home she loves it so we're just trusting that we can find somebody to take care of her and everything so if you'll keep me in prayer and so if i go i'll uh i'll i may not be here next weekend but uh i just sure like to find some peace uh with this situation you know what i mean and and i want to do my part you know i mean it it's hard because uh my calling is here but you know god's blessed us with some real able men and and people that love the lord and and so i just like to do this i don't know how long i'll i'll have with my mom but i i don't nearly do what i should you know billy paul told me he said daddy called he he always called brother bram daddy so i'm not but he always said daddy called his mother every day and he told me he said i i should have went and saw her of course you know stuff like that just you know what i mean because you get so busy you know you don't call your mom every day and he did every day you know there's so many things i've heard about brother branham through life that people have just shared the family and everything you know and you know i mean i'm so bad that sometimes i'll shave i'm not shaving for a while but sometimes i'll shave and i won't rinse out the sink if and brother rim never went into the bathroom that he didn't clean the whole thing fold every towel pick everything up you know yeah i know where you can find my towel right on the floor where i dropped it you know but that praise god he gave me a good wife you know so when she's done it looks like i just did what brother branham did i just do it through her well that's what god wants to do he wants to do it through all of us wants us to be like him and i think that's your heart's desire too so keep us in prayer i think god's wonderful i i'm very very much in love with going through this message verse by verse so if you know if if you would rather move on then please feel free to let me know personally you know don't sit out front and say i sure wish brother mcgary would get off that book you know like brother branham had job on the ash heap for us i don't know how long finally late he said brother brandon when are you going to get job off that ash heat you know but i think there's some real food in this message don't you and it's our secret so if we can take this word act and and listen to it and obey it you know i i want to close with this testimony musicians can come and and i'd like to close with this testimony and i won't tell the person but if she wants to give the testimony i'll let her do it but they came to me and they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so uh they they went on and and and all of a sudden one day i i got a phone call and they said wow i really feel different god's really done something for me she said i i can actually be a testimony to my family you know i i really know i i believe and it just a wonderful transformation of your spirit from doubt to pure faith and so she looked back to where she was when she got baptized and she said well i didn't feel like this when i got baptized should i get baptized again and i thought it just was inspiring to me and i thought no don't you see the way you feel now is the word made flesh you went and got baptized you did it and you got a promise right you promised that if you would be baptized you would receive the holy ghost so now you've got the holy ghost and the enemy's looking at you saying when you got baptized you weren't like you are now but you're like you are now because you got baptized because what was spoken is now made flesh so she was obedient to the word and the word was made flesh and now she's different and really believes the word in everything she said oh i didn't feel like this when i got baptized but the reason you feel like this is because you got baptized and you might not feel it but he didn't say did you feel it he said did you believe it you be obedient to the word and it will manifest its promise in your life it will become word manifested in flesh and that is beautiful and every one of us has the opportunity know how how little or how insignificant it might seem that lady that went up that highway in that great vision was failed to keep one word you don't know all the word i don't know all the word but every opportunity that the words revealed and shown is an opportunity for me to be obedient and therefore that makes entrance for me into the kingdom having escaped the corruption of the world through the flesh has translated me or made entrance for me in to the kingdom of god so we're we're moving forward church move forward with it take the rear view mirror off your car because you're not backing up take the side mirrors off your car because you're not take the reverse out of your transmission because we're not going back you know why someone asked me the other day i believe i was over at uh the funeral for sister karen and someone asked me if if i ever look back i said i don't look back it's too painful to look back alls i see is the wrecks of my life but by the grace of god he's washed my windshield clean and he's laid a path before me that from this day i can leave those things which are behind behind i can become obedient to the word god's word and all things can become new for me in christ jesus that's the hope of every believer if we are faithful and just to forget our to confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive him i rest in that don't you i rest in the fact that he's got a plan for my life i rest in the fact that he knows what he's doing and i hold to this promise if he's begun to work in me he'll finish it till the end i may have taken his permissive will a thousand times but jesus practices what he preaches if your brother offends you a thousand times in one day you forgive him a thousand times in one day i don't care how many times i've taken the permissive will he promised me he would work it back around to his perfect will all that the father hath given me will come i will not lose one so now if my heart comes to the place that i really want to overcome i want to overcome my fears i want to overcome my doubts i want to overcome the lust of my flesh the pride of life the lust of the eyes i want to overcome but god's given me the way to overcome he's given me his promise and all's i have to do is obey and when i obey that word's made flesh and the word made flesh gives me every victory that i ever have need of god bless you [Music]
