so uh we we um I was looking at it there was nothing on it so I thought is that the second page or is still the first page so if you haven't filled it up please um take time to just fill it up so we uh we want to uh make sure we account for everything and um uh we just do everything that we can to to get ready for it amen man it's good to have brother Jeremy with us and you know um it's always an opportunity when you have a visiting Minister who could sing and to just have them come and you know just greet the church and sing a song for us so invite brother Jeremy to come at this time God bless [Applause] you God bless you it's good to be here amen this evening do you love the Lord amen I'm asking you again do you love the Lord amen and I sure want to say that I appreciate uh your prayers and support for our meetings last week and uh uh those that were able to come uh I've said it there and I say it again it was a tremendous blessing amen for my church um to be able to have the fellowship there and maybe if you're here and you say well we didn't get to hardly visit with anybody well I'm working on trying to get my people to talk more uh and so but uh we sure appreciate it and brother Matthew amen the the ministering of the word was just one wonderful and and the Lord knows most of you probably don't have any idea man the things that we went through to get to the meetings um but this morning they want you to they want me to change all right amen that works amen sometimes you just got to you just got to adapt to the situation amen do I need to start over no I'm not going to start over I do want to say that we appreciated brother brother Matthew again in his ministry amen it was a blessing to our church there was a lot of things that happened um to get to that point and this morning I woke up and there's a lot of songs that we can sing but this song's been on my heart all day and it just seems like uh with everything that's going on the testimony or the prayer request for the the family in Louisiana uh you know maybe perhaps you've had a rough week maybe you've had a rough year maybe you've got something that's going on whatever it is one thing that we can say is that in every situation a Believer learns constantly that they have nothing but trusting in Jesus and and to me that's our hope you you somebody wonder why are you even here tonight well I'm not here for just religion or just to pass the time but I think we're here because we know there's only one one person that we can go to and that's Christ and that we can come and we can offer ourselves tonight in the church service by sacrifice say Lord I'm here and I want to thank you that you've brought me through every trial and no matter what is coming my way I I have no clue what it is but I know that if I just hold close to him he'll get me through it this is a song that we all know and uh so it's nothing special it's just perhaps maybe you could sing it with me if this is your testimony as well amen it's just through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus amen let's sing together I've had many tears and Sorrows I've had questions for tomorrow and there have been times I didn't know right from but in every situation God gave blessed consolation that my Trials come to only make me strong I'm singing through it [Music] all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all oh through it all I've learned to depend upon his word oh I've been a lot of places oh and I've seen a lot of faces [Music] but there were times when I felt so all alone here it is but in my lonely hours yes those precious lonely hours Jesus let me know that I was still his own oh that's why I'm singing through it all lift your voices now to him oh through it oh I've learned to trust in Jesus you know I've learned to trust in God through it all oh through it all I've learned to depend upon his word can you really say this now oh I thank God for the mountain oh and I thank him for The Valleys I thank him for the storms he's brought me through for if I never had a problem I wouldn't know what God could solve them I wouldn't know what faith and my God could do oh we're singing through through it all hallelujah oh through it all i' learned to trust in Jesus oh I've learned to trust in God through it all through it all I learned to depend upon his word through it all together now singing through it [Music] all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus oh I've learned to trust in God through it all oh through it all I've learned to depend upon his word what have we learned now oh yes I've learned to depend upon his word God bless you [Applause] Saints wonderful we learn to depend on him on everything we realize he our everything we can't do anything without him amen certainly thankful for that amen uh brother John and chany they did a prayer for his son Chase and the situation there and amen let's just bow our heads and take it before the Lord our gracious father we so thankful to be gathering your presence tonight Lord and father you know the situation and what's going on and we certainly want to lift up our brother in prayer Lord Lord you are the maker of all universe and father there's not a problem that you don't know about in fact before there was a problem there was already a solution in your mind Lord so we just ask Lord that you go and you intervene according to your word and your promise father We Lift Your Name up oh god father this even as we sang that song the needs for the problem is so that you can come and show us what you are in our lives Lord we committed to you and we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen K ofd amen oh the to R you main take one by side one by faith oh take

we could have gathered Lord that we were accustomed to Gathering father but we count it a good time to be in your presence Lord Jesus father we just ask the people of made the sacrifice to come to your house Lord Jesus father Place me aside that you might speak something to them Lord Jesus that they may go back with a little bit more faith than they had when they came in Lord for you said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God lord father I yield this vessel to you Lord Jesus have your way in this service Lord Jesus and the short thought you put on my heart Heart Lord Jesus father I'm just crazy enough to believe that whatever problems came inside this house by the time our time here is over it'll be settled Lord Jesus am not because a man stands here and can say something Lord but father because you said in your word Lord Jesus and we are believers of your word father in spite of the circumstances that we see Lord Jesus Faith isn't a hopes so Lord Faith isn't an assurance Lord Jesus and we are certain father that if we come in your house Lord Jesus you said forsake not to Gathering amongst each other Lord you said where two or three are gathered in their midst will I be Lord Jesus father we trust that you are here Lord Jesus we've done the man part by arriving father we're asking you to do the god part in being with us in this time we leave everything else into your hands Lord Jesus I ask this in your precious holy powerful and wonderful name amen I trust we're gathered to be in the house of the Lord tonight let's just turn our Bibles over to the Book of Psalms while you're standing we're going to read in Psalms 8 I believe the scripture reads oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name and all the Earth who hath set thy Glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings H has thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger when I consider thy Heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with Glory and Honor thou mest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet thou has put all things under under his feet all sheep and oxen yay and the beasts of the field to the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passes through the paths of the Seas our Lord our oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name and all the Earth may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I don't think I'll be long but we'll see the Lord put a uh a more of a question in my heart for a while now that I've been pondering and I know we've been speaking about traditions and speaking about the effects of traditions and how that works with man and you know praying and trusting in the leadership of the Lord trying to you know you don't want to beat a dead horse but at the same time if the Lord wants you to stay in a channel it doesn't matter if you think it's beating a dead horse somebody needs to hear it so the Lord put on my heart that sto the unclogging of pipes and the subtext or you know subject you could say would be true Faith Unleashed and uh last time we were here and we spoke we we touched on a quote that brother brandom spoke on in proof of his resurrection this is merely just to lay something down for the thought that God put on my heart in paragraph 31 it says now Jesus spoke the same thing when he was here on Earth he said ye are blind leaders of the blind he said if the blind leads the blind won't they all fall in the ditch now pronouncing Christian or religious teachers blind see God has a way of revealing himself to the people and making himself known to the people but many times tradition shuts off the people before God can get a chance to get into them to reveal himself see you get it see Traditions all what that is today and it got me thinking because the the the problem isn't just tradition we've we've we've got into that and kind of expressed what the Lord had on our heart in that part and now the Lord's moved in a way that now the thought's been in my heart of if I'm here for a purpose if Christ has brought me here for a reason and I need to yield myself so that he might have his way and use me in whatever manner he sees fit in order to do that I have to get out of the way I have to get things out of my life brother Brandon would type and the scriptures would type you are a temple your body is a place where the Lord dwells so if the Lord's dwelling in your house what kind of a home have you opened for him we we want to be real careful with how we present oursel when it comes to the Lord you know as as we heard it says the Lord has a way of revealing himself he's wanting to make himself known show you in another sense you could say another piece of the puzzle but until you can get out of your own set ways which is what tradition is is a set way then God can't really use you as I pondered on this thought I fell upon the sermon but preach there's a lot of quotes from this sermon uh the fundamental foundation for faith brother Brandon would speak about Adam how Adam in the beginning beginning was a son he was like God what he said came to pass he was a son with full Authority brother bam said he had unconscious faith meaning it wasn't something that he was consciously trying to muster up it's just he knew if I say something it has to be whatever I speak I have an authority behind what I utter that will bring it to pass amen not because of who he was uhhuh but because of who God made him when God said he made him in the likeness of himself see Adam oh this is amazing Adam is you and I because we have been brought now to what it is that Adam had lost Adam had full dominion and Authority brother brandham said he was a master of circumstances how often we when circumstances arise do we consider ourselves masters of circumstances or do we have things that have clogged up the pipe the flow in which God supposed to bring forth his Revelation to you is it busyness of life is it work is it school is it relationship what's in the pipeline when you're building the home you have a water M the water man is the source that connects to the main and it brings forth water into the building and that water gets dispersed you have a bathroom you may have a sink you may have something else but if you shut off the valve in the water man then the building doesn't get any water now a building without water you can't really do much in it's missing a key piece you're the temple of God brother Brandon would say that you there's a pipe that you're directly connected to that is Christ and anything you put in the way from God letting his Water of Life flow so that you might become a son a true son with true Faith like Adam was see Adam never questioned anything Adam never doubted anything Adam never thought for one second oh man you know I'm not God I'm I'm I'm just his creation I'm I'm this I don't have authority I don't have you show me where that was described because the Adam that we knew that if he spoke to a mountain it was moved if he told the the the lion come forth come let's have fun the lion came forth he had complete authority over everything but would say once again it's a unconscious faith I I'll give you an example how many here Believers are going to wake up tomorrow what's your Assurance what's the proof that you'll be alive tomorrow that you'll wake up tomorrow how do you know you wake up and you're on autopilot if it's work you get up how do you know your car is going to start you just get in your car you start you go to work how you know you'll make it how do you know you'll finish work see you're operating in the unconscious realm but according to things of the Physical Realm God wants you to operate that unconscious faith in the spiritual realm and if we're not careful we start just going by the ways of life every days like this every month's like this and year and so forth and you're not really progressing into anything that Christ wants you to be spiritually brother Brandon would say that man was made with a purpose he has to fulfill his purpose in this day brother B would say that after the fall what happened with Adam was he lost consciousness of what Authority he had he could no longer speak and what it is that he spoke came to pass because something now was clogging that pipe see beforeand there was nothing in Adam's way but after the fall now he had himself in the way this is something that he did the Lord told him the day you eat thereof the day you'll die he fed on it you reap what you sow we we have we have to watch ourselves brother would say that now in our hands has been restored what Adam lost complete Authority Dominion the scripture says you were made to rule you were given power over all things you're a master of circumstance that's right amen you give me the circumstance God can't master either you've got something in the pipeline stopping that Revelation for that specific circumstance that you think no this is too much for God God don't care about this I've been struggling with this for so long the spirit's been battling me I've been fighting with it I don't know how to get past it it's so easy to minister to somebody else about the things of the lord it's so easy to tell somebody just have faith in God just trust in God he'll answer to you he'll give you what your heart desires that's easy but when it really comes down to you see what you're really saying is man have faith in God in the back of your mind you're saying Lord don't bring that in my doorstep I just I just have enough for him for me to tell him and let him know what he needs to do but the moment it comes to do to you now now you're stepping back lord I I don't I don't know what to do how do how do I figure this out well what do I need to exhaust okay I need to do this I need to do that I need to do this I need to do that that's not the authority that was promised it wasn't an I need to do it's this is going to happen am I hope this takes place no no no no I don't hope I know it'll happen I may not know when or how but I believe because I've been given Authority that anything that I speak has to come by come on now regardless of the circumstance that you see yes regardless of the mockers regardless of all the different situations if Christ said he's given you Authority you're his son you're heir to All Things how could you be air to all things but beat yourself up every two minutes you know what I I I'm not air to all things I'm just you know last last last week you know I made a mistake man you know just you know just before coming here you know I made a mistake man I I was talking bad about that person I shouldn't have been doing that man I'm not going to pray why come to church it's pointless you see the condition I'm in how is God going to speak to me how's God going to tell me something how's he going to use me when did God ask for your condition to be the cause am his will will come to pass in spite of you regardless of you our problem is we work too much in the Physical Realm we see too much 1+ 1 equals 2 in the kingdom of God 1 plus 1 is not to for a day to God is but a thousand years so now you do your math and let God do his math he truly is the god of impossible math when situations seem like they can't be figured out when circumstances feel like there's no answer to them when it seems that your strength has run out that's a time to thank God when you can't do it anymore praise him when you can't figure it out anymore praise him when you don't have the strength to get past it praise him why are you praising himh in my weakness his strength is made perfect not you know what Lord I I bench 300 pounds you know I can I can really move anything I that's not the kind of strength God's looking for yes he don't need your help he he doesn't need your opinion uhhuh he doesn't need what you think all he needs is a son that'll say Lord you said now I may not understand how I may not understand why but you said and if you said it we we are Abraham's Royal seed we have that same silly faith that Abraham had that patient Faith years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years can go by you could be asking for the same thing and it may seem like it's never coming but my God you don't see what's working on the spiritual side you only see what's happening on this side but if for one moment the Lord could give us a glimpse of what's happening on that side of things did he not say there's more with you than there are with them did he not say greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if Christ has said it then where's your faith yes amen he spoke it believe it whatever doubts in your way get it out it doesn't belong you were made a son amen not a stepson you are a direct son because you were in his mind in the beginning you couldn't be a son unless you were here with him in the beginning Hallelujah brother Brandon would say in the door to a heart I want to open my heart my door of faith I want you to come in and take possession I want you to open my eyes oh Lord I have said in the meetings I've heard brother brandom and many of ministers talk about you being the same yesterday today and forever and I've tried hard to believe that I've really seen your power come and unfold the secrets of the heart I've seen you speak through your servant to absolutely strange people and would know who they were the sins that they were doing the sickness that was in their bodies and I've seen you healed them from all thy blindness sickness and Sanity and have set them free and somehow I've kept my own little Door of Faith closed God be merciful to me tonight say open the door of my faith would them people raise their hands to God open my door Lord God Bless you that's right God bless you open my door Faith Lord I open it to you come in be Lord be ruler take me as I am I'm no good we've come to the same conclusion you're no good I'm no good we're all no good but he but he in spite of your no goodness he said manew you were a Troublesome one but I want you Dave you were a Troublesome one but I I want you Chris back there crispy Critter I want you CU oh no you don't know the kind of life that I live I was so terrible you know I I I just all the iniquities and stuff that I I did you don't understand I'm just God can't do nothing with me praise God that's the kind of man God can use when you realize you can't do anything think of Moses come on put yourself in issue you've been placed in Egypt you've risen now you're a general in the greatest army that ever lived science would say or history you have the power the the ability the strategy that when you're told you're the deliverer wait you've probably heard brother brandom say this the children of Israel outnumbered the Egyptians they accepted the oppression that they were in and therefore it made them weak the only Power the devil has is your belief in him if you don't believe him he can't give you anything part of it is you accepting it oh you go to the doctor and say oh brother you've got this disease well I guess I got it you received it that's right that's true I I I want that different kind of faith I want that one when the circumstances seem impossible like my head's going to be chopped off that kind of faith if God you don't do nothing it's the end of me and to be able to stand boldly and say Lord regardless of this situ father I know I know you will deliver me here Moses is is is raised there he has all this idea he has all these he has everything at his disposal he could infiltrate from within he was one of the highest ranking members in the Egypt in Egypt yet God didn't use any of that he tried it his way No Moses it's still you I don't need you I need me in you he waited till he got old right where he couldn't do nothing for himself gave him a stick that's an old person now he said okay Moses go deliver my people you couldn't have done this like 30 40 years ago like when I had all the youth and strength and the power I could move mountains back then now I'm I'm old I'm big and my my shoulders are kind of stooped why would you use me now there's no miracle there's no mystery in the ability of you to come up with an answer but there is a miracle and a power when a son sees Hallelujah when brother Brenham is describing gifts and and and so forth in the church he he puts forth the scenario he says imagine you the PE the people with gifts come together they come with a a word from the Lord and the word says a brother will come forth in the aisle he'll be dressed like this and he'll be prayed for and when you see that you'll know that I am the Lord thy God and and it's written and brother brandom says it before the service begins and then that person comes forth he's drawing an example that person comes forth and now when everybody sees that do you understand the odds of a random person being described how they look what they'll be dressed in what they'll do their action everything to the tea not missing when you see that what it does in you the believer it raises your faith and all that Faith raising is for is for you to then take the word and say Lord if you can do it then Lord you can come in my circumstance and you can have your way in my situation we're talking about the unclogging of pipes God made you an all powerful being amen amen see Satan wanted to exalt himself above you he said above the Stars the prophet would say the stars are the sons of God here you are the devil wanted to raise himself a little bit higher than you but for you God said you know I'm not offended if my son has my power I'm not offended if my son has my authority I'm not offended that when my son speaks is as good as me speaking I'm not offended by that we need to start operating in that realm get out of this realm for a moment and let God do something for you in the Supernatural realm brother Brandon would say in the sermon the fundamental foundations of Faith paragraph 19 now what are we anyhow how did we get here did you ever think of those things along those lines we are human beings what made us human human beings what made us different from anything else on the earth brother clears his throat pardon me as human beings no matter what a state a man is in he's yet a Son of God no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he's a fallen son but yet he's a son God is his Creator God is his maker God has bought him with a price he may never reconcile himself to that he may never accept it it may never do him any good but yet he is a son and she is a daughter and what did God put man here for now we could spend much time on these thoughts but we won't we just give a basic thought here for the night then we'll go to praying for the sake because perhaps ministers has already spoke and so forth now God when he made man in the beginning I want us to really focus on this he made him Superior to anything on Earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on Earth to control everything he controlled animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything jump down to 35 when they could get rid of sin this this is in uh the sermon Dr Moses preached in 55414 he preaches this after he the next day after he preaches the the fundamental foundations for Faith and remember God God made you all powerful he made you to have dominion over everything to have jurisdiction over everything a master of circumstance keep those in your mind we're speaking of things that clog the pipe brother Brandon would say when they could get rid of sin paragraph 35 you've got to get healing oh my that makes the Methodist feel good doesn't it yes sir look get rid of the cause and you get the Cure already drawing interest and if God In His Infinite mind for knowing that hundreds of years later that Jesus would die on a cross and made sin for us be crucified and let Israel be healed by the phenomenal before Christ was crucified how much more will he after Christ is crucified if that was the type how much more by the antitype how much greater program have we today than what Moses had and yet when Moses come out of the Wilderness there wasn't a feeble one among them 40 years Dr Moses I imagine if there's doctor here tonight you'd like to have some of his prescription how many would like to have his prescription Hallelujah LED 2 million people how many babies is bornn every night in two million people how many old people how many cripples how much sickness among them and Dr Moses took care of every one of them and brought them through without one f feeble one among them why doctor you can't even do a family that well think of it why Dr Moses had prescription would you like to see what he had for a prescription I'll show you let's look into a briefcase I am the Lord that Health thee that's all the prescription he needed I am the Lord that Health thee put that in the brief briefcase doctor I tell you your patients will get well I'm the Lord that Health thee if the mother was real sick with the baby I'm the Lord that Health thee if the Serpent's bit I the Lord that Health thee someone broke a leg I'm the Lord that Health Thee I say what about you what's your prescription that you have need of oh you're sick I'm the Lord that Health Thee the prescription is in the word yes amen you need a deliver the scripture says the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed amen well how do I know I'm free because he said so amen there's a simple formula here when God says something you put your peanut brain aside and you say Lord I'm taking you at your word because you said it I believe it yes Father I don't have to understand it but you said I'm free I'm free claim it maybe if you act free for a little bit you might get your freedom see the problem is God frees you and you keep acting like you're bound you keep acting like you're chained like a dead man no you've been set free shake off those Chains It's an illusion it's not real you weren't Shackled you weren't in handcuffs you weren't handicapped God has set you free amen who are what are you Bound by what are you Bound by tonight right now you take him at his word you've been made free because he said so it don't matter about me he said I'm [Applause] [Music] free oh Hallelujah come on now see the devil all he does is Bluffs that's all he does God says you're free he says well if you were really free then you wouldn't have done that well if you were really free then you wouldn't have said that well if you were really free you wouldn't have had that attitude Freedom wasn't based on you the scripture says if the son therefore shall make you make it personal if the son therefore shall make me bino free I'm free let the devil Bluff let him say what he will he's made me free well if I'm free I better start acting like it if I don't act like it it's your confession what are you confessing what are your action showing are you really free well act like it then take the token apply it in your life get that devil out of your life and let Christ have its way with [Music] you see the spirit quickens the word in you speak what you will it shall be given to you wake up do you know what power is being transmitted to you what Authority is being placed in your hands you have the right if you woke up with a headache say Satan get thee behind I don't have it you have a right what's the circumstance Financial physical spiritual whatever name you know where you're at you know the secret sin oh no no don't don't get on that you know what you do when you're alone amen you know what you're watching amen you know what you say you don't think God sees see we think because you know it's just me nobody saw nobody saw that it was just me God sees am amen he sees all things you might be able to lie to everybody else but you can't lie to two people yourself and God it's it's the problem that man has you have to first disbelieve the truth before you accept the lie that's right but friends I'm I'm not here to dwell on on on the secret sin I'm here to tell you even in the midst of that secret you can get alone quiet with the Lord for a moment and he'll come right down there in that closet he'll come right there where you no Lord not here cuz then you'll know me you'll see for me for who I am Christ will come right in there and will free you from every devil Every Lie every sin every Temptation there's nothing too strong for my God we need Sons and Daughters yes to say Lord I'm taking your weapon and I'm going to speak the word yes and when I speak it it'll come to pass because it's your word and you are your word so if your you you understand if you doubt God's word you're doubting Christ that's right not the letter you're doubting Christ the person himself because he is one with his word amen you are his word amen so what do you think happens when you doubt you that's right when you doubt what he said of you what he made you who are you doubting you don't think the god that washed over two million people is watching over you he watched over that Prophet with all the things that went through in his life all the battles he had to face the circumstances the struggles the fights this message came at a cost and don't think living by it ain't coming at a cost it'll cost you something it'll cost you something but I have an assurance whatever it cost you in my father's house for many mansions it's worth the price it'll cost your life it'll cost your Ambitions it'll cost your goals that's right your perceptions your own ideas your way of living it'll cost you everything the closer you draw to the Lord the more the cost oh i' I've just started in this little small spot I've I've been baptized and and so forth and whatnot and then here that Devil comes and says well you know brother brandom said baptism don't save you it don't do nothing for you it's the beginning of something it may not be the thing that saves you but it starts the process because a son fulfills the word so as long as I know I'm walking in the word I will I will obtain that end goal brother brandom says in the sermon fundamentals of Faith paragraph 26 he says now through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again and Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had a worry he never had a heartache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father and just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is heir of all things paragraph 29 now when man fell he lost this now what he lost in the fall Christ as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to that Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall now the thing of it is since he's restored man back to this place man in the fall this is you and I has lost his conscience of what the father put him here on Earth to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets of Faith have been clogged up with business Affair home life domestic things it's all become so clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for you see why it's important to unclog the things that are standing in the way we always speak about how we as sons and daughters are living beneath our means we talk about the great things that our Prophet did he spoke squirrels appeared he spoke to the storm it went back and we Marvel oh my what an amazing feat wow if only I was a prophet I could do the same thing who lied to you who lied to us to let us think that those things that we saw were only given to that office did we not just read where he said you have been given the authority Adam had you can speak to the storm it'll move you can speak to a bull amen you can pray for a pum amen you can speak a fish back to life you can do all those things see our problem is we Marvel at all the things that he did and fail to see how much stuff had to be unclogged from his life in order for that to be produced you understand it came at a cost the Lord sent him to go preach somewhere he listened to his mother-in-law and it cost him a lot but if God wants you to be a son and he wants you to know the authority my brothers and sisters he will take whatever is necessary to get you to that point that you completely submit everything to him the Lord told them don't go to Africa he didn't listen he went and he got into meeba he had to learn obedience he had to learn to unclog himself there was too much as he would say William bram's biggest enemy is William brandham he had to learn to get himself out the way to stop thinking small Lord you know I I really need for you know I want this sickness that I've been fighting for four or five years to be healed but rather than heal that just my finger hurts can you heal that no maybe that's too much maybe that's too much maybe that's too much I have this one gray hair up here could you just remove that from me why not ask for the big things do we not serve a big God do we not serve serve a powerful God what has clogged your faith the channels of your faith to make you think that as a son you can only ask for crumbs on the table you have right to everything on the table amen the table's been laid and dressed for you don't be your own problem though as as long as you're in this flesh you'll have to war against yourself but anytime the devil Bluffs and just stands himself up sit him back down the Lord play his position if you didn't know is under your feet we've settled that he belongs under your feet so if he's under your feet what's stopping you from the feet up right if you stomp on him every single day how do you stomp on him I pray and read my Bible every day I feed on the tapes I get one with a word because that's when I'll become the word the more I feed the more I become till eventually you become a son with full Authority and you've got nothing clogging your channels how do you expect how do we the Lord was was dealing with me Ben how do you expect to see a Rapture your faith is clogged you can barely have faith for your basic needs how are you going to have faith for Rapture you mean my body will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you mean if I have a short limb that limb will grow back cuz there's no imperfection in glory these are the kind of things the faith God wanted you as a son to have is supposed to produce yes we need to get the distractions out they don't benefit you they don't help us they hinder you says in fundamental of Faith paragraph 32 if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he has designed designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural workings of God Outlets through Gifts of spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and Gifts of healing and all these other different gifts its Outlets that God lets out his power and lets out his Revelation to the people not as an individual so much but as a unit we're all together one great body of believers how do we get into this body this Mystic body of the Lord Jesus by one Spirit we're all baptized into this body now Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate and sends a cancer now no notice the order Satan sends a cancer whatever it is you're battling you place it there the man recognized it and receives it Satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more ought god with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it how much more ought God through the children to make his laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power of gifts manifestations of the Spirit the law of sin and death Works in people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come into us to set us free from those things come on friends so I believe this with all my hearten now I believe this all my heart I believe that we're nearing the age that when people are going to recognize these things that we had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it has set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that what you need is to revolt yes against that old thinking you need to revolt against that old man God made you more than that he called you to be more than that oh Hallelujah we are those people that are recognizing how do you recognize he said the Satan sends a cancer the man recognizes it and receives it now think about this God sends a messenger all right the people recognize it and they receive it you can't receive something you don't listen to on you can't recognize something you don't spend time with that's right did he not say that the this bride had to be able to see the two Spirits within the framework of the church discern it withand come on Friends the Lord's trying to take us somewhere we got to unclog whatever it is you need he's here tonight he'll unclog it he'll remove it if it's you that's in the way he'll do whatever he needs to we've got example after example after example of God setting the man out of the way so that he might be able to use them Lord if I am in your way get rid of me let it be you that they see Let It Be you that speaks they've had enough of been that's right I want to so transmit the light of God that you don't see me but you see him that's the intention God had Bram says in paragraph 39 now if we could throw oursel completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in US them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as the natural thing does just the same thing but we were first created for that purpose to control see the devil wants to pervert that and tell you that this is what you were made for this is what you were supposed to be you were supposed to always struggle you were supposed to always battle diseases battle sickness battle trials the devil wants you to attribute this life that has a Time clock on it an expiration date and he wants you to identify yourself with it well the moment you identify yourself with it now you have an expiration date but you've been made an eternal being you dropped in this little hickey of time you're here but you're not of this world so you can't operate according to the things of this world see when Adam was there in the beginning he operated on that true six sense he was so engulfed in it his five senses were useless the devil could not he couldn't touch him because he was 100% Faith but when he fell now he started to rely on himself I I've got to dress myself i' I've got to hide myself I've man I've done wrong I've done wrong I I've and the Lord comes Adam Adam Where Art Thou come on Friends what about us what about us are we dressing ourselves what we think is a Christian Life when in fact it's just religion are we dressing oursel as sons of God if you're a son act like it talk like it walk like it be about it that's right Jesus said the scripture says but we first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God now Jesus said if this is the formula if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if ye abide in me and my words abide in you paragraph 43 it says before I get there there's there's something that just came into my head brother brandom says in the sermon trying to find it paragraph 37 of Dr Moses 55114 could you pull that up for me I don't see it here in my notes this brother bandam says and if he did that under that Covenant how much greater is that Covenant today if he did that under that type what will he do Under the anti type you know what I begin to believe Christians friends that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest time the world has ever witnessed I just believe that all the lines are getting unclogged you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines theologies and kinds of stuff unbelief I want us to focus on this part it's it's been handed down from generation to generation oh there's no such a thing as healing the days of Miracles has passed we just automatically believe that you see the power of generational things that are passed on they have such a power and effect over you that when it's spoken you just believe it if you grew up in a home where what the prophet said was always questioned what he said was always doubted was always explained be real careful you can pass that trait down to your kid and he then when he grows sees the word and says mom always question that one dad didn't quite believe that one if we're not careful we start attaching ourselves to things we ought not to be attaching ourselves with but thank God for the holy ghost that whatever generational curse is running in your family when you receive the Holy Ghost it kills that line in that moment it says you're not continuing anymore that's right we got to be real careful with the things we pass on be real careful with the things we let hold and bind us break free from those generational things who's going to be the Son and the daughter to say I'm standing against that Spirit of doubt in my family I'm standing against that anxiety Spirit I'm standing against the suicidal Spirit the cancer Spirit oh the doctor says it runs in my family it's been on for years and years and years so what now what now so it runs okay what are you going to do about it now it is written yeah amen that's right break past the generational curses God's trying to show you something brother Bram says back in the fun the fundamental foundations for Faith paragraph 43 so everything that God has spoken his word received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise it is God will do it he's obligated to it then if ye abide in me and my word abide in you then ye have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatever God's word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God Jesus said whatever you ask in the father in my name that will I do do you realize what that means you realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through me oh Hallelujah that makes me excited so you know what that does it eliminates your condition because when a son gets down to pray God don't see you he sees him oh Lord I I'm I'm I'm I'm the worst of them all hallelujah hallelujah amen he sees a son in need amen he sees a a son Desiring something and the littlest desire to serve God is greater than any desire the devil can put on his son or daughter of God his desire has got no effect on you but you keep your eyes stayed on him and you trust that no matter the circumstance no matter what you've done unclog the Avenues of Faith get free a little while let that turn that water pressure all the way up let that water just gush right through clean up that entire system just for a moment let loose and let God have his way oh when that kind of a son recognizes who he is and he says I've got the Waters of everlasting life flowing through me he can do anything he can do anything he's not hindered Hallelujah let it flow through me Lord but says and then I've got to receive what I ask for because he said it and it's God's Own word it can't do nothing else but produce just what it said oh my goodness that settles me amen he'll have to produce what he said through me if he's got to drag me Lord I'm ready to be dragged whatever he's got to do that word will not return void that's right he spoke it he's Duty bound to watch over that word because that word is him if that word doesn't come to pass then you're saying that God doesn't keep his word but God said I am the Lord and I change it not he's the same yesterday today and forever if he did it then he'll do it today and he'll continue to do it forever more right so then we believe that and this is the confidence we have in God that we get what we ask for for he's God and cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word so then if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given unto you isn't that simple Faith created we was made for that purpose then through the fall why we was taken away from it and then in Redemption we was brought back to it again brother says notice this and the only thing to hinder the human race today from being Superior in controlling like they did in the beginning is because that the power lines of God made in the human being has been clogged up I need the great plumber I need him to come sometimes I say this reverently sometimes Theology and Church doctrines have clogged up your faith line clogged up your lines till you have been taught that those things can't be and that puts a block in the way you get somebody crazy enough to ask God for the craziest thing you've ever heard and then you with like doubting Thomas you start going God ain't gonna give him that he just asked what how much yeah God ain't doing that did he ask ask you if he was going to do it according to what you thought on no no no he's asking for too much he's asking for too much or God's got too much that's why he's asking a son recognizes whatever I ask my dad for he'll give me amen that's right whatever I ask my father for who has all wealth who has all blessings who has all power whatever I ask for as a son he'll give it to me Lord help me to ask more and now if the natural laws of God per 53 which is electricity and things once handed down in the right capacity can do those things how much more could the power of the Holy Ghost once passing through the human heart by faith what it could do now God has not promised us electricity only that knowledge shall increase but look what the Holy Spirit has promised to the Believers today and then we look back to see that God put electricity here for a certain thing and science is moving into the field of science and bringing it out but we as Christians we have become too clogged up we just can't understand what we think about the doctor said I can't get well as long as you think that then you're not thinking God's thoughts you're you can't do it if you say well I'm going to die the doctor said I was going to die all regards to the doctor that's the best of his knowledge if he said he's going to die humanly speaking I would believe the same thing but by the word I don't believe it am that's right because he promised me whatever I ask the father in his name name could be granted and I believe that's true now if God could just clear that little Channel out and run that energy out to that place then something is going to happen the whole body is set together to operate and as Life Begins just as sure as it takes every member of the body to operate and give me life so does it take every member of the body of Christ to operate together to give it life you know what I mean oh what a service it'll be when every single son and daughter of God comes to the recognition that there's nothing standing in your way for what you have need of what kind of a service would that be I wonder if he wouldn't just Rapture right out of here but we get so clogged up we get so oppressed we get so affected we so things in our life stop the Avenues and channels of God from producing what he already said it had to produce he said it had to be that way but we get in the way with what we think has to be get out of the we and get in him if you're in him all things are made possible to them that are in Christ Jesus paragraph 59 now I believe that a lot of times in the wiring up of God's spiritual body on Earth we let some plumbers in I say that reverently instead of electrician but it's the plumbing is all right but we can't save them by water you know that's right and that's a big thing for a Baptist to say but that's true that's true as if the body is correctly wired up and the Father in Heaven Hallelujah turns the big master switch on something is going to rise up that's right that's if the body is if the building is properly wired see here you have God the great electrician the master plumber you're waiting for the wiring to be just right was it not said that it's been given to her to Adorn herself andine linen which is righteousness when you get adorned with the right thing and you get properly wired and you've got your Avenues of Faith completely cleaned and the master turns on that switch something has to rise up out of you because there's nothing stopping it you'll sit in a powerful service you'll people jump jumping here jumping there and so forth and the word coming forth and it's a beautiful wonderful time and you're there in the midst of everything and you're so clogged up that you look and you start saying why is he jumping why is he shouting why is he praising why is he acting the way he's acting rather than focusing on what God had in store for you and what God was trying to speak to you you are so wound up in your own channel of how God's supposed to come of how God supposed to do things that you don't give the spirit enough room I heard a prophet say that God will do whatever it takes to get his son to believe yes so if you think it needs to be this I serve a God that says that's my son that's what he wants I'm come in that way and he receives the Revelation that goes beyond deeper than just the shout deeper than just jumping deeper than just this and that when you receive that Revelation it's a reality nothing can move you yes amen unclog the channel and let God put in your life what he has need of for the purpose in which he put you on Earth for it's not I hate the question I always get ask this question what do you want to do when you grow up if you personally I'd rather the Rapture be tomorrow or right now than figure out what I'mma do this world you're constantly chasing something that's true you're constantly running by behind something you got all the money in the world more problems going to come things going to cost a whole lot more oh but he's got millions in the bank yeah but you got hundreds of thousand worth of expenses just cuz you get more don't make the life easier you got to be smart with that which you have in the little amount that it is and if the Lord blesses it keep the same mindset oh but that's in the financial realm okay spiritually if all God gave you was the ability to get on your knees and pray you do that to the best of your ability amen if there's anybody that gets on their knees and pray Let It Be You Yes say there need somebody get on their knees Lord I'm here let me be one that gets on my knees and pray if all you can do is raise your little hand just a little bit for a sign of Faith you do that to the best of your ability you watch you stay faithful with the little bit he's got you one of these days it may not be the way you expected it it may not be the way you thought it but he expands that which he gave you and you start realizing wait a minute though I have little if I got him I got everything that's the key if I've got him it don't matter what I see in my pocket it don't matter what I see around me I've got him he works The Impossible he moves mountains anything I have need of he has the power to make it come to [Applause] pass he says now if theology no he says if the building is properly wired back up in 60 a little bit if it's properly taught there's an importance in teaching and every fiber of our body being Lost In Christ and to his word alone now if you got theology if you've got some Doctrine if you got some Superstition if you got some unbelief you got something that stops up somewhere then that energy can never pull you through but when you get to a place where you're perfectly wired and the master electrician has oated by sealing it with the Holy Ghost the only thing is just to turn on that switch then and there will be a light show and that's right and ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid and we tonight as I was studying this and I read this I am the number one person who This concerns and we tonight ought to be ashamed of ourselves and honestly and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us how we represent him in this life he's depending on us you believe this messag do you believe this message will cause a Rapture for you do you believe you're a son how are you representing him where's that representation of Abraham where's that representation the word has to be seen in you in full Authority yes don't settle for anything less Lord if I ain't got the fith to bring anything that I desire to pass by speaking your word help me if the world is watching you be a son and you pout and you sigh and you cry and you whine my life's hard you don't understand it's tough month to month it's tough day to day I barely make it what whatever the circumstance aren't you a son act like it you don't like the circumstance change it amen speak the word you've been given thus sayith the Lord speak it what do you have need of bride what's the need speak it he's listening yes he's waiting for you to confess it yes you need to get past the idea that what I'm confessing I don't quite understand how it will ever come to pass get past that idea you'll never truly make a True Confession so long as you're still trying to figure out the channel in which it'll bring it to pass he never asked you to figure out the channel that's right amen just confess it yes and have unmoving faith that's right he's Duty bound to bring it to pass you talk about the last minute at the last moment God moving on the scene the thief at the cross when his life's almost at zero it'll be the end of him in that moment he lived his entire life incorrectly it took one moment of recognition of who he was in the presence of that he knew he could make such and ask he didn't come by the way of baptism and all the different steps he didn't come by that way he recognized something though yes he asked something big of God that's he said Lord we deserve this but you you don't deserve this remember me how what about me and you when it gets to that end point that last time when you think there's no hope no ability for it to happen do we recognize who we're in the presence of do we recognize who our father is the power you've been given speak the word nothing can stand in your way brother says in paragraph 66 I might not be able to get past all these quotes but try to find a place to close what did Christ redeem us for did you ever think what he redeemed us for why didn't he just make the atonement there's no need for giving them these Powers there's no need in making this man a Son of God there's no need of doing that I will just ask him to believe it and write his name in the book of heaven and that'll settle it sometimes I that's how we think Lord you honestly you could have just took my spirit out put your spirit in and just lived and then I had no conscience of anything and done it done just figured it out I don't want to have to do it I don't want to have to but he wants you to exercise that power he wants you to know you have power but he give us these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the holy spirit in St John 15 he said I am the vine and ye are the branches do you know the vine can't bear fruit although the fruit is in the vine but the fruit cannot be brought forth from the vine it has to have the branch Branch to Bear the fruit and you are the branches now the Vine with all of its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy Lord help us now God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit and now if he's depending on you let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and recognize us and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts Revival has come brother Brandon would say the Holy Spirit paragraph 74 the holy spirit is the Healer if the musicians can come the holy spirit is here tonight to energize every life to do everything now we see what the basis of Divine Healing we'll have to draw this to a close just because time won't let us speak much longer we've got to bring it to a close now there's something that's wrong and in the beginning God created you to be master of every circumstance and that's the origin that's authentic that's God's word there was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it that's what you were created for then sin came along through the fall and blinded the eyes of it and now Jesus come along and redeemed it back and now the father gives you the Holy Spirit to lead you and guide you giving you all these Divine promises teachers humbly saying it as I love every manner woman that believes the name of the Lord Jesus see and I am not a de AB deor not to fuss I don't believe in that I believe in just preaching the word that's all and I believe that this is God's word and if this is God's word as I believe it to be I believe that he's obligated to answer for me every promise that's in the book if I meet his conditions and he SE heals me into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit which I believe is not fanaticism though we have had a lot of fanaticism with it but yet it's not fanaticism it is the truth and then God is obligated to his word to take care of his word he watches over it to perform it amen Church he's watching over us in order to perform what it is that he said that's right we need to unclog the pipes in our life we need to let Christ just have his way in our members get past any ideas or thoughts that we've had in the past of what it meant to live a Christian Life and recognize you cannot live a Christian Life hindered you need to be completely set free from anything that hinders you brother Bon preach God's word calls for total separation from unbelief do you know why you have to completely separate from unbelief in order to receive God's word because God's word is a seed that produces life and it can't produce the life in you if there's unbelief present clean your circle maybe your channels that are clogged is not something in you maybe you're all right maybe all your channels were clear but the circle around you is not one that God can minister to you that God can speak to you and have his way with you don't just live a Christian Life in church but go out of here and live the Christian Life unclogged freed from your mind free from your thinking let's stand [Applause] we we always hear the story of the mother Eagle you you can play something sister Julia of the mother eagle and the little Eagle in the chicken coat and how here he is going throughout life thinking he's a chicken but something just didn't sit right with [Music] him he looked at his circumstances says man this this isn't me this isn't who I am I wasn't made to eat worms I wasn't made to eat these things when I look up in the heavens I see someplace where my heart longs to be I long to soar I long to fly I long to be at one with the heavens but I'm here yet something inside of me says there's something more and that was us here in this world Bound by the things of this world and the circumstances of this world but then God sent a prophet to Remind You and I of what Authority was given to us of what right we had as a son to live by that we were never meant to be hindered we were meant to soar in the heavens nothing could stand in our way master of our own [Music] circumstances if you would like to receive the recognition and receive what it is God has given to Us in this hour lift your hands to the Lord by you doing that you're defying the laws of gravity and you're making a move for the Lord and he's Duty Bound by seeing that to come by your way come by your Pew and minister to you where you're at that Spirit of Doubt may be there right now in this moment trying to tell you this is just a workup this is just order it's more than that it's you saying Lord I'm taking you at your word Here I Am Lord have your way with me I want to be a son with power I want to be a daughter with full Authority oh it brings joy to my heart to know that you've made me to be powerful to be able to speak what I want and it come to pass gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord Jesus for the little words Lord that you spoken Lord and I pray Lord that it was a blessing to your people Lord Jesus father right now the hands are raised all around the building Lord [Music] Jesus father I can't make them realize who they are what Authority they've been given but you Lord when you give that revelation Lord Jesus it becomes a reality it tears down any thinking that was Prior Revelation changes the thinking of the mind it's a cellular change it's a makeup change one way I thought this way but then I realized I had all power to do anything father give these people that power Lord Jesus or give them the realization that they were made for that power get us out the way Lord Jesus let your glory fall Lord unclog our pipes Lord Jesus let the water go forth everywhere Lord clean out the places that aren't that you aren't welcome in Lord Jesus you are welcome in this place Lord Jesus you are the master of this Home Father I am your Dwelling Place Lord Jesus you made the choice to put your name with mine Lord Jesus our Prophet would say the devil cast his vote against you Jesus cast it for you now you have a choice in your hands Lord we want to cast our vote with you father for you are Eternal you are all powerful you are the reason for our existence the reason for our being father watch over us Lord Jesus help us Lord Jesus to be better Sons Lord Jesus father it pained my heart to know when your Prophet spoke and said how are you representing him that I couldn't help but see that I wouldn't representing you Lord instead I was representing me a finite person that's limited with what he can do but father if you could just give me the the grace Lord and the help Lord Jesus that I might be an example Lord Jesus that we might be Sons and Daughters Lord that the world can look forth and say these are a people that don't let circumstances control how they are that don't let situations dictate how they speak and how they walk and their atmosphere father these are sons that can create any atmosphere in the midst of a trial that's what you gave us father and with the right atmosphere the seed can grow father change our atmospheres Lord Jesus have your way father we thank you tonight we ask these things in your precious wonderful and holy name amen [Music] let's just sing that you hold my moment you call my ring seed

believe the word of God when it comes and it's to awaken that Consciousness that Adam lost and so we can be called back to realize that we are Sons and Daughters of God is to awaken you to to take that Amnesia away to constantly call you by your real name and by your real identity so you can recognize let me say this we were called to live by faith and not by side you know butam says that a Believer we have untapped resour ources untapped resources we were we were those that were called to bring things that don't exist into existence and not to live just by sight and you know it's say there's only two Powers you know if if all we operate by is the natural and by what we see and there's the power of doubt and it's there and you're only going to produce doubt everything you're going to do well you know that's what I thought it's going to happen and that's what you know you do and it produces negative and you believe it and it produces more negative oh but if you can look at the positive if you can look at Faith tonight and say there's a power of Faith that's given to a Believer then when things are not going the way they're supposed to I have the power to change them I'm not stuck I have been given the word of God to live by oh my if we could just come with our Consciousness and say Lord help my unbelief I I see these things going the way they are going and and your word says that if I believe this is what's going to happen help my unbelieve tonight just come by my way let my faith be nzed by the power of faith that you can bring into existence your word into my life and I believe he's here to do that we just we just he just our brother just preached it and we read it as the prophet was saying he's there to energize Us by faith and to bring us to believe his word and live by the word and have the word produce the word in us that word coming out of us and producing what he promised will produce you think about it if the the world that we live in Satan can take Man by its knowledge and and create the science out there that we look and the great invention that man has done how much more by faith faith God is wanting to make his word a reality to us he's wanting to call us to say don't look at the things of the world don't don't be despaired don't look at it and think you are stuck by the things you're looking at look into the word this is your promise this is what you've been called to live by this is what you've been called to change the circumstances by to say sickness at my is at my door I don't accept it I accept the word and the word will come and stand behind that and it will produce healing for you amen amen if you need a prayer tonight you could just come and we'll pray for you it's the same God every time he's here to make his
