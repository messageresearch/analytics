be with us tonight and may the joy of the Lord be our portion we ask it in the precious name of of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen amen God bless you may be seated so I I felt that uh next uh Sunday night I'd throw myself a birthday party H that way you can be sure that uh you're not forgotten no but what we I I just uh you know I I kind of like that scripture that always touched me so much is that the Lord would rather see you love one another than even himself so we just and and I should say it like this only those that are here tonight are invited that's the way to do it isn't it no but so what we'll do is we'll just maybe start somewhere around 4:00 and we'll just have a dinner barbecue uh some ribs and some chicken and some sausage and some sliced beef and sounds terrible no we we really uh would trust that it all come out so we we'll do that next Sunday and I don't need any shirts I don't need socks I don't need pants I don't need nothing in fact I think I'll bring stuff and you could take it out of my closet and everything so uh just if you if you just come and have a good time love one another and just Fellowship one to another that would be great and someone said well isn't that awful close to have barbecue for our meetings and I said man that's a full three weeks away anybody in Texas eats barbecue at least every other week so we should be fine so uh we hope yall can be be there and uh and certainly enjoyed that uh thank you all for coming out to um sister janette's uh um I don't know what you call it we would call it in my day awake you know basically is what it was but uh I was fellowship with some of the brothers and so you know these are all the people were there from Sister janette's life the way she grew up well five years ago she got ConEd converted to this message you know what I mean and so you know when we walked in then all of a sudden she saw all her Associates you know and you could see the eyeballs rolling brother Tim said man you walked in there and the eyeballs were just rolling you know look oh it's those kind of people you know all long hair and dresses and and everything but aren't you glad you're one of them amen and and I I just thought I I just thought that is just so uh wonderful that uh uh those you know that we were there for her and and so they know one life but we know another because that's what we have we have a transforming God he takes something that's one way and he makes it into something else you know the greator you know the great transition of God from one thing to something else and and that trans transition has a path and people can't understand it and you meet people along the way they see you in a certain time of your life you know and that's what they remember you as and then they'll hold that image of you in your mind their mind you know what I mean they just think this is the way that you are but you know we don't care what people think we are we want to become what he said that we could be and so that's what we're are pressing the mark for so uh I I could look across the room and see that different people had different times different images different understanding and and uh I I I think that the best part about it is is we got the final picture you know we got what God had in mind you know of course they had a picture of her when she had her hair cut and then she never cut her hair you know what I mean the day that she heard about this message and we baptized her I think this morning I said at 8 uh five or something but she was like 82 she about 5 years ago and uh she never looked back and she'd always say to me oh I wish I had have known that sooner I wish I had have known that sooner you know but I I I I like the 11th Hour worker remember the 11th Hour worker picked the same fruit that everybody else picked and he got the same wage that every other and so I'm happy she got in on on the labor of the Lord and so God richly loves you and and I'm I'm sure that it's a blessing I want to fellowship tonight I uh every now and then I I just like to evangelize you know what I mean and uh and uh you know being a pastor is a j o but uh uh evangelizing man that's piece cake you know so uh every now and then you just want to preach so I'm just going to preach something off the top of my head and but from my heart you know what I mean you say oh you can't do that way I got scripture for it I took no thought of what I was going to say you know what I mean and that's in the Bible all right so uh uh if if you have any questions about what I preach talk to Billy you know he can figure it out and straighten it out so uh we just uh we just want to enjoy the Lord and and uh uh I know you're looking around and figuring that if this is a ice cream night or not but we got too too many so so so no we just we'll just Fellowship around the word of the Lord and uh I I I I heard now that little Natalie's birthday's coming up and and and I got to thinking she she's 16 years old I remember when she was no bigger in this box of Kleenex you know what I mean and the grace of God just bloomed her up into a big young lady amen so uh well you wouldn't believe it but Caleb bill was about half the size of this box of Kleenex he's a giant you know so don't tell me that God can't do the impossible amen he's a good God and we really love him amen let's go ahead and stand up and read a Bible story and uh just trust that the grace of God will uh just do you know Christians ought to be happy yes sir you know uh I know I know maybe the the message this morning was a little flat and a little straight but uh you know that's the way God made it he he made it so that you would hear from him and and not have secondhand Revelation that that's what hurts the church you know it's the the gospel because people didn't go to the Lord and get and hear it for themselves they they it's like you remember ever play that I guess they call that game charade you know where you talk to one person on one end and and you said you know the butcher barbecued the pig and then when you get down to the other end after it goes down it says the neighbor uh you know the butcher said his neighbor was a pig you know what I mean and it it gets all all me messed up you know what I mean so there's only one way that you can keep it straight is keep it straight for yourself because though we hear the same word God wants that word to have an effect on you personally and and it and then then he can reflect himself through you that's how he can use your personality your nature your being that you are the statue that you're in that he can use that because you're hearing from him directly and you're carrying out his instructions so let us read this little story here and I I I just like the end of this story because it's so different than what you normally would think would happen Okay so we want to hold that thought what we normally think would happen and so my little title is look to the Unseen and get an unseen answer so let us read it says here in the eth verse it says then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counil with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for H there the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the men of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was s troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them wil thou not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord O King but Elijah the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the the words that thou speaketh in thy bed chamber Hallelujah aren't you glad we had that kind of prophet amen Same Spirit Hallelujah and he said go and spy where he is that I might send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is is UN indan therefore sent he hither horses and chariots a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about amen God bless you let's go ahead and be seated we can finish the rest of the story and when the Servants of of of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host come pass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered he said fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them yes sir and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he might see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha and when they came down to him Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said Smite this people I pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elishah and Elisha said unto them there is not this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek but but he led them in to Samaria and and it came to pass when they were come un Samaria that elishah said Lord Open the Eyes of these men that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of Samaran and the king of Israel said unto Elijah when he saw them my father shall I smite them Smite shall I smite them and he answered Thou shalt not Smite them wouldest thou Smite Those whom thou Hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow but set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master and he prepared a great Provisions for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent sent them away and they went to their master so the bands of the syrians came no more to the land of Israel Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word amen what an unlikely outcome and you know that just not the way that we would think that something should uh come to pass you know what I mean here's your enemy they've been pursuing you and you would think shall we Smite him shall we Smite him you know he says no don't do that he said feed them set a feast out before him give them Provisions give them water and so what they ended up with if I could say it this way is they they look to an unseen God that's what they did now they looked to they looked to the Unseen and they got an unseen answer and what I mean is by an unseen answer uh we could we could uh say it this way you know is I I I never saw that coming in other words it wasn't something that you would think of doing or that you would P perceive to do you wouldn't sit back and say oh this is the logical thing to do so these guys want to kill you well make them stronger you know give them food uh make them comfortable why you wouldn't do that I mean it doesn't make no sense it doesn't make no uh have any logic to it it doesn't have any uh understandable outcome you you wouldn't think that that would be the outcome of you feeding your enemy that they would leave and never come no more but they got an unseen answer something that they would have never seen themselves something they wouldn't have perceived themselves something they wouldn't have understood the themselves they got an answer from God that was totally different they they could have said I would have never seen that coming but because they went to an unseen God they got an unseen answer and so you would think that you know if you wanted an answer and and you you wouldn't go to somebody that nobody sees right if you wanted a military answer you would go to the strategists you would go to the military man you would go to the general I mean that would be the place that you would go you wouldn't go to an unseen source that nobody would even think existed or what do you go to you go to a a doctor right or a counselor I mean these these are things that you could see these are logical places that you go to get answers these people make money uh having answers anwers you know you know you would think that a drug counselor is somebody that really wants to help you so you come in you say I'm a drug addict the first thing they say do you have insurance well you want to know right then you're going to find out that if you run out of money you ain't getting well in fact they charge you so much you want to go get use more drugs you know what I I mean because they're looking to something they can see and what if you look to the scene you're going to get an answer that you expect you know go to rehab talk to other drug people you know when you feel down call your counselor and we'll walk you through it you know but if you look to the Unseen you're going to get an answer that you wouldn't expect and so the people go to it you know jobs people people uh I don't know what they call people that you know uh if you need a job you know you go to A A head hunter or something right you go to somebody and say uh I need a job you know what I mean or and you want to get a reference and you want to go to indeed you know what I mean and a lot of indeed really should be I don't you know what I mean but you know that's the course that's that's the scene course you know what I mean you know that's what You' think you would do but they you wouldn't think someone would go to the Unseen God how are you going to get a job I'm I'm going to go pray to the Unseen god well you might get a job totally out of your field you might get a job you never did before you something might come up to you that you totally unexpected why because if you go to the Unseen Source the Unseen God you're going to see get an answer that's unseen by everybody else but it's real to you because that's the way that that God does things he it's not an answer we saw coming I never thought I'd be where I am today you know I just prayed about it and I went to this place and this guy come up to me and said you know well here I you you don't qualify you know you don't have no schooling you don't have no degrees you don't have nothing but uh if you go to class and you pass the test I'll hire you why that's ridiculous totally ridiculous but I like God he can do the most ridiculous things you you know what I mean he he make he he he just make a way he he'll do things that that you you wouldn't expect but if you take an expected route and if if you if you take a carnal route right then then you're going to end up with something that's carnal that makes sense that fits into things but God's not interested in fitting you into the world he's interested in being your God he's interested in doing for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think he's interested in proving to you that if you look to the supernatural he'll give you a supernatural answer if you look to the Unseen you'll get an answer that nobody else could see you that you never even saw it coming you didn't even know how it could work that way and whoever thought that feeding the enemy would keep them from ever coming that's an unseen answer but the reason it was unseen is because they sought an unseen Source they sought an unseen God and and we could go down through the scriptures and and and and and look at it we could look at Joshua we could we could look at the stories you know uh Joshua he he was they were going to get destroyed the enemy was coming they were they finally got the enemy to flee and they knew oh if they can regroup they'll they'll form back their ranks and they'll gain strength and it'll cost us casualties if we have to fight again so God Joshua looked up for an unseen to the Unseen and he got a unseen answer who would ever thought to stop the sun to stop the moon whatever you want to believe stop the Earth from spinning around it don't matter all I know is everything stopped why we wouldn't expect that that's not the answer that we would look for it's not even the answer that that we would we would come up with we would come up with well let's outflank them to the left or let's let's pursue this group and and then uh we'll send spies and we'll go from group to group we to come up with all kinds of ideas but it wouldn't be one that we've seen it wouldn't be one that we would see coming it wouldn't be one that we thought we could put our finger on no it would be something unseen in other words it would unseen to us I never I never saw that coming I never thought he'd do it that way I never thought that that would be my solution it'll it w it never will be something that you figure out because God likes being Supernatural for you he likes he likes doing things for you that are that are above the ordinary that are above what man can do God likes to set himself apart because his word calls for total separation for unbelief if you look to the Unseen then you want an unseen answer you want an answer that's identified in the Unseen I don't want a caral answer sir you know I don't want to go to the Lord and say Lord I really need deliverance and have God say take two asir and go to bed well anybody could tell me that but what happens he he spoke to your heart and said you you want to get rid of that headache why don't you read your Bible 10 more minutes every day what reading is what gives me a headache that's why I quit reading my Bible in the first place and God's answer is you ain't reading long enough pray for 10 minutes read your Bible 15 minutes longer your headache will go away well that's unseen I never saw that coming I wasn't expecting that answer but you know what the prophet of God said he said a son and daughter of God will know when God speaks my sheep hear my voice that's what he said you'll know it's God you don't have to worry whether it's God or not you're sheep you're called to hear the shepherd's voice if you look to him he will give you an answer it may not be the answer you expect and in fact it may be an answer that only works for you how many people that have I met in my life that are drinking wine for their stomach sake grab an old bottle one what are you doing oh the script says drink wine for your Su I'm tell you buddy that that wasn't for you I didn't see your name on the end of that scripture you know what I mean that that that wasn't that wasn't that scripture at all I mean where did you come up with that that's [Music] man-made and an unseen answer is not man-made if man could come up with it there's no new thing under the sun right it's just it's a just a Twist on the same old thing you you know what I mean but when God does something it gets [Music] unseen and it may be just for you but you know it's him and you're not you've heard his voice and you're not afraid to hack on it and that's what happens with God we you mean we're going to go feed these guys and they'll never come again and I think well they must have F them poison no he says you don't you don't kill your captive God captured them God's who brought them there God was who put them it blinded them and put them into the hand of their enemy and their enemy showed mercy and did the right thing and the result was one that they never would have expected and and the the the same with with Joshua I said he stops the sun we wouldn't have thought that you know Moses wouldn't have thought when he went down there and and and he felt pretty good about it and he went down there and threw his stick down and and all of a sudden his stick turns into a c he's standing there feeling pretty good and then they come up do the same thing and all he's got to do is look to the Unseen God you know and then you know his his serpent eats the other ones up he goes to Pharaoh you know and and so he goes to God God says send fleas send flies and you know I I enjoyed that movie The Ten Commandments because every time that Moses done something Pharaoh come up with some scientific answer to explain it all the way you know I just got to thinking about frogs man they had frogs everywhere in their beds in their cupboards I mean everything I mean frogs and Li and and oh that's the water turned oh that was the mines up there and the mines killed the fish and the fish bought dead fish bought the Flies and the frogs come out of the water to eat the Flies all figured out right they could they could they could they could see something in all that so all those things they they they could see how it happened you know what I mean oh that I can see that I could see that I could see that but when when Moses said let the death angel come through the camp that's something they didn't see coming that's something that they couldn't explain how the firstborn every first first born would die they didn't even see the type of Christ and the type of the sacrifice and they they were totally oblivious but what was it it was an unseen answer because they looked to the Unseen and they got something that they totally didn't expect they never saw that coming who had ever thought that putting Blood on the doorpost will keep the death angel away Whoever thought of putting the shed blood of the Lord Jesus on your life would keep the death angel away that by applying the blood you could have eternal life who ever thought of that that why man couldn't see that coming you could do all the works in all your life and it wouldn't Merit anything if you can do one thing for your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain but just to think the applied blood gives somebody eternal life Hallelujah that's unseen you can't figure that out but you look to the Unseen you'll get an unseen answer you know David you know he's facing a giant man giant looks at him and says I'm going to take this little stick and I'm going to take my Spear and I'm going to put you up on this little Branch over here and I'm going to have the birds eat your eyes out David looks to the Unseen he looks to you know and that's the thing he's unseen so they didn't know that David had a unseen power behind him he had a a force and and a power and and a a counselor and a prince of peace and a mighty God that was standing behind him that they couldn't see they couldn't see what was in David's Corner they couldn't see what David had on his side because he's the Unseen amen if if if if they would have seen that God they would have never uh even went up against Israel the prophet of God said if they would have seen who Jesus Christ really was they would have never crucified him but it's hid just think the Unseen source that you go to for every problem and every solution not everybody even knows he exists they might think he's somewhere but you have the you go to the Unseen God not unseen to you because your eyes have been open but it's unseen they they can't believe David's going to this Source David goes up and says I'm going to chop your head off son are you kidding me Saul even said get my armor on him you know some people you know they always want to downplay the Bible they said well Saul just was going to use David as a decoy and come up behind the back of them you know and he's going to send David out to distract the giant so they could kill everybody else God don't need no decoys amen he's got the power they just can't see it and so David sought the Unseen what did God tell him to do get five rocks take your sling shot and you're going to throw this rock up there and it's going to go through a guy's 2inch thick brass helmet and kill him where did that come from didn't come from military Scholars it didn't come from the book of how you defeat seven foot Giants by general you know whatever his name might be he didn't come from that it came from an unseen Source you seek the Unseen you'll get an unseen answer you'll get an answer that you never could have dreamed of you never never could have thought of that's our trouble is we try to think up the answers we got a program of how God can go about getting it done Lord I need this certain thing if you do this and you'd do that well if you're going to look to the Unseen don't look for a seen answer because he don't work God works in mysterious ways he W Works in ways Beyond finding out he Works in ways that you can't put your mind on how did this happen well I never saw it coming I never thought this could happen I never thought I could this would take place why because you went to the Unseen and you got an unseen answer do you know Daniel you know he prayed to the Unseen off in the line then he goes who knew what would happen he got an unseen answer because he looked to the Unseen who thought that the Lion's mouths would be I mean I I wouldn't have wrote the story that way I would have said they threw him in the den and Daniel with much learning looked around the cave and he saw a stick and he saw a stone and he he set it up that he set this trap up where he put the Stick Over The Stone and then he covered it up and when the lion come the stick come up and knocked them in the head and slay the lion now that's what we to come up with we had to come up with a seen answer so an answer that we could see an answer that we could comprehend but who would have ever thought that all of a sudden God was would stop the mouths of the lion that's not the end of the story he didn't stop the mouths of the lion he just stopped who the lions were going to eat he just changed the menu that's the only thing that happened amen they had ordered Daniel and they got fed some spies you see that that's all that happened the lions were still hungry but the Unseen God God changed the menu hey man there's something new for dinner boys and it ain't Daniel sure that's what that's what's so good about it if you look to the Unseen you're going to get an unseen answer an answer you never thought of an answer that you couldn't put your finger on an answer that you could have do it and he we heard this morning he wants to answer you he wants you to seek him he wants you to go to him and lay it before him and and and have them give you the answer that you would have never seen yourself and nobody else would have ever seen it you don't know what God does we just trust him you know I mean uh you know a Gideon I mean my goodness Whoever thought you I mean look those stories are unbelievable get torches and pots really who would have figured out which great General would have figured out that if you take a a torch and a pot and a trumpet that the Army would kill themselves you never want a pastor to come to the platform with a torch a pot and a trumpet because you know he's about tired of the congregation you know what I mean no you wouldn't have come up with that answer you would have never thought that it would happen that way would you no you wouldn't think that God would go to bat for you in a way that doesn't make any sense but he looked to the Unseen and he got an answer there was a route not not with a army of Israel not with 30,000 not with 10,000 with 300 that is an unseen answer one that nobody else would have come up with but the results were results that nobody would expect and that's the kind of God we serve this is the kind of place that he's wanting the Church to come up to he's wanting the church to climb that ladder of faith not with trying to look back over events and try to revive an answer from days gone by and we listened to that in the quote this morning he says they're always looking back to another age and going back no I'm going to examples but the examples are to tell you that that unseen answer exists for you in the day that we live in and in the circumstances that we are in now that we can get an unseen answer for today because he's the same yesterday today and forever and that's where he wants us to rise up to in faith that we too can look to the Unseen and then watch God do something a miracle that's just beyond anything we could have ever thought of happening totally unseen totally not prec comprehended because we look to the Unseen we got an unseen answer and the the answer will be something that nobody else has ever seen before I've never seen that before when that boy received his sight they said never before have we seen in is Israel that one that was B born blind receives this sight why because they had contacted the Unseen and that's what you have to see you have an unseen power that walks with you you have if God be for you who can be against you you have an unseen power that that that is standing behind you to fulfill your desires and the things that you look to him to do because he said come unto me and I won't cast you out he didn't say I'm going to give you an answer that you might be able to comprehend he says no I'm going to do for you something unseen something special just for you something tailored just for you just for your need and we've got God where he's he's he's we got him category these are the things he does well we got demons today that I don't know where they've come from but we've got a God that can defeat every single one of them how he does it he can do it any way he wants to and it'll be a way that we don't expect because God works in unexpected ways and I there's a message titled that I wish I could quote it better to you but it's it's God working in un un unexpected ways doing the UN accept unacceptable not acceptable unexpected ways that we never would expect that he would work he would work we just go down through you know Samson who ever thought that you could take a dried draw bone of a donkey and kill a thousand Philistines why he looked to the Unseen and he got an answer they didn't expect it here they come and here's a guy standing with a dried up old job on they thought lunatic that's what they thought this guy is a Luna kick he needs to be eliminated from the face of the Earth what we'll do is we'll stick a thousand Spears in him you know what I mean and we'll fill him so full of so many holes that there won't be enough of them left for anything and here he is you know that old long hair down there you know and in the scripture we think Samson is a great big guy he's a little skinny Ruddy guy you know what I mean if a little old skinny run guy there with a jobble come on boys I've looked to the Unseen and I got an answer in my hand that you would never expect you never saw this coming you would have never perceived that this would work you would never understand that this this is what's going to come to pass that I'm going to knock you all no they didn't expect them to pack a gate out the city too because that's the kind of God we serve and until we could start getting our hearts lifted up and know that if God before us who can be against us and start expecting the supernatural to come in ways that the world would never understand we're always going to be living short of the glory that God wants to manifest in us and that's what he says if you read in Hebrews 511 he talks about that God we're not don't despised we're not discouraged you know trotten down we we we don't have hope that Christ might be manifested in our bodies this is this is a great thing you know finally they cut his hair off they pluck his eyes out but they he got a hold of those pillars once more Lord once more amen they were mocking God you think they expected him to tear down that building which architect do you think designed a building that a blind guy could walk up and tear down what great Builder built a building that a little skinny blind runt could pull down tell me you think they hesitated twice to tie him up they were Mak a sport of him laughing me he said to those case just put me between the twoo pillars and he reached out and felt those pillars you think anybody was afraid you think they sat back and said oh you better watch out Samson's fixing to care tear down this whole building no you think they designed it that building that two pillars would take it down no we design buildings if you take a wall out the whole place don't fall apart you take take two studs out of a wall if it falls down you better look for termites no they built that thing right they built that thing strong it stood for years what was the problem they were dealing with the Unseen there was an unseen God that was going to give an unseen answer an answer they didn't expect that's right and he wasn't looking for a military host he wasn't looking look for an architect he didn't seek an architect how can I tear this building down he didn't go to the contractor and say where's the weak SP spot he didn't he didn't go to a seen Source he went to an unseen source and he got an unseen answer and he got results that nobody expected because he went to an unseen God Amen that's just the way it is you take Shadrach mhach Abednego amen who ever thought oh King live forever we wish you well they never ate his food and they never got sick they were honest Whoever thought three teenage boys would come to be running the Affairs of the king why why because they look to the Unseen they kept God's word they rose up into places that that we wouldn't even think was possible could you imagine the jealousy around them the criticism that everything's going right for them and they can't figure out why how come these boys pull this off they don't eat nothing but vegetables you know they don't eat all this they don't eat no pork they don't have bacon for breakast they don't they don't they don't take none of the King's food they they they they they wash everything you know they don't dress like everybody else and yet these guys are running the Affairs of the king and they they they were jealous I'd be jealous too and so they tried to trap him think of that if you don't bow down they trick the king got Daniel in the lion stand trick the king lit up the furnace seven times hotter in they go but they were looking for the Unseen God now if I would have wrote that story I would have wrote it like this opened the furnace doors and the clouds began to grow in the sky and the sky grew dark and all of a sudden you could feel the pitter patter of the rain and the ground began to flood and the water Rose quickly from all the ground and down the streets it came and it funnel right down into the doors of the furnace and quenched it I'd be a better Bible writer than those guys right or how about a wh went came down and sucked all the fire out and it blew out in the sky out into the sky oh yeah but you know something you could imagine that sure you could imagine a way it could happen but you would have never come up with them going into the fire and there being a fourth man in there already uh-uh no you couldn't have come up with that because that come from an unseen source that come from somebody that's looked to the Unseen and got an answer that was unseen to every other man except for them that believed and who was it behold there's one like the Son of God standing in the midst of the fire Hallelujah that's who we got standing with we got an unseen answer when we seek after an unseen God Amen and that's the kind of faith and security and hope that he wants the church to have I can look to the Supernatural and I'm not going to be able to understand what he's going to do and he doesn't have to tell me what he's going to do but he will do something that identifies himself as being the god of every circumstance in every situation so don't ever fear you need work look to the Unseen you need peace look to the Unseen don't look to the medicine cabinet you know what I mean don't F don't don't say oh doc I need some proac I need some valum I need this I need that you know if you look to the Unseen i g see if I can find this statement I think I'd like to read it it's pretty good he he says this he said Jesus died and he climbed in the ramp part hearts of glory and he said in he the heavens of Heavens there ain't nothing going to bother you His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me and he watches you then when there come if there should come a cyclone or something to disturb one of these little ones why she they had better not she would pick up you know he's talking about the Eagles he'd pick up uh up a coyote in her hand and she would paw and carry him to several thousand feet and just turn him loose he he he would disintegrate in the air nothing's going to bother them little ones she is going to see to it nothing's going to bother you don't be scared to take God at his word just relax and have faith and believe he watches over you he'll disintegrate anything that tries to bother you oh it might attack at you but it can't harm you for all things he permits it it could do nothing else for it works together for the good to them that love the Lord no harm can come to you amen it might look like it's going to harm you but there's an unseen force that walks with you there's an unseen power that Goliath didn't know David had that the king didn't know that Shadrach abish abedo that they didn't know that Daniel had it they didn't know that Gideon had it they didn't know that Samson had it they just didn't know if they would have they wouldn't have and that's the same way it is Satan don't believe you got an unseen power but we don't believe what he believes anyway why because he's a liar and there's no truth in him and if he don't believe it well that's all the better for us then our unseen power can work so tonight I I just think that God so wants you to have confidence that he'll take care of you that he'll disintegrate everything he'll take everything he'll work it together for the good he'll no matter how bad it hurt no matter how difficult it was it wouldn't happened unless the Unseen God allowed it and the result in the answer is going to be something that man never expected you know I think there's going to be a lot of people in heaven that if it was up to us we'd have put them in hell but God can do things that you can't even believe possible let's just look to the Unseen and leave everything else in his hands God bless you tonight amen [Applause] go amen let's all stand let's sing that song the Unseen hand amen it's one guiding all every step of the way amen I believe it's [Music] F oh there is an i
