your grace in jesus christ's name we pray amen my it's good to be in his presence amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we'll be reading out of second corinthians chapter three i want to take this opportunity to welcome my father and mother-in-law brother sal and sister margaret so good to have them with us this time they came they brought up they brought a motor home and a car outside so they might be here a while so that'd be all right with us though we're so glad to have you and uh just remember our pastor and sister leslie is there in california with my grandma we know that she's 99 i believe now that when when you get to 99 you start counting the quarter years and the half years my grandma's 99 and a half and so we're just so so thankful for the long life that god has given her so just remember them as their way i'm getting a little ring up here brothers if if we can bring down the monitors just to touch second corinthians chapter three we'll read verse three after six second corinthians chapter three says for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen you may have your seats i just want to pull from this reading of the scripture a thought this evening the revelation of the new covenant and here in verse 6 you find he says who hath also made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and as a subject i've been thinking along the lines of able ministers let's just also read out of hebrews chapter 10 verse 16. i know there's more than three or four bibles in the church feel free to turn put your sword to good use hebrews chapter 10 verse 16 it says this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more my i think we could just stop down right there for a little bit maybe think of the simplicity of the gospel but here the word is saying that that i'm going to make a covenant with you and it says the lord says that i will put my laws into your hearts this is something that he's going to do this isn't something you're going to do by how much you can study and how much you can learn and so how much you can listen and how much you can apply yourself but this is a covenant and this is something that god said that he is going to do he said santa learn i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more well i don't know about you that makes me happy when i hear god say look i'm not going to remember your sin and your iniquity anymore i don't know about you but i got a lot of sin and iniquities if you knew the place where i had come from if you knew all the things that i'd done before i met the lord but i want to tell you since i've met the lord i don't know about you but i've had a lot of sin and iniquity in my life even since i've been converted so when i look into the word where where the devil would try to condemn you and your own mind we're trying to condemn you oh and you can look into the word and you can see where it says in their sins and their iniquity will i remember no more i say what a covenant tonight what what a covenant god has made with his people that if you'll just plead the blood of jesus christ i will make a covenant with you i will put my words in your heart i will write them upon the table of your heart and your sin and your iniquity i will remember no more well we got something to be thankful about tonight if there was never another word set tonight maybe ought to just let that start to swirl around in your hearts a little bit that the king of glory the only one that could condemn you the only one that could take the letter of the word and say you're guilty but he took that letter of the word upon himself he said i'm going to make a new covenant with you and your sins and your iniquity i will remember no more oh hallelujah in verse 18 it says now where remissions of these is there is no more offering of sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus oh can somebody say by the blood of jesus when i see the blood come on we know we know in the old testament the death angel was going to come but god had sent a message with a prophet he said look there's only one way that you're going to escape the death angel there's only one way that you're going to escape judgment that's you got to take the blood of the lamb you've got to strike the the blood on the doorpost and when i see the blood i will pass over you i wonder if you've applied the blood tonight is there a people that have applied the blood of jesus christ to your life then i can say when judgment is passing over look we're living in a world that's just right for judgment all these plagues and all this sickness and everything that you're going on what is it it's judgment judgment has struck the world judgment has struck the land but there's a people by the grace of god and the covenant that he has given to him that have applied the blood of jesus christ and when that judgment comes oh you could just say just pass over my house because the blood of jesus christ has applied i've taken the blood of the sacrifice of the lamb of god it's been applied and your sin and your iniquity i will remember no more oh thank you jesus for the blood thank you for the blood thank you god for the blood that you shed thank you god for an everlasting covenant oh my when i see the blood what did jesus say he said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me i was dwelling on that a little bit he says if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me i want to say it like this if i be lifted up i'm going to draw you unto me if i be lifted up or i'm coming after you look he had you in his mind don't think that that calvary was some just random sacrifice that god veiled himself come down and took on sinful flesh created himself a body and became you to take our place and went to calvary and laid his life there and goes well i wonder who will believe on me i just wonder i wonder if there's going to be a people out there that that can actually catch what i've done that that was the great creator the great elohim the self-existing one and i condescended down and took on the form of man that i might have fellowship that i might take their sin and iniquities upon my shoulders that i would bear it to calvary and that i'd pay the price for your sin and oh would there be a people that would recognize that would there no the god knew who it was dying for he said if i'd be lifted up or i'm going to go draw you to me jackson where were you was it something you did but he said no if i be lifted up i'm going to draw jackson to me if i'll be lifted up i'm going to draw you to me brother if i'll be lifted up i'm going to draw darrian to me why because he had you on his mind when he went to calvary it wasn't by chance that there would be a people that would believe on him but he went to calvary for his pride oh this new covenant it wasn't it wasn't just for some people at random but he had you on his mind he was thinking about you oh if i be lifted up you know they took our lord they lifted him up on a roman cross oh there they tortured him and they beat him and they ran a spear into his side as i thought about that here here the the he came to his own and his own received him not and they lifted him up there on that on that cross and on calvary there he he died the most brutal death and i thought my if i be lifted up and something in my heart started to stir within me i thought my they might have raised you up there lord on a roman cross but oh god let me lift you up tonight lord let me let me lift you up with my life let me lift you up with my praise lord let me lift you up and give you the place that you deserve may i surrender my life to you may i surrender my all to you lord i want to lift you up i want to praise you i want to worship you i want to bring you glory lord let you be high and lifted up oh god oh god because he draw me unto him let me give him glory let me give him praise hallelujah let me worship him in spirit and in truth oh the father seek as such to worship him he's seeking such worship in those that will worship him in spirit and truth well there's only one group of people that can do that don't get quiet on me you might have heard it over and over but you know there's only one group of people that can worship him in spirit and in truth oh sure there's a lot of people out there that can get in the spirit they can run they can jump they can shout they can even have signs and wonders moving them but when they reject to the word they're void of truth god sent a message in this hour to restore truth this is a message of restoration and when god came down by divine promise and veiled himself and the prophet of the age the son of man ministry and brought truth they rejected it just like jesus coming to his own in his own received lot they rejected it but oh there's a little class of people uh a little a little persecuted group uh they're not accepted by the big religions they're not accepted by the big denominational systems out there because when the word came from when everybody else turned them down when everybody else rejected them there was a people that the word was written upon their heart that when that word started to go forth it was talking to you it was speaking to a seed you couldn't explain it you couldn't understand it but when everybody else was walking away from the message when everybody else thought you were crazy when everybody else thought you were a lunatic something inside of you said that's me i can identify with it it's calling me names my name i'll walk away from everything else and i'll follow this word why because that word has been written upon your heart not something that you did but it was something that god did verse 20 says by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god the prophet would say in the token testament means covenant the new testament means the new covenant the old testament was the old under the lamb that the life could not come back on the believer the new testament was the lamb of god and his life comes back on us oh thank god blood's life see blood is life in the new testament see life is from the blood of the lamb which means the new testament new covenant that god after those days will i write my laws upon the fleshly tables of their hearts see not upon the stony tables and a lamb's blood which you had to say yeah i'll make with the people and uh uh yeah i got blood over here now what does it say do but upon the tables of your heart see the spirit covenant will i make with the people and it displays his power this new covenant i'm going to write this upon your heart the spirit covenant will i make with this people and it displays his power john 14 12 says that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and it displays his power i want to tell you there's a power here tonight there is a power in the house of god tonight look there is a new covenant that god has made with his people i wonder if we'll just surrender to it tonight i wonder if we'll just start to understand and start to recognize and say oh god may you just break open your word to me may i catch a greater revelation of what this new covenant is why because there is a power tonight that has been released upon the people then i ask you what do we have need of tonight what is on your heart what is your question there's been a blood covenant made for you look we're not under we're not under the old testament and and rules and regulations and oh i got to do this i got to do this every month or the the priest i got to bring a lamb to the priest and he's going to he's going to slay the lamb and then whenever i do this you know whenever i see it every year i'm gonna have to come in i'm have to make no this lamb jesus christ was slain once and for all for you and it's a new covenant that i'll put my word in your heart and there comes with that that new covenant of power the same works that i did shall you do also now where are we looking for that to be manifested how many are looking for that to be manifested here tonight let's have a let's have an expectation for this new covenant for a revelation of what's god's done look yesterday's gone tomorrow is not guaranteed but you know what we have we got right now we got tonight so i i say it behooves us to take advantage of it maybe maybe your revelation is much further down the road and i commend you for that uh maybe your understanding of the message you have such a a greater depth than i do and i commend you for that but i wonder if we can just humble ourselves in the presence of god tonight and lay down all of our understanding lay down everything that we feel that we've acquired and start to recognize that we're in the presence of the king jesus christ has come and there is a power here tonight in this building that whatever you have need of whatever you would ask for you can have it in the name of jesus christ oh glory to god i want to say you you get out of it what you put into it i was driving down the road today and i i saw this old gentleman and my he must have been like 95 or something and i looked at him and you could tell he was jogging but he wasn't going anywhere he wasn't going anywhere i thought you know it seems like he's hardly doing anything and it struck me i love how god takes the simple things and he said yeah i felt that man had to overcome so much more than everybody else that's running down the street today everybody else might have their youth and they might have their strength but that man despite all the odds it took everything that was within him to roll out of the bed it took everything that was in him to stand up it took everything that was in him you know i'm going to go out there and run today even though it might take me two hours to get out of the house even though it might take me 30 minutes to get down the stairs even though it might take me so much time but i'm going to put some effort into it i'm going to do something because i know it's going to be a benefit to me or if that can be in the natural how much more for our people though you might have to overcome a lot though you might have a lot of struggles though i don't know how much you went through today but oh you might have felt like you couldn't overcome the obstacles but something inside you was driving you that you would come to the house of god oh you might not we i might have had it much easier i have a small drive to come to church maybe i'd overcome so many obstacles but i want to tell you god will bless you for your effort oh and what you put into it's what you're going to get out of it it might not look like much but god sees it you might have showed up and you just feel like you can hardly raise a hand well god bless you for being here i don't know what you've been through i don't know what you've gone through but you're here tonight and when i say if you hear god has something for you there's a power here come on there's a power to be released upon the church that can change you that can deliver you oh we're not here just to play church we're not under the old covenant we're not under the old testament this isn't rules and regulation here but everybody pretty much volunteered to come here tonight except for a lot of the children you didn't have a choice but i commend some of our children if their parents weren't going i bet they had a desire to be here we should encourage that in our children oh i say god raise up young children that are 11 12 13 years old maybe even younger when the parents say you know what i'm going to stay at home tonight maybe say mom can so and so pick me up i want to go be in the house of god i want to go be in the presence of the king i want to go sing to my lord i want to go worship the lord i don't want to forsake the assembly of the saints together let me be obedient to that word because there's been a word that's been written upon my heart and i can't help it there's something inside of me driving me to manifest the word oh that ought to be the approach that ought to be the desire i want to ask you what do you what do you want out of it what have you come here for tonight what type of expectations do we have oh yeah these things are familiar but when you come into the presence of the lord jesus christ i believe it begs the question you know what lord maybe i thought i had it all figured out maybe i've heard i've heard this so so much and so often i've come to so many churches that it's just become religion to me now and sometimes a good a good sobering checkup say you know i've been so busy i've just been so busy with life that i've i've come to the house of god and here i am i'm sitting here and i had no expectations at all i just just came here because of my post of duty but oh if maybe we can start now in our hearts if something can start to well up inside us we can start to think about the things that we need say lord if there's any if there's any sin inside of me if there's any unbelief inside of me lord just start dealing with my heart start speaking to me lord reveal yourself to me reveal your person to me lord i want to be right lord i don't want to be wrong if there's higher heights and deeper deaths which lord i know there is may your word just open up to me may the power of god just be poured out upon the congregation tonight lord may we see your holy spirit move in action i believe with that type of expectation expectation we can receive something from the lord what do you desire look jesus said ask and you shall receive ask that your joy might be full ask look he's telling you right here in his word ask and you shall receive that your joy might be full look you you have not because you ask not and when you ask you don't believe but oh we know that faith come by hearing the word i pray as the word is going forth that a faith is rising up inside of you to go ask for it you know the prophet of god said ask for big things ask for big things you know my heart's been moved and i want to say i'm rejoicing with the testimony that of sister heidi and how that she come through the the surgery process and she she's doing good and i want to say i saw a man stand here on sunday morning and he asked and he spoke big he spoke big things i say why not we serve a big god what do you have need of tonight why are we down here uh low down and out and acting like we're nobody we got the king of glory that has descended with a shout and he's opened the book and he has called your name ask for big things what do you have need of we'll go ahead and ask for it oh brother matthew i've asked before ask again ask again that's your joy that might be full oh it sounds to me like a bunch of joys coming oh can you hear the joy bells ringing it sounds like joy is coming oh my it might have looked like a little cloud of rain but something's coming church oh the abundance of rain is coming the blessings of god is going to be poured down upon your life oh brother matthew what are you talking about you don't have the authority i have the authority by the word because god has made me an able minister to preach the gospel ask for big things go ahead you got the opportunity now thinking you asked for big things you've been wanting it you've been desiring ask for it you shall have it oh i'm looking for the manifestation i'm looking for the vindication of his word we heard it sunday brother jeremy did a wonderful job this this ain't a challenge to you this ain't a challenge to whether you can do it this is a child will you take god at his word if you take god at his word then the challenge is not to you it's to him and god will back it up he'll back it up every time ask for big things prophet of god would say in the presence of god unrecognized he said if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that is to release our desires that we have in him to us now i i don't this was 1964 june 18th is is that the only place where this this word is relevant oh brother matthew that was just the prophet you know he was appearing in the sign of the son of man to the prophet and that that's just a dead letter now the days of the apostles are over we that that gift's not in the church anymore oh no no i want to read that again because he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us oh glory to god i pray faith is rising up in somebody now that god is appearing to you tonight hey i'm so glad i'm not standing upon my own word i'm glad i'm not up here by the words of a man i'm glad i don't have to stand up here on a maybe or an if or a probably or it could happen or just by chance we might win the lottery but i'm standing upon thus saith the lord heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away jesus is appearing to you tonight that your desires in him might be released to you i'm telling you ask for big things oh glory to god hallelujah but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promise not the promised word of moses age or any other ages the promised word for this age i want to say that revelation is a reality revelation is a reality if i can say it like this it becomes part of you it's part of your identification you become a part of christ you know many times you might not have it all figured out or you might understand it but i was thinking along those lines of that boy who who had never seen a mirror before and he come up into the house there he come into the in a room never seen a mirror before and he kind of looked in the mirror and he waved and the little boy in the mirror waved back to him he went to the left the boy with the way he went to the right and everything that little boy did it imitated him and he came up and finally he got close to that mirror and he caught the revelation he said mama why that's me oh that's exactly what's happened to you that's exactly exactly what the lease or call has done that's exactly what the message has done that's exactly what the seventh angel message has done you are hearing that word go forth and it sounded familiar you're like is that me in there there's something that's kind of familiar and you kind of dodged back and forth you kept on wondering and you got a little closer and oh as that word opened up as it became a revelation you said oh my oh god thank you so much that's me in there that's my identification that's who i am oh i'm so thankful other people they can't see themselves in it i mean have you ever been trying to show something maybe maybe i don't know just they have them pictures you know where they it's all kind of blurred and everything you don't even know what's in it but if you can look at it just right all of a sudden you look at him like oh my goodness can you see the mountains and can you see the landscape and can you see the stream coming through like what are you talking about all i see is a bunch of white noise all i see is a bunch of i don't it doesn't make any sense to me it seems all confusion and you there's this beautiful picture is unfolding to you that's the same thing with the word of god you sit down and you try to walk people through it and you try to show them you try to say look this is the truth of the hour this is what's written in the bible and through their denominational way of thinking because they've heard it over and over their whole lives and their priests and their ministers get up there stand up and over and over from creeds and and traditions and false dogmas and the only thing they can see is the ways of man oh but thank god there's a people he said i'm going to put my word in there i'm going to put my seed in there the way my word flashes upon their heart something is gonna say mama that's me jesus would say to peter he would say look flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven have revealed this to you and upon this rock i will build my church i just want to say we cannot over emphasize revelation uh revelation is what we must have because he said that the gates of hell shall not prevail over this revelation what is the revelation is who he is and that's what was stripped away from the church with the godhead and the revelation of the word he's not three the holy the holy ghost isn't just treading there somewhere we we got a god the father up there and then a man jesus christ we don't know who to pray for no but but but he's been veiled through the traditions of man and god has sent a message to break those denominational vows that you might see him for who he is and it's upon this revelation the lord jesus christ that peter with those keys amen and brother what must we do to be saved repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for there's no other name under heaven given where which man might be saved but by the name of jesus christ everything that you do in word or deed do all in the name of jesus christ oh it's just over and over right there in the word and god has sent a message that would strike your heart that way and if you're that seed oh if there's something inside of you you'll say that sounds right to me oh glory to god the church is built upon that revelation and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it look there has to become a revealing young people there has to come a revelation it's good to be raised in a good church it's good to go to the camps it's good to have experiences it's good to do these things and to be a part of the youth group there has to come a revealing or an unveiling of god to you personally because i want to ask you if nobody showed up to this church on sunday what would you do if nobody else showed up what would you do or if everybody walked away from the message what would you do oh i wonder how many really have a revelation of the word if our pastor got up and god forbid renounce the message and started preaching another gospel what would you do oh you say oh my no no not me oh god oh look it's manifesting time oh we've had ones walk with us a long time been heroes of the faith have gone around the world and preached the message and they've been a champion for the message but all of a sudden one day they start to get up before their church or start to sow seeds of discrepancy seeds of doubt and before you know it they've turned away from the message and they're preaching another gospel and all of a sudden oh there were people there yeah i'm talking about a situation that happened there are people here like nah i know who i am i ain't sticking around for it but you know what there's a group of people that stuck around for it why because they didn't have a revelation and i tell you we got tonight oh you might start doing some soul search and start asking yourself do i really have a revelation of what the message is it ain't a dress code it ain't the message isn't god sent a prophet if the message is god sent a prophet you've completely missed it you've completely missed the message it's more than that and i'm telling you we need a revelation i say oh god give me revelation lord i got tonight lord jesus maybe in my mind i thought i had it all figured out maybe i know i've been going to a good church maybe something in my heart feels good about it nor am i starting to think about it it's later than we think lord and the plagues and the diseases of the land and the shutting church doors and everything what happens if this church ain't here on sunday what happens if we can't gather here anymore what happens if you're just left to yourself is there a revelation is there something that has taken place on the inside of you that you have met the lord jesus christ you know who he is because it's upon the rock of that revelation the gates of hell can't prevail against it the revelation of a good church you got a good pastor you got a good church you got a good family that's not enough to keep you nope the fact that you you go to church two three times a week and and you're a good person and and and you tithe and and you give to missions nope nope that's not that's not gonna save you but it's the revelation of who he is and that's why god had to send a prophet because the revelation of who he was was so covered up by the veil of traditions just like there in the old testament under that old covenant oh they were just bringing lambs and goats and they were sacrificing it and once a year the high priest was supposed to take blood behind the veil right once a year the priest was supposed to take the the blood of the red effort behind the veil and for the sins of the nation what was he supposed to do he was supposed to sprinkle the mercy seat i believe 12 times once for each tribe and under the old covenant that was an atonement a type of an atonement for the sins but you know what there wasn't even no mercy back there you realize in the days of herod under roman rule that that the israel and the church they were just under the bondage of the nation they were just living under rituals and and living under a man's traditions that when the word made flesh came and appeared amongst them that they denied the word oh friends the same thing happened in our generation by a divine promise god said as it was in the days of noah so shall i be in the coming of the son of man and malachi 4 5 i will send elijah to reten restore your hearts back to the faith of the fathers oh he said i will send the son of man ministry again to you and what did god do he came down in a vessel he veiled himself there was the word made flesh again proving he's the same yesterday today and forever and the denominational systems rejected it that's why he could stand there and say i indict this generation with the second crucifixion of jesus christ why because the word was on displayed oh my but thank god there is a people they got more than a good church come on somebody they got more than just a good story they got more than a man's idea they got more than a man's opinion they got none other than the lord jesus christ oh thank you jesus there is a power here tonight come on somebody there is a power in the house of god why don't you go ahead and ask for big things oh thank you jesus oh i know we're a little reserved i know we're a little setback but why don't you just loose yourself a little bit oh come on do we need to bring it do we need to put a game up here do we need to put your favorite uh team up here that's so they can score a touchdown so you can get excited come on somebody do we gotta do we gotta fancy you and baby you and pet you oh maybe maybe if we give you some worldly something to get excited about maybe you'll just get a little loose yeah man i like that it's my favorite show brother i really get into this stuff you know i was thinking about it when i was out there in the world you know i used to see people carrying on and i hate to admit this but i remember going out to the to the the clubs and the bars you know these these people man they would be all dancing up and in the spirit and doing all that and be like how do they do that how do they even know how to do it i mean everybody's having a good time out there but i tried to do it and i kind of it doesn't look good but i found out one day they have something that's in those places that can stimulate you a little bit you see all them people out there acting a fool you know what you sit on the sidelines a little bit probably do that too of course i could do that you'll get so stimulated you're like hey what's going on i want to come out well come on do you do you realize that when jesus said look take this cup take this cup this is my blood of the new testament and drink all of it not just a portion take this cup drink all of it well you know what's in that cup there's stimulation there's wine what does wine represent it's the stimulation of revelation oh my the prophet of god said hallelujah he said that what is what is oil a type of in the scripture it's a type of the spirit and he said what is wine a type of he said it's the type of stimulation he said that oil and wine is always connected together why because it's the stimulation of revelation by the spirit word that comes to the individual oh no wonder that john was weeping there when nobody was worthy to take the book he was weeping but on the high oh my said weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and loose the seven seals thereof oh my you want to know what john got stimulated john god stimulated the prophet of god said oh the most sublime act in all the scriptures he said john must have saw his name in there john got so stimulated he started screaming he started shouting the joy bells oh we're ringing why because he saw his name written in the lamb's book of life and he said oh and everybody heard i john saying blessings and honor and glory forever and ever why because there was stimulation of revelation i wish a little stimulation of revelation would break down in the house of god tonight that there would be a people that's free that would recognize that their name has been written on the lamb's book of life i'm tired of living for the world i'm tired of rooting for the rangers i really am tired of rooting for the cowboys i really am they're losers i want them to win but they're losers but oh we got a champion tonight we got a champion of champions why don't you root for my jesus why don't you root for the word why don't you put all your efforts why did you take his stats you want to be a statition why don't you go ahead and take his stats he's a million a gazillion wins to zero losses the greatest champion a champion of champions my lord and if i read the word right he's here he's here what brother matthew jesus jesus is here what are you going to do are you just going to be pious yep okay i heard you brother matthew i've heard this a million times jesus is here amen wednesday night got to work tomorrow jesus is here i know god sent a prophet we got the message i've heard you try to pump up people before you're just an evangelist want to be brother matthew it ain't my words you know the problem is there's a fleshly veil here tonight there's a veil that is over the people tonight but if for one moment we can lay aside our thinking and we can start to look to the word and the mama that's me part of you can look into the word and say you know what that is nothing but the truth you know when you say the right things things happen just like hattie wright she said the right thing to the word i wonder if there's a people that have been gathered together in bedford texas that are going to say the right thing to the word and watch out something's going to happen things are going to start to shake things might start to break it might be those chains that you've been bound for all of your life but oh why don't you be like the blind beggar there why don't you be like blind bottom ass if jesus is here why don't you cry out thou son of david have mercy on me jesus is here why don't you be like that woman with the blood issue what are you going to do if jesus is here what are you going to do about it i want to ask you is this just another good sermon is this just brother matthew trying to put some scriptures and some quotes to wow the people or is this the lord jesus christ veiling himself in the bride showing that he's the same yesterday today and forever ask for big things jesus is here oh why don't you just worship them why don't you praise them why don't in an atmosphere like this why did you go out and ask for what you've been praying for oh glory to god hallelujah oh sirs we would see jesus sirs how many want to see jesus sirs we would see jesus prophet of god said the greeks couldn't see him because of his earthly veil their god veiled in that tabernacle of jesus christ and they couldn't see him the prophet of god would say this god veiled hiding himself from the world veiled in human beings here was god those greeks saying we would see jesus and jesus said a corn of wheat has to fall and die look at this angle the prophet takes on this time maybe sometimes it's hard it's really hard to grasp the word we need a revelation look at the angle he takes on this he says jesus said a corner of wheat has to fall and die you have to die to all your ideas you have to get out of your own thoughts that's what i'm saying there's a fleshly veil here tonight we gotta break through the humanity church we gotta break through the flesh i wanna say that the spirit of god has come tonight by his word to lift you into heavenly places you were not made to be squandering around down here in ladies unbelief you were not made for the earthly you weren't made to be down here quibbling about if the democrats or the republicans are going to take office that is not your fight that is not your concern on a spiritual level now sure it's good to look at the signs of the time and watch the time pieces but if if if politics and sports and the stock market is affecting your joy something is wrong if if you are just i can't wait to see where my stalks are i can't wait to see who took if those if that's your ambitious i want to tell you you're down here uh squabbling around in ladies unbelief but that's not where you belong the word has come to lift you up into heavenly places you are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you're not made to be down there you're an eagle church you are an eagle why don't you just set your wings and soar in the promised word of the age high above all of the lady you'll see a unbelief and accept the word for the hour get past the fleshly veil of man get past the ways of man get out of your own thinking get out of your own ideas get out of the ways of the flesh and recognize that jesus christ is here oh thank you jesus hallelujah you have to die to all your ideas you have to get out of your own thoughts i like this part y'all keep pulling we might be here a while like those messiah love this like those disciples they couldn't explain about eating his body and drinking his blood they couldn't explain eat your flesh and drink your blood the prophet of god said but see they had done died to those things oh my look friends i'm dead to trying to figure out all the cases that people want to present whether the prophet was here or whether the cloud was over here or whether the bridge were people i'm dead to that you're talking to a dead man you want to go ahead and present your case to me i've done die to all those things because the message has introduced me to him i got take you want to take beef with john the baptist you're going to pay for it but john the baptist did his job what did you go out there to see i read shaken by the wind look all these people you know who they got issues with the flesh veil they can't see the spiritual come on well john was standing there and what he said i he said what did it say jesus saw him coming i mean john said i see jesus coming nobody else saw it but the prophet he said i saw the pillar of fire uh like like a dove come down that who saw it there were no other witnesses to it john saw it you want to take beef with john the baptist and say there was no other nobody else saw it that's fine but i'm like one of those disciples that were standing there i happened to be standing with the prophet one day and all of a sudden while i was standing listen to the prophet he said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world and i said what go that okay i'm gonna run after him that means i'm doing my job that's what i'm here for the prophet came to introduce you to christ the word go ahead you can take all the issue you want with the prophet you can say he said this wrong he did that wrong that vision didn't come to pass but you know what he did do he introduced me to my lord jesus christ and he took away the veil that fleshly veil was taken away the veil was wrecked and i can see jesus christ standing in our midst oh the presence of god is here ask for big things glory hallelujah praise his wonderful name oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name oh i want you to catch something here this will be for our benefit oh my i was thinking about that prophet said they've done died to that i got to thinking about you know didn't matter that they couldn't explain it guess where they made it to they made it to the upper room didn't matter everything they couldn't explain i'm sure they talked about it i'm sure peter and john and then they talked about it no no this is what he means like i i don't doubt all of them one day said you know what i don't know what's going on all we know is he has the words of eternal life and i'm just going to follow him they couldn't understand it so much so when jesus said you'll deny me peter said i'll never deny you lord peter didn't even know that that ability was in with in him and i was thinking about that when he denied the lord those three times and all of a sudden that crowed imagine how little he felt when all of a sudden those words you'll deny me three times imagine the guilt and the condemnation but guess what peter made it to the upper room maybe you're feeling a lot of guilt maybe you feel like you've done a lot of things wrong maybe you feel like you're not good enough for the message i got news for the devil take a look around they're still here they're still here they haven't given up why because god put something in him that can't give up he said i will write my word upon their heart i will put my spirit in them this is the covenant that i have made with you i will remember your sins no more you want the holy ghost it's here for you tonight you want deliverance it's here for you tonight you want your family it's here for you tonight you've been praying for it for a long time sister go ahead and claim it in the name of jesus christ oh glory to god hallelujah oh my this message isn't an idea not man's thinking so i just got to my inspiration we'll try to work towards will close here but i believe this will be for a benefit we're talking about being an able minister an able minister of the new testament you find out here in acts chapter 18 there's a man by the name of apollos and the word would say this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john now look at the attributes that are given to this man and he began in verse 26 and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue who when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him then and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly now just think of this here's this man apollos he's well taught in the lord he's an eloquent man he's mighty in the scriptures oh that fervent in spirit he's he's like a he's fired up for the word he's going around and preaching he's instructed in the way of the lord he knows what he's talking about he knows what he's learned he he's heard the witnesses he believes believe that jesus christ has come he's recognized that god has done something he's actually been received by you know he's preaching the word but i want you to point out something to you apollos only had the mechanics he had the word but he didn't have the revelation of what the word came to do he had made a step in the right direction but he was preaching only the baptism of john there are many ministers and churches today that are only preaching that god sent a prophet they're only preaching malachi 4 5. they recognize that god sent a prophet they recognize that he brought a message but they haven't recognized if i could say this they're not an able minister of the new covenant because the new covenant came to do something in that blood covenant there was life he laid down his life he shed his blood that the life that was in the blood would come back upon the believer apollos was just a good baptist preacher and there's a lot of good message believers there's a lot of good message preachers but oh under an able minister by the new covenant there is a revelation to take the word and bring the people into the presence of god into a new birth by the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] oh hallelujah oh god let me be that type of minister let me be an able minister oh my hallelujah oh he was just a good baptist preacher he wasn't able to bring people to the new birth i want to see new births i want to see the presence of god i want to see people delivered i want to see people changed i want to see the word living in an action that's what gets me excited oh my so there paul says he's preaching but then an able minister came to the coast of ephesus one by the name of paul said tell me a little bit about what you've been hearing how are you baptized oh yeah well how were you baptized well we were baptized on the baptism adjourned he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe we didn't even know there was such a thing given and there paul baptized them in true christian baptism not under john's baptism not under a baptist or a methodist or a pentecostal way of thinking but under the revelation of the age amen the prophet of god would say this as we work towards a close quickly out of the token he says but you must have the token do you hear branham tabernacle do you hear a christian life tabernacle do you hear christian life tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all your believing is in vain hear the prophet of the age speak all your believing is in vain see you'll live a good life you'll listen to what the word says you'll go to church you'll try to live right that's fine but that's not it now i'm talking about being an able minister i'm talking about a revelation of the new covenant a revelation of what the message has come to do it's not a way of living it's not a church system but the but the the token must be on display he said when i see the blood that's the token well i say take this to heart church oh maybe there's somebody here you've been wondering all the time whether you had it or not you don't have to wonder anymore why because jesus christ is here he's here to take away the fleshly veil of all your good works and all your good deeds and everything that you've done oh he'll just take that all away and if you can meet him friends there's nothing like being in his presence if you've ever been in his presence if you've ever been on the back side of the desert if you've ever been praying there and that fire has wrapped himself around you oh and it'll change you it'll make you different it'll be a revelation that's so real that it's beyond the five senses of your flesh it's beyond the church building it's beyond your friends it's beyond your family it's beyond everything that's around you because it's you and him alone you and him have become one you are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life spirit of the spirit you and him are one now that's a revelation come try to separate me from you can't do it i'm part of him galatians 5 24 says and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust that old nature's dead i want to just share this in closing we're talking about a revelation something's changed something's different but they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust that old nature's dead does anybody know what it's like for the old man to die to absolutely die where you become a new person but something was i often tell my my testimony and there's of course no time to go into that but but when i was just when i was just in that transition of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost there was this voice that would speak and and and it had an influence on me in a sway and the only way i've ever been to describe it is like i would say i heard like the devil or demons saying this but you know that never really always made sense to me but but i came across this testimony and and brother branham was talking to brother sidney jackson and he's talking how many of you have seen the picture of the seven uh licks of fire the pillow fires taken out there in lake port california there's a picture of brother random standing at the pulpit and my there's just this beautiful rainbow of licks of fire that are going across them and this personal testimony brother sidney jackson is talking to brother branham and he says to him he says you know if you look close behind me on the platform you see that face that looks like an old indian chief and brother sydney goes well brother branham no i've i've really never noticed that before he said you see what happens he said when he said that's my old nature and he said your old nature is always there to haunt you but he said when you receive christ in his word the revelation of the hour he said the holy ghost and fire comes down in your soul and burns out your old nature but this is real important here like i said this is a personal testimony of brother sidney jackson and he said as the prophet was standing there he said the holy spirit comes down and burns out that old nature and he did like that with his hands and showed how that old nature it's always behind you it's never in position to make you do those things anymore but it always wants to try to insert its pla itself into a place of influence again oh my that started that that started to ring so true with me because i remember in my conversion as i was being converted and the holy spirit was was coming in and taking control there was this old nature there that say well i'll get you back out in the music i'll get you with music and tv oh there's always that temptation that old nature is right there always trying to attack you always trying to pull you back it's always wanting to come back into the driver's seat but let's listen to the words of paul and they that are christ have crucified the flesh this ain't a one-time act church if we want to start seeing the power of god we want to see the moving of the spirit we want to see signs and wonders we want revelation to be breaking out in the church we got to get down to business we got to start crucifying the flesh with the affections of the of lush and he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit if the musicians would come if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit we need more than the mechanics church it's more than just the letter it's more than just the work it's more than just going to church but we need the spirit to manifest the word that we believe we got to have the dynamics we got to have the holy ghost in action in our life oh that's what we preached last time about peter let me stir you up and put you into remembrance of these things look we know where we've come from we know what god's doing we know what he's done in this age but he said i want to stir you up that you be established in the present truth there is a present truth and maybe just leaving in on this quote in the presence of god unrecognized they can just lightly play something this is maybe a place to to end on right here look at the day that we're living in the presence of god unrecognized what's promised for this day now you know you know what the fleshly veil does 1963 1965 is that all we got church we just look back [Music] is that all we have look look at the day we're living in what's promised for this day where are we we've moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of israel moved with the pillar of fire or they went back to egypt [Music] we gotta move with the word [Music] lord help me to move with the word i'm tired of looking back i'm tired of looking back at what the word was tired of looking about you did it in the days of brother branham you did it in the days of paul you did in the days of moses but lord something in my heart i want to move with the word i want to move with the pillar fire when he says look at the day that we're living in that's this day where are we now if i could have all of your attention right now on these final words [Music] let's all stand maybe just close your eyes i want this oh the greatest pleasure i know of [Music] is to be to pray until i can realize that i'm in the presence of god and recognize it i think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the holy spirit i think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the holy spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us fill his presence and see his word and see it vindicated it ought to give a faith to make cripples walk blind see death here dumb speak [Music] is that the thrill of your heart [Music] with every head bowed what are you living for what are you excited about you excited about your paycheck are you excited about your girlfriend you excited about the stock market [Music] maybe you feel like there's nothing to be excited about maybe life's been so hard on you lately you feel like you don't even have any joy [Music] i want to say i got good news for you because the presence of the holy spirit is here that you can see the promises that god have made standing among you [Music] would somebody lift their hand and say lord i want that to be the thrill of my heart if the prophet says the throne of the church should be the presence of the holy spirit i want to lift at my hand and say lord that's the thrill of my heart i want to see the presence of the holy spirit i want to see the god that made the promises standing among us he's the same yesterday today and forever now maybe you're lacking revelation maybe you want to lift your hand up say lord jesus reveal yourself to me i realize i don't have what i thought i had and i need revelation tonight god bless you god bless you just hands all over the building [Music] able ministers of the new covenant [Music] able by the word to bring the presence of god to the people let's all lift our hands up but i want you to
