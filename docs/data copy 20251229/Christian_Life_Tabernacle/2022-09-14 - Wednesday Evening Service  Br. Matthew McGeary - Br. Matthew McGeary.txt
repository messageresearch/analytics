there's something driving us or something keep Lord when we would have been gone a long time ago there's been a Grace following in our lives you've been overshadowing us by your love we're compelled Lord to stand here tonight and tell you that we love you thank you for your grace and for your mercy Lord for you've done what no man could do you took your sin upon your back and you went to Calvary and you die in a horrible death and we all should have died but your love was so great then you could take our place Lord that we could be forgiven tonight or there ought to be a joy in the house should be such a freedom and a liberty to know that we've been forgiven that we've been set free and Lord we've heard the greatest message that's ever hit the face of the Earth to know you and the power of your Resurrection when the whole world is groping in darkness and even the religious leaders of the day are so blind that they don't know what the truth is but you Lord you open the book and you cut our name you call us out of Darkness nominationalism you call us out about Sin father now set us upon a strong Rock of Revelation that'll never fail Lord though the world would fail around us oh God we're standing upon the sure word of Prophecy to know that any day now Lord there's going to be a catching of way Lord that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye our bodies are going to be changed Lord that this sickness that we see on this side Lord oh my my little nephew Elliot that's suffering right now Lord you you were you were stricken Lord you repeat and you were bruised Lord it was by your stripes father that he's healed tonight we stand as you're believing children that the holy jungles just go to allow and perform the work Lord Jesus that it is finished as you have declared unto your people Lord we just love you thank you for your presence each one that's been that's been able those that aren't able to be with us those that are on the Airways Lord we commit all things to you Lord come break the bread of life Lord as only you can and myself Lord I I know I'm nothing so completely 100 dependent on you and Lord I know that here says Amen to that father for if you don't give us an ear to hear the word then we can't hear but Lord we're thankful that we know your voice because we're your called Sheep we pray in all these things in Jesus Christ name amen praise this wonderful name if you have your Bibles we'll read out of Revelations chapter one man praise the Lord just enjoy the Psalms and the worship and the song specials good to have our visitors brother Amos and his wife and with us and also really a privilege to have brother Norbert I mean I would have what a privilege to have him where are you at how can I miss you where are you at brother there he is you're trying to hide well it's good he you know we just had such a wonderful time in the Lord there in Romania and uh as we're just ministering to the youth um you know I can't I I I'm not in a position where I can interpret so I'm thankful for that but my you know the the the inter the one that does the interpreting you should pray for them like you do the minister because you know there's an anointing and there's a gift that comes behind that and there was just such a Unity between me and brother Norbert um and such a flow of the Holy Ghost it's just a privilege to have my brother in service with us but reading in our Bibles Revelations chapter one it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel into his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you in peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before and his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kingdom of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from all from our sins in his own blood amen you may be seated as we'll just continue to read a little further just trusting that God will come and bring a word of encouragement to you and hath made us Kings and Priests you know I like that right there he has made us Kings and Priests he's done something that you could not do he's done something that the world could not do oh sure that the world might be able to make you a worldly king or a worldly priest but but here this he's made us Kings and Priests by the washing of the water of the word by the shedding of his blood he's done something that no man could do he's made us both Kings and Priests unto God his father for him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him in all kenjons of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty I just want to maybe focus a little on this verse here he says I John who am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ now just for a little uh Foundation I love to read a quote of the prophet he says this and presume and he says let's presume nothing stay with that word and God is obligated that word is a seed and that word will bring forth everything it promised to bring forth now I know we hear that many times but the word is a seed and it will bring forth everything that it's promised to bring forth the prophet would even say look the word is a seed and if you're believing for salvation then it's a seed you you place into your heart and you go believing for the manifestation of it if you're believing for healing he said by your stripes you are healed and then you take that word which is a seed into your heart and you go believing if you're weary if you're downtrodden if if you don't feel like you're worth anything he said come unto me all ye who are heavy laid and I will give you rest that word is a seed and if you take that word that seed into your heart and you believe it by faith then that word will produce exactly what it said it would produce he said it'll do it it'll take the world out of you now I think that's maybe a word that some of us need tonight we need a faith that'll take the word out of us amen we need something that will get a whole hold of us and change our lives and I tell you if you're feeding on the message of the hour if you're feeding on the word of God if you're getting down into prayer and you're really listening to the tapes and you're going into the word of God I'm telling you you take that word into your heart and it will change you it will change the way you think it'll change the way you talk it'll change job situations it'll change family situations this word of God has a power and this word of God is a seed and the spoken word is the Original Seed and Christ is that seed and that is the seed that is coming to the heart of the believer that will produce every promise of God it is yea and amen I want to preach to you a little bit tonight oh Hallelujah I love the word of God because he has given you an ear to hear he said my sheep know my voice they will follow after me and if you know the voice of this message if your ear has been tuned in oh if there's a faith Crystal on the inside of your heart then whenever you hear the prophetic message of Malachi far whatever it's speaking oh if you can believe it then you can hide what you're hearing it's for you oh my we we've heard something the world's never heard before it tore the seals off the book we have an open book The Prophet said it became a brand new book has it become a new book to you I think maybe it's just become Theology and it's just become a man's opinion it's just become something that maybe we've we've found ourselves able to agree with in clicks you know and and old men have have studied the message and they they maybe say it this way and they speak about his peering and they speak about the the coming of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man and we come to a denominational way of thinking where we accept man's interpretation of the word but I wonder if you've ever got down into prayer and you say oh God I need a revelation of the seventh seal Lord your Prophet said it's the coming of the lord it's the end of all things it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials I know something happened out there on the mountains in 1963. I might not know exactly what it is Lord but my heart's on fire my heart is stirring Lord I need a revelation Lord would you come down in the room I want to tell you if God would come down in the room and reveal the Seven Seals to the prophet he wants to reveal those Seven Seals to you oh but if we're not careful just because it's on the tapes just because it's on the books we we imagine that we know what the prophet's talking about but it's by revelation look this is not a denomination we haven't gathered around a man's thinking man's words were fail but we what have we gathered around we've gathered around the unfailing body word of the son of man that's what you're feeding on or are you fading on it that's what you if you're feeding on it then you're becoming it if you're eating it if you're listening to it then you're going to manifest it because that word is a seed and if you take that message into your heart what's going to happen you're going to start to see the fruits of the message you're going to start to see the fruits of the life you're going to start to see the word in action in you have we settled for something less are we living below our privileges Have We Become to a place where we're complacent and and and and we found that you know what I really can never live a total overcoming life that I find myself subject to worldly pleasures uh maybe not so much sinful but is there a progression is there something in your heart that's moving and stirring with your feeding on this message in such a way that there's an expectation and something inside you crying out and Desiring for more of this word to be made alive in you look I don't know about you but I'm not satisfied with where I'm at I I I can listen to I can listen to what one message or read a read a few quotes and you realize how little you really are when you hear the voice of God speaking tool oh I'm thankful for it there was a time there was a time there that God come down on the mountain and his presence were there and it's so fearful and he spoke unto him and he said oh don't speak to us or let Moses speak to us lest we die and God said you've spoken well I'll raise up a prophet amongst you and I'll put my words in his mouth and he'll be a God to you look David if you have the revelation of what a real Prophet is a word Prophet if you have a real revelation of what Malachi 4 5 was then you're not just hearing the words of a man how can we get to a place where when we would question the words of God well did he really mean that well I just know he said it and that's good enough for me that's where we get ourselves in trouble is when we try to figure out what the prophet meant and we try to run with our intellectual idea and run over here what did this brother say about it and what did this brother say about it and we got our little quote books and we jump into here into one quote and jump over here into one quote and before you know it we just got our own little sermon all worked up on speaking in tongues and just how it should be we got our own little sermon all cooked up about the son of man we got our own sermon cooked up about the coming of the Lord and all you're doing is pulling a quote here pulling a quote there pulling a scripture there and you're just cooking it up you're playing Chef in the kitchen oh I'm gonna whoop to something that's going to wow the people or wow my brothers I'm just gonna throw this all in and add a little spice and something nice and say how you like it well and everybody will jump and everybody will holler and everybody will say Amen but if you take what the preacher is preaching you take it back to the word of God and find out of what the man's preaching is in line with the prophet then you'll know if it's the word of the Lord or not I'm reminded in the scriptures that Jonah he had a call upon his life and God told John he said Jonah I want you to go I want you to go go to Nineveh he didn't say I want you to go to Nineveh and make up some good sermon he said I want you to go to Nineveh I want you to preach the preaching that I bid you to preach that's the kind of prophet I want that's the kind of Pastor I want that's the kind of preacher I want give me a man of God that'll stand behind the pulpit and you'll preach the preaching that God bid him to preach that's the kind of preaching that'll bring results he could have went in there to Nineveh oh may he I didn't want to go in the first place why am I even here I'm just going to come here and I'm going to preach a feel-good sermon and I'm going to give them a little history lesson and you know maybe some people will see it and maybe some people won't that won't bring results the word is a seed and if you preach the word the word will bring the results and what happened when he preached the preaching that God bid him to preach it brought the whole town to repentance don't you realize we're supposed to be preaching a message well I need I need help tonight y'all are the ones that are going to preach tonight and we ain't gonna preach at all your life is me your life is preaching the message look just as Jonah was commissioned a go to Nineveh and preach the preaching that I bid you to preach there is a people a bride of Jesus Christ that has been called by God their eyes have been opened unto the unfailing word of God in that word that you take into your heart it's supposed to birth forth the fruits of Christ and you are walking living epistle written and red of all men that they might see your good works and glorify God oh God granted let me be that written epistle Lord let me really live this message let me get down to business oh my I've played Church way too long Lord forgive me I I realize that if I'm going to start doing something for God I better start doing it now the word is a seed and that word will bring forth everything it promised to bring forth it'll do it well I didn't start my timer so y'all might be in trouble we got that was a bonus right there however long that was I found out that that little that that really helps you know you don't Tire the people because if you turn a corner and then you know we can be here till 10. though that word is a seed it'll bring forth the thing that it promised it'll take the world out of you it'll sanctify you it'll make you live diff a different life it'll make you do things that you thought you couldn't do oh Hallelujah can anybody say Amen to the word has the has this message or the hour made you do things that you thought you couldn't do you thought you couldn't live an overcoming life you thought you couldn't live a Victorious Life you thought you couldn't have a hunger for the things of God you thought you couldn't do without your drugs you thought you couldn't do without the alcohol you thought you couldn't do without your internet programs you thought you couldn't do without of all those things but what happened Faith received a seed of the message into your heart and you started to walk according to that word seed that you had received not even seeing any change in your life does somebody know what I'm talking about that you heard the message of the hour you heard the preacher preach the word and something in your heart said amen to the word and Satan came behind that remember the parable of the Soul or the the good Sowers the son of man who went forth and sowed good seed but then Satan the wicked what comes by that he wants to sow them tears into your mind and you hear the word of God you haven't experienced something great happens in the church service and you go forth praising God rejoicing in the word that you've heard and you say Amen to the word now I'm looking for change in my life but then the devil will come right behind us say that's not for you you've tried this so many times you've come to the altar so many times you've been to camps and camps and after camps you're just that same one the preachers always talk about you just got another cap experience he'll try to rob that seed right out of your heart but you have a choice you have a choice to either take God in his word or take the devil at his word you have the same choice that Eve had you know that's exactly where we've come back to in the end time again that we are back to the same place where we have the fullness of the word made available to us the full word of God and it's up to you to believe every single word that God has revealed by Malachi 4 5 or you can doubt that word and bring forth death but something in my heart when all of those things coming you just need to tell that Old Devil to shut up just tell that Old Devil to shut up tell them he ain't got no right to be there that I've heard the word of God and that word is a seed and I've heard that word in my heart and it's going to bring forth what it said it would why because he said it would bring forth what he said it would bring then that settles it oh if we could just have that childlike Faith to know if God said it I'll believe it I'm going to walk forth and I'm going to keep believing it it'll do what it said it would do it'll take the world out of you it'll make you do things that you thought you couldn't do because it's the word in you oh I like that because it's the word in you it's not your efforts it's not your ability it's not something you worked up it's not some man's opinion no it's none of those things what it is it's the word that's found fertile ground in your heart and by faith you believe that word and now that you're walking according to that word with faith in that word it will bring forth what it's intended to bring hey man because it's the word in you don't presume you have it watch your life and measure up and see what your life is see the way that you're living see the way that you're living see the way that you're sleeping in church and you're falling asleep and the preacher's preaching really doesn't mean that much to you see how you sit there in the seat of the scornful and say oh this is kind of the way it goes every single time Lord knows your thoughts he knows the intents of your heart he knows that your attitude towards the word and you find out it's not your attitude towards a man it's an attitude towards God's Vindicated way of bringing forth the message of the hour and we can get so carnal where we start to doubt our pastor and just look at the backside of Israel and think oh my goodness we could do it all this way in that way just because Satan wants to give you a little A View from this way and see the humanity oh yeah we all got Humanity but it's this Humanity it's this Badger skin that God has chosen to Veil himself in in the end time to continue on the ministry of the son of man in the bride's body don't you realize that's what's taking place today is the very logos of God that was split up on the day of Pentecost and poured out upon the people it's that same Holy Spirit that's living now in you and in you and in you and if you speak against that word watch out I say God may I never have the wrong attitude towards my brother may I never have the wrong attitude towards the man of God may I never sit in in in the seat of the scornful and think that I got it all figured out and I studied it out better and and this is rudimentary and this is elementary and and we've been down this road before and we're just going down that road again can you say something that'll help me preacher well I might not be able to that depends on your faith that depends on your attitude matter of fact your attitude we've been taught can knock somebody else out of their blessing but I wonder if we could all get together and get in one mind and one Accord and have the unity of the word and believe in the Supernatural and the spirit of God and say you know what we might have a we might have a young one amongst us we might have a new convert amongst us somebody might have come in off the street and all of a sudden we all get together in one mind and one Accord start praying oh God would you deliver them would you heal them would you bring forth your power in the service anoint the man of God anoint my ears Lord I'm expecting the supernatural tonight I'm expecting our young people to be filled with the Holy Ghost just like the Bible said while Peter yet spank these words the only ghost fell upon all them that believed I believe there ought to be an expectation in the house of God where people come together and we look for the supernatural have we gotten so churchified that we don't either come on a Wednesday night and we don't even expect the power of God to sweep through the building and we just become good old denominational Christians and all we do is we want to listen for a good word or have we come here to look for the presence of almighty God to come and change life Christ to deliver people to cast demons out of the sanctuary to change Hearts to change attitudes oh Hallelujah that's what I'm looking for the prophet of God said it takes atmosphere to do things where we ought to start creating an atmosphere there ought to be a heart of expectation there ought to be a heart of praise that ought to be something inside of you oh if you if you're preaching something you heard before why did you just start thinking about those love Secrets oh Lord I remember when you saved me I remember when you delivered me oh God I remember when you came to me and my pit of despair oh he's a savior oh he's a Healer oh he's the Mighty God I remembered I didn't know which way was up which way was town which way was right which way was left I didn't know where to go but oh I heard somebody call my name oh the sweetest voice you ever did here is when Jesus Christ calls you to repentance that you realize that you're a sinner that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and you can call on the name of the Lord and by Divine promise he said You shall be saved look friends I don't want to get people to a church I want to get them to Calvary I want to get them under that bleach blood of Jesus Christ that'll set them free from all of their complexes and all of their sins I think that's what we need tonight we need to be set free we need to be washed we need to be cleansed by the word of God I'm tired of church Hannity I'm tired of looking for man's acceptance I'm tired of thinking about man's opinion I got one duty that's to preach the word of God I got one duty that's to live the word of God I got one duty that is to manifest the message of the hour and the most wicked age that has ever been in all of the humanity I am that chosen vessel you've been chosen for this you've been ordained to Manifest this message there ought to be a praise coming forth out of your mouth an expectation for the supernatural why not why can't we hear a sound of a Russian Mighty Wind drop down into the building why can't we see our young ones fall out in the presence of God and give their heart to God why can't we be like Hattie Wright that's nothing but the truth you get that kind of attitude oh Hallelujah things will start happening when you just start saying that's nothing but the truth that's not amen amen that's not hey man that's nothing but the truth oh you get a whole people gathered together saying that's nothing but the truth watch out devil something's about to happen somebody's about to get delivered somebody's about to get slave those two boys you've been praying for all your life they might just pitch over right in the service and all of a sudden give them oh why because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you see the pattern in the word why don't you look for the pattern in your own life oh I feel good Oh Glory to God when I see God do something in his word that means he can do it in my life that means he can change me Lord if you transported Philip from here over to Romania man I can buy plus an airplane ride be all right with me poof Harbor I'm gonna go back home here in a few minutes it's gonna happen don't you know that's going to happen start looking for it start believing for it start expecting it start saying hey that's nothing but the truth oh Hallelujah in a moment in a twinkling of an eye see the way you're living yeah well how are you living I mean do you see the fruits of Christ in your life do you see that same spirit well you know this just has to be more of a revelation because I don't know how let's explain it but even though I've never met the prophet and I've only listened to his voice I know his character because his character was a word character his character was the same character of Our Lord because it was the Lord Jesus the spirit of the Lord that was moving in his life well that's not too fanatical for you I hope not because I believe that's the same thing that's happened to each one of us is that the spirit of the Lord by the word of God what did Jesus say he said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life therefore the spirit and life of the word comes into the believer and then it produces the Life of Christ not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday this ain't a workup this is some not something that you imagine this isn't just just something some feel-good thing I got at some special meetings that wears off on me after two or three weeks if it wears off then you aren't changed but if you can ever be changed if you can ever become a new creature and Jesus Christ where old things pass away and All Things become new and you've been birthed by the Holy Spirit and the fire of God is coming to your heart and it's burned out all the things of the world and you've been changed you no longer think the same you no longer dress the same because it's not you living it's Christ Living then if it's Christ Living how does Christ talk how does Christ troubleshoot how does Christ pay the bills how does Christ go to the job how does Christ respond look at your life we can be changed tomorrow there's going to be a lot of disappointed people foreign there's going to be some people who miss it I don't want to be one of them Lord as soon as you get the attitude you look at the life you look at the attitude as soon as you get the attitude to use the word for an excuse you know you have the wrong spirit well I'm predestinated I can't miss it Paul said do weep do we sin because God forbid do we sin because grace abound is it something along those no and if if you find yourself where you're using the word as an excuse for your condition then you have the wrong spirit I would rather be be living wrong and have a spirit of repentance and say Lord I don't want to be this way then to be some heady high-minded puffed up so-called message believer I'm going in a Rapture and if you don't come to my degree in my education and my church you're just all going to hell bless God we made it we're in the message of the hour and my goodness we're all going if you come under our roof that ain't the spirit of Christ I love it the prophet of God said how many near as the Holy Ghost I'd love to play Church like the prophet did how many are how many of you believe you have the Holy Ghost oh raise your hand raise your head okay okay all you say you have the Holy Ghost we'll see if you have it or not how many of you are sighing and crying for the Abominations of the world well when I heard the prophet say that what did I do did I say yeah I do that I mean you know tired every once in a while and like man this place is crazy Lord help the world no something in my spirit said I'm sorry Lord maybe I don't have one I think I have but I want it Lord give me your spirit when you look into the word if you have the right Spirit what's the evidence that it's the Lord working in your life is that you say Amen to the word it's that ability to receive the word that when it comes forth there's something in your heart that says Lord I believe it I Want to Be Right Lord help me be right oh that's what I want to see the the uh uh uh I want to see uh works I want to see fruits I want to see uh repentance I want to see these things when I look at my life the prophet of God is saying see what see the way you're living well I hope we could just stay there a little bit while just so you can kind of stroll through your life maybe we can do some maybe we ought to do a a chart let's just do a diet chart you know you're in business you know a lot of times you do charts and and maybe you're you're you're you're profit and your loss and you know how much you spent on fuel and that things like how much you spent on materials and supplies and and all of this and you do a little chart and you can see how much you invested into each thing to keep your business running I say we ought to let's just do our all do our own chart we're going to start doing how how much time did you sleep last week okay okay you built a nice little graph there how much time did you spend eating how much time did you spend doing your hair there's Grace for the sisters brothers not so much the longer the hair the longer the time the curly it is you get two times longer God bless our sisters if you only knew how much effort goes into keeping that Glory I praise you for that you start looking at a graph okay how much time did you go to school how much time did you go to work you know you start lining up and you know you know you can you can make it where it's kind of sloping like that and let's let's start putting in how much time did you listen to the message how many minutes did you collectively listen especially for those that have speak English did you listen to the mouthpiece of God how how many minutes did you listen to the prophet well we just might as well get down down to business down home how much time did you spend praying how many people did you not pray for that you said you would pray for how much time did you spend reading your Bible foreign can you see your charts or your numbers clicking and start being honest with yourself we've received such a great revelation such a great gift from God I'm reminded of how Paul would have been delivered but yet it was because this abundance of Revelation that was given unto Paul he had a thorn in his flesh you feel you get so religious and lifted up God will allow something to come into your life I'm not saying Paul was but God will allow something to come in your life and humble you and get you back to where you're calling out for God get you back to your ABCs and Back to Basics I say Lord let me get back to basics Lord let me look at my life let me stroll it over let me see where I'm at let me see if if my graph is out of cater that I can actually start seeing the way that I'm living see if you you're in the faith search it out and see if everything is going just right see if the world still has got love so much it'll call you away from the things is really of God to the love of the world if it is brother check up right here stop right here and say Satan you take that dirty thing back I will not receive it Satan's tried to give some of y'all a a box of rattlesnakes he's trying to give you some some uh uh um app or some program or some uh membership to something to steal away your time well just receive the word if it's for you and it's time to clean house it's time to get down to business and I just love here as we read in our opening scripture is how John right in here in the in the he's writing the revelation of Jesus Christ and he says the reason that he was on the Isle of Patmos why was he there he was there for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ I like that if I'm going to be in a condition if I'm going to be going through something let me let it be for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ he said I am your brother and companion and tribulation you know I like that I am your brother and companion in Tribulation we're in this together if anybody could have said well you don't know you don't know you none of y'all have gone through what I've gone through I mean you know I was there with the Lord and and I was there after he was crucified and and if you only knew all the turmoil and torment that I've been through even before they've made me a Castaway out here on the aisle but yeah look at this look at what what John is saying I am your companion and tribulation he's not acting like I've done something more than anybody else but he's saying look we're in this together we're going through this together did Paul not say look when one member suffers we all suffer when one rejoices we all Rejoice I I like that that uh John writing that that Spirit of Christ say look I'm your fellow companion in Tribulation look we're going through this together church I want to know we're going through this together none of you are doing this alone if the devil has made you feel like you're all alone and you're going through this all alone in your family problems and your family history and what you're going through in your medical problems You Are Not Alone you have a group of Believers standing with you in prayer why don't you bring that need to the Lord and I we will see you get the victory but the devil wants to make you feel like you're all alone and that you're going through it all by yourself but oh if you can hear the words of the Lord say look I am your companion and tribulation oh he is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities John was in a bad place they're on the Isle of Patmos you know our pastor was preaching about spiritual environment John was in a bad place I like what our our Pastor said he said the one place that Satan can't Thrive or grow is in a holy spirit environment I say God I want to produce a holy spirit environment that where the things of this world and this Satan's Eden don't so easily trip me up and be setting sins or so right there at the door that it seems like every time I peek my head out I'm just getting hit every single time but no I've got my guard up I'm in prayer I've created such an atmosphere of prayer such an atmosphere of faith that I'm in that Holy Ghost anointing that I'm able to live that Victorious life but see when you start to let down the bar and you start to let down your prayer life and you start to stop listening to the word and you start to take the wrong attitude all of a sudden you find yourself stepping out behind the word and that's where that punch comes but I just want to uh bring this out because it here John is on the Isle of Patmos there he's been a Castaway he's been in prison and it was in this environment where no doubt you got the Scorpions and the snakes and the rocks and it's it the miserable living conditions but it's here on the Isle of Pat Mission opatmus means my killing because they had tried to kill John John was writing the Epistles and then now they tried to kill John and now they they made him a Castaway they cast him out on the Isle of Patmos which Patmos means my killing me uh my killing and just think now the enemy is trying to kill John they're trying to do away with him This was meant for John's destruction like get rid of this guy the enemy don't you know the enemy's trying to kill you he's trying to destroy you trying to do the same thing but I like I like how how Joseph had the Revelation when his brothers oh they were repented to him and said oh you know we we should have done this thing and he had the Revelation look what you meant for evil God has met for my good oh I tell you what if you're going through a trial right now and maybe you're just sick and tired of going through that trial just tell that Old Devil what you meant for evil God has intended for my good you just give that Old Devil a black eye tell that Old Devil he ain't one no victories he ain't done nothing he don't amount to nothing I might be suffering in my body I might be in pain I might be out there on the Isle of Patmos just to Cast Away and I might be out here in all of my misery and all of my pain but Old Devil all the what you can throw at me God's intended it for my good because it's bringing forth a character of gold tried and Fire well it's time we start take the word what the word and whoop the devil I don't know about you but I I like to take the word and whoop the devil what the devil means to destroy you look no weapon formed against you is going to prosper sickness death no weapon formed against you can prosper so just looking at this here John is he's banished to the island a Castaway he's in this horrible condition and I just think it's amazing how when you you even look at the history and you try to study it out you don't find John complaining about his condition you don't find John writing about how bad it was and writing about his infirmities you don't hear any of those things John talking about it look up the history even try to find things about the Alabama's look into all those things and try to fight it you don't hear John talking about that and I just want to say that it might look really bad for you might have been sick a long time the odds might be stacked up against you the doctors are saying look we've done all that we can do and I just don't know how you're going to be healed sorry this is the case we we we we've tried our best we've done all that we can do and you feel like all the odds are against me now you know it reminds me in scripture how one day that Jonathan was with his armor Bearer I believe Jonathan wanted to get something done his daddy was you know uh Saul was just something back and they weren't going to battle he said you know what come on Armor bear why don't we go over to the uh Philistines camp and put a whooping on him he said what is it to God that he would deliver us by many or by a few I said praise God I like that kind of Faith that's a man that knew what he was talking about he knew the victory wasn't because of their Spears he knew the victory wasn't because of their might he knew the victory wasn't because of their strategy their victory was because they were the sons of God and I want to tell you that's the same thing for you tonight your Victory isn't by your might your Victory isn't about how good you can quote the Bible your Victory doesn't know about how good you know the message your Victory is Jesus Christ your Victory is the word of God and faith is the victory that overcometh the world it ain't about what you did it's about what God's already done Faith looks past the odds Faith looks past the circumstance Faith looks at the Unseen Faith looks to the promise Faith doesn't know any defeat Faith creates Faith makes things come where no things could be brought faith is Victorious faith is that Sixth Sense I love the story but brother Branham tells about a couple had come to ask brother Branham for prayer for their son he had diphtheria I believe it's called and they had to dress them all up like a priest just to get him into the hospital and he came in there and brother Branham says I just prayed a little simple common prayer just bowed my head I just prayed a little simple common prayer and said amen and the couple they're in the hospital room the doctors have given them up it's gotten to the heart worst case they've seen he's gone the machines and all the the diagrams and everything impossible for them to come back he's in a coma he's gone a little simple common prayer I'm the couple upon that prayer when he said amen they got up said oh thank you Lord Jesus for healing our son isn't that wonderful sweetie and he started to hug each other and they started to rejoice what was it it was faith in the promise it was faith in the word it was faith in the prayer and faith is the substance not a hope so maybe so but faith is a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen so in the face of all the medical reports in the face of all the opposition the prophet of God with Saint Lucas he said oh I'll never forget it there was another nurse in there says I don't think you understand we've never seen a case this bad before he's gone what do you mean he's healed you see you can't talk like that Prophet said I I I'll never forget it the man went over and said put his hand on her shoulder said now dear you're trained to look at all those machines you're trained to look at all the instruments because that's all that you know to do but see we're not looking at an instrument we're not looking at machines we're looking at the promise oh Hallelujah I'm not looking at instruments tonight I'm not looking at my own ability I'm not looking up my flesh I'm not looking at my faults I'm not looking at my failures I am looking at a Divine promise he said I have perfected forever them I have sanctified that's what he did he said that he might present himself a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle now what are you looking at come on some Satan's been trying to beat some of you up if you're in this fight Satan's been trying to beat some of you up and point to your past and point to your failures and try to tell you you ain't good enough and you just failed again and you went back on that website and you just ain't no good and you're giving all your time over to these video games and all of these things and as long as you keep living under that condemnation you'll never come out from the bondage that Satan's trying to keep you in but if you'll finally just say devil shut your mouth I am a Son of God I have been made free and who the Son of God has made free is free indeed get your hands off of me you dirty rotten devil I'm gonna serve God I'm gonna walk in my healing I'm gonna walk in my Deliverance I'm in a walking Victory why because I'm looking at a promise oh Hallelujah that's the faith we're talking about that's the type of Faith that's the victory that's the kind of faith that produces an atmosphere that's the kind of faith that produces a holy ghost environment that's the kind of faith I want to have brother Branham says this in the masterpiece he says when we see Saint Paul Peter James John and all those who wrote the word and they wrote the word they wrote became become alive and lived and they wrote the word they wrote become alive and it lived and it lived and when we find after it began to get ripe John began to write in Epistles he was thrown on the Isle of Patmos after being burnt in oil for 24 hours maybe I should read that again he was thrown on the Isle of Patmos after being burnt in oil for 24 hours but the word must come forth it's got to be wrote they couldn't boil the holy ghost out of him with oil so he come forth his work wasn't finished he died a natural death now think about it in that condition and that trial they tried to stop him but God had to work for him to do I don't want to say right now in the midst of Satan's Eden where Satan is the God of this evil age he's the god of fashion he's the god of sports he's the god of entertainment he's the god of the internet he he's the God of all of these uh uh uh seducing spirits that are trying to seduce your mind and seduce your life and seduce you for your time he's the God of this evil age and everything is designed to stop the Bride of Jesus Christ but he cannot stop you because you have a job to do there is a work for the Bride of Jesus Christ to do I like how Jesus told Simon he's looking Simon the devil would sift you like wheat but I have prayed for you that your faith would not fail oh thank you Lord Jesus you know Jesus Christ prayed for you not only did he pray for you he prophesied over your life even over that you know the prophet of God said he spoke you into existence that means you're the word of God then if you're the word of God that means you can't fail that means you can't miss it oh that gets me I can't hear enough I tell me all day long who I am in Jesus Christ I don't get tired of it I don't get tired I'm sorry call me prideful I don't care well and my Lord tells me you're an overcomer you can do all things through Jesus Christ that strengthens you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world according as he hath chosen you in him before the foundation of the world that you should be holy and Without Blame before him in love blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impuce in there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus oh this is the secret the word is in the bride as it was in Mary she has the mind of Christ she knows what to do with the word or she stands still because I can't I can't hear it enough just keep telling me over and over because I love hearing love secrets from my Grooms but my my bridegroom oh just tell me more just like the song would say Elise or tell me more oh Rebecca I imagine she couldn't just get enough of it why don't you tell another story about my savior why don't you tell me another story about my redeemer why don't you tell me another story about my bridegroom I just can't hear enough because could you imagine when she finally got to her bride room oh Behold the Lamb of God the Lamb of God started to say your bone of my bone you are Flesh of My Flesh you are life of my life you are power of my power you are my pride everything that I am you are she is him you cannot fail I predestinated you not to fall I've called you in the most wicked age that has ever been on the face of the Earth but I'm proud of you you're going to make it why because I've predestinated you you cannot fall oh I can't hear enough of it it makes me excited it makes me want to shout because it's who I am go on keep telling me I ain't gonna stop you you ever had somebody give you a compliment why'd you stop go on a little bit longer it's like the prophet of God said one time somebody gave a compliment the brothers the the man said I don't like compliments brother Brandon said I do the difference between me and you as I'm telling the truth well I want to tell you go on I love to hear the words of my Lord telling me who I am telling me that I can make it telling me I can do all things tell me go eat all the world these signs shall follow them that believe why because there's something inside of me that says Amen to the word and I want to see that word coming to materialization and see the fruits of that word on display not to make me somebody no no that ain't it but there's a deep calling to a deep to see that word come into manifestation we heard this Wednesday I mean we heard this Sunday night God of this evil age we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of woman and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that is the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word where did he fall by disbelieving one word under the temptation of the enemy face to face now I can't say I can't interpret that under the interpretation of the enemy face to face only other than looking back and knowing what the original sin was in the Garden of Eden and how Satan incarnated The Serpent and beguiled Eve and preached another gospel face to face and got her to believe a lie if we've ever been face to face with demons and Devils before and Satan's Eden to beguile you on your I mean on your phone and on the internet and face to face you can't even walk out the door anymore about about being defiled by people stripped down and undressed if sin has ever been right in your face under Temptation again look we're right back we've come right back to the end to where we're face to face with sin again that same Temptation that Eve was faced with now it's right in our face the prophet of God said what is it the world is heading to a climax why the spirit of lawlessness moral Decay scientific religion has led to the cage of every hateful and unclean birds as the Bible said the prophet pointed out that Eve did not willfully just walk away and say I don't believe believe in God but he said it was the spirit of air we're not exempt from this church if we're not careful we will give over to a spirit of air that will make us think that we're okay in the condition but we must come back to the word of God we must come back to the urum thumam we must look into the message we must listen to the voice of Malachi 4 that says check up in your life look at your everyday life and see if you're bearing the fruits of the word it's time for a checkup if we're not careful what happens you're given over to a spirit of error you start to allow yourself to drift off the word of God and then oh oh what does the word say and then you believe a lie and you be damned for it and what happens then a strong delusion comes upon you and we have seen men that have believed this message and preached this message for 20 or 30 years come under a strong delusion because they they came face to face within well we just call it like it is they came face to face with the serpent again they came face to face with the devil's lies they came face to face with all of that nonsense and they didn't have the ability to take sides with the word they started to reason against it found themselves in a spirit of air and watched some of them how they walked they're with the message then they're I'm message-ish he's a man of God and literally walk them walk out from underneath the message oh I believe you know oh we're all Brothers we're all sisters he was a man of God he just got off at the end and they come right under that Antichrist murdering spirit it's not long until their their brother their sister well we just don't see it that way until all of a sudden that Spirit of air takes them into a strong delusion and an antichrist Spirit where they're now enemies to the faith and those Brothers you should not put your feet under the same table with according to the word unless it's to rebuke them and call them to repentance it's an antichrist spirit I say I pray oh God may I stay behind that word may I take sides with every word or if you look young people if you haven't been met with it yet the devil will try to get you to doubt this message and if he has it what are you doing maybe you haven't immersed yourself in it maybe you haven't made a declaration that you believe it maybe it hasn't had an effect on your life but when this message starts to have an effect and claim on your life and you start to walk in the truth of it the devil will be right there to challenge you on your faith and challenge if you really believe this message and you'll start to try to show The Faults he'll start to try to show the failures which there are none none no it's perfect it's a perfect message oh go ahead and dig in there and show me something okay fine that's what made it the masterpiece show your little blip on the radar it doesn't know it ain't a thing to me the only thing it means to me that oh if God could bring that kind of message through a man if God could bring the revelation of Jesus Christ through a man if God could catch a man up into the heavens into a constellation of angels and say go back and preach the revelation of the Seven Seals oh and to know he was a brother in Christ that he needed God just as much as I needed God if it wasn't for the grace of God you realize the prophet would have took his own life he would have been the murderer he tried to kill them boys I think he tried to kill a sheriff for his dog he tried to take his own life because of the despair if it wasn't for the grace of God but he had a work to do and just as they couldn't take John's life they tried to boil him for 24 hours they tried to take the life out of him even brother Branham tried to take his own life but there was something inside of him that said not even you brother Brandon could take your own life because I got a work for you to do and I want to tell you pride of Jesus Christ the devil and this Satan's in he's trying to Snuff you out he's trying to stop you he's trying to kill you but the word must come forth just as John was predestinated to bring forth the written revelation of the revelation of Jesus Christ the bride has been called in the end time to manifest the revelation of Jesus Christ and to bring forth every word and to manifest it Oh Glory to God what can stop you what can separate you from the love of God can famine sickness come on musicians might as well come what can stop you from manifesting this message what can separate you from the word of God can your faults can your failures no nothing nothing can stop why because God has predestinated you that you have a work to do and that's to believe every single word of this message you confide it you can kick and scream you can try to doubt it but oh just as they couldn't boil it out of John they said we don't know what to do with you I'll go put you on an island all by yourself and just think oh I love this just think John now he's on the Isle of Patmos seems like the worst place to be and it's there in that condition now I think about your condition your trial Satan's Eden your struggles it was in like it was in that condition John says and I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day chapter 4 he says oh and I looked and behold there was an entrance opened in heaven and I heard a voice of a trump saying come up hither John don't you realize it's in this Condition it's in this age that an entrance has been opened up into heaven to you though there's chaos and lewdness and seducing spirits and spirits of lawlessness and everything all around you in the worst condition there ever was John was caught up in the revelation of Jesus Christ and in Satan thing there's a bride who's been caught up in the revelation of Jesus Christ in an invisible Union together with him oh glory to God that makes me happy to think what we've become a part of you can play something please Oh Praise His wonderful name that's why you're here to prove to prove to Satan yeah you you that's why you're here this ain't by chance you don't believe this message by chance you are predestinated for it you were born for it pilate stood there he looked at our Lord and said are you a king [Music] he said thou sayest to this end I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world are you the bride are you the bride I want to hear the prophet say want to hear the Bible say Lord you say it [Music] can't we stand with the same faith that Jesus had and who he was say I am in the bride it's for this purpose that I was born it's for this purpose I came into the world for this purpose that I could prove God's word would not fail to prove that this bride is not like that Eve to prove I'm not going to sell my time not going to sell my efforts to spoil my Scourge to the things of the world [Music] because I got a job to do and Satan's trying to take my joy trying to take my peace trying to take my health she's trying to take the joy of my salvation but I'm going to be like John out on the Isle of Patmos and they're in the face of all my infirmities having been boiled for over 24 hours or not Cast Away on an island with without any good food or water and and here I am in all of my infirmities I'm not gonna I'm not gonna speak of any of those things foreign of Jesus Christ I'm going to speak the words of God I'm going to speak the word that has been spoken of me and see that word be manifest let's all stand [Music] prophet of God said when they signed the Constitution of the United States they put God in everything they did now they don't even have a meeting and they never even name his name that's right they depend on their loftiness of their science their cunniness of their science at the loot Bunch that's exactly right the whole world is swallowed up in ignorance of the Bible the whole world has turned from God but just think right out of the midst of all of that and all the church denominations and all their Seminary lewdness and everything God has took his prophet's word and chopped out a bride that will believe said he would do it he's hewed from that thing what he promised [Music] that was speaking of you the whole world has turned from God but just think right out in the midst of all of that he's taking the prophet's word you out of the world he's hewed you out of the denominations he's hewed you out of sin he chose you and elected you that you would be that manifestation oh that does me so good let's sing this song [Music] you alone are all I need foreign [Music] you alone are all I need you alone are you alone I need foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] like the presence [Music] I change forever are you afraid to sing it again to him or I am free his prison I am here in his presence [Music] pour your spirit out on me we fall just like the rain [Music] saturate my thirsty Storm come and fall fresh on me feel my confidence heal my heart and make me Lord I need you now for your spirit now Lord I Seek You foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] I think that that's what we all need to find time to [Music] let the Holy Spirit be our portion and you know when we stand in the face of God's word we so many times feel short you know and and we feel that you know I'm just not making it but that's when my heart always goes to that great word called Grace you know that's what makes a difference is his grace it's his intervention in our lives to change the inevitable outcome [Music] something is said on a course of catastrophe [Music] you've sowed so much that you know that you got to reap what you sow and everything looks impossible and the painting has you hanging over Hell by a thread then there's something that comes down from above [Music] it's him and it's called Grace he comes and intervenes and changes what was inevitable and we can never forget that that Grace will work in our lives it'll work in our children's lives it'll work on our behalf for our problems that's how God does what he does he does it by grace and when you're undeserving he precedes that Grace with Mercy and it's by Mercy and Grace that we survive not by power not by might but by your spirit saith the Lord and I think the greatest call is we heard the word denied is where's our heart at [Music] you know where's our heart at and I think that's the real challenge that we face today is every man looking to find out where his heart is and I hope our hearts can slowly turn to the things that are above and I'd like you to pray for me I'd like to bring a little sermon if I could Sunday morning about the body and and so if you would want to study and look up some quotes or scriptures you could be well fortified but I think there's something that God's doing and the way that he's moving and the direction that he wants us to go in and it's always hid in such a simple way and it's on my heart and uh I would like to your prayer for me that I could bring it out through the message of the hour that you could see that that's exactly what our messenger said because then we can anchor in it and his brother Matthew said tonight we know if it's the word we know it'll come to pass so let's continue to have that faith we need faith faith by grace it's our victory and if we just keep that humble spirit that feeding on God's word that gentleness about us that peace about us and that total reliance on him to get us through all this we'll make it through don't you believe that I believe with all my heart don't give up on any prayer request that you have don't give up on anything that you're holding on to don't give up on yourself because he hasn't given up and we're going to make it Church amen like the young man said when he stood in front of the Lord he said Lord help my unbelief and that's what I trust tonight so just before we go that's once again if you have a request on your art if you have somebody on your heart I know brother Otis is back home now resting they gave him a bypass let's keep him in prayer I saw the most beautiful grandbaby here the other day sister Hannah had just want to keep Josh and Hannah in prayer they had a beautiful baby where she had her child Caesarean so we want to keep her in special prayer I really believe God's doing a great work there so I'm thankful so let's believe are all things possible all things are possible so let us pray go ahead lift your heart once again to the Lord [Music] Lord with humility [Music] we come before you tonight in your presence we feel your presence here father we're needy of your spirit father or needy of a refilling and a reconsecration father as our brother spoke tonight of a chart of all the time and effort we put in so many different things father may we not fail to seek your face maybe not fail to ask for the intervention of your grace in your Holy Spirit and our life and father with the needs and requests that have gone up before you tonight Lord we humbly come before you not worthy not on any claims of ourselves father but on what you did at Calvary and father asking for your mercy be merciful to us O Lord [Music] we call on your kindness in your mercy and your grace we need your person more than we've ever needed your person before we need your presence in our hearts and our lives more than we've ever needed your presence before Lord Jesus father we need respect and reverence and kindness like we've never needed it before Lord Jesus create in us an atmosphere and a heart that we could have the faith that was spoken of tonight Lord we commit our request into your hands trusting Lord and knowing you promised that you would hear us we love you Lord Jesus [Music] and we ask that you pour your spirit out Lord as a pastor I believe that you've given me a place that I can intercede on behalf of the people not because of Personality father or knowledge or ability but because the office that you created and father I would make intercession for our congregation Lord that we become more sensitive to your Holy Spirit that we when we come together we wait on your spirit father that we give ourselves over to your spirit and allow it to move freely in our midst doing exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ever even ask or think
