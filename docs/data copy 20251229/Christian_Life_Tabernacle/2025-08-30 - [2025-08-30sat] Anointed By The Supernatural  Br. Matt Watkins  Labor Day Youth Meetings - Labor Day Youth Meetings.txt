And Father, where the devil would have come and tried to sew snares and hindrances, Lord, we want to invite you, Father. And Lord, bid you come and deal with each heart in a special way, the way only you can. Father, you hold the hearts of kings in your hand. You could take the hardest of hearts and soften it. Father, in one moment in your presence, Lord, all things become new. And Lord, that's what our desire is, Father, that you would come now.

Thank you for [Music] listen to our hearing. Oh, let your spirit sing. A song of praise and love from those who have redeemed. We will use the words we know to tell you what awome God you are. to tell you. &gt;&gt; Our loving father. Lord, we wish we had words. We wish we could write songs to express to you the love that you have shown us. But Lord, our hearts beat for you to walk with you, to talk with you, to be in your presence, to have you come by and just reach out and touch us. Let us know that it'll be all right. That you have everything in control and you know the beginning from the end and we don't have to worry. &gt;&gt; Father, may we find that loving peace that you so promised us that joy unspeakable and full of glory. That peace that surpass understanding. Father, it's all available to us tonight. And I pray, Father, that you would remove any hindrance that would keep us from looking upon your face &gt;&gt; and telling you what an awesome God &gt;&gt; that you are. &gt;&gt; We ask it this evening in Jesus' name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord. You know, a lot of times we we say that it's a young people's service and then the old people don't think they they should come. But you know, there's not a young people's gospel and an old people's gospel. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's been one gospel &gt;&gt; before there ever was ever time. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God &gt;&gt; and the word was God. &gt;&gt; So, we're so grateful for that. I I was thinking just as we were here and I thought, you know, man always believes in God and wants to meet God. They know that there is a God, but it's hard to make that God become personal to you. And the Lord made it easy for that to happen because of the way that he presented himself. And you know, he didn't present himself as one that uh would strike you dead if you look crossways or you better line up or you better be in fear else, you know, judgment's going to strike. You know, a lot of people think that's what church is. You know, boy, if the pastor uh gets on you, you know, you boy, you're in trouble and all that. No, he never did that. He presented himself as a father &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "You know which one of you having an earthly father &gt;&gt; and your child would want a loaf of bread that you would give him a stone?" He said, "Or or which of your earthly fathers uh if your child would desire a fish that you would give him a serpent?" &gt;&gt; See, he he wanted you to know that he's a father. &gt;&gt; He's not he he's he's not against you, that he's for you. And he wants to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think. &gt;&gt; And I and I, you know, I I I had a father. My father's passed on. And I I knew I could count on my earthly father. I knew that if I ever went bankrupt or or lost money or got ill, I knew my dad would be there for me. But one day, my father passed away and I didn't have that place of security. But I was able to turn and understand that I had a father. &gt;&gt; And sometimes our home life isn't what we wanted. Sometimes the way we were raised up wasn't what we wanted. Sometimes the past isn't the way that we wanted it. Sometimes we have a lot of tragedy and sorrow in our life. But the Lord always wants you to know that he's a father. And that's the heart that he said he when the the disciples said teach us to pray he said our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven hallowed be thy name &gt;&gt; and we and as we go forward in this weekend our our heart's desire for a long time is how do we go forward what where do we go from here and I I think we've got to reset our mind, reset our attitudes towards God and try to learn to know him how that he wants to be known instead of what men tell us to meet him ourselves. And so every little person here, young people, I know many of you from 12 to 20s, early 30s, all those great development years, all those years of mental struggle, all those years of trying to figure out who you are and where you're going, you know, and and but there's one thing that you I hope you come to know that you have a father. And he was your father before your earthly father. &gt;&gt; He knew you. He knew the parents that you would have. &gt;&gt; He even planned that your grandfather would meet your grandmother and your great greatgrandfather. And he he planned it all that they would come together all down through their family trees that you could be here today. I I I hope you can think about yourself that way is God knows me. He's the one that fathered me. &gt;&gt; He's the one that brought me here. I have a father &gt;&gt; and he knows my name &gt;&gt; and and and that's how he wants to present himself. And that father sent his only son. If I could say it this way, he sent our kinsman, &gt;&gt; which means our brother, &gt;&gt; our sister, one that was a part of our family. &gt;&gt; He sent him to us so that we might know that we're a part of the family of God. And so this great tonight, that's what my heart's desire is, is that we could draw closer to him and he could become to us what he desires to be to us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that we could come to the realization of that. And that if you could just think in your heart, if God be before you, &gt;&gt; who can be against you? God's on my side. &gt;&gt; He loved me. &gt;&gt; He knows me. He knows what I'm going through. He knows what I'm thinking. He knows what I suffered. And he's a father. And he wants to come by tonight and be that father to you &gt;&gt; and touch you and and supply to you whatever your need would be. If you would open your heart to him tonight, I believe that he would certainly come by and touch you and be for you what you need. For he knows what you have need of even before you ask. &gt;&gt; I'm needy &gt;&gt; and I have a father. &gt;&gt; What makes us family is we have the same father. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're privileged tonight to have Brother Matt Watkins with us and and uh to break the word of life to to to speak what's on his heart, to present to you a God that's real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As we said last night at the banquet, to tell you the truth &gt;&gt; because the truth sets you free. &gt;&gt; Jesus said he was the way, the truth, the life. So there's one truth. Let God's word be true and every word of man be alive. &gt;&gt; So God loves you tonight, young people. If you've never had a touch from him tonight or you don't you're up against something that you don't think that you can get through. If you'll just reach up tonight and say, "Father, Father, you're a father to me. You put me here. And you wouldn't have put me here if you wouldn't take care of me. &gt;&gt; And I need you tonight." and he will do exceedingly and abundantly above what you could ask or think. As we invite Brother Matt to come preach to us tonight, if we'd stand together, maybe we could sing that little tune, I have a father. [Music] He knows my name. I have a maker. He's the one that made me the way that I am. &gt;&gt; And I'm here tonight to touch him, to contact him, to feel his presence, to know that he's real. to take me from a where that I am to a greater and more meaningful life because without him I can do nothing. God bless you as we prepare our hearts for our brother. I have a maker [Music] before my heart and before even time began. My life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each and fall and hears me when I call. I have a thought. He calls his home [Music] and he'll never believe it. &gt;&gt; No matter where I go. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. [Music] He knows my Every thought he sees each tear that voice and he hears me well. &gt;&gt; Can you sing that again now? I have a father. Sing it to the Lord now. I have a father. [Music] He calls me his own. Yes, sir. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go. He knows my name. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. One more time. He knows my name. Sing that again now. And he knows my name. [Music] &gt;&gt; He knows I am. every thought. He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you glad that you have a father? Amen. Tonight, the Bible says that he has not given us the spirit of fear. Amen. But of power and of a sound mind. Amen. You believe that? You know why? Because we've got the voice of our father. Amen. And I believe that he's here to speak to us tonight. How many just want to say, "Lord, I want to listen to what you have." Let me be sensitive to what you have, Lord. Amen. Didn't come to hear the voice of a man. Amen. But I came to hear the voice of my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless you. Amen. This evening, such a privilege to be here with you. Amen. Just count it such an honor. Amen. I wonder just before we go to the word if there maybe you just bow your heads with me all around the building. Wonder if there'd be a need maybe something upon your heart. Amen. Gathered in a place like this. And we've sang, we've worshiped, we've felt the atmosphere and the the blowing of that wind of Calvary, amen, has blowed through this building. But I wonder if there'd be somebody here tonight that just would lift a hand and say, "Lord, I need a touch from you." And I I'm just going to raise it up, Lord. My need, Father. I'm going to hold it high, Lord. And I'm going to say, "Here it is, Father. Behind this hand is a need that's represented maybe for a mother, a father, a daughter, a son. Whatever it would be tonight, Lord Jesus, you told Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" Nothing is Jesus. Lord, you said in your word, if you ask anything in my name and don't doubt, you'll have what you ask for. Your prophet taught us when we ask, believe. Lord, he preached a message called Believe from the Heart, Lord. And that's what we want to do tonight. We want to believe from our heart that when we ask, Lord, you're going to do it. Now, God, the same God that so constrained me, Lord, even in the back office before I came out here and turned my whole direction around and gave me my text, Lord, something, Father, I didn't come to these this to this to these meetings, Lord, even expecting to preach. But Lord, you're in divine control, Lord. I believe it's only because you work on both ends. And there's a there's a Lord, a little lamb that's crying out. It has a need, a father, and from their heart, Lord Jesus, they're asking for a touch from the master. Now, Lord, if that little woman with that blood issue, your prophet taught us that you, Lord, that the father showed you everything. But your prophet said that little woman with that blood issue, Lord, he didn't show you that. That's why when she reached out and touched you, you said, "Who touched me?" &gt;&gt; Lord, your prophet said that from her need, she reached out. &gt;&gt; From her need, Lord, she reached out a hand of faith and said, "If I could just touch the hymn of his garment, then everything will be changed. Everything will be different." Now, God, your prophet taught us if we come on the same basis of anyone we find in the Bible, Lord, that you're obligated to do the same thing tonight. So Lord, we lift up our hands. We represent our need and say, "Jesus, I am reaching out with the arm of faith, Lord, believing that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And you're here to speak to minister to your needs, the needs of your children, Lord. May you just take us one and all, Father. Help us to, Lord, just to set aside our minds, our Lord, any thoughts, anything that would be a hindrance, Lord, and may we just focus in on what you have to say. We ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we give the Lord a hand clap of praise? He is worthy. He's worthy. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Second Kings chapter 2, if you have your Bible, I count it. Such an honor. Amen. Brother David, thank you so much for having us. And brother Matthew, Amen. for the vision that you have for these meetings and the young people. Amen. I just uh I just believe that Amen that God puts those kind of burdens upon men's heart. We don't just come up with those kind of things, but Amen. the Lord puts a a thought, a burden, an idea, have a banquet, have meetings. Amen. Aren't you glad that that God is in control? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we believe he's ordained these services. And so I just want to if I don't get a chance to say that, just want to say how honored we are. Amen. and and just consider myself, Amen, the least that could stand here and minister and and uh but I'm just uh I want to say, you know, I learned a long time ago how to let off the pressure from my insufficiencies and and incapabilities and and uh and because I'm not, you know, I feel like brother Brandon when he said, I Lord, you called me and I was never I was never sufficient from the day you called me. Amen. And I feel like that sometimes. But you know what? I read what the Apostle Paul said. Apostle Paul said, "I am what I am &gt;&gt; by the grace of God." &gt;&gt; And can I just say that's enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to be somebody. I don't have to be somebody great. I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's enough. Amen. But we just want to uh minister to you tonight. And I just feel so burdened from the Lord uh even from the back. The Lord just took me in a different direction here. And so I just believe it's the Holy Spirit going to minister to you to something on something I've spoken before and I trust it'll be a blessing to you. Amen. I want to look at 2 Kings chapter 2. I'm going to title this service here tonight anointed by the supernatural. How many believe in a supernatural God? &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many believe that that supernatural God can become and touch a realm that is very natural? Amen. Because here we are. I'm here today. I'm I'm I you know, my my soul's been translated into the kingdom of God's dear son, but I'm still in a human body. I still got weaknesses. I still got struggles. I I still have battles. I still have trials and tribulations. Anybody else? &gt;&gt; Anybody else have problems and issues? Anybody got a need? &gt;&gt; You mean I'm not preaching to theophanes here tonight? You're all just like me. Amen. But I'm glad we got a God &gt;&gt; who the Bible says, "Whatsoever you bind on earth, it shall be bound. Whatsoever you loose, it shall be loosed." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we know that we could touch that supernatural God. And I believe he wants to do that here tonight. Amen. And so we just want to give him liberty. Amen. And give him full sway. Let's begin reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse one. And it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha, "Try here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Bethl." And Elisha said unto him, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." So they went down to Bethl. The verse four says, "And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, Tarry, here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho." And he said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." So they came to Jericho. Verse six says, "And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan." And he said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." Now, the prophet of God takes these three cities, Jericho, Bethl, and Jordan, and he makes and he tells us that they were representative of actually a stage of our Christian journey. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said it was a type of justification, sanctification, and then receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. But then beyond just an anointing that comes on your flesh, you've got to receive the person of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "You can't stay. You've got to come to each city, but you can't stay there cuz you got to cross Jordan." &gt;&gt; And brother Barham says that his life was a type of us. Even he to points at Abraham and says Abraham's life was a type of us. Came out of a city of heathens. And and and and we know all of that. and and but God doesn't just leave him with Abram. He actually gives him a name change. So God does doesn't leave us at justification, nor does he leave us at sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor does he leave us with just a gift of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; but he was going to give Abram not just to something in his flesh, but he was going to go further than that. Not just an experience on his flesh. He was going to change his body. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet of God tells us and who is this Melzdc? What God did for Abraham is what he wants to do for every believer. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, do it in my life." &gt;&gt; And notice here because all of these cities are going to be important. But he keeps moving him further. And and then he says here in verse six, Terry here. And then he says here in verse 8, "And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters, and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground. And it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for thee." Isn't it amazing? &gt;&gt; He asks him a question. Ask what I shall do for thee. Another word, Sister Hattie. &gt;&gt; It's what you say. You see, brother Brandham said that he's talking about the squirrels and he says, "I don't know what it was except Jehovah Gyra." And he said, "Sister Hadt," he said, "That's nothing but the truth, Brother Brandham." Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said in one place when she spoke those words, it felt like the room was about to come apart. &gt;&gt; You mean that? You You're telling me, brother Matt, you think our words, our amens to the word of God don't do anything? What would have happened had she sat there and thought to herself or just gave a good nod? But she spoke and when she did something natural, it moved something supernatural. &gt;&gt; You see, your words have the ability to control your atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away." Now watch this here very closely. And Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads one more time. Lord Jesus, Father, we're so grateful for your divine presence. Lord, for you've made a divine promise that wherever two or three would be gathered, there you would be in our midst. Lord, now we're gathered here, Father. We came with one purpose, Lord. One objective, one goal, Lord. And I just want to say, Father, that my there's nothing more important in this service than that that we touch you, Lord. I pray, God, that you would just come right now. May this sermon be a gospel trumpet, Lord. And may when it blows, may it set every captive free, Lord. I pray that you would come and have your perfect way, Lord, as we just humble ourselves before your mighty hand or just your servant, Lord. Now, God, may you come and do what only you can do. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated. I want you to keep your place there in second Kings. And I just want to continue reading from there. The Bible says that he said, "Let a double portion," let's pick it up here in verse 9. "Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." And he said, "Thou has asked a hard thing." Now, I got a question. Who was it going to be hard for? You think it was hard for God? No. You think it was hard for who it was going to be hard for was Elisha? &gt;&gt; You see, as brother Brandham was told when the vision with the prophecy over his life with Danny Henry, he's told because you have chosen the harder way. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for, you know, great great things, not a museum to be made to your name, not a fleet of Cadillacs, but because you made a choice of a harder way. In other words, I didn't force you. I didn't pressure you, but you by your own choice chose the harder way. And I love the words of that that vision that prophecy says, "But it's my way." &gt;&gt; And so it's going to be a harder thing not for God, but for Elisha. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Nevertheless," notice this promise here. And he says, "Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so. What's so amazing about this verse is so powerful in verse 10. If you go and look up the Hebrew, actually the original Hebrew text, it's saying something that perhaps you've never caught before. I believe it's so uh so powerful that it's it's not it's not in the not just in the sense that Elijah is saying, Elisha, when I go, if you see it happen, then it will come to pass. And if you if you're if you're if you're distracted, then it won't. That's not really all it's saying. But actually what the Hebrew is transliterated to mean is that if you see, if you perceive, if you regard, if you look upon, to be taken, to be carried away, to be removed from you, with you, from your side. It literally means if you perceive me when I'm removed as being removed from you, &gt;&gt; then it will come to pass. In other words, Elisha, what I'm Elijah is saying to Elisha, you must accept that I'm leaving. You must come to grips with not waiting for Elijah to come back. Not waiting for what God's going to do for Elijah, but Elisha, you've got to see Elijah has been taken. And there's still a work for you to do. There's still a job for you to do. There's still an anointing upon your life. You've got to see Elijah is gone. Elisha And in other words, what he's saying is if Elisha clung to Elijah, wishing him to remain, then it wouldn't come to pass. &gt;&gt; I think it's just the same exact way for us, my brother, my sister. Let me just say it to you this way. God's prophet has ran his race. He has receive to me friends. He ran his race faithfully, and God anointed him for the job. But our work is still here. And there's still a commission on. There's still a job for the Church of the Living God to do. And you've got to stop looking for Elijah and start realizing that the same God that was with Elijah is still with Elisha tonight. &gt;&gt; And that's why there was a search of prophets that went for the for a search of prophets and men, the school of the prophets going to look for for Elijah. Where's Elijah? I tell you what though, Elisha didn't go on that search party. He went to the Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah and he didn't say, "Where's Elijah?" And when he came to his needs, he said, "Where's the Lord God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; And so notice here, I want you to pick it up here. He says, he says, the Bible says here in verse 11, and he says, "It came to pass as they still went on and talked, and behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both aunderder, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." Notice this here. The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and ripp them into two pieces. And verse 13 says, "He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoke the waters and said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; When he had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over. I think this is so such a powerful moment that we find here and it's just one example we could use to where Elijah is leaving. He's going home. He in fact knows that. So he intentionally takes Elisha to these cities. These were in an intentional journey. Elijah was going to take him to Bethl and to Jordan and to Jericho. &gt;&gt; And what's amazing about this is that Elijah knows his departure is soon. You know, I believe, and you don't have to agree with this, it's just my own opinion. I believe that brother Brandham knew when he was about to leave the scene. I believe there was things that you could find on the tape with him saying things like this. He'd come to what house will you build me? And then he comes, you know, even before that, and he's saying things like, "I'm so thankful for your young pastor here that stands for the word of God and and and men of God like him that will take these truths and sweep it on unto the coming of the Lord." Let me let me just tell you what a prophet's vision was. His vision was never to body body up all of the power of God into one vessel. His vision was never to to take and lay aside all of the other ministers and all of the gifts and all of the the you know the b the rest of the body and just empower just have all the power bodied up in one man. No. But the prophet had a vision, my brother, for an entire unified bride that knows who they are, knows their God, knows their position, and comes to their calling because they've got a work to do. &gt;&gt; I know that we'd all love Brother Brandham to be here. But guess what? If he was here, we'd close our churches. We'd all move to his church. No, we wouldn't have no pastors and no other brothers. God knew what he was doing when he took his prophet home &gt;&gt; because he knew that as long as Elijah was waiting Elisha was waiting for Elijah. Then what could Elijah? Now listen, Elisha is not going to be Elijah. It's amazing. He was never going to actually repeat the same miracles that Elijah. So God didn't want him going to hold a tent, you know, and and and all of these kind of things and try to do the same miracles and have the same gift of discernment. Listen, none of us will ever have the gifts that Brother Brandham had in his ministry. God did it for a certain reason. &gt;&gt; I said God did it for a certain reason. &gt;&gt; But let me just say to you, none of those gifts was what really attracts the bride. It wasn't the miracles. It wasn't the healing. It wasn't even the blind eyes. It wasn't the deaf ears. I'm thankful to God for all of those things. I'm thankful for the miracles. I I believe in miracles. But can I tell you that when he went to Sabino Canyon, the B the the the the the voice spoke to him and said, "This is the vindication of your ministry." It wasn't miracles. It wasn't signs. It wasn't wonders. It was a sword. And brother Brandham says, "What is this? This is the word of the Lord." Listen, I'm thankful for all of the miraculous, but the vindication of this message is that it's Jesus Christ, the same as he was in the Bible when he walked on the shores of Galilee. what came back to the earth again in the ministry of a prophet. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so Elijah's Elisha is not going to repeat the same things, but he takes him very intentionally to these to these cities. And it's amazing because you notice this here. He asks him this question. What do you need, Elisha? &gt;&gt; What do you say, Elisha? Whatever you say. It's a powerful thing to me when you think about this because fear has a connection. You could watch this in brother Brandham's prayer lines even in some of his meetings and he would talk about how that he would preach and he said what was that? He said a demon screamed &gt;&gt; and he said then a demon from over here screamed. What's that demon doing? It's looking for help. It's trying to make a connection. You remember brother Brandon talking about this? &gt;&gt; And and the prophet of God says, "Sister, the same thing that's wrong with you is wrong with that sister over there." And he says, "And this sister was about to get free. So that demon spirit begin to cry out asking for help." And notice, he says, "And there's a dark streak or a line that is connecting this with this demon with this demon." And he says, "Oh, how I only wish that my lovely audience could be in this dimension to see that." So what a prophet does is he peers into a realm of the unseen of the dimension that we have no, you know, even here would never want to see. Honestly, some of the things brother Brandon describes, I wouldn't want to ever see. &gt;&gt; Be honest. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon begins to tell us how that fear had a connection and that one spirit or demon was crying to help for another. That's why depression loves depression. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. You know what the devil will do? He'll take something in your life that is bothering you and he'll bring somebody else with the same spirit, with the same struggle, with the same problem and connects you with them &gt;&gt; because he knows that company demon spirits, misery loves company. What you ought to do is recognize the devil and his tactics and realize you got to you got to find a friend that that has had victory over the same thing you're struggling with and say, "I'm going to surround myself with someone who God has has given them victory in their life." Don't put yourself around somebody else that has the same problems. Connect yourself with somebody that has faith that has that has uh God has worked in their life to overcome that spirit. Now, I want to tell you something here tonight. If fear has a connection, then faith has a connection, too. &gt;&gt; That's why you're a man. Start charging someone else's faith to pull on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't don't you I'm just going to preach what the Bible says. The Bible says Paul and Silas were in a prison bound by chains, right? &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that they started praising God. What were they doing? They were creating the right atmosphere. You see, they didn't have no power within themselves to let their chain to to loose their chains. If they did, they would have. But they knew if they could and if they could summon an angel, &gt;&gt; if they could summon another power stronger than them, so they start singing praises and him. But let me tell you what happened as they begin to sing in their darkness, &gt;&gt; in the midst of their trial, the Bible says that those chains that they were bound with suddenly were loosed. But you know what's so powerful about that? It wasn't just Paul and Silas who the Bible says went free, but actually the entire prison lost the the the devil lost a grip on the whole church. You see what happens when one person can break through in victory. When one person can get victory in the Holy Ghost, it'll break the chains in the church of the living God. That's why an atmosphere, brother Brandham tells us you create your own atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Tells us another place that you operate the gift. &gt;&gt; And so pulling on the word of God, the natural, the prophet of God says, types the supernatural. &gt;&gt; And he says the natural and the supernatural run together. &gt;&gt; Right? Hello. And so now notice this question. What what what will you have me to do? Now watch how Elijah takes him to these cities. Here was Jericho. This was a city that was on that time at the days of Elijah's ministry was on fire. They were in revival. You know what God did in the city of Jericho with Rahab. And then he takes him to Bethl. This is where Jacob dreams a dream. And the scripture says he wakes up from out of his sleep and says, "Surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not." This is none other than the house of God. And he names the name of that place, Bethl. What was it? And the ministry of Elijah at the beginning of his ministry, they were on fire. Revival fires were burning. Bethl was also a city. Jordan, we know is where Joshua crosses over uh uh uh the Jordan River. And we know the victory. But oh, how different was these cities from the early stages of Elijah's ministry to the ending when he's about to go home. &gt;&gt; Now, those same cities are mocking the prophet, &gt;&gt; called him old body &gt;&gt; and it's young people. Listen to me, friends. I believe it's no different today. People love the ministry of brother Brandon when he was, you know, with the blind eyes were being open and miracles. They all wanted him in their meetings. Come to our tent. let's hold a revival. &gt;&gt; But when he came to his real ministry, &gt;&gt; he comes to what house will you build me? And said, I never want to start a church. I never wanted to start a church here in Tucson, but I sat here for eight months and you wouldn't have me preach in your pull pits. They had closed the doors &gt;&gt; to Christ &gt;&gt; and put him out of his own church. &gt;&gt; This was the ministry of Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; And now those same cities are mocking the prophet of God. Don't want anything to do with him. &gt;&gt; You know that Perry Green said the reason he started a church, this is in his own testimony, the reason he started the Tucson Tabernacle, he said because I wanted a church where I could say the name William Brandom and it wouldn't offend anybody. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if Brother Brandham could see us today? We have churches across the globe that not only are we not ashamed to say the name William Brandom, we are identified with that messenger. That's why the voices of thousands of people said we are resting upon that. &gt;&gt; What was it? Our life I our testimony is resting upon this. You preached what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; And the same ministry that was in the first age comes back at the last age again. And now these same cities that were in revival now have closed the door. &gt;&gt; And and and Elijah brings him. You you notice some of the most powerful things that took place. I just want to show you here for a moment. Look at Joshua. If you have your Bible, Joshua chapter 4. Can we just turn there here for a minute? I I I I just want to catch this and not miss it. The Lord just brought this to to me just now. So I just want to make sure we don't miss this. Notice what happens here. And here's Jordan. Came to pass when all the people were clean passed over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua. Now notice what's going to happen. They're about to cross Jordan. Now remember, Jordan represents sin. It represents death, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's so amazing when you look at how different this was from the days when when Moses, the prophet of God, crosses the Red Sea. Jordan's very much different than the Red Sea. Here you got a prophet of God, you know, the Ten Commandments displays it very perfectly. And you got Moses and he's got the staff and and the lightning, you know, uh uh you know, flashing and and here's this great big old sea and this great big old water. And God says, "Why cry unto me? Speak and let the children of Israel go forward." And Moses comes to the water, a prophet, and and he plants the staff in in the Red Sea. And and the David said it this way, the water stood up as two heaps. And here they are in this great, you know, granduous uh great ocean. But here's Joshua and it's not that at all. &gt;&gt; Now you don't have no prophet. You don't have no Moses, &gt;&gt; but you have the ministry of Joshua. &gt;&gt; And now you have 12 priests who Levitical priests who God is going to use this crossing also different than how they came out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? &gt;&gt; It's the Jordan River now. It's swelled up. It's flooded. It's higher than it's ever been. But it's no nothing looks the same as when Moses crossed the Red Sea. But yet God, the same God who parted the Red Sea is about to part the Jordan River. &gt;&gt; And he's not going to use a Moses. He's going to use the 12 men. This is what your Bible says. He's going to use Levites under the ministry of the Holy Ghost. Oh, I wish you'd preach with me. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, God says, "I'm not going to do it the same way you crossed the Red Sea, but I'm going to use ministry. &gt;&gt; I'm going to use a man from each tribe." And so God says, "I want you," notice here in verse two, let's read it here. He says, "Take you 12 men of the people, out of every tribe, a man. command them, saying, "Take you hints out of the midst of Jordan." Notice, out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm. I love the way the Bible says that. &gt;&gt; In other words, they weren't wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; They weren't a jellyfish. &gt;&gt; But my Bible says they stood firm. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a it's it's something different when you're standing, you know, sort of not knowing really where you stand on how your holiness and how you should dress and what are you know, all of these kind of this is the world we live in, friends. It's a wishy-washy world. Ain't nobody got any standards anymore. They're afraid to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; They're they're afraid to hurt anybody's feelings. Afraid to step on anybody's toes. &gt;&gt; You know, you got to modernize it. Don't say it the way Brother Brandham said it cuz it might hurt somebody's feelings. &gt;&gt; You know, water it down some a little bit, Brother Matt. Dumb it down some. Don't you know this is the Antichrist spirit that Brother Brandham said would come into the church. That antichrist spirit was never there to make us a bunch of word rejectors. He knows he's not going to get anybody to shut to turn the a true minister of God to, you know, to turn the message away. That wasn't the goal of the antichrist. It was to water the word down &gt;&gt; to make it lose its effect. &gt;&gt; And they're afraid to say anything. Oh, don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. Don't want to hurt the, you know, the the famous person over here. Don't want to, you know, you know, don't want to step on anybody's toes. Yeah. I got a friend back home and he said, "Yeah, one of his my favorite statements." He said, "Feelings are overrated. &gt;&gt; Put that on a t-shirt and wear it somewhere." I said, "Feelings? I just got news for you. I I want to tell the ministry in this last day, brother. Don't worry about my feelings. Tell me the truth. I want to know the word, what the word says. Don't worry about whether it hurt somebody's feelings. Just preach it the way God said it." And I believe there's a people that say, "Preach the word of God. Preach it the way a prophet spoke it. Don't water it down, brother. Don't try to worry about my feelings. Just say it the way God told you to say it." &gt;&gt; Their feet stood firm. &gt;&gt; Now, notice this here. He says, "Take you out of each place, the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm, 12 stones." &gt;&gt; And notice what he's going to do with these stones. And you shall carry them with you. leave them in the lodging place where you shall lodge this night. Verse four, Joshua called the 12 men. Verse 5, and he then he goes down to verse six and says, "That may be a sign among you that when your notice, children, ask their fathers." Come on, message believers. Anytime you see children and fathers, you ought to catch something there because my Bible says he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. And now Joshua is saying that this may be a sign that when your children, oh, when children begin to look back in the word and say, "Where's the God of the Bible? Where's the God of the supernatural? Where's the God I read about that work through Moses and worked through Daniel? What was it?" children would begin to get hungry for a revival and say, "Where's the God we read about?" &gt;&gt; And notice, God was not going to leave it though were great. Though the though the the fathers and elders were great, he wasn't going to leave it just a story that a dad told or a mom told or a grandpa told. Stories are wonderful, brother, but you've got to have your own revelation. &gt;&gt; You can't have a story just that you heard about. And so God says, "These stones," &gt;&gt; in other words, it will be these rein divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Take you 12 stones that this may be a sign." When they say, "What menu you when they ask?" Notice this here in verse six. What mean you buy these stones? Then you shall answer the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When you when when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever. &gt;&gt; What were these stones going to represent? Where the feet of the fathers stood. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I said we're the feet &gt;&gt; of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Stood firm. &gt;&gt; And it would be us turning back to the faith of the apostolic, &gt;&gt; not Isuza, not 1906, &gt;&gt; not just a work of not just Pentecost. Brother Brandham said that wasn't even really true. Pentec the restoration of Pentecost. If that wasn't, what do you think this is? The prophet of God said it over and over and over that's replete throughout the message that the message of the hour of Malachi 4 was to turn the faith of you back to the faith of the original apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; Can I preach what a prophet preached? There is one standard. There is no other standard. There's one pattern. There is no other pattern. What the church was on the day of Pentecost is the standard. That is the pattern. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go a little further? No matter that scholars tell you the apostolic age is over, don't you believe it? As long as God is calling men to preach the gospel, there's still an apostolic age. And brother, I want to tell you with the restoration of the apostolic word would come apostolic power in the Holy Ghost to defeat the devil in your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not a time to go backwards. This ain't a time to to water it down. It's a time to preach it and to go forward. Like brother David said, not for fear or favor of men, but preach the word of God. &gt;&gt; And notice he says, "Take these stones where the priest's feet stood firm." &gt;&gt; And so these men walk over to Jordan. You imagine what they're feeling like. Couldn't a prophet come? Could Couldn't Couldn't God send? This is death. I mean, this is the B. This is the translation. &gt;&gt; If if we don't cross here, what's the purpose of God even taking us out of Egypt? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? What do you mean, God? You want me to do it? &gt;&gt; God says, "Take each man." Come on, Joshua. You could do it. No. God says, "You got a part to play in this." &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is going to do it, but he's going to do it through men. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the Bible says that the Bible was written by holy men of God who were moved by the Holy Ghost. God wasn't going to take his finger and write it. He was going to put it in the mouths of men and their words would become what you read in a Bible. &gt;&gt; But it's not the words of man. It's the words of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on, Joshua. You could do it. No. He says, "Levi, I need a man. Dad, I need a man. Reuben, give me a man. Simeon, give me a man. Benjamin, give me a man." And out of each one of the tribes would be a man that would represent that entire tribe. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says they walk into Jordan. And now this is very different. No staff. But the scripture says, "And when the souls of the priest feet, &gt;&gt; footsteps mean &gt;&gt; when they touch, not when they think about it, &gt;&gt; not when they contemplate it, &gt;&gt; but you've got to put action to your faith. When they put their foot in the Jordan, Jordan will part just a little bit. &gt;&gt; And then they put another, then it parts a little more. &gt;&gt; Then they put another and it parts a little more. And before you know it, there's a highway. &gt;&gt; And you have Gad here. You have a man for Reuben here. Listen. Listen. Come here, brother. Let me use all four of you. All look perfect here tonight. I want you to notice what Notice what he does there. Come here, brother David. I want you to face this brother right here. And come here, brother. Come here, brother. Brother, you stay there. Stay here. Now, this is just four, but I want you to imagine because this is the picture that your Bible paints for you. This is how, listen, not them coming out of Egypt, but this is how they cross over Jordan. &gt;&gt; And God says, this is how we're going to cross. That the ministry will stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; That the ministry will stand in the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Now, listen. Jordan is full of it's it's a it's representative of death. It's representative of fear. And they stand there with their feet. Listen, planted firm &gt;&gt; because the rest of the tribes, the rest of the people are going to so depend upon their stand &gt;&gt; that they're not wishy-washy, &gt;&gt; that they're not jellyfish, that they're not questioning Jo Joshua. Come on, somebody. that they're not questioning Moses, &gt;&gt; but it will be their stand. And the Bible says as long as they stay in the water, Jordan will part. And so, mother, father, little babies, &gt;&gt; they begin to cross &gt;&gt; through the other side with the voices of the ministry on either side, taking a stand for the word of God. &gt;&gt; All right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And as long as they stay in Jordan and stay standing for the word, &gt;&gt; then Jordan has to stay out of people's lives. &gt;&gt; But I got a question for you. What would happen? &gt;&gt; What would happen, brother, &gt;&gt; if these men put their Bibles down like some people want them to do? &gt;&gt; What would happen if these men stopped preaching the word of God? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. What would happen if they okay, not preached, but what would happen if they started watering it down? &gt;&gt; What would happen and say, you know, we really don't have to stand with my foot firm like that. You know, I think that was I think that was Joshua's opinion. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I know that what year was that? Was it after 63 or before 63? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, why do we got to say, brother Brandham said, and brother Brandham, aren't we ever going to get past quoting a prophet? I had a brother tell me that. Brother Matthew said, "Aren't you ever going to get past quoting a prophet?" I said, "Buddy, you if you're waiting for me to stop saying, Brother Brandham said, you better just go ahead and give up now." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, why do we got to quote a prophet?" I said, "Well, let me just tell you what I believe. Jesus quoted a prophet &gt;&gt; and said that it might be fulfilled the word spoken by Isaiah." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist quoted a prophet. Paul quoted prophets. And I believe it's my liberty to say what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What would happen if they started questioning? Well, that was just Brother Baron's opinion. Don't you see how important it is &gt;&gt; that we stand firm? &gt;&gt; You see what would happen if these brothers stepped out of the Jordan? Jordan would begin to creep in our churches. &gt;&gt; Sin would become to the to our churches, to our families. We'd look no different than the mega church down the street. &gt;&gt; What would happen if they stopped and compromised on the word of God? Who would be at risk? You, your children, your family. Oh, I say like never before, you ought to thank God for a minister that will tell you the truth. You ought to say, "Pastor, stay in Jordan. Don't compromise this word of God. You ought to thank God that God put a man over your life that stands for the word of God. Thank you, brothers. I'm going to tell you what, I preached that to a church in Honduras. Brother David, I was there and I got to be careful even how I say this because I wouldn't want to be careful because there's I was there just just last year and and and I didn't know I was there preaching for multiple churches. I think I preached at I forget how many it was, six or seven. And the pastor was a wonderful pastor. He took me around. I didn't know where I was preaching the next night, where it would be and take me to there and take me here and and the next service was just another church I was going to and we're going to go there and and this big city and I'm going to preach for these believers. And so I'm just praying about what I preach, Lord. What what would you have me say? I don't even know. You know, it seemed like the Lord has given me something different. And no matter where I went, God would just give me something a need to to meet the need. And uh and so so the brother he he goes to he's a he's a teacher there and he he picks me up. I'm at the house all day just preparing really just torn between directions. And uh and he gets me there in the afternoon and we got about a two-hour car drive and it's me and him and the pastor's wife and we're driving there to that church and he says, "Brother Matt," he says, "Do you know what you're going to preach on tonight?" I said, "No, brother." I said, "I've just really honestly I'm I'm really just praying. I got I I just I'm struggling to find the mind of the Lord. You just pray for me." He said, "Okay, okay, brother." And about that time, the Holy Spirit just dropped in my heart with a sermon that I hadn't preached in a very long time. Didn't have it anywhere on my in my notes that I had prepared for even for that trip. And I stopped and I said, "I got it. That's it." And he says, "You have it?" I said, "I got it, brother." I said, "The Lord just gave it to me. I know what I'm going to preach." &gt;&gt; And he said, "What's the title?" I said, "Well, the title is the truth shall make you free. because that's what your Bible says. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the truth will. It says the truth will make you free. &gt;&gt; And and and he he he quotes he says yes. And he says my two opening scriptures. &gt;&gt; And I thought, my goodness, how did that brother know what my scriptures were? And it was my two scriptures I was going to read out of John. We get to that church. And so I just begin to prepare and there's about three or 4 hundred believers there. big old building, you know, and and just really long. Just seemed like it was just a really really long just a lot of believers. And they sing, "I don't know nobody. Don't know no nothing. Didn't don't know anything." And just there to preach. I knew what I was going to preach. I walk out to the platform and I read my opening text. And that brother had been interpreting me that entire trip, but he was a different man in that service. In fact, at one point, he was so anointed, he almost knew what I was going to say before I started wondering who's the translator and who's the preacher. I'm serious. You laugh, but he was standing on my right when I started. About midway through, he was here and I was on his right. And he's so preaching it with such passion. And in that sermon, I I I spend a lot of time about what is truth and the truth that's been restored and how important it is that we speak the truth because it's only the truth can set you free. &gt;&gt; And you can't dance around it. You can't worry about what people will think. You just got to sometimes you just got to speak it. &gt;&gt; And and and I begin to preach that and I use that same example out of what we just now read here in Joshua 4. And I and and I wanted to use that example. So I called out four men out of that church randomly. I just said, "You, brother, you brother, you." And then I looked at the very back. There's a brother. I said, "You, brother." He said, "Me?" I said, "Yeah, come here. Come here." So he comes up and I I use the same exact example, brother Matthew, with those brothers and I put my arm over on one of them as I just now did just now said I said what would happen if these brothers started questioning saying we don't need to quote a prophet we don't need to know what say what brother Brandham said and the church all I know is at that moment a volcano erupted in that building &gt;&gt; and that church just was like an earthquake and I thought my goodness I don't even know what happened. I get out to the car and and and the brother tells me as soon as they close the door, his wife starts sobbing. Says, "Brother, you have to tell brother Matt now." He said, "Brother Matt, I want to tell you that what happened tonight was nothing other than God, a supernatural God meeting a need." He said, "This morning at 5:00 in the morning, the Lord woke me up and he said, I started just to talk to the Lord and say, Lord, I want to I want to translate brother Matt well tonight. I want to do a good job." And he says, 'Lord, I want to I want to be direct me to a sermon that he's preached that I could hear during the day and translate it at school. And he said, "So I went on your website. I scrolled through page one, page two, page three. Randomly, I selected the sermon you preached tonight." &gt;&gt; And he said, "So I knew everything you were going to say before you even said it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And brother Matt, I was determined not to say anything to you, but this church was my greatest need, was my greatest burden because the pastor who was a pastor for years has got dementia and he's he's he's uh not the pastor anymore." And they're sort of in a in a low there looking for a pastor. And he says, "And four men have have came in and they're trying to move the church out of the message." And they're starting to say things like, "Why do we need to quote brother Brandaman? Why do we need to emphasize brother Brandaman? Why do we need to emphasize a prophet? It's all about Jesus. Just preach Jesus." Well, I got a question. Which Jesus do you want me to preach? &gt;&gt; People say, "Just give me Jesus." I tell you what they're wanting. They're wanting their imagination, Jesus. &gt;&gt; They're wanting just their own version of Jesus. Well, just let me preach Jesus. Let me tell you something, brother. You say, "Oh, had I been there in the days of Jesus, I would have never uh been with the crowd that crucified him. I wouldn't have been with that crowd saying crucify." I would have stood for him. I would have defended him. But I tell you what a prophet said. A prophet said, "I'll tell you what you would have done then. You show me what you do for your word, for your day and its message." &gt;&gt; Brother, I just say it like I believe it. What you do with this message is what you do with Jesus Christ. [Applause] And and and that brother said, "What would you?" He said, "Brother Matt," he said, "you sat there saying," he said, "Those," he said, "you see," he said, "you don't know it, but those four brothers," and he said, "Are saying we don't need to quote a prophet." He said, "Brother Matt, those were the four brothers you picked randomly." &gt;&gt; I tell you what it is, brother, sister. God defends his own words. &gt;&gt; I said God will defend his own words. God is the great shepherd of the sheep. Oh, you ought to give God praise. He defends you even when you you don't even know you're under attack. But God's angels are watching over you. God's angels are protecting you. God's angels are keeping you. Hallelujah. I say if God could protect his word in in in Honduras, how much more can he protect it in my own life? Why, brother Matt? Because he's a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; I said he's a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; You imagine the burden that was on Elijah as he wants to pass down the expectation, the faith. He can't. He's his impression that he leaves on Elisha would determine the next generation. &gt;&gt; So he wants to pass down the right things. He wants to let Elisha know Elisha, the same God that was with me will be with you. That's what God had to tell Joshua. As I was with Moses, so shall I be with you. &gt;&gt; And so what what was on brother Brandham's heart? Really, what was on his heart? Is the past down the right thing to believe? Listen, friends, I'm just going to go ahead and preach it here for a moment. Uh this is not the time to stop believing in the supernatural. This is not the time to stop preaching about a supernatural God who when doctors say it's impossible, my God says I'll have the last word over your life. When doubt and fear says you're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach here tonight. That voice of depression has talked to you for for years of your life and you've listened to that voice. What what's going to happen to your life? You're never going to make it. Your children are not going to be saved. You're going to lose everything. and you let the devil talk and talk and talk. I think it's time we shut the devil up and let the Holy Spirit start talking to our heart and say, "God, I'm tired of hearing his voice." [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know, it's so powerful when I hear uh you heard the voices of many men, but my Bible says Jesus said, "But I say unto you." I'm not talking about what your depression is saying. I'm saying what is Jesus saying? Uh, the devil says you won't make it, but I say unto you. &gt;&gt; The devil says you'll never be enough. But I say unto you, &gt;&gt; the words that I speak, they are spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Adam says here. This is so powerful, brother. You can just display it. This is what the prophet of God says. I love this quote so much. We can preach the word, explain the word, but you have to receive the word. Oh, that's what sets it a fire, brother. When you receive it, how many want to receive it? &gt;&gt; When you receive it, the revelation, &gt;&gt; something slips out of the unseen world, yonder, &gt;&gt; comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says, "Now I see it." Your eyes get brighter. Your lips that hung down straighten up and smile. every muscle in your body. Oh, you mean the word cannot just affect my spirit. It can actually affect my body. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Listen, I believe God can more than uh give you a revelation down in your soul, but my Bible says that there's stimulation that comes with that revelation. &gt;&gt; Brother Adam says every muscle in your body seems to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Say, "My body?" Yeah. Brother Matt, &gt;&gt; you mean God wants to move my body? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants to move every part of you. In fact, he wants to change your body someday. &gt;&gt; And I say, "The God who can change my body, I ought to give him liberty in my body right now. If you ain't giving him liberty now, how's he ever going to change it?" [Applause] He says, "Every muscle in your body rejoices, &gt;&gt; sir." &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Revelation book of symbols. Angelic beings associate together. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you get that. Just drop down free. If you've got the Holy Spirit, how many is here tonight? I said if you got the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; how many got the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Then you're a candidate. for association &gt;&gt; with the unseen world &gt;&gt; and the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Notice brother Adam says this further in his body has earthly contact with five senses. In his spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them and speaks with them. You mean that I can have more than demons speaking to me and visiting to me? I can have angels &gt;&gt; speaking to me &gt;&gt; and visiting me. Come on, somebody. This is your inheritance in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to settle for just a a doubt spirit, a spirit that always makes you doubt. You can say, "Let an angel come and minister to me to give me faith to believe the word of God." They're messengers sent from God to reveal. Then what have we got to be worried about? &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I got news for you. Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; His spirit is here. &gt;&gt; What happened just now? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon stopped. Says, "What? What? What happened just now? I went into another world. It's an unseen world. We become so conscious of looking at one another like this. But there's an unseen world. &gt;&gt; And it's greater than anything you see. &gt;&gt; I said it's greater than anything you see. &gt;&gt; There's a lot we see. We see problems. &gt;&gt; We see impossibilities. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; We see years after years of struggle with the same problem. doesn't look like we've ever going to get the victory. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you tonight, &gt;&gt; there's something greater in the room that's greater than anything you see. &gt;&gt; Here's Christ. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Here's Christ in this world, in this building are evil spirits &gt;&gt; in this building. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to say, "Oh, that preacher's just emotional. He's just worked up. &gt;&gt; He ain't got that ain't for you. That's for somebody else. Yeah. Those spirits, they come to church. They're the most faithful church members, pastors have. &gt;&gt; Demons of doubt, demons of uh uh you know, of worry, demons of fear, demons of questions, &gt;&gt; demons of distraction. &gt;&gt; I got news in this building. There's evil spirits. But I got better news. There's also Christians who are anointed and the angels of God encamped about them trying to energize them with faith. &gt;&gt; And I say, God, energize my faith here tonight. &gt;&gt; Let me plug into a supernatural dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't know about you, if you feel like I do. I'm so done and tired of a world that's dreary and fearful and war with Ukraine and your war with Russia, war over here. The world's falling apart. What's Trump doing? What's Putin? Listen, I I don't know about you, but I feel like I am disconnected. I have not that is not This is not my home. I'm just passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. And that ain't the news I listen to. But I'm hearing a different sound. I'm tuned into a different dimension. &gt;&gt; And in that dimension, there's angels. &gt;&gt; Trying to energize my faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's demons. I I know that there are they're more bold. The devil, listen, is more bold than he has ever been before. You say, "Brother Matt, you are bold sometimes when you preach." You know why? Cuz I got four kids, some of them's teenagers, and they face a bold devil &gt;&gt; who doesn't ask me. He doesn't get my permission. He doesn't negotiate with me. He just does whatever. He He tries everything he can to harm them and to and to and to attack them. So, I just figure if the devil's bold, I ought to be bold. I ought to have a bold faith and a bold voice to say, "You can't touch my children, Satan. You can't have them. Get your hands off of my family." Oh, something ought to rise up inside of you to say, "Satan, you might have had victory for years, but I'm standing up against you tonight. &gt;&gt; You can't have my family. &gt;&gt; You can't have my body, Satan." &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said he's more bold than he's ever been. &gt;&gt; His agenda is more bold, brother. It's out all out in the open. Brother Matthew, no matter where you look, demon spirits are more manifested now. that veil that stands between that realm of of hell and this realm of life has blended together &gt;&gt; so much now that the prophet of God said it's like a hell on earth. What do you see when he goes to J C Penney and he sees those sisters come, those women, sorry, coming on the escalator with makeup. It was hell &gt;&gt; coming to earth. &gt;&gt; And brother, if that was then, how much more &gt;&gt; is hell here on earth? &gt;&gt; I got news for you. You face it. I face it. Our churches face it. Our children face it. A bold devil that doesn't stand in the closet. He doesn't hide subvertly. He doesn't do things subliminally anymore. He comes right out in your face and he manifest himself. I just happen to believe that there's a hell that can manifest itself boldly out in the open. I just happen to believe there's a heaven that wants to manifest itself and pour out his spirit. &gt;&gt; I could hear the words of a prophet, "When all hell cuts loose, all heaven turns loose. Listen what brother Adam says here. What house will you build me? Because these are some of the last words. I'm I'm not going to go very much longer. You got you can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Say Elijah's leaving and he's you could feel the burden of this moment. What's he wanting to pass down? What's he wanting to say? Elijah some of his last words. You can go and read the last words of men like Abraham Lincoln. Go and read the last words of men like David even in the Bible. Records the last words of Solomon. It records the last words of Jacob. Records the last words of Joseph when he says, "Don't leave my bones here in Egypt." These are some of the last imparting things. He's wanting to transfer. He's wanting to pass down the right thing. He's leaving. and everything that his he represents at his faith. He he his testimony is going to affect that next generation. You could go back and scour the message as I have. And I thought, what is some of the last feelings of God's prophet before he leaves the scene? Notice this. What house will you build me? 1965, November 21st. If you feel, listen, I know that each of you, if you feel like I do, how did you feel, brother Brandon? I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving. &gt;&gt; I just can't hardly stand it. &gt;&gt; You mean after the seals, after the feast of the trumpets, &gt;&gt; after Here you are and you're still wanting more. &gt;&gt; Give me more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Give me more, Jesus. I'm so hungry for the spirit of God to move. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many feel that way tonight? &gt;&gt; Just say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I am so hungry. &gt;&gt; I just can't hardly stand it. &gt;&gt; Some experiences I've had, I just up in the mountain just to feel that once again. That's something that when I was first saved, so glorious was so glorious to my heart. Listen to what he says here in the token 1963 11128. And I am looking, what were you looking for, brother Brandham? For a time of a breakforth. You mean not a time where we all sit around and get more intellectual, more smarter, understand the mysteries better, be able to put it on a chalkboard? Listen, I'm grateful for all of that. I thank God. I believe we ought to have the knowledge of the word. But I tell you what, brother Brandham said he was looking for. He said, "I'm looking for a time of a break forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit." Oh, I'm speaking today and saying, "Surge Holy Ghost. Surge in my family. Surge in my children. Surge in my church. Oh God." He says, "For another surge, for a rapturing faith, &gt;&gt; just before it comes, &gt;&gt; what shall you do with this Jesus called the Christ?" The dynamics of this church. How many can say this church? &gt;&gt; This church, &gt;&gt; this church, &gt;&gt; this church, &gt;&gt; the dynamics of this church &gt;&gt; will be a refilling &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. What's happening right now? &gt;&gt; What's been happening for the past 50 years? &gt;&gt; The headstone has been coming down &gt;&gt; to the body. &gt;&gt; And what happens when the headstone comes down? &gt;&gt; Are we smarter? Are we better? More intellectual? More knowledge? No, brother. I'm going to tell you what happens when the headstone comes down. When the head and your body unite together, the full power of the Holy Ghost. I said the full power, not a partial power, not a power from 1906 Isuza Street, but the full power &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; would raise her up. &gt;&gt; Even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years &gt;&gt; will rise in the beauty of holiness and take a flight to the skies. &gt;&gt; The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. I want you to watch this as I just bring this down to a close. And I want to make sure my burden that I that I come to my burden of my heart that God's saying, you've got to have the same faith, Elisha. The same. He says, "Give me a double portion." Justification was good. Sanctification was good. the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your flesh experiences miracles, signs, wonders. &gt;&gt; But you've got to move on further. &gt;&gt; You've got to move on further, Elijah. &gt;&gt; You got to keep coming, Elisha, because you got to cross the Jordan. &gt;&gt; You've got to come to the token life. &gt;&gt; And you see the difference with the token life is that it wasn't the token was not going to be an experience. Hello, somebody. The token was not just going to be an experience on your flesh. &gt;&gt; Nor was it going to just be an intellectual knowledge, but the prophet says the token would be the literal life &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; coming back down on the worship &gt;&gt; and when you have his life, &gt;&gt; you have his nature. Hello. &gt;&gt; When you have his life, &gt;&gt; you have his gifts. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, when you have him, you have all of him. &gt;&gt; The literal life of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; means that you will love like Jesus. &gt;&gt; You'll have patience like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Your character, your nature. Come on, &gt;&gt; brother goes beyond the curtain of time and he comes back and he says, "Oh my brother, my sister, whatever you do in this life, &gt;&gt; get to a place &gt;&gt; where you can know the seals." No, &gt;&gt; where you could bre, you know, from front to back line everything, the vials and the trumpets and the that's all wonderful. But when he goes beyond the curtain of time, his burden to tell you was get to the place where you can love everybody, &gt;&gt; even your enemy. Get to the place where you have perfect love. For nothing will enter there &gt;&gt; without it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because perfect love comes from the perfect sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That is the literal life &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; of Christ. &gt;&gt; You have not only the fruits of the spirit, &gt;&gt; you also have the gifts of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12. Brother Brandham said, "I'll show you where God put the gifts in the church. You show me where he took them out." &gt;&gt; Gifts is not the inheritance of Pentecost. Isuza Street. Gifts was the inheritance. The prophet of God says what the church had at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Can I preach to you what a prophet says? &gt;&gt; And that is your inalienable right. &gt;&gt; You may have got a right &gt;&gt; to the gifts of the spirit in operation in my life. Yeah. That's your right. Don't let a preacher, don't let a devil, don't let a spirit take it away from you. It is the right of the church of the living God &gt;&gt; to have the full power, the full nature, the token life manifested. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so amazing to me. I know I've preached on this before, but it's so amazing to me how that people always line up. I've always found, brother Matthew, that people will do one of two things. They'll either deify or they will deemphasize. &gt;&gt; And it's so amazing because people will prop up one thing, the gifts, the gifts, the gifts, the gifts, the gifts. And I'm all for them. But then the fruits are like Baptist, you know, denominational. We don't have to love anybody. Oh, really? What did Brother Random say his problem was with Pentecost? He says, "Oh, yeah, they got miracles, but they got the temper to fight a buzzsaw." Listen, brother. If your revelation doesn't make you love your brother, you ought to get a new revelation. &gt;&gt; If your revelation makes you backbite and talk and fuss and talk about every other church, you ought to get a different revelation. If your experience can't make me like Jesus, I don't want it. &gt;&gt; But give me the literal life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because when I have him, I have all of him. And there's miracles, there's signs, there's wonders, there's power, there's love, there's joy, there's peace. &gt;&gt; And but people always love to emphasize one only to deemphasize another. &gt;&gt; It's like brother Brandham always dealt with with the two ditches. And and the prophet of God said about Calvinism, he said, "I'm a Calvinist." You are, Brother Brandham? Says, "Oh yeah, I'm a Calvinist as long as Calvin's in the Bible." &gt;&gt; But when he gets out of the Bible, I'm no longer a Calvinist. &gt;&gt; Are you an Armenius? Yeah. as long as Armenian is is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And brother Bamson has always tried to stand between those two, the fundamentalist who had, Brother Bam said it this way. He said, "There's always two groups of people I find." And he says, "One of them has the all the money in the bank, but they ain't got enough knowledge is what he's saying. They don't know who they are. &gt;&gt; They don't know their position &gt;&gt; cuz they just believe in experience. Experience. Experience, but they never know the word." And brother says, "They got all the money in the bank, but they ain't got the faith to sign their name on the check." &gt;&gt; He says, "Then I got the other group of people who ain't got no money in the bank." &gt;&gt; But they got all the knowledge and the precepts of the word of God, the good, kind old priest who gives to the poor, feeds the hungry, has all of the nature, &gt;&gt; but he lacks the power. &gt;&gt; Brother Baron says, "Oh, but if I could ever get the two groups &gt;&gt; together, Oh, brother. I tell you what I believe this revival is. It is the two groups coming back together. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, notice always, it was always two ditches. He says, one ditch over here. You got the, you know, brother Adam says, some people make church a funeral. &gt;&gt; Just real quiet. And that has a place. But brother Adam says, "But it's not a funeral. &gt;&gt; Church shouldn't be a funeral." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Then you have the other side that makes it a frolic." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And it's not a frolic." &gt;&gt; Then which is it, Brother Brandham? It's a feast. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the bride goes down the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; But catch it, drawing from both sides." You see why the devil wants to divide us and separate us and draw circles? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; I tell you what your prophet said. I don't draw a circle. I just draw the circle bigger. &gt;&gt; But we got division over here in this group and this church. And I think I I think there's a people that say, "I'm done with the fighting. I'm done with the arguing. I'm done with the fussing. I want the power of God. &gt;&gt; And we we divide over here and separate over here and separate over here. And brother Brandon says got a ditch over here. And some, you know, it's so funny because people always do that. You got one group that says, "We don't need the preachers. &gt;&gt; We just need the tapes. &gt;&gt; Deemphasize or deify. One or the other. &gt;&gt; We don't need preachers. We We just need the tapes." Well, then you got another group that says, "We don't need to listen to Brother Brandham anymore. We got the ministry." You know, the You got some who say, "We don't need the tapes. We just need our Bibles." &gt;&gt; You got some say, "We don't need Bibles. We just need the tapes." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got one group that says, "We just need shouting and jumping and dancing." I'm all for those things. Brother Adam said that he was. But if your life don't cope with what you're shouting about, &gt;&gt; and then you got some say, "We don't need any of those things. The gifts are on the mantle. We don't need none of that." that no more that's all Pentecostal and and and we just got the word and the word only and then they separate themselves over here. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't we don't we don't need those kind of things. We don't need to love our brother. We we don't need mar that's always to don't you see it's the tactic of the devil &gt;&gt; to push us into a ditch. &gt;&gt; I got news for you, brother. One ditch ain't no better than the next ditch. &gt;&gt; And the bride wasn't called to walk in a ditch. She was called to walk in the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Math, then what is it? Do we need preachers? Is it our Bible? Do we need tapes? Do we need books?" &gt;&gt; You say, "Which is it, Brother Matt? You're confusing me. Can I just make it simple?" You need all of it. &gt;&gt; You need your Bible. You need the tapes. You need the books. You need preachers. You need people. You need pastors. You need a prophet. And I say, "Give me it all, Lord. I want all of it, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't let me settle for one. Give me it all, Lord. &gt;&gt; You need everything &gt;&gt; that God has given and restored back. &gt;&gt; You need it all. &gt;&gt; Need it all." You see, with Christ would come the miraculous. Listen friends, if we ever believe in the supernatural, Lord, if we ever need the supernatural, Lord, it's now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People say we don't we don't need the supernatural. God, anymore. I ask what what kind of world are you living in? &gt;&gt; If we ever need the gifts of the spirit, they're now. &gt;&gt; If we ever need preachers, it's now. &gt;&gt; But I say more than preachers, we need a people who live. Oh, I can hear the prophet saying, "What is the thunder that shakes the devil?" It's the life of lived voice of lived lives. That's the thunder that shakes the devil's kingdom. He don't care how much you shout. He don't care how much you dance. But what he can't do anything about, brother, is when that Zoey seed life comes into your vessel and it begins to live like Jesus, think like Jesus, act like Jesus, love like Jesus, believe like Jesus. Listen what brother Brandon says. I'm just going to skip some of this because we got to close. Are you with me still? &gt;&gt; Don't get scared. As brother Diggs says, I'm fixing to close. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandham says here. He says, oh, he's talking about Moses and why Christ speak. I'm just going to skip some of this down, brother. He says in verse in in slide 18, I think any man or woman or boy or girl in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is can never have a full foundation stand &gt;&gt; until they have met that light &gt;&gt; that brings that word to a reality. &gt;&gt; You can have a picture of the pillar of fire and that's wonderful. You can have a tie pin of the pillar of fire and the the the the cloud on sunset mountain. I'm all for that, brother. But that cloud has got to live in your life. &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire has got to come off the picture. &gt;&gt; It brings the word to a reality. &gt;&gt; Brother Adam says, "Just as we know, as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming, this is just two slides down, slide 20, about the coming of the Lord." And he says, "About the coming and the rapture." And we know we've lived the time out &gt;&gt; and the time of the rapture is at hand. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Anytime you read that in the Bible, it says, "Behold, he cometh." And you always say you you always read the way that the the the that the words would say that, but then it would say, "It's at hand." And if you ever want to know what that means, it means it's within your reach. &gt;&gt; The rapture is within our reach. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we're looking." How many's looking? &gt;&gt; What were you looking for, Brother Brandham? a rapturing faith &gt;&gt; that can pull the church &gt;&gt; together &gt;&gt; and give it some supernatural strength &gt;&gt; that can change these bodies that we live in. &gt;&gt; When we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor out in the yard and bring him back to life again presenting before us. When we see a God who can take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing faith &gt;&gt; to the people. &gt;&gt; Four years ago now we we're at our in our city back home in Buford where we're from. I have a very good friend of mine. He's one of my closest friends, brother Travis Jackson. He's just a just a a brother that if you ever had a chance to meet him, boy, you wouldn't be running for two minutes. I don't care if you're his mechanic. I don't care if you're his pest control guy. I don't care if you're the person working at the cashier. You're going to hear about Jesus. Travis would just he's got such a bold faith. And and years ago, he wasn't born in the message, wasn't raised in the message, and he's he's he's as a young boy, 13 or actually younger than that. his mom and dad were uh in a the Buford Baptist church and he grew up in the in the Baptist church but his dad he became disillusioned with a with you know he'd go out for the deacons would leave church for a smoke break and he just couldn't understand that how are these people saying they're Christians so his dad stops going his mom they backslide but little Travis is just a a boy is reading his Bible in his room mama didn't even know it and he's he's reading about the Lord and talking to the Lord and praying he wasn't a believer not a message believer at all and he and He's there one day and he's going through his mom's books in her closet and he pulls out a book that had no spine in it. Brother David, it was just all tattered and broken up and he begins to read that book. That book was Acts of the Prophet written by Perry Green. &gt;&gt; To this day, they don't know how the book got there in her closet. &gt;&gt; And and Travis begins to read Travis begins to read about read this book. He had went everywhere. This is service at 16 years old. He'd went everywhere, Brother Matthew. It went to every church. He was a church hopper. Tried every church in town. This church to that church to this church. He'd always get to he said, "I always get to the youth leader and say, "Brother, uh, I believe that we're, you know, you people are wonderful." But he says, "But where's the God I read about in the book of Acts when Pet when when when Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Rise up and walk." Where do we Where's men like Stephen who the Bible says was full of the Holy Ghost. And he says, "Where's men that are full with the Holy Ghost?" And he says, "Every single time I would say that that it's, oh yeah, Travis, those were wonderful things, but you have to understand the apostolic age is over, and God don't do that anymore." &gt;&gt; Isn't that exactly what they try to tell Brother Brandon? &gt;&gt; Those those those were just uh, you know, the gifts for the early church, but those things aren't in in operation anymore. We don't we just believe the the word only now. This is what they tell him that, you know. And Travis said, "That didn't sound right. I'd go to the next church. He'd go to the youth leader, go to the pastor, talk to the pastor of the mega church, the biggest church in our city, Evangelical Evangelical Reformed Baptist Church. And he talked to the pastor, Dallas Theological Seminary right here in Dallas. He's a very educated man. And that's what he told him. He said, I talked to him. He said, "I believe you're wonderful. I love your teaching. You teach on the word, but where is the God we read about in the Bible? Why don't we see the manifestation of the spirit like we read about in the Bible?" And he said, he looked at me with all of his education and said, "Well, Travis, you have to understand that God did those things only for the early church to establish the church. But the the last miracle ended with the death of the last apostle." &gt;&gt; Really, go read Irenus. &gt;&gt; You'll you'll see a man who believed in tongues. He believed in prophecy. He believed in interpretation. &gt;&gt; You'll go read even the church age messenger Cola. And the BBC did an article on the life of Columba. And you can go find this. I'll give you the article if you want it and said this was the BBC secular talking about a church age messenger we know as Columbus and said he was a man who believed in the supernatural and miracles took place. He even his horse died and he brought his horse back to life. That's right out of the BBC. And it said also there was a strange column of fire that accompanied his ministry seen several times. That's why the prophet of God could say the same light of the candle went to all of those seven church age messengers. &gt;&gt; That fire wasn't just for listen friend. The pillar of fire didn't come in our didn't just come in our generation. It was a return of a pillar of fire that met Paul on the road to Damascus and said, "Who are you Lord? I I am Jesus &gt;&gt; who you persecute." &gt;&gt; And that same pillar of fire that was with Cola appeared in our generation. And he said that they they ended with the death of the last apostle. Travis said that didn't sound right. So he finds this book, Acts of the Apo, Acts of the the prophet. And he says, "Oh, now here's a man. Here's what I've been looking for." &gt;&gt; And he goes to his mom, "Mom, where did you get this?" He says, "Honey, I don't know where in the world that books. You got to read it." He gives it to her to read. She goes to She's a plumbing a secretary at a at a at a plumbing business. She's a secretary there. And a man from our church actually walks in and sees this woman, this sinner woman reading the Acts of the Prophet. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Where did you get that book?" She says, "Oh, my son got it." And boy, he sure loves it. He wants me to read it. He said, "If I if he like that, I got something for him." So he goes back and gets brother Owen's supernatural series and he brings him a supernatural book and it gives it to Travis. And Travis said, "I started reading that book and I didn't know he it was unconclusive because of the book he had. He didn't know brother Brandham died." And so you he said, "You know what I did, brother Matt?" He said, "I started asking every single person I would talk to, have you ever heard of William Brandham? &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of William Brandom?" No. No. Never heard of him. He says, "Man, person, every work associate, everybody had talked to." One day, just so happens, he's riding in the van as he's an HBAC tech and he's in the van with a backsliden message believer &gt;&gt; who hadn't been to church in years. didn't even we didn't even know if he was still in town. Didn't know anything about him. He just left. His marriage went arry and he left, you know, left our church and just so happens God doesn't do nothing by accident. Just so happens he's in there and he says, "Hey, Dave." Yeah. They're driving. Have you ever heard of William Brandon? Dave's bald. He said, but he said, "Every little hair I had was standing straight up." He said, "I just held this term." He said, Yeah. He said, "You have? You're the first person to hear it, to say you really?" He says, "Yeah." He says, "There's a whole church that that believes that he was the, you know, a prophet." He says, "Yeah, of course he was a prophet." And he says that, you know, they believe he was the church age messenger. He said, "Church? Church age?" You know, I I don't know. He said, he said, "There's a church here." I get a call that that day from Dave. I heard from for years. He says, "Matt," I said, Dave, he said, "You got to help me." I said, "What? What's going on, Dave?" He said, "I'm riding in the van with this sinner just working with me." And he asked me if I had ever heard of William Brandham. He said, "I I" He said, "I I I was I'm in no condition to talk to him at all." I said, "I need you to come over to my house. Can you come? I've invited him tonight. Can you come?" I had a friend of Irish, Brother Rick Perie, and also my brother Jonathan uh there. Rick was visiting from out of town. And so I I get this call said, "Hey, I don't know what we're going to run into, but this guy, we want to he wants to you meet us." And and and so we go there and I'll never forget we knock on the door. First time I ever laid my eyes on him. Now, if Travis was here, I'm just going to tell you what he says in his testimony. He says that when those three men walked in the door, we knocked on the door. He says, "When you walked through the door," he said, a voice spoke, audible voice, and said, "Behold, men of the Lord, men full of the Holy Ghost. Travis says, "I knew at that moment what I had been looking for since I was a boy had just walked in the door." &gt;&gt; We got to fellowshipping with him. We got to fellowshipping with him. And we said, "Travis," he's talking to us, just pouring his heart out. And we go to a coffee shop and and he says,"We says, "Travis, you got to come to our church." He says, "Where's your church?" We said, "2608 Mossios Road." He said, "Mossio, Mossio's road." He said, "Do you realize?" And he names the street he his house he grew up in that he lived in his whole life was only, as the crow flies, about two or 30 hundred yards. &gt;&gt; He said, "You mean what I've been looking for? My whole life has been right. That little church I passed every Oh, my brother, my sister, what you're looking for is not way down the road somewhere. It's in the building right now. The God you're looking for is here. &gt;&gt; Stop looking down the road. He's right in the building. &gt;&gt; Glory. Don't tell me God ain't a God of the supernatural. Don't tell me ain't God ain't a God of the miracles. I already seen him operate too many times, brother. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He'll be the same. He he he's that's been years ago now he married brother Dell Smith's daughter actually and they got a beautiful family and and years go down the road years later 10 I don't know how many years 10 or 13 12 years and Travis comes to me I'm with him at a at a event and there's a man there I meet and he says I want you to meet this man he says this was my former pastor the last church I went to before I found your church before I found the message and he said I want you to meet him as a wonderful Christian man I always wanted to leading to the message. And I said, "I'll go meet this man." And I introduce myself and he's there and that was it. And then about two or three months, maybe four months later, uh Travis calls me says, "And it's a Saturday and I'm preparing my you were out of town and it was I was going to preach that Sunday morning and I'd been studying all day to get ready for the service and Travis called me. He said, "Matt, I hate to bother you." He says, "Can you do me a favor?" He says, "You remember Marcus Humphrey?" I said, "Yeah, that man I met there." He said, "Yeah." He said, "I got terrible news. Mary called me today. He's been diagnosed with cancer, stage four non-hodkins lymphoma. They've just given him just a few months to live." I said, "What? That man I just met?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "He's full of cancer." He said, "Will you go with me and lay hands on him? I want to anoint him with oil and and and pray for him." Just so happened all day I'd been studying one book, Healing, &gt;&gt; what cancer is. So, you know what I did? I just did everything Brother Brandham said to that man. &gt;&gt; I'd been studying it all day. What is cancer? &gt;&gt; We walk, we go there to that little apartment. We knock on the door and there's that man and he's there and looks so different. My goodness, he was just just looks so different. And he's there and you could just feel the room, the atmosphere of the room was just so low and he and and his trustees there and they're just there to be with him and comfort him. and I didn't really know what to do. And you know, Travis is there and we're sort of it's awkward and you could just feel the sorrow in the room and and and and and you know and I'm just waiting on the Lord saying, "Lord, what are you going to do? I don't even know how to approach this." And Travis just starts in he said, "Marcus, you know, tell me what's going on." He said, "Well, they've given me tried chemo eight times and failed all eight times. They told me to go home. I won't live. I just have a little bit of time to live. This ain't how I wanted to go. I didn't want to die this way." But but he says, "But you know, uh, every man's got to die." And Travis says, "Well," he says, "Well, Marcus," he says. He says, "I guess with as serious as it as it is," he said, "I'm just going to cut right to the chase." He said, "I'm just going to be real straight and honest with you." He says, "Sure, Travis." And he says, "I I just want to tell you, Marcus," he says, "I love you, and I believe you and Mary are wonderful Christian people." He says, "But when I was at your church, I was searching for the living God." And he says, "And I want to tell you, I found a living God." &gt;&gt; And he said, "He's a God of miracles still. He's a He's the God, same God of the God of the apostles that you read about in the book of Acts. He's still alive today." And he says, "And God is not in your church. He's not in your denomination. The trinity is a doctrine of the devils." And he says, "It's not father, son, and holy ghost." And he said he's it's a denominational system is going to take the mark of the beast. And he says, "And I want I'm just thinking, whoa, whoa, double barrel shotgun." I told him after I got out, I said, "Buddy, if I'm ever fighting for my life in a foxhole, I want you in my pack." I mean, he just, you know, he's not in this and he's not God and he's not the God of your denomination. And and this is my friend Matt. Go ahead, Matt. Well, I said I said, "Well, you know," and Travis stopped. He said, "Marcus," he said, "I He" He said, "I sure hope you know my heart." He said, "I I didn't say any of that to hurt you." He said, "I love you. I think you're a Christian man." He said, "I'm not trying to hurt you." He said, "I hope I didn't offend you." And I'll never forget Marcus just sat there and he said, "No, Travis." He said, "You didn't you didn't bother me at all." He said, "In fact, when you and your friend here knocked on the door, a voice spoke to me and said, "These are men sent from the Lord. Listen to what they have to say." &gt;&gt; He said, "So I was prepared for anything you tell you what friends, God works on both ends. &gt;&gt; Take no thought for what you'll say, for in that moment, the words will be given to you." &gt;&gt; And and I just began to break in. I said, "Marcus," I said, "I I listen." And I said, "I I I don't have any, you know, I I don't have any tools. I don't have a doctor's bag, you know, to to to work on you or to look at you." I said, "But I do got a book full of promises." &gt;&gt; And I said, "And I just want to tell you about some of those promises." I started telling him, I said, "In fact, there's a little sister that I know." And I said, "She's she's from Louisiana." And I said, "She was actually diagnosed, you could go to the next slide, with the same exact disease that they've diagnosed you with. And I said, "But this little sister Elena and doctors had done PET scans on her and told her she she, you know, that she had cancer, you know, and these kind of things." And I said, "And Mary's, you could just feel it right at that moment." Uh, you know, her heart just Mary's heart just began to lift. I just want to pull this up if I can. Uh, uh, this is this is just from her own testimony. She says, "A week before Christmas, I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodkins lymphoma. Two days after Christmas, I started the first of 12 chemo treatments. They told me that after four treatments, they would do a PET scan and to see how my my body is responding. I believe God is a healer. This is Sister Elena Buts. She says, "I believe God is a healer." And I've told that to anyone who asks how I'm doing. I told them that I was looking to him and believe that he would heal me. On Sunday, I leaped and danced. Go to the next slide. I leaped and danced before the Lord. To the next one, I leaped and danced before the Lord. Notice what my what our sister did here. Sometimes it takes something natural to move the supernatural. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, sometimes God is looking for you to do something. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh unto you." &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're waiting on God and God's waiting on us. &gt;&gt; She began, you know, to to to leap and dance before the Lord. Listen to this. She says, "I I began to leap and dance before the Lord and and with joy and victory because I knew it was already a finished work, even though I didn't know how or when. Even though there was no proof yet," they were singing, "What have I to dread? What have I to fear? Leaning on the everlasting arms. I have blessedness with my Lord so near. Leaning on the everlasting arms." That sounds strange to many, but in the Bible, Miam danced for joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians who had enslaved them were drowned. David danced for joy when he saw the ark of the covenant brought back to Jerusalem. It's an expression of extreme joy and victory. I knew my healing would come sooner or later because the Jesus of the Bible, the great healer, is the same Jesus I have served for 27 years. She says, "Yesterday I had my PET scan and today I met with the doctor before my fif fifth treatment. He informed me the cancer is already gone. That's my God. That's Jesus. That's the God of this Bible. That's the God of the supernatural." Hallelujah. Oh, if you don't praise him, the rocks shall cry out and praise him. If we don't lift him up, you ought to have seen that that woman's eyes. She begins to weep and cry, but she she began to weep and cry. Oh, I I I sat there and I said that. I said, "Yeah." I said, "The same same exact disease." She says, "I've always believed in a God of the supernatural." She says, "When I was a little girl, I seen my daddy was a missionary and I seen someone blind eyes come up." She said, "I always knew God was a God of the supernatural." And that that trusty's wife, she said, "Are you now? Hold on, preacher. Are you trying to say that God's definitely got to heal him?" I said, "No, I'm not saying that. I'm just letting you know God can. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God can. &gt;&gt; God can do whatever he wants to do. &gt;&gt; We didn't ask we God didn't ask us to figure it out. He just asked us to believe. &gt;&gt; If you can get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; nothing will stand in your way, not even cancer. Don't you realize how important it is for you to believe the word that is preached to you and and back it up with an amen and say, "Yes, Lord. I believe in God. That's for me, Lord." &gt;&gt; She said, she said, "I always knew that." I said, "Now," I said, "I'm just going to pray pray for you." And he was sitting there. You you could have seen the look there. If you can go to the next two slides down, you'll see the picture of Marcus. The first picture, he's there with a cancer, a tumor the size of a grapefruit on the side of his neck. Go to the next one. You could see there was there that one there, the PET scan. If you go to the next one there, you notice the PET scan that he had that cancer. Normally in as you've seen in Sister Elena's in a PET scan, you can see a dark spot for the heart and dark spot for the organs. You can't even see it in this picture. Cancer had came all the way through his abdomen. He had the I looked down on his calf. He had tumors the size of apples. You know, it's very easy to believe for someone else. &gt;&gt; Sometimes your condition is so bad &gt;&gt; that it's hard to believe for yourself. &gt;&gt; I said sometimes it's hard. This man could not believe for himself because it's conditional. I'm reminded of of a man in the Bible also who couldn't get to Jesus. He was lame in a bed, brother Matthew. And he couldn't get to Jesus was in a home and he couldn't get to him. But my Bible says his friends, the faith of friends, came over and picked up his bed and began to march him to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says when they got to Jesus, they couldn't get in. Too many people. That didn't stop them, brother Andrew. They climbed up on the roof and they tore the roof off. Oh, you ought to take that knee right now and say, "God, I am climbing up on the roof. I am tearing the roof off and I am lowering them down to Jesus." [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I'm going to pray for you." And I believe the God of the Bible can heal you. I'd never forget I I was there and began to pray. Never forget my prayer as I laid my hands upon him. And I said, "Lord, even your servant Hezekiah came to my mind who was told he was going to die. But he so pleaded with the Lord for his own life. And you added years to his life. Now God, remember this man. He stood for you. He's preached Jesus. He believes in your word. God, will you honor him, Lord? And I we you know what we did? You say, "Brother Matt, what happened? What happened? The the earth shake? Did the Did the windows ratt or the door shake?" No, nothing happened. You know what we did? We did what the Bible says. We brought our burdens to the Lord and we left them there. &gt;&gt; Left there. Travis says, "What do you think?" I said, "What? It's up to God now. We did all we could do. &gt;&gt; That's all we have to do. Don't try to manufacture it. Work it up. It's in God's lap. Now, &gt;&gt; that's where we get into trouble. We try to manual. Brother Brandon says, "You just believe it. &gt;&gt; Just confess it." That's what ABCs are. &gt;&gt; Always believe Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you What do you got to do? You got to confess it. You got to believe it. &gt;&gt; Accepting, believing, confessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and and I said, "I just leave it there." We left the burden there. Left it. Didn't hear anything for for weeks, months, even went by. I forget how many months now, three or four months. Just so happens Travis is in my living room and we're just talking about a boat and all kinds of things. Nothing to do with anything. He's talking about fishing and he's talking to me mid-sentence and he pulls out his phone as he gets a text and his eyes got about that big. And he said, "Matt, Mary just texted me. Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage 4 nonhotkins lymphoma. The living God has so healed his body. Go to the next one. He has healed of cancer. That's my God. That's the God of the supernatural. What is your need tonight? Oh, what is your need tonight in this building? That's my Jesus. I tell you what, the Lord, that sister began to sing that song. I believe I was there in the back when God put this changed my entire direction and God reminded of me of something he told me when he gave me the inspiration for this sermon. God gave it to me so clear and I want to give it to you now. Don't give up on your miracle. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rewrite it. Don't let the devil explain it away. Don't give up on your promise. If you ever believed, believe now. &gt;&gt; If you ever testified, testify now. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I believe it, Lord." Oh, stand to your feet with me. Say, "God, I believe it with all of my heart, Jesus. Nothing &gt;&gt; is impossible. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible." Musicians, come bow your heads with me. Every head bowed, every eye closed. You've got to seek God. is not the God of going backwards. Elisha, he's the God of the double portion. He wants to give you more. You say more, brother Matt. Elisha needed not just what Elijah had. He needed double. He needed double the zeal, double the sincerity, double the belief, double the faith. Say, "Oh, oh, where where's the where's God at now, brother? He's right here. He's the God of the miraculous. He's the God of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; He's the God of the impossible. &gt;&gt; When it looks impossible, what is impossible with man is possible &gt;&gt; with God. Oh, I feel him right now moving. Every head bowed, every eye closed as they just play something very softly to the Lord. Don't give up on your miracle. You might not even intended to be here tonight, but here you are. You you you might you might have didn't expect this at all. Neither did I. But here we are. What could God do? You say, "Brother Matt, what what can God do?" God listen, friends, the healing of your body is wonderful. The the healing of the body is wonderful, but you may he may heal you of the body and you you get sick again, but what about your soul here tonight? What about that inside eternal part of you? You need healing tonight. You need a God of the supernatural to move in your life in such a way you say, "Lord, I'm raising my hand up in a sign of surrender. I'm saying, Lord Jesus, I want you to come with healing in your wings." If it's my spirit, if it's a complex, bitterness, a grudge, malice, envy, hatred, division, stress, depression, anxiety, cancer. Doesn't matter what it is, who it's for. He's the great physician. He's the great physician. I wonder if you could just believe him. Now, as brother Brandham's told, if you can get the people to believe you, nothing will stand in your way. Is anything too hard for the Lord, Abraham? Is anything really could there be a need that you think's too great? No. Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Oh Lord, we just wait on you now. We've preached, we've shouted, clapped our hands, we've sang, Lord, we've gathered in this building. We've prepared a a place and a time. We've set it aside. Oh Lord Jesus, for what we spoke on last night for that encounter, for that moment, for that moment with you, Lord, I believe that angels are here. They've been here from the beginning of this service and they came with a mission. Some came to heal. Some came to encourage. Some came to energize. Some came with answers to questions. Some came to to to give faith. And I just raise hands and say, "Hey, Lord, if you've sent something my way, don't let me miss it. Lord, let me receive it right now by faith. Lord God, I lift up my hands in this building and I say, Lord Jesus, yes. I want to give you free. I want to give you complete control. Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Yes, I believe. I believe it. I accept it. But now, I'm going to confess it &gt;&gt; with all of my heart. I'm going to confess it. I'm going to believe. Oh, my brother, my sister, if you have a need, God is here in this building right now. The Holy Spirit's brooding. He's moving. I could feel him right now. And sometimes as I preached on you got to do something natural for God to move in the supernatural. Wonder if there'd be a need here tonight. You want prayer. You're welcome to come. If there'd be some some situation in your family, in your home, and you say, "Lord, I've been praying. I've been waiting. But tonight, I'm going to walk out of this building with my need met. I have determined in my heart. I have I've made a decision in my heart, Lord. I'm gonna touch the hymn of his garment. I'm gonna reach out like that little woman. I'm gonna reach with my need. From my need, I'm gonna reach out. And your prophet said she drew out from God what she needed from the Lord. So we we do that tonight, Lord. We reach out with our hands. We reach out with our hearts, Lord. Father, we come with an expectation that you are the God of the supernatural. that you're still the same today, yesterday, today, and forever. As you told, as Peter said that day on the inaugurational service, the promise is unto you. It's unto your children. It's unto them that are a far off. It as many as the Lord our God shall call. The promise, the brother Brandham said, of which the apostles were endued with is unto you. It's unto your children. It's unto your family. Oh, you got children need salvation. and say, "Lord, the promise is unto me. It's unto my children. It's unto my home. I don't have to live under the grips of the devil. I don't have to live under the grips of doubt and fear. I can have a blessing spoke over my life. I don't have to live under the curse of Satan. I don't have to live under the voice of Satan. I can be free of it tonight. Whatever it is, whatever it is, Lord, you are the healer, as the song says, of the broken pieces. God, you can touch our heart. You can make us new. We believe Lord. We believe Jesus what he plans us. Spirit of God move. Write your word in my heart. Is that your prayer? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh consume my life. Spirit of God move. &gt;&gt; An empty vessel. so that you may. &gt;&gt; Here's my prayer. Lord, and fill me. Lord, and fill me. Sing that again now. Spirit of God, move. Oh, let's tell him to move. Write it in my heart. Jesus, fill my whole being. Oh, consume. &gt;&gt; Oh, spirit of God, move an empty vessel. I want to be. Would you brothers come and help me pray for these things?

[Music] Oh, and I become [Music] giving me victory. Oh, that is reality. Something keeps holding me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Presence of the Lord. God moving on hearts and lives and you know you feel the presence of the Lord and when the word of God is preached &gt;&gt; and you hear about the supernatural &gt;&gt; it starts to just come all around you. You know it's here and you know it's in the building. And then something inside of you, you start to recognize that there's something out there. You know, the prophet of God came, he brought the reality of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; into the church. And he would say, "He's here. Not creeds, not dogmas, &gt;&gt; not man's ideas, &gt;&gt; but the word that spoke in the beginning was here." Amen. &gt;&gt; And that reality of all that God could do, &gt;&gt; all that he wanted to be in your life, he made that real. &gt;&gt; But when he summed it up, he said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him. Listen closely. The one that was on the outside. If you'll open the door and invite him in, he'll come from the outside in. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as also I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. That was our age. Jesus was on the outside. The church recognized him that it was him. &gt;&gt; They felt the presence. They heard the testimonies. That's right. &gt;&gt; And they knew that was the kind of God they believed in. We believe in a God that can heal cancer. &gt;&gt; We believe in a God that can deliver. &gt;&gt; And now all he does is he stands at the door of your life. And you know you believe in him. Now all he wants you to do is say, "Would you let me come in?" That's right. &gt;&gt; All that our brother testified about the miracles that were in other people's lives, the testimonies that our messenger spoke about, the God that he made so real, he wanted you to know that that God that's on the outside wants to come in. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him. That's our age. &gt;&gt; That's our gospel. &gt;&gt; The inddwelling spirit of the Lord Jesus in our lives. That's the decision that we have to make. I don't want to believe a God on the outside. &gt;&gt; I want to believe a God that I know is real can live in me. And he said, "If I come in with you and suck with you, the works that I do shall you do also." &gt;&gt; Is that for preachers? No. &gt;&gt; That's for every &gt;&gt; believer. [Music] That same God can dwell in you. And our messenger was trying to get that message out to the people. He would say it over and over again. The church put them on the outside. Don't leave them on the outside of your life. Don't look back at where you've been. Make a decision in your heart where you want to go. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you want him living in you? And if you invite him in, he will change your life forever. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to make this invitation. If you've never invited him into your heart, but you know that you're not right with God, if you repent of your sins, we have a pool here. And they asked Peter, "Men and brethren, what must I do? I find myself. I find God on the outside. I find that I don't have the God living in me that you're confessing lives. I find myself short. What must I do? Repent and be baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll work for anyone that will believe it. There wouldn't be a minister anywhere in this age that would have any ministry that could keep any water from flooding in if it wasn't for the voice of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; That was the true revealed word of God &gt;&gt; for this hour. And you can't have the gospel without having that voice. &gt;&gt; Any man that heareth my voice. That's what we're built on, a God that'll stand behind his word. So I want to encourage you. Don't be discouraged with yourself. Don't be discouraged with your past. If there's something in your heart that wants to change your past, invite him in. &gt;&gt; He will come &gt;&gt; and suck with you. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. Lord, richly bless you. I hope you feel a desire in your heart to move closer to God. We want to know what our path forward. Our path forward is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; living in our lives. Christ in you, the hope of glory. If the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwells in you, it'll also quicken your mortal body. Let's don't live without him. Let's invite him into our lives. Let's apply the token to our home. Let's let him live. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And he'll do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can even ask or think. There's no time, no place ever to end a service. But we do have some food next door if you'd like. We have sandwiches, ham and turkey sandwiches, and some leftover pizza. You're all welcome to go there, fellowship with one another, encourage one another, lift one another up. Don't be silly. But if you talk about him, he draws nigh. &gt;&gt; If you keep him on your thoughts, he stays with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you dedicate yourself, Lord, from this night forward, I've had my moment. &gt;&gt; I'm not going back. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've come too far to go back. I'm going to go forward. Tonight, I purpose in my heart, I'm going to go forward and serve God. I'm going to get rid of some of that stuff I got going on. And you watch, God will be with you. He'll help you. He'll guide you. He loves you. He's your father. Amen. Don't we sing a song something like I'm not going back or I won't turn back or you know that song? I don't. But we can sing it. Do you have your mic? You got a mic? We can sing it. Let's let this be our purpose. This is our dismissal song. Let's just pray for the food right now. our heavenly father for the sandwiches you provided. We ask you that you bless them to us that you bless the rest of our services coming. Father, anoint the ministers. May we receive the word. Father, we thank you for the quotes that we've heard tonight. Father, the things that your messenger told us, Father, that could bring us life and faith. Father, let that come into me. Father, let it pass from my mind into my heart and become the will of God in my life. Thank you, Father, for this time of fellowship. Bless these people, Father. We pray and thank you for the food you provided. We ask it in Jesus' name. Father, help us never to go back. Amen. [Music] I've been changed. Oh, he free. [Music] Deliver. &gt;&gt; I found your peace. [Music] and favor. Right now is the moment. Today is the day I've been changed. I've been changed. I have waited. Yes, I waited for this moment to come and I won't let it pass. I won't go back. I can't go back to the way to be. For your presence change me. I won't go back. I can't go back to the way I used to be. For your presence came and changed me [Music] all my king. Sing for you. No more fear. My is over. And now is the moment. Today the day I been changed. I've been changed. I am waiting. Yes, I'm waiting for this moment to come. And I won't let it pass. [Music] God bless you. Don't go back. Go forward to the way it used to be. For your presence can change. [Music] I won't come back. I can't go back to the way it used to be. Oh, your presence came and changed me. [Music] Let me [Music] heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
