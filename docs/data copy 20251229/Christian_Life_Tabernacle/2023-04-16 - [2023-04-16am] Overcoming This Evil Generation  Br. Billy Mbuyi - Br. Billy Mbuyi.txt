to be in the house of the Lord this morning when his sun rises it just shows his grace upon our life knowing that we have another day to serve him and today is a special day for us because we're in his house with our brothers and sisters let's just sing this as we just opened our service this morning bless the Lord [Music] never before oh my soul I worship Lord the sun comes up it's a new day

before your throne of mercy and Grace Lord you you're worthy of all praise Lord [Music] We Praise You In the good times and Praise You In The Bad Times Lord because time is in your hand Lord we commit ourselves into your hands Lord this morning and ask that you'd have your will and your way here Lord that you bring the word forth Lord and heal our disease Lord that you bring deliverance and joy and Victory Lord that your word would accomplish what you have set forth for it to do Lord Lord we are in anticipation an expectation Lord for you to visit us this morning Lord you said that whenever two or three were gathered together in Your Name Lord that you'd be in our midst Lord we're relying on that Lord come and keep your word let me just ask you feel welcome here and that you would just be gracious to us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen a bless you can turn around and just welcome somebody next to you just say God bless you I sure just don't ride by the mic with this song reading this morning you can also have your seats as what the Micah she's doing good morning [Applause] you know we've been uh we've been blessed over the years to have so many wonderful songs of the faith and of praise and worship and they can be an encouragement to us or they can be an expression of our praise but you know I I wonder you know as I was thinking about some of that is uh you know sometimes we enjoy the melody or the beat but I wonder if we pay attention to the words that we're singing you know if we're not careful we find ourselves singing something that you know we're responding to a song that isn't really Our Testimony it doesn't match our experience and for example there's an old gospel song that you know came to my mind this week as I was reading the psalm goes like this there's a River of Life flowing out from me it makes the lame to walk and the blind to see but I wonder how closely we listen to the words of that song it says there's a River of Life flowing out from me you know it's a life-giving river that changes how people walk it changes causes them to see it opens prison doors it's not something that happens to them when their favorite song is played in church but it's something that constantly proceeds from a people from me from you a river I was thinking about that as we were reading so as I was reading Psalm 46 we're going to turn to that this morning you know there's a verse in verse 4 that's very familiar I think to all of us it says there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacle of the most high you know I wonder if there's anybody that's been to that River amen that I think we're all familiar with this River that the scripture speaks of this River of Life we sing about it and there's many scriptures about it we'll look at a couple of them this morning but you know as I was reading that a couple things about this River of Life kind of stuck out to me you know David says that this river is a source of gladness for the city of God you know and I got to thinking about that what is a city well you know it's a Dwelling Place it's a place of habitation it's a place where people live together dwell together in a community together but it's this the city of God is the place where he dwells with his people cohabitating dwelling together in Fellowship you know in fact he says this specifically in verse 5. he says God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved you know it's the it's a Dwelling Place of God a place that's established it's a place that's unmoving where God dwells with his people and this River is for those it's for those that are dwelling together with him you see there's a dwelling component of this River it makes glad those ones you know this isn't a place the river is not something you just visit every once in a while something you go and splash around in every once in a while when you have a good time but it's a constant state of being dwelling not just an occasional visit this isn't talking about something you visit on Sundays or Wednesdays or in special meetings but it's a benefit of being in a Dwelling Place in a constant state of being you know David says it this way in Psalm 1 and verse 2 and 3. speaking of one of those he says but his Delight what makes him happy what makes him glad is in the law of the Lord the word and in his law doth he meditate day and night constantly dwelling and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water somebody who's very Delight is the word it's what makes him happy it's his Delight you notice the river is in his Delight the word is his delight and then the river is the benefit of dwelling in that word dwelling constantly in that word meditating day and night that person who's constantly dwelling in the word is like a tree planted by the rivers of water something that's planted is established it's a dwelling place it's a permanent place it's not a visit again not visiting the river constantly plugged into it you know it's uh those that are dwelling in the city of God benefit from this River as we'll read in psalm 46. those that are constantly dwelling in the word benefit from this River there's a dwelling component to being a beneficiary of that River of Life but the thing that also struck me is that this River has an effect you know in Psalm 46 it says it makes glad those in that Dwelling Place in Psalm 1 and verse 3 it says this and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so the effect of being plugged into this River is as it brings life it produces fruit it causes to grow it causes to be fruitful it's a life-giving effect that this water brings but Jesus said it this way in John 7 and verse 38. he said he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water see now this river is just not something you benefit from but it's something you produce it's something that flows out of you just like the song says there's a River of Life flowing out from me you see the effect of partaking of this River is is that you become a source of that River it's just not something you go and you Splash around and to have a good time but it's something that should cause you in turn to be a River of Life to bring forth life to someone else you know when Jesus was speaking to that Samaritan woman in John 4. the woman at the well he said this but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst you know and sometimes we just stop right there that we you know our thirst is quenched when we drink of that water but he didn't stop there he said but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life see it's more than just about having our thirst quenched it's about becoming a source of life and that could only come by dwelling in that presence constantly there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God as the song says come to the river there come to the water there's a vast Supply but know this this isn't an invitation just to Splash around in the water a bit and have a good time as we'll read here in Psalm 46 this is about a dwelling place it's a call to come and dwell in that place where yes you benefit from the city but it's all about the dwelling it says in John 14 23 if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him we can go ahead and stand this morning this was to turn to Psalm 46 you know more than anything this Psalm is a call to enter into a dwelling place as we'll read it's you know it starts in verse one God is our refuge and strength a very present help in a time of trouble and as you know we read this together consider what it would be to not have a refuge to not have a dwelling place to be planted next to that River in the hour that we're in it's almost like we'll be reading the front pages of the newspaper as we read this together but you know I'm grateful to have a Dwelling Place I'm grateful to have access to that River but you know the question is is it something we go and play around in every once in a while or is it something we're planted by is it something that's producing fruit is it something that's causing us to be able to impart life in others let's read that Psalm 46 together starting in verse 1 God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Selah there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the heath enraged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Selah come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakth the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth The Chariot in the fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge

that you may come and take this service under your control that we may say it was good to be in the house of God we love you and we commit everything to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you so good to be in the house of God man we want to welcome everyone all our visitors I also want to remember whether David and sister Leslie pray that the Lord will certainly bring them back safe to us amen many to open our Bibles this morning I try to work this thing out we will open to Revelation chapter 3 a very familiar scripture reading oh we'll start from the 14th verse amen are you happy to be in the house of God Amen good um it says and unto the angel of the Church of daudisi and write these things right these things say the amen and the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God it says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would I word that that were called oh hard it said so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold or hot nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith I'm rich and I'm increased with good I have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked they said I cancel thee to buy of me gold Trident fire that thou may have to be rich and white Raymond that that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou may have seen it says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so so the the way back or or the Zeal that is calling for is is the the repentance the ability to recognize that you are wrong and repent and come back it says that that you come back that you repent and you be zealous therefore and repent it says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh I will grant a seat with me in my throne even as I overcome and am set with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the Church Father we ask you blessed word to us this morning Lord that you may just come by our way and speak to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen let me have your seats this morning so this morning we'll try not to be too long I want to speak on overcoming this evil generation and it's important as the description we just read of of the age that we are living in the prophet is telling us this is uh perhaps a summary of the age as you would say this is an evil age and it says the god of his of this evil age is Satan we know that when he said that Satan this is we we it calls this age or the time that we are living in he calls it Satan's Eden and it talks about how it's by through education science and technology that has become the god of this evil age is used uh men's knowledge to to create and to civilize and to do the things that we are in and everything around us is designed by him it says here that this is a lukewarm age meaning it's the age where people are not hot or cold they are lukewarm which is a mixing so in other words it's okay for you to be a little bit religious and a little bit in the world that will go through but we find out that the the requirement is that he would he would that that would be cold or hot that you'll be perfectly identified so so it's an age even as we we look at what's happening outside we can see Barbara will tell us it's the age of complete deception uh deception to where we we've gotten to a place where people don't even know whether they are men or woman talk about lukewarm talking about mixing talking about time where uh uh uh Satan's has become the god of this evil Age and and we can see as it was promised that is growing bigger and bigger we we could say you know five years ago that perhaps it was bad to be in this world and the things that were happening but we can surely say today is worse than it was five years ago when and we we are also guaranteed that if we continue to live it will be worse than it is today so it's not getting better it's getting worse then the prophet will talk about how the world is out of control and and the countries are out of control the economy is out of control I was sitting and thinking about this I realized the the people are applying things that they have applied in the past where they knew well if this happened we do this we should be able to stop it and now it's not working anymore they've run out of knowledge they they try to save faces and trying to assure that things are under control but we know they are not under control it's a complete chaos and and and the people are here it's a it's the age of a woman but the prophet will say the rights and people's rights and everything and and yes and you can ask yourself we live in such a time where we don't even have the proper definition of what a woman is it it's amazing people that are educated people that went to school people that are that have studied and understand they will stand there and and and will will not be able to answer a question of what a woman is and you will look at them and wonder what has happened to the man what has happened to this world it's what was promised will happen this is what happened when Jesus is taken out of the church this is what happened when God is no longer in schools this was what happened when God is taken out of our Lives all that's left is complete chaos oh my all that's left is is a complete wandering and and I begin to think about that this morning and I say aren't we glad for the message of the hour aren't we glad that God has sent us a message to take her out of this confusing situation out of this wandering situation of this endless mind game situation to bring us into the bright age to those that have received this message they're no longer they are in the world but they are not of the world they are no longer subject to the things of laodicea they are in the world but they are living in another Age The Prophet will tell us it's brought us the message to get us ready so we can go in the Rapture the word that we have received is not for us to look and try to comprehend the things that are happening in the world but it's a word that so that we can get ready and be taken out of here Oh my he would come and it would it would tell us how the believer it's not time to get distracted anymore it's not time to to to let your work become uh take uh become the most important thing it's not time to let the case of Life take you over it's time to understand that this world is going to an end the cup of iniquity is filling up every day and at any moment we will be gone out of here we are promised it could be in the next minute in the next hour it's not time to get distracted don't don't get caught outside don't get caught trying to or figure out things or don't get caught being into trouble and difficulties or getting the bolted I'll say this morning get in the ark of the word of God let it get you ready for you to be taken out of here let it be the first thing in your mind when you wake up Let it Be the thing that takes up most of your mind every day you walk around there's no promise there is no hope for this world it's gone the only hope we have is the word that we have received and let this word becomes everything to you and I want to say this let's make our lives more important this life of the Gospel more important than anything we have so here he is he gives us the description of the time that we are living in and and Jesus would say the prophet will say in the message that thou they see in church age it says and today when and this is paragraph 253 says and and it says and today when Jesus is standing outside of the Pentecostal organization the baptism organ the Baptist organization Methodist organization trying to get back in with the Pentecost again it says the people are passing by the people are passing by it says after you it says after you your worldliness and the things has pushed him out of the church what push them out at the church instead of the church being the the body of Christ the representative of who he is his life being reflected in them they've they've allowed things to come in and in letting the things to come in it's pushed them out the way we push them out is by allowing the worldliness come into our life is by allowing our cares of life to come into our lives and take over in that way it's pushed out and and he says he pushed him out of the church and says he's standing trying crying to get back in again and oh it's the most pathetic things I've seen in my life he said had had no need of him he says outside knocking trying to get back in that's the same thing he's trying to do today why he he was outside if you could excuse me yeah he is the the the the the very uh Lord Of Glory the the very master who knows your life and who can guide you the one who made you the one who knows exactly what you have need of we've taken him and put him outside and we're trying to solve our problems for ourselves we've taken him and put him outside and we're trying to figure out life ourselves here he is the one who has all the solution we've taken him and put him out and now the prophet will tell us and because they have done that the Lord is no longer dealing with the church he's not knocking into the hearts of individual and those who have accepted him he's making himself known unto them this is not a group thing anymore this is not time to say well because my parents believe because no one believed that means I'm good now you're not good this is the time so you can know him for yourself this is the time where he's making himself known to the individual this is the time where he's opening up of himself and Whispering secret to those who will hear him now we're speaking about overcoming this evil Age and and the prophet will say in the marriage of the Lamb he says you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh so this this overcoming that we're talking about is not God taking you and doing everything for you and pushing you through and then you come to the other side you said bless God I'm an overcomer says no you had nothing to do to overcome he said he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself it says I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respect to God so when we talk about this overcoming and and Oh Maya begin to realize what the Lord is speaking here it's so important we understand overcoming is not just a label that you are given overcoming is the process you have to go through when you're in the mud and you are down and you you taste of the defeat and and out of defeat something happened to you and you that was defeated you begin to stand up and to over overcome the things that they were challenging to you overcoming is wanting an experience so you can have an experience to know what is it that word that it is to be a sinner but at the same time he wants you to come to a place where you've tasted of his goodness and you know what it means to be a conqueror the very things that were taking you down now you have the ability to withstand them not another person but you the same person that went down let me tell you this the resurrection who the one who came up is not of the different person who went down the same Jesus that went down the same one who went down is the same one who Resurrected and therefore when we talk about her going through it's a learning process that God his warning is believing children to taste of and to be aware of so is trying to tutor us so we can become mature Sons and Daughters of God so we can know what it means to taste victory oh my he's trying to give us an experience with the word so in other words when you say I know God Is A Healer in other words you've tasted of that healing yourself you know what it means to be sick but then you also know what it means for your body to begin to restore you know what it means for your body to begin just like the testimonies we heard this morning that is overcoming oh I began to think about Jacob my one who was born in China one who just knew how to to run everybody around and he just knew how to to do wrong in all his life that's what he knew oh but it came a time where he sinned caught up with himself but he stood there and he realized he was in complete the faith and he had to overcome something oh when the Angels showed up and he began to wrestle with an angel he went down and he went up and he he went down and he hold him he held him until the sun was coming up then the angel said let me go he said I will not let you go until you bless me that's overcoming that the overcome is not without a fight it's one who's gone in the mud and descends up is one who knows something about winning and let me tell you you never know something about winning unless you've been in a fight Oh my he he wants us to move from being paved into Sons and Daughters who understands something about the power of God and the power of His word and I want to say this God has secured our overcoming in Christ and his ear manifesting The Works of what he has already done in other words this overcoming it's not us that are fighting the devil for the first time no he's taken a devil he's not the truth out of him he's made him nothing he's taken the power out of him so that these believing children can come and claim what belongs to them he overcame for us but he wants you this morning to stand up and say I believe that God did something for me I believe that my healing I've already got it I believe that my Deliverance is already purchased for therefore I'm standing out of my I'm standing and raising her out of the mud therefore I'm raising out out of my situation and I'm going to the devil to claim what belongs to me oh my let me say this it's important we understand that the overcoming is what gives you character without overcoming oh without the overcoming you have no character without the overcoming you just wondering oh I thank Jesus he did this for me you go to the devil you grab it out of his dirty hands Jesus has already paid a price this has already overcome for you but it's now your turn let me say this faith in the word of God will produce the good why because he paid for the good what he needs us as believing children this morning is to stand upon the victory that he already won so we can go and claim whatever we have made of this morning I need Deliverance go get it I need healing go get it I need salvation go get it it's already paid for he already overcame the devil for you you just go through the hands and grab it oh my what a place to be now I want to say this the process of receiving what we are asking for it's not dependent on the devil it's dependent on the believer to come and take and ask what is it that they have need of we can't blame the devil anymore we can't say well I can't be healed because the devil no Christ's already paid the price in fact the prophet will stand time and time again he says I can't heal you and if any man says he can heal you he's a liar that process of healing that power of healing was already given to the believer and let me just read this Oh I thought this just burned my heart as I came across it and and there are things in life where you you you you walk around and you study the Bible you study the message you have a certain understanding and you walk in it so so long but yet there comes a time where the Prophet you read something it completely changes the view that you had now he's speaking here it says he he speaks here in the prayer I forgot the name of the message I didn't write it down he says oh I say sir he says this Lord give us your promise this give give to us this promise it says I asked the father he says ask the father anything in my name I will do it it says yeah that's our promise it isn't free it isn't our faith in our prayer then it's just our faith in doing what he said do oh my it's not because I prayed I felt like heaven came down no it's not even because I have this certain ability to do something it's not it's not because I feel good at doing it but I'm just doing it because that's what he said to do right that's why you can remove all of the emotions overcoming you you can overcome when you are at the weakest place that you've ever been it's not because I shouted that means I overcame you can be in the dump and you can overcome out of it you can feel like a failure still overcome you don't have to be at the mountain top to overcome you can be in the valley and still overcome why because you did what he said to do [Applause] in another place now he talks about David and it says now notice notice this channel on the other side he didn't believe neither he says he didn't believe it he says neither will cancel he laughed and he says am I a dog and and you send a kid to come here and fight me he said I'll pick him up I'll pick you up on the end of my Spear and let the bird eat your flesh he says why he had all he said all everything on his side this is Goliath speaking now listen to this it says but you see that didn't Shake David at all he says why it was revealed to him he had the faith in what it was doing he had the faith in what he was doing in other words he had an understanding him himself I'm doing what God told me to do I'm speaking because God told me to speak I tell you when Moses speak it's not because he felt Almighty all he knew is I met a god in the wilderness he told me to go to Sparrow and speak and I'm here standing before you and saying let my people go in other words he said it knowing that the word The God Who gave me the words to speak the God who inspired me to speak he will come and make his word true now he says he node he knowed he was going to do it and he did it he it's because that is that was it was revealed to him and he know where he was standing and then he says and if God will speak that right down to your heart tonight you said you want he says you are not going to be laying in the bed in the bed you are not going to be sitting sitting in that chair he says you are you are going to be well they could he says there couldn't be anything change your mind in it but until that happens every preacher in the world could pray and I don't it says I don't say it wouldn't help you it would I would encourage you but until until that Faith see healing power is in you [Music] I don't it says I it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by revelation oh my brother my sister we have taken the power that's given to us and handed over to preachers we have taken the power that's handed to us and we've given it to other things the prophet is telling you this morning the power of Revelation comes from God and the power of healing is already in you the power of saving is already in you the power to be delivered is already in you this morning when you come it's a it's a sign that there's something in you that's already calling for the power to come to manifestation in other words it's just a deep calling unto the Deep why do you need saving unless say something in there that wants to be saved that's calling for a savior why do you need healing unless there's something in you that's already testifying of the healing in fact the prophet will send it says it's not me it's you that operate the gift it's not me that's doing it it's you you keep calling on God that the light will move and you will move from one person and it'll follow where the light is going what was it it was already in the people faith in the word will is what is going to produce the good amen oh my I wish I had a voice to preach this morning we take all of that's given to the believer we hand it over we wait oh God I need this is all said the reason why you're asking it is because I placed it in you didn't they say that everything that the seed has need of is already inside of it then they promise that it's already whatever nutrients whatever all you need is a revelation this morning oh my God give us Revelation Quicken our hearts so we know what is it that we are capable of what is it that we can do why is it that we can manifest in our life it's not waiting for somebody to come and manifest it for you but it's in you already so yeah we are so I say this morning faith faith in the word faith in the word of God will produce the promise faith in the promises of God will bring God into manifestation for your life now the prophet will also say to overcome is to keep life in you now I want to say this there is something out there in this world that's constantly every day trying to Chuck the Christian Life out of you you have to be aware of it your job tried to choke the life out of you oh my I was thinking you go to a store you're looking for something every week you go they rearrange everything last time I got it no it's all for them why they want you to walk around and walk around and all of a sudden before you get out you frustrated my goodness try to make a phone call to get your bill to to dispute something on your bill You're Gonna Lose It everything around it is made for you to lose your life and to to get frustrated to lose it to constantly be mad and and depressed and all of those things but God has given you his word this morning God is giving you his word this morning so so you can stand by him you can live by it so you can manifest it when frustration comes you say I'm not gonna get frustrated I refuse to get frustrated I refuse to get mad I stand on the word of God he promised to give me peace therefore I'll take my peace you will call the oppression from one person to another and then they'll ask you the same question that they started off with you explain your situation you asked for the manager and you sound like the person sitting next to the other person they all saying exactly the same thing by the time the phone call is ended you are blowed up you're ready to explode and then you lose your peace think of the devil that you just get you get you straight in you're driving on the people will cut you off and people will do all kinds of things on their cell phones that makeups and everything and oh I don't know how to live in this world anymore it's all made to just get you frustrated and frustrated but the word is yes this morning telling you you don't have to live that way that's why people have so much anxiety and all kinds of things it's the world itself so let me tell you this morning there's something out there the devil is here trying to do everything that it can to get you out of your element to try to get you frustrated to try to get you to lose your mind but the word of God is here to build you into an overcomer the word of God is given to you this morning so you can take it and offer come buy it say this this morning I'm so thankful that the word that the God has not left us alone but he has sent us a message that knows every tactic of the enemy that describe everything that he's able to do so we can withstand it oh my but what I'm saying says he talks about our our first birth or our natural birth he says this he says notice now notice each Church age the same Overcomer when they each Son of God out of each age uh that says the same overcoming one day each son out of each age overcomes the temptation of that age and has got a scripture here for here he says I don't I don't think we really have time to make it but I know each one of the church ages same now it's just the same it's just like the same one who is it says see he said it at the beginning you are born defeated as I said in the beginning you were born defeated now this overcoming he's wanting to make it very clear it's not an Overcoming By The Elements of the world by one overcoming the World by the world it's not overcoming the World by thinking more of the world or by trying to rearrange the element of the world that's not where the overcoming comes from it says and that birth can never get you bring you to life because you are born defeated you are you are in a defeated World among defeated people among defeated Creed defeated denomination you've got to come to Victory somehow now that that covers everything that covers all that it is about Man part of the overcoming is the realization or the recognition that this flesh is already defeated there is nothing good that comes God can come out of this faith I'm born defeated there's no way it doesn't matter how good you try to do it doesn't matter how many times you try or for those of you that have lived a little longer you realize that however many times you try you will always find yourself to the same place right but it's not by education or by theology but this overcoming comes by the new birth one must be born again by the seed that's inside of them one must realize I cannot overcome by this flesh there has to be something else that God has placed inside of a Believer by which they can overcome now listen to this it says in first John chapter 5 verse 1 through 5 it says whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is born of God and everyone that loves of him that loves him that be God loved him also that is begotten of him it says by this we know that we love the children of God that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandment for this is the law the love of God previous he says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world so the secret to overcoming the world is to be born of God I want to be born of God I want to be born of God in my mind in my spirit in my soul in everything that I do I want to be part of God I want everything that comes out of those places to be vetted by the word of God to be brought forth by the word of God to be changed covered by the word of God the thinking of God the mind of God the spirit of God the soul of God functioning in me it says and this is the victory that overcomes the world if in our faith whosoever he says who is who is he that overcomes the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God we are not called to overcome the world with the world I say that because we do it a lot including myself something will happen and my great mind starts to find solution starts to rearranged situations what if this didn't really happen what if I could go back and change over here what if I could do this it will only produce a bigger failure I was thinking and this just came to me I was it was when we were listening to the tape about faith and I was fellowshipping with Brother David and he just became so apparent and just spoke to my heart we're not going to get him too far so and this was when the prophet is here now speaking about we have to have an experience and it just came to my heart I was thinking about Yaris Goliath of the standing and challenging the children of Israel he's there standing there and boasting forth and and Burman says David at an experience and I thought if you go and you read the story and you begin to look at it Goliath the The Saul had an experience but he understood that his experience was not enough to fight Goliath the scripture says he was Head and Shoulders he was well trained in the sword and he just knew how to Willow the soul he had a special way to dress himself to war he he fought a lot of wars and he overcame it now but this one he knew this is different he summed up all his experience about everything now I'm talking about carnal and carnal mind and I'm talking about spiritual mind I'm talking about overcoming the world the with the world and overcoming the World by the word of God so here is one who had an understanding who just knew the tactics and everything but yet all of that was carnal it was something Saul was chosen by man so therefore everything that he could come up with was the best that men can come up with but before this giant that was not good enough but yet David yes who it was this little young child and who that just seemed like he was not even Faith to fight but he had a different kind of experience and his experience was God my father had let me watch the ship and when I was watching the ship a lion came to take it a lion came and he took one of the ships and he says I followed him I took it out of his mouth and I killed him so he knew something about positioning he knew something about when God places you somewhere when God calls you to do something that there's nothing that can stop you [Music] he knew something about the bear coming up oh the bear came in because I was in my position he was in his heart to protect the sheep that God placed under his his care so he went and he slew it therefore when he stood there the experience spoke to him once again he knew that with this kind of experience I have just been anointed king of Israel and if that is the true that God has anointed me King over Israel I have the power to go and protect them my brother my sister worldly experience will not get you anywhere let's get this inspiration by the word of God let's get this inspiration by God and the scripture says as many as receive him to them give any power for them to become Sons and Daughters of God by inspiration of God coming upon you and leading you oh I want to overcome the world the evil age that I'm living in and the only way to overcome is by the word of God but when the scripture will say in John 16 and 28 it says let me start from for the sake of time he says 31 it says Jesus answered and said Do you believe he says behold the hour has come the hour cometh here is now that ye shall be scattered in every man to his own and he shall live and shall leave them alone he says and yet I'm not alone because the father is with me this thing I've spoken to you that ye may have that ye might know that ye may have peace in the world they may have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world the one who's sending you he's the one who overcame the world the one I'm too glad we know someone who overcame the world Jesus remember what I'm says and what was the Holy Spirit given for or what is a holy ghost it says the the way the same way that God sent Jesus is the same way that he's sending you he says how did he send Jesus the father that sent him went in him so if the father that sent him went in him the Jesus who's sending you he's growing in you my brother my sister if I want to do something I want to find somebody who knows something about it don't give me give me something somebody was trying to learn together with her with give me somebody who knows what they're talking about so this Jesus is saying to you don't be fearful don't be afraid I have overcome the world and the prophet will tell you that everything that you went through he went through you say he doesn't know anything about my situation he does the headache that you go through the suffering that you go he knows something about being dead he knows something about being healed he knows something about having a headache he knows something about oh my carrying the burden of the Cross and getting to a place where you can't carry the weight and you crumble down and you need someone to help you if he doesn't know anything that you're going through then he cannot be the high priest makes him the high priest is that this morning whatever situation you're going through he knows about it and he himself has been through it therefore he can come and Whisper to your ears says I I know something about this you know comforting from someone who's been through where you've been is the one that helps it's not one who knows nothing about well at least one who's honest it will help but one who's been in the trenches to know what it means to be defeated he says you know I know something about being tempted you're a teenager oh yeah I was a teenager I know something about your mind and you're thinking and your body changing and the things you old folks he says I know what you go through he says I was a young man and I know what it means to work up and perhaps bill you feel your body tired and and things like that he fall asleep in the boat he didn't fake it he was tired and to fall asleep he says I know something about overcoming now he says to you that's why it's important and I know I'm not going to be able to get to the end but let me say this here when he gives you his word he's giving you the formula to overcoming the word of God is not something we just study and get excited and say oh wonderful no it's an overcoming power we are told that the word of God will defeat the Devil at any place any time under any circumcision says if God had anything better to give you he would have and he has what was it it was the word right so therefore whatever situation you're going through I don't care whether it's children marriage family whatever apply the word it's an it's the only formula that is guaranteed success sit down be honest with one another say I've messed up I did this wrong remember he says he overcame by the word and humility we to a place where we can humble ourselves and admit when we are wrong or not going okay say you know what it should have gone this way I'm sorry I don't want to go back and I don't want to sit here and say I was wrong you were right and and get in the fight you know what we gotta end this today take the word and and remember the prophet says this and I'm running just to try to get to a close now it's saying that it's when Jesus is out that when trouble sets in when we when the word is no longer the center of our relationship when the word is no longer what we gather around that's when trouble sets in and therefore I say to you bring back the word bring him back into the conversation do get to the word the word says humble yourself I don't care if it's not your fault you just say you know what I'm sorry it wasn't supposed to go this way I apologize let's find a way to get back together let's find a way to solve our problems because outside of this you are going into a devil's place you are you are you are walking in some place that is not guaranteed an answer that's not guaranteed an overcoming Victory outside of this you are venturing by yourself oh my let me go quickly here so now he says what what here are the comforting words of Jesus Christ I have overcome the world and if you ever want anything it says I have overcome this morning I have overcome the world this means it's a he is here saying he overcame he is the only one who knows how to overcome Satan and the world good what are you looking for you go read the doctor so and so on find out how to make your relationship better that's not the answer the answer is the word what is the word saying that I'm not doing a teenager I I don't know I'm constantly messing up what is the word says that I need to go apply so I can overcome the testimony we heard this morning I I need to overcome I realize I'm living a defeated life what do I do I need the Holy Ghost and the moment you say the Holy Ghost there's a holy ghost in you that's seeking for Revelation and that comes into place say this it's the blue for us to get out of this world into the Rapture there is no other way and and I want to say this because it's important the word of God was given to us in this generation to bring us back into God's original mind original idea of what he intended for you to be this word was not given so we can go to some Churches it's gone by it was given to us so we can move out of this world and go back into that original condition that God intended for you sin brought you in this condition but the word is here to bring you right back into that original condition and it's only when we use it that's what will bring us into the real you say what was it to be like Adam he obeyed the word he did what the world told him to do he named The Animal by the word that was inside of him he spoke the word when it was time to speak the word and may I not go too far in this generation have we not seen one come into that condition what did he come by by the word and humility if the musician could come we'll continue another time oh my isn't it wonderful overcome Jesus told us how to do it he overcome overcoming me overcome means to stand the test whatever tests the enemy let me say this the enemy is here to destroy families to wreak havoc to make you ineffective and we cannot take a chance to try to resolve things by our own mind and our own ability don't do that it will not work if it works it's going to work for two seconds and you'll find yourself worse off than you did before it's like holding a lie the longer you hold it the worse it gets the quicker you tell the truth the better it is he told us that what is it is it it means to stand the test that's right like all the like the old Saints like Jesus he says it admits in admits of the all his enemies he stood the test now he says one place that he came forth with a dirty name he was born with a dirty name he said the very birth was questionable think about a baby a child having to First even overcome the fact that some call him a legitimate and all kinds of things but he said he overcame every stage of it what was he doing it for he was doing it for you so when he comes at the end and he gives you his word that's why the fullness of the word we can't play around with these things the fullness of the word has come to the bride and you have to understand outside of that word there's no Victory all the victory that you ever need of is in that word [Applause] we get excited somebody comes and preaches some things that don't make no sense and everything everybody gets excited all the new doctrines and the newness and forget all of that stay with the word that's the only thing that's guaranteed to give you the victory is the message of the hour not a new doctrine not a new that's why I appreciate so much what our pastor does here he plays the tape so we know what the messenger said so we know what the word says so when we preach you know whether we are telling you the truth or not president every single one that comes behind the smoking we try to stay with what the prophet said we don't come here with our own mind we try to say what he said why because that's a weapon that will overcome and let me say this don't don't get caught up into excitement about other stuff gets excited in the word and stay with the word however humble it looks however simple it looks however whether it sounds dry or whatever if it's the word to take it [Applause] don't fall for somebody coming in and preaching and you go wow and everything stay with what if the messenger says it rejoice in it if it didn't say it stay away from it like I'm talking about the key to overcoming so he takes it's like someone writing a memoir about everything about their lives they come and they said I'm here you know I have overcome the world you said I do it says okay now he says I am come down in Revelation 10 7. and I'm coming here and I'm giving to my messenger the book The Secret of overcoming and I'm sending it to go to the bride and give him that book so she can eat it now remember when he had to when she when you add the book there's some bitter parts and some sweet so you don't have to say oh I'll just take the sweet part and no you eat the whole boat it will save you it will save your family it will deliver you it will solve your problems it will fix your marriage whatever the situation is that book isn't good enough to bring the solution to it all right I just can't feel I don't know where to stop I'm sorry so here it is it says to to stand the test and the ride of all senses in the midst of it enemy he stood the test he says everything he was it was tested against his student he stood his student this is in the message how can I overcome paragraph 103. he says in the face of sickness and him being the Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself overcoming is not just standing on top a mountain and shouting it Lord I don't know what's happening my world is upside down right now but I'm surrendering myself to you because I know in your able hands you are able to protect and secure me it doesn't matter if death is before me whatever is before me I will stand against it because I believe that thou are with me isn't that what David said though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death behold thou are there he says if I made my bed in hell Behold our if I go in the outermost part of the earth behold he says such knowledge is so wonderful for me I can't even attain it what kind of God it is is it is the one who's here to protect you and his word is our ticket out of him his word is the blueprint to overcoming his word is the formula for us to live in overcoming life let's all stand this morning [Applause] isn't it wonderful says you welcome the word in your midst and he will do what you promise you will do you want Rapture take the word [Music] I believe it's not too far-fetched for me to say Rapture is already in you that's right you should know that how is it in You by the word of God it's the inspiration that we need the Revelation to come and shock us to bring that portion of the word to come to life in due season but we don't have to abandon what we know Works to go after things that we are that are questionable when we have the blueprint to the very success of God he himself coming he says you take the word it's him that you are taking I like a quote that brother Kaufman and I have talked about a few months ago he sent it to me he says that God gave to the believer his word which is himself he himself coming to dwell in you you take him and you don't have to worry about anything our gracious father how we are so thankful this morning [Music] Lord I know we have circumstances and situation that we find ourselves in and sometimes we don't even know how to get ourselves out but Lord we come to you this morning we desire that we may bring you back as the center of our Lives Lord that you'll be the foundation on which we are built not our own minds not our own thinkings but your word we pray this morning that father God from Young to mature Believers this morning may you come by our way Lord and add a little bit more measure of yourself Lord father though you may make us overcome us by Your Word in humility [Music] you would say that the greatest people I the ones that you'll come next to them and they make you feel like you are great Lord you've given us your word and you've made us feel like we are great but we're here to Humble ourselves to you oh God recognizing your greatness in this hour to know that it's you that's moving in US Lord if there be any need this morning Lord you said faith in your word will produce the good may you come and touch the absolute hand and the heart that's crying out to you the need that's been lifted up before you Lord God that you may become a reality to that person that it may have in a true experience like David this morning and say that the Lord is my helper the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemy when they come upon me they stumble and they fall oh Father may you come this morning to each and every one Lord that is listening to this that you make yourself a reality to them we love you Lord we commit what we are to you we pray now that you send your Holy Ghost to come and make this world a reality to our hearts we love you and ask such things in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's just sing that is where the cause men come holy words [Music] oh and when all that time [Music] oh [Music] my true love foreign [Music] before that the world [Applause] of God [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning [Music] come with Open Hearts oh let the word of God impart amen brother Billy mentioned this in the service this morning and I was moved because the overcome the Overcomer already overcame and now he's in you so you can overcome by the same power that already overcame all you have to do is stick with the word and the word will tell you the next step you're walking into and that's the overcoming power we're only Reapers of what was already sowed so if the word of God is a seed we're not Reapers of that very word that came in our generation and now when we become that Revelation at word we now saw because it's not you that speaketh but it's Christ that lives inside of you what a privilege Saints it's not something we take for granted but it's something you love with humility with with the humbleness just knowing God desires to use you and to live inside of you amen that makes me happy that makes me want to just shout and praise the Lord because that's who we are that's our identity and not because of something that the world gave you but it's something that came from eternity that was already in you you're just now being made aware of it amen what a service what a word let it become flesh now I wanted to sing this song I'll Praise You In The Storm and you know we praise them in the storm because we love him for what he's doing for us every day we got to be mindful of the little things this takes care of your Saints your daily bread you know the things that we have sometimes you know we take it for granted but he's always there for you if you're there for him because he wants to have this fellowship with you I would say it this way if you need prayer this morning I know the the Lord's here this morning because his word came forth and it was the truth and if you desire something on your heart this morning ask for prayer and know that it's your faith that will touch you because it's already in you let's just sing this song I was sure by now my tears away [Music] but once again [Music] [Applause] of God [Music] anymore no matter where I am [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I remember [Music] my crisis You Raise Me Up Again my strength is [Music] if I can't find you [Music] I barely whisper through the rain I made you Mercy foreign [Music] [Music] no matter where I where are you and every tear I Cry [Music]
