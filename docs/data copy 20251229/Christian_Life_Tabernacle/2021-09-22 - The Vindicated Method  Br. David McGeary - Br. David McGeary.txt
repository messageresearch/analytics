great resurrection gift we ask you to bless each one that's here this evening may it be special to them for their sacrifice we just ask you to be with us now in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen god bless you this evening let's turn over in our bibles to the book of romans and the fourth chapter and uh you know i i just enjoyed the word so much sunday that i'm just gonna stay right in it amen and just hope that as we go through a few more pages and a few more paragraphs it would really uh be a a blessing to us and we just want to lay this little foundation here out of romans because i think it's a really a beautiful thing if we read it i i've been listening to romans 4 and 5 a little bit here lately and it's really blessed me but let's say this as we read here in romans chapter 4 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found so what did abraham find for if abraham were justified by works he hath wherefore to glory but not before god for what saith the scriptures abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt so he's saying if you work to get it then you know you got what you deserve but he said but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness amen amen even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works amen so david even said blessed is the man you know that god imputes righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered that's in psalms psalms 32 1 and blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessing then unto the circumcised only or unto the uncircumcised also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision may the lord add his blessing to his word amen amen you may be seated unless you want to stand up the whole service and that's good i think you all graduated from a m so uh anyway i i just enjoyed the word of the lord uh and uh the word of the lord just getting richer and and better and this is a beautiful scripture because uh man's always struggling with what part does he play in things and and uh it's hard to receive it so paul addresses it here he says you know abraham didn't do any works to receive the promise amen so it what was counted to him for being righteous was that he believed what god said and and that's also counted to us and also blessed is the man whom god does not impude sin to and that's great to us as gentiles because as the gentiles we know that we we came in to the world we were sinners we didn't have the promise of of of circumcision naturally that gave us a covenant to of inheritance but we were gentiles without the law and we know where there is no law there's no transgression and and so but yet our very natures we knew that sin dwelt in our mortal bodies and then bought god by his graciousness by his faith by his power amen he brought us to the realization by the quickening of our spirits he brought us under conviction and and through that move of grace so it wasn't that we were righteous and then obtained the grace of god but just like abraham's faith was not given in the righteousness of circumcision but it was given by the righteousness of faith that he believed god and just like for us we were in sin and god brought us under conviction and we believed that we were sinners and we therefore we cried out abba father and that's what was imputed to us for righteousness and then what was given to abraham was the sign of this agreement that he had between god that god said that he would multiply his children that that that they he would be blessed all the childrens of the earth would be blessed from him and that the promise would come through his seed so he gave them the covenant or a sign of circumcision in other words every one of your offspring all your males will all have this sign that they've received this covenant now we know that's bled over into christianity and things but the real circumcision for the christian is not a natural or physical because that was what was in the law that's what came down through adam and that's why that had to be given because the first adam was a living soul but now we have a covenant of circumcision and it's not the circumcision in the flesh it's the circumcision in the spirit and what that circumcision in the spirit does it separates us from all unbelief amen that's god's covenant to us that is blessing to us that we'll be totally separated from all unbelief can you imagine now this is what he's saying this is what he said i'm going to do for you amen not by works but by grace not but not that it's imputed to you because you earned it he says i'm going to give you a faith that will separate you from all doubt that's my covenant with my children and that's how they'll know that they are my children because they will believe god they'll believe every word of god that's they that that's the real circumcision is the circumcision from unbelief we think a lot of times that circumcision of the gentile circumcision is i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do this i don't do that he's trying to tell us it's not by that it's not the covenant by works it's the covenant of faith or revelation that you believe what god's word tells you and when god sees that so he's not going to impute the sin he's not going to lady or charge the works of unbelief but he's going to give you the faith to believe everything that god said so sin is an attribute of what unbelief so therefore if you believe god and you believe the word of god you sin not there's no charge to lay to you because he bore that at calvary amen so we're we're seeing that we're trying to move up and that's what we talked about sunday i i have you know it just seemed like it miraculously the holy spirit moved sunday just his presence was here just so mighty and strong in doing things and we were realizing and i believe the lord was here because we were touching into the things that our messenger wanted to share with us and we saw that there was there was a justification that's when a man is convicted of his sins and and and then all that he's done is justified by what he did in other words he never did it in the first place so there's nothing laid to his charge it's totally imputed and then we saw sanctification how a man that's been justified no longer wants to be associated with the sin that caused him and put him in the condition he was so you're not going to be justified is as if you never did it and then continued to do it i like the song the brother is saying if i didn't get it from the world so the world can't take it away amen so if you didn't get justification if you got justification from yourself then you're going to find yourself doing the same things over and again but praise god that he's got something he's offering that takes us away from the things and we if we could go into all with how one by sin came by one and by one how that all sin was taken away but it's wonderful so we see this great thing so in others when you're justified you no longer do the things anymore that you were freed from so therefore we call that sanctification so in other words if you're going to keep going you have to go to sanctification you can't stay there at justification i do wrong i go confess my sins priest gives me penance i go do wrong the catholics never got out of justification they're dying there that's why luther came out of it because they were stuck so he said no we're not saved by our repentance we're saved by his blood amen there's only one place to meet him and that's in the shed blood so we are sanctified and then he said then wesley came around said if we're sanctified then we're not going to keep doing those things and then we realize after that that god he gave the baptism of the holy spirit the restoration of gifts that that was and and we found out that when a believer's there he's got a deed so and we we talked about this so he claimed he laid whole and so we saw what that was in the believer is that he saw these promises of god and they said i believe them they're mine but that didn't stop satan from keep saying they're not yours they don't belong to you you are you are still guilty you're still the sinner you're still in bad shape you're all these things are are are still there and you're still in that battleground but now we found out that our messenger came along and said there's there's something else that goes beyond that oh and that only came by malachi 4 5. and that was the abstract or the original proof that you were the boundaries that he spoke in the beginning so in other words if you we're using property so if if you take all of texas or all of the world it's one great big massive world right but then somebody comes along and he says from this point to this point to this point to this point now will be uh texas all right so that's that's the abstract the original boundaries well you know so in the spiritual realm we say everybody's saved well everybody claims that but it doesn't it it makes you part of everybody so now you're just dealing with the crowd you're dealing with a religion we're all part of this a great big general thing and or we're all part of this a great big general group and and it's a group of group but this comes down to an individual affair where you get the abstract which brings you all the way back to the beginning and shows you that you were there in the beginning in his mind in his thinking in his attributes all the way from the beginning that's beyond the baptism of the holy spirit so that's what we're moving into we're moving in to receiving the abstract you know once you possess it you never have to be refilled with it you don't have to keep running to the altar it's over and that's where we're going to pick up tonight amen so we're going to start reading paragraph by terror gap and shouting and having a jubilee and a good time in the lord so we left off the other night right here at paragraph 295. so i'm going to call this tonight because i i don't really preach series so it's not the study of of uh this the seventh study every single one's a brand new fresh manna you know what i mean so i i wanna brother makes a statement and here he says and i'd like to call this the vindicated method all right so so he says he says now remember now quicking to see what these things are so remember he said zoe meant the spirit of god moving through you so watch the quickening power of the day that we live in so right this power quickened quickened luther it quickened wesley it quickened the believers and now there's a quickening power that for our time and day and that quickening power was returning the abstract another the proof to you individually the proof to you that you were there with him in the beginning oh my so you're you just watch as we read here it's it it it removes something so in other words we're all in a hope so i hope i live right i hope i do right i've got the spirit trying to help me live right i know it's the holy spirit because it convicts me of sin but can you imagine moving past that go where it's settled that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt not a hope not looking at your own life to see if if your life doesn't but it's absolutely been settled i know beyond a shadow of a doubt because i possess it right now i possess the proof that i was with him in the beginning everybody wants a birth certificate well i want my birth certificate to go way past the day i met him on the roof want my birthday to say that my name was on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the beginning of the world that's what i want for my birth certificate because i just wasn't birthed when i came to the knowledge that i was a sinner i was in birth when i got sanctified i wasn't birthed when i got filled with the holy ghost i was birthed when he thought of me in the beginning so now i've got the proof of that in an abstract that he gives the believer and not everybody gets the abstract because the abstract only came through malachi 4-5 i don't care what you say the abstract is the abstract when men lost the abstract it went back to him and it was in the book and he had to come open the book and he's the only one that can give out the abstract the original proof that you were with him in the beginning everybody else is living under a hope so everybody else is hoping that their sins are forgiven everybody else hopes they've got the holy ghost but you don't hope no there's no more hope so praise god you say that's right is that possible yes that's what he's trying to do in this age get rid of the in and out get rid of the ups and downs get rid of all those things so he says now remember he says now quicken it quickened to see what these things are that's what he wants to do watch the quickening power of this day remember we are quickened amen watch the quickening power of this day and so he's talking about the quick inner power of this day you guys can read but let's drop down to paragraph 303. said oh one day when i was weary myself i said he's i said you he said boy you'd better go ahead you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the lord you better hurry up and do it you're get you're getting old and there that morning the quickening power can't come and he let me look over the curtain and i've seen all you over there amen so what the quickening power took him all the way over i like that so the abstract takes us all the way back the quicking power in this day takes us all the way over hallelujah right that's what he said it i all that he said he looked over the curtain time and i've seen all of you over there huh see he said all that you ever loved and all that loved you they're given to you i've seen them all over there like that what was it quickening power you understand this quickening power is something that does not operate in the carnal realm it operates in the spiritual realm hallelujah you're a part of a move of zoe moving through you right now something that's living and producing fruit and living right now so that's that quickening power so he says let's look at the quickening power today so we can watch this quickening power move watch what it's doing watch what it's producing what it is so it's not some old stale study of the scriptures it's not some old study of message history it's a living resurrection god if you're doing what he wants and what did he promise to do in this day i'm going to take my sons and my daughters i'm going to give him the divine revelation of the abstract that they were with me in the beginning so that as he is so are we in this world and where did that happen how was that quickened how was that brought about how did the quickening power do it in this days he says he said quickening power and if the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal bodies mortal body remember the quickening power so let's get in tune with this power it's not theology it's not study it's revelation of the moment you see that it's revelation of where he is not where he's been he says now look at what we've seen in this day so what what did he say the quickening power was when we started their first quote the quickening power lets us see what's been done how many baptist churches are telling their people that the seven seals have been open and that malachi 4 5 was here an elohim stood in our midst discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart may not one no not one uh-uh but what let you see it quickening power the power of god oh wait a minute i'm a sinner wait a minute did you see it did abraham see it after he was circumcised or before he was circumcised the circumcision comes as a token showing you that you received it oh hallelujah i i mean just let's just read this if i can stick it like now i'm tired of people telling me i'm too long if you think i'm too long turn off your computer if you think i'm too long get up and go home but you get under this inspiration you don't want to leave it so if if i can stay in it for three hours i'm gonna stay in it for three hours you don't have to join me but don't rob me of my joy with your with your too long i can eat a whole tray of of that five-layer dessert i just eat and when that's gone you know i i love leslie's lasagna i'll sit down one day i used to be working and i thought young man i hold a pan of lasagna she used to make two pans one for me and one for everybody else so you know what i mean like i say you leave whenever you want this says look what we've seen in this day all right so now he's pointing out part of the quickening power that you know you have the quickening power is that watch the quickening power he says it lets you see right because that that's what's so that's so beautiful about it he and then this is what paul said he said and i think our lord said and so did paul what the father hath showed me i have not held nothing back i tell you and in these last days when we seen his quickening power upon us oh my what showing us things what did the spirit do when the spirit comes he will show you things to come hallelujah all right so he says look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals so now you saw that didn't you you saw those seals you saw what they were what they revealed who those horse riders were who those things were that was the quickening power that let you see that that came because the abstract is being returned to you and now you're seeing what it is that you possess yeah what what was that the intelligence of a man know the quickening power of god see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angels of the lord i told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth you're a part of that what was imputed for righteousness that you live some great holy life or that when you saw the pillar of fire you said that's that's elohim the same yesterday today and forever what was imputed for you for righteousness that when you saw the cloud that that you said that was a missile rocket you know all these guys think they're dis proving the message that they're just proving their judgment that ain't imputed to righteousness any bird brain can come up with a rocket theory but it takes quickening power to see it as jesus christ the same yesterday to them you can't do that carnally you got to do it by the resurrected power of the quickening amen uh the quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we know just look this just look this away and it's our lord jesus up there you see hallelujah what is that what is that's working in you it's the it's quickening power working in you if you get it mixed up with the baptism of the holy ghost you'll be running in a circle you've got the holy ghost oh i'll let those let that just eat up the people that are hung up on evidence hey when you get this abstract what did we just read nobody can take it away nobody can say you don't got the holy ghost wait a minute i got proof and then and what did we say that the the proof was is that it it drew you closer to the word wasn't that what the proof of it was if it draws you away from the word it's not him but when it draws you closer to the word you know it's him okay amen and so that that he says now look how can you say that the spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here is your evidence here is your evidence you want to know if the spirit of god's working in you here is your evidence whether you got it or not if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens you to the word so when you think that you see the seals because of you're some intellectual if the world give it to you the world can take it away and that's why they can walk with it all the wine they want and what happened the world gave it to him and therefore the world took it away but when he give it to you the world can never take it away right and it quickens you to the word for he is the word and if and if it contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ care what you've done until that moves you in the word my keep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word uh as i was talking the other day so we're just coming down here so he said i got weary and so we know he says now look at this this opened the seven seals it wasn't the intellect of man he's the one who opened those seals see you're not when you have this abstract and you know what was in the beginning then then when those seals are open you say that that's him that's him because it came by malachi 4 5. and that that's in you he he gives that to you and that when you receive that you receive that quickly power and you say oh my goodness it's by by that that i saw the seals were open it was by that i saw the church age messenger it was by that power i saw the son of man you understand that quickening power was working you all the way from the beginning bringing you into the statue of a perfect man that he could deliver that capstone and what that capstone is it's the abstract deed that's what capped you off you love him and he loves you and nothing can move that and though he says here he says he said now let's just read it says he says that who and open them seven seals for the whole world the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened oh amen what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ revealing what you're abstract because remember as we read because you were in him when he went to calvary you were in him when he rose you were in those seals you are in those thunders look at it and ever and the very seven angels was represented the seven church ages all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega hallelujah and he said showing his alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us what's he trying to do get rid of the doubt if you don't believe that was him and you don't believe that was him then you're going to be struggling with this message if you're going to think man gave it to you right well that's why he didn't build his church on intellect he built his church on divine revelation he built his church on quickening power are you ready for the next sentence quickening power let us see his coming why what what was he doing when he came he was delivering the abstract you are already resurrected here here it is here take this personally for you it's not a group i'm going to let you see what i did for you i'm returning to you through the opening of the seals the the finishing of the church age the return of the capstone i'm letting you see that you are in christ let's just follow it just a little bit more the quickening power let us see is coming amen so he's just talking he was talking all that the quickening power did how it told people what was wrong with them how it was discerning how it discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart you can read it there so what was that that was all him vindicating watch the method now how he's vindicating he's showing you things he's opening your eyes he he's vindicating it was him because he's going to those that see it and believe it and receive that attribute there's something that's going to be shown to them he says now how did he do it why why could he say destroy this body in three days i'll be raise it up why why why did he say that he knew that it was written of him see that's it it was written of him by the word of god which could not fail isn't this written of you as he is in this world okay this wherein that we know the love of god right how do we know the capstone how do we know the love how do we know that god's love is as he is so are we in this world i should have that place in john memorized but i keep forgetting it it just takes a second to look it up but that's how how do we know we got the capstone because as he is so are we that's the title deed so don't kill yourself because you're not there understand the quickening power is here to bring you there start believing the word of god he said and he says and we go the show he says why he knew what the word said of them and he says let's go to 3 14. why it was prophesied the word of god and prophecy if the true word of god cannot fail and the same prophecy and word of god that said he'd raise him up said that we are already raised with him so what what do you believe children of abraham do you believe the promise so what is imputed to you for righteousness not your beautiful message works but you believe what he promised you abraham believed something that was totally unbelievable now he's asking you to believe something that's totally unbelievable that i'm already risen i'm already raptured i'm already resurrected i'm already there hallelujah oh i think i'm going to get raptured out of here i may not even make it to missouri turn me off i've just started press your star carter get it nice warmed up or cool down for you but i'm telling you it it it's it's a no wonder he said fear not and it's written that the spirit that is now was in him now in us also quickens our mortal body fear not friend the s-o-n is up so now so he's he's going to wipe out this whole word of message of the hour is to wipe out unbelief why couldn't men have faith because they were denominational creeds and you can't have faith without the pure unadulterated word of god because faith's resting place is what the word of god so you've never had a place to rest your your abstract you've never had a land to claim you've never had something that says this is me and tell them hallelujah until the message was revealed no i don't want that delivered by emotion i want to deliver by word revelation that's right so he's trying to get rid of unbelief so listen what he says so what what were they worried about back in the days who died and who was living paul says don't worry right those that have going on aren't going to hinder you and you're not going to hinder them why this is what matter 3 3 15 now look at the transfiguration we was everyone represented there so when he was glorified and the dead were raised with him then we were there then there was the living saints that had raptured there was elijah standing there and there stood moses the dead saints represented also both of them had quickening power whether one died or the other one didn't die they were all there [Music] hey man whether i die it doesn't matter to me because i got it whether i die i'll be there someone says oh if i miss the rapture come on come on breathe oh what there's going to be a lot of us that believe this message that aren't going in the rapture you know why because we do all alternative things instead of coming to church we watch online that's an alternative right instead of giving to the body and be a part of the body we just live our own little life that's an alternative so you know what going through the judgment is it's an alternative you'll still be there you're just going to go a different way because you took a different way you were still elected your name was still on the lamb's book of life but you're just going to go a different way the prophet of god they prophesied him because thou hath chosen the narrow way and the straight way white is the way to destruction and many be there yeah i'm saved my name yep you are you'll get your abstract but you're just gonna have to go an alternative way you're gonna have to be when it's so dark and so miserable and there's so much judgment and so much tribulation you're going to have to get serious with god you know why because you didn't get serious with god now so take the easy way and you'll get your reward the hard way take the hard way you'll get your reward now that's the gospel so sit back in your easy chair and drink your cup of coffee fine you say well there's no room in church for me because you have to have some sort of kind of air condition padded seat comfort i've been on the hillside where they said the sermon of the mount was preached there was no comfortable seating those people were sitting and standing on a rolling hillside their backs hurting their necks hurt and everything but you know some once they got in that quickening power of that anointed work there was no time how much time do you think it took to feed 4 000 people and to collect all those baskets would you have ran off or would you have been in the revival watching every bread come get picked up and all of a sudden have all these baskets left over and just rejoicing and what the miracle is maybe better not maybe it's better that you don't come and keep all our faith down because i want to see the signs of wonder i want to see what's promised to me shall we go a little further are you ready to quit again please uh feel free he said he said we are both represented there he says notice oh look what we are now seeing in these last days the same thing that he promised in john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also that's remember we just preached this sunday that's what the abstract does the abstract makes you him it gives you permission to do what he did that's what we're seeing we're seeing the permission to be the sons and daughters of god what does the scripture say god so loved the world he gave them power to become the sons and daughters of god so if if the love of god is the capstone and so if the love of god returns which is why he sent jesus to bear our sins if the love of god says then the power to be sons and daughters of god has to return the very foundation of every church is that he gives them power to become the sons and daughters of god so they throw that off an eternity somewhere so they can live like the world act like the world talk like the world but to confess that jesus christ has not come in the flesh is an anti-christ spirit what is now if the scripture said that he gave his son so we could become the sons and daughters of god if we deny to become the sons and daughters of god then we're denying that he came because we're saying he didn't accomplish but remember we read it that he proved that we were there by raising up lord he says so 317 we're just like them out mount transfiguration that's right wait a minute have you put yourself there that's what satan's been trying to keep us from doing is claiming who we are no wonder the prophet of god said we've used this quote for so long in this message totally clueless when the church recognizes who she is she'll become an invincible army yeah let's run around in circles what it's when we realize hey i was at mount saint figuration when we realized i've got the abstract i've got the permission then i'll be coming in okay but if you're going to be the sons of cephas and you're going to go and say in the name of jesus the devil is going to look at you and say jesus i know and paul i know but where's your abstract in this day you would be able to say i've got the capstone i've received it by the pillar of fire malachi 4 5. i've seen in the revelation of the seven seals don't try to use just the baptism of the holy ghost as your identification because that fell on the just and the unjust and the anointed ones at the end time this is an elect lady that is receiving her abstract because her abstract is her participation in the rapture am i okay no i'm not i'm crazy look at certainly he says we were just like them at mount transfiguration now listen to this this is important certainly we do not claim power but we like they was on mount transfiguration they wasn't saying moses said see who see who i am this disciple said see who i am see who i am you know what happened notice they seen jesus glorified don't miss this because this is the method this is a vindicated method this is how god does he doesn't lift you up he humbles you listen now he said he said they wasn't saying most say see who see who i am the disciples didn't say see who i am see who i am you know what happened notice they've seen jesus glorified that's all they wanted to see represented jesus glorified that's all they wanted to see was jesus glorified and that's all they wanted to represent was jesus glorified they didn't want to represent themselves they didn't want everybody to look around i'm a preacher i've got a message see how good i preach see how important i am see what i know see how smart i am i've been there and you know something once i knew i had it for myself it didn't matter anymore don't matter to me how long you think i preach it don't matter if you think you're in church ages it don't matter no more there's only one thing that's important and is that's him glorified that was him glorified that was him glorified that was him glorified if they don't like it i don't care i only want to preach to the bride anyway they're the only ones going to pray for me anyway right yes sir it's him it's him him glorified right so he says and so it is today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life isn't nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified praise the lord wouldn't that change the whole way you worship the church wouldn't that change the whole way you sang wouldn't that change how you came in the church i'm not coming here i'm not coming here for someone to see my new hat my new suit i'm not coming here to let everybody know how down i am and how blue i am and how rough life is woes me woes me i oh no i come in the door to leave praises i come in the door to glorify his name i come here to sing of his wonders [Applause] that's what i'm come for i don't have to worry about my salvation when i walk in the door i come to glorify god so those who aren't saved will get saved so those who don't have the spirit will get the spirit those who haven't realized the abstract will realize the abstract i'm here to glorify him and whatever he wants to do he says so is it today not trying to be a big person we don't care what people say arm names nothing it's his name our life is nothing it's his life his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified and how can it be when his glory when he's glorified in us by his resurrection in us we see him represented again as he was today as he was so are we we see him glorified as he was in us if not then we just picked up a message religion spirit it's not glorifying him it's glorifying our interpretation of the message it's glorifying our form of church order it's glorifying our doctrines it isn't it's glorifying because he's the same yesterday today and forever tell me all those things that brother brahm said aren't taking on new meaning it's becoming a new book that's part of us going back being restored back is back to glorifying him we've been a lot of time glorifying ourselves i'm the bride i'm the bride i'm the bride i'm the bride look at me i'm the bride i'm the bride and people look back and says well i don't know who you married but if they're making you like this i don't want no part of it remember my mom tells a story about the little washer girl the closer he got the unmerley she felt she was pulling down her dress and putting down the dish pan and the more he talked to her the more he well i'm just a i'm just a little servant you know amen but he made her a promise you're my wife my word is as good as gold and i'm gonna come back and pick you up and she made herself ready the foreman had an eye on her the foreman in this day says will they believe my word will they believe my word will they have toured us in his word given us something greater to believe as our faith grew now he's got us to the time to come to john 14 12 the works that i do you should do also or just about the clothes i could feel his spirit settling in he said when he's glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that yes see our desire is not to glorify our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make some more in sunday school or try to bring in hog tie push in offer a picnic party or bring stars and buttons or something else like that no that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us so your words your testimony what you talk about what you share you're sharing he lives he's here amen he can do the same works in me that he did you need prayer let me pray for you he's alive he's the same that's your testimony you don't hide your life under the testimony of william branham and all that he did so you don't have to be a christian you know i know somebody just said oh he said something bad about william brown no i didn't william branham was the representation of christ in flesh in our day the first fruit waved over to show us that we also could come to that maturity so people tried to be i'm getting to my point just started to preach i pray that god gives you strength in the morning and that your kids are good in school and if you homeschool let them sleep in but this great beautiful representation that we're we're not we're not always trying to build people's faith based on what happened in the past but you've got the proof that the same works that he did you shall do also go into all the world the works that i do shall you do also you'll lay hands on the sick and then recover never was an idea of getting a group of men stick an rev in front of their name which i think stands for recreational vehicle and everybody sit back how dangerous let's just read it it's beautiful if i can't get if if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham's not even thought of and you're not even thought of till we see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that's quickening gives us the quickening power it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated method proving in us that he's now risen from the dead the same method that vindicated him the same method that vindicated the prophet now i'm not talking about changing doctrine if any man come unto you and preach any other gospel then i preached count them a curse i'm talking about abstract evidence quickening power do you believe it or do you look backwards and look at all your faults and everything and say it it didn't come by circumcised it came by promise and when you believe it then circumcision is given to you as a token that you believe it so you believe the word he'll start circumcising all the world out of your life we just got just another couple paragraph the vindicated method being humble i do nothing lest the father shows me turning the other cheek no glory that my works might glorify the father which is in heaven i do nothing of myself meek humble little the love of god shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit i'm telling you this attitude that we've got that we're just going to crush the world because we've got this great message no you better get ready for calvary you bet ready get for persecution that's right that's right you just need to everything's to glorify him his method no wonder he said fear not now listen this is what i want to preach tonight no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him notice we have his spirit in us the abstract deed feel fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it [Music] how many times have i said that and heard people say oh i just hope i make it i just hope i make it i just hope i make it don't you believe you were in him that's what he's asking you to believe he asked those disciples to believe he was the son of god and they believed it look at the thing that they were asked to believe now he's asking you to believe that you were in him when he rose and then he came to show you the quickening power by opening the seals by using the same vindicated methods that jesus used to lay everything out there just because period not for you to sit back and believe what he did but to believe what you are in him amen you know just this is the vindicated method you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i've all ready made it i never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother branham they say i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want i care about i just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down church i'll just be honest with you for years it ate my heart out we'd have prayer lines and somebody would come up in the prayer line and we'd pray for him and and we'd say according to thy faith in other words you go you go get the faith if thou believe and i thought we should be able to do more than that so what were we doing we were calling him down calling him down if we keep calling him down then we're denying that he's living here we're denying he's here in our presence and this is not condemnation this is a challenge of god's word to step up into your rightful position as a christian he paid for you to be there and he gives you permission to be there and he rose from the dead to prove to you you can be there not calling them down silver and gold have i none amen but that which i have i give you where was the word of god manifested was it manifested in them or was it manifested in the crippled man because the crippled man got out and what did he do he danced and he what praised god amen no look at us no glory i can pray for you not because i'm a minister not because i'm anointed i can pray for you because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i can lay my hands on you because he asked me to you are going to show that he's doing the same works he is doing the same works through me you are the manifestation that he's the same yesterday and forever when you get rid of that devil when you get rid of that sickness it's none of us doing it it's him doing it how can you do that how can you claim that because he told me go into all the world and laid my hands on the set but if your motive is to glorify him and you know that you're risen in him you're not calling them down he's here do you remember all the works that brother branham did he wasn't calling god down he said he's here i take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of jesus christ he never claimed it he said what is what whatever he said whatever he showed me now we don't have that gift because that gift was the method of vindication now that's what he said that we would possess the method of vindication that the same works he did will do also and that was put on display it is not taking away from the divine office of the prophet it is not taking away from the jesus christ being revealed in him the deity in the flesh it is not taking away from the coming of the lord and the opening of the seals it's vindicating it do i just want to see him manifested how can i do it call him down no he is in you see he is in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest myself how can you do it because you ordained it so all that the father hath given me will come notice glory and we're just going to read just a few more things what with all the evidence collected with us now this morning oh i think of that song oh that resurrection morning when death cords will be broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then life after death we are now alive who are once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broke death from around me i am alive the easter seal the beginning broke that seal of the roman seal the easter seal that broke the seal and revealed the secret now god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him let's just read that real close again now god by his holy spirit has broken the seals that's right the seal from around our lives he's trying to break the seal from around our lives that's been keeping and we've been keeping us from walking in and accepting the permission that he's given just think of all the doubts that are surrounding all the all the mental battle you're going through just trying to realize what it is he's trying to place in your life all the sin and things that you do and the way that satan attacks you and holds you he's trying to break that away he wants you to believe because if you believe that faith will come and drive those spirits away from you because he cleanses god works from the inside out and you're trying to work from the outside in amen now god by his holy spirit has broken the seal from around our lives right the roman seal the grave that kept him in he's trying to break the grave of that we live in to break that seal away so we can resurrect as sons and daughters of god taking our position and doing the works that are commissioned how do we do those works he he said he uses a word here i just think is is so beautiful let me see if i can find it because you are art he says not of myself meant this because you are because you ordained it so because you ordained it so well what are you to ordain what's going to drive that motivation what's going to drive the that brings the the the christ and the abstract that you are and the permission and the power that you have you know what's going to drive that love because love and faith work what hand in hand not love and religion not love and doctrine but real genuine love to glorify the lord you know i i don't want to preach a condemnation message i don't want to browbeat you till you all realize you're a bunch of sinners and you come to the altar and then we think we had a meeting that doesn't do anybody any good it's when you can sit there knowing you're sitting in a trash can knowing you're watching tv knowing you're doing this knowing you're doing that and then you can say wait a minute i can step out of this pig pan i don't have to eat this pig food i've come to my senses i'm going to go back to my father's house he knew his father had it he could testify to it he rejoiced in it he shouted in it he ran in but he never got out of the pigpen but one day he had enough of it don't do no good to come and boohoo about it don't do no good to call them down call them down you know what got him the victory that's my father and in his house and i'll go there even if i have to be a nobody oh i i i hope you feel the presence the way i feel it what a glorious love affair all he's trying to get us to do is break the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him and he just goes on he says page after page after page and and uh and what a what a glorious thing it is and he says just wait the sun comes up and we'll see where we're at he is the word wait till you see the word manifested shining across the seed the wave sheath we'll see where we're at paragraph 3 31 just wait the sun comes up and we'll see where we're at he is the word wait till you see the word manifested shining across the seed the wave chief you'll see where we're at do you love them what do you think is happening we're seeing where we're at we're really seeing who we are we used to say oh i know i'm something not this so we knew who we were but now we're coming to see what we are we're him back on earth or here on earth doing the same thing he did that he might be glorified and that when we leave this world jesus christ will be glorified right in the presence of all those who despise him amen don't you want to be a part of that then i lord richly bless you we just have billy lead us in a song of worship i i hope that this message that we've listened to is their inspiration and and i'm not talking about we i know there's people that are listening at work and they're listening at home i'm not talking about people that have reasons or are gone i'm talking about people that could be here and they don't want to make the sacrifice you understand they're not lost you know what i mean but i i i i'd sure like to bring more than 20 percent or 40 percent i would like to do all that i can for a message that's trying to let me know that i hope i don't make it i hope i'll be there and actually be able to say i've already made it it's done it's over father it is finished praise the lord god bless you brother amen praise the lord amen is in the word wonderful amen let's all stand tonight kia offer man amen oh there's a calm that god [Music]
