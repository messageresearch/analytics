you merry christmas that's over to mike and sister ellen they're visiting we're certainly happy to have them with us and all the others amen god bless you this morning as you invite but in my junior for a psalm reading amen the joys of a small sound booth is shuffling the deck so people can get out good morning you know the thing about this time of year the christmas holidays is it's a time where you know people often will put together a list of things that you know maybe they would hope to receive of their friends or their family or maybe their friends or family are asking for one or you know maybe there's children out there that are putting lists together hoping that they might receive something you know as we turn to psalm 80 this morning verse 1. you know just kind of struck me as i was reading this kind of the first verse there says give ear o shepherd of israel thou that lead us joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth between the cherubims shine forth you know as we read the rest of the psalm which we will this morning you see very quickly that virtually the entire chapter is the prayer of one crying out to this shepherd with a list of all the things that they have need of in verse 3 it says turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved oh lord how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people in verse seven it says turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved he goes on in verse 8 to describe this people as a a vine which was once great cast a shadow and was cast down and consumed and burned you know it really is a confession kind of a sad testimony of how a people that was once great now found themselves in desperate need of their shepherd but you know verse this the chapter ends in verse 17 with an interesting statement it says let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself the man of thy right hand you know and it occurred to me as i was reading through this psalm that if there was ever a christmas list in the scripture this was it this is our list it's uh you know this is uh every year christmas if we think about it what we are celebrating is recognizing how the man at thy right hand brought have brought us everything everything that was accomplished as a result of the appearing of the man at thy right hand and you know what's interesting is every single one of the items on this christmas list was answered by the man at thy right hand you know where it says in verse 1 to give ear o shepherd of israel the man of thy right hand came and declared i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep for his cry of turn us again he said for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come in the condemnation but his past from death and to life for his cry for his christmas list to cause thy face to shine the man at thy right hand came and declared he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father for the broken down vine the man at thy right hand came and declared i am the vine and my father is the husbandman abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit that without me you can do nothing you could take this psalm and you could put it right at the beginning of the new testament almost like the prelude of every gift that was about to come you know and as we think about this season you know hopefully as we read this psalm remember that we are recipients of the answer of everything that's on this christmas list that for us christmas is more than about luke 2 but it's just as much about ephesians 2 and colossians 3 in romans 5 and 6 and basically everything that follows from the very first of matthew 1. so as we kind of read psalm 80 this morning let's let's rejoice that we have seen the man at thy right hand who has come and delivered everything on this christmas list you know maybe as some celebrate the end of a difficult year maybe we celebrate the receiving of all things let's read psalm 80 together it says this give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadeth joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth between the cherubs shine forth before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved oh lord god of hosts how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou feedeth them with the bread of tears and give us them tears to drink in great measure thou makest us a stripe unto our neighbors and our enemies laugh among themselves turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparest room before it and its cast caused to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the vows thereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her vows unto the sea and her branches unto the river why has thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which passed by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood thoth wasted and the wild beast of the field that devoured return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou made it strong for thyself it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou made us strong for thyself so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved amen amen god bless you may have your seats amen amen we're going to be singing some christmas carols man i mean i learned that christmas is the day after thanksgiving man i know we don't want to get caught up in the season but i mean this is a reminder that there was one that came and died for us even as we just read it man i mean let's sing it came upon the midnight clear we're gonna read uh sing a couple of songs and just demand just a reminder of what our savior done for us [Music] amen [Music] oh near the earth to touch [Music] with peaceful wings [Music] [Music] [Music] whose foams are bending [Music] [Music] look [Music] [Music] my prophets [Music] [Music] and then [Music] is to the world the lord [Music] oh [Music] is papers [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] says [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] crown is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] amen that's our desire that it may continue to shine shine in us that we may bring light amen remember mock derby that's a special if it could come at this time god bless you church oh we have brothers sisters our parents and the lord that have been serving god for you know years before we were born and often times you hear them say i wish i'd been serving him even you know before you know now like longer and sometimes you know i'll sit down feel a little jealous you know and i'll say oh uh but the aspiration is i also want to get there i want to serve lord for this you know for this long time never look back and so you know i was thinking about it i was driving to work and i was thinking i said what's the real cost like economist would say what's the real cost of serving god so the real cost would have been you know death it would have been you know if you don't serve god then you you reap you know the wickedness of the world and i just you know it was it just done to me and said it pays to serve jesus that's the song that came to my head and so i'll be singing the pace to serve jesus i might have a different maybe a different tone to it but it's sir like they say it pays to serve jesus i speak from my heart he'll always be with us if we do our part there's nothing this wide world can pleasure our fault there's peace and contentment in serving their lord i love him far better than in days of yore i'll serve him more truly there never before i'll do as he beats me whatever the i'll be a true soldier i'll die at my pose and hopped when i'm tempted to return from the track i think of my savior my mind wanders back to the place where they nailed him on calvary's tree i hear a voice saying i suffered for deep i love him for better than in days of year i'll serve him more truly and never [Music] [Music] a place i remember where i was set free towards where from partner heaven to me dear jesus spoke sweetly to my weary soul my sins were forgiven he made my heart [Music] i love him far better than in days of year i'll serve me more truly than ever before how do i see beats me whatever the cause our reach

pray that god it'll be a blessing for you this morning amen i heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play and loud and sweet their songs repeat [Music] and the bells are ringing like a choir they're singing in my heart i hear them [Music] peace on [Music] and in despair i bowed my head there is no peace on earth i said for hate is strong and marks the song peace on earth good

[Music] [Applause] and thank you very much my whole life's always been i just wanted to share the lord with other people because you know you've heard my testimony but you don't know how dark of a person i was i was really dark and and he just came by one day and it got me and i just don't know how to express that i always loved that song but what really shakes me this morning is how i'm supposed to be a pastor and how you could pull that off without me knowing it that makes me wonder how much is going on i don't i don't know about so i'll try to compose myself this morning i think we're going to have singing this evening i think i hope brother ben and you're you'll be here tonight i surely wanted to have you sing for us so god richly bless you um you know i i appreciated the songs that they sang you know some people call them christmas carols but you know really christmas is really about the lord that's that's what it's supposed to to be and it it's supposed to be uh about him but the world's always trying to substitute you know i was fellowshipping with brother cosman the other day and we were talking about just look at how satan has come in and substituted santa claus for the lord you know you better watch out you better not cry you better not pout i'm telling you why santa claus is coming not jesus is coming but santa claus is coming and then he knows when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake he knows if you've been good or bad you know not the lord knows not he's got his spirits going to and fro he's making a list he's checking it twice santa claus is doing it not the lord going to and fro and marking the sign and kind of the abominations it's it it's sad to see the lord leave uh the lives of mankind and try to go through this world without the lord jesus i i just don't know how somebody does it you know i stumble and fall a lot as it is but i've never seen his hand not extended to me even in the hardest times of my life he's always had his hand out for me and he made a promise i'll never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even until the end and and so uh we we just like to uh it's nice to have mike and ellen with us did they have you stand up you got to stand up [Applause] yes now these these are old friends of mine and and that's in the trueness of the word uh so but it's nice to have them i i know there's others here and we're grateful to have uh you uh this morning i gotta try to find my composure here this morning to start but uh we we talked wednesday night and we read a scripture so let's go stand this morning and turn on our bibles to i believe it's john the gospel of saint john john 3 16 and we'll read this scripture this morning and and am it says for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life father bless us this morning please be our portion today walk in our midst do for us exceedingly and abundantly about what he can even think or ask we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated uh last wednesday night we uh ministered a little bit about the gift of god and we saw in the scriptures that as we read that the first christmas gift we called our sermon the first christmas gift and we went to the book of hebrews the first and second chapter of the book of hebrews to describe the first christmas gift the first christmas gift that was ever given and and when we began to describe it it seemed to be such a wonderful description and we saw in hebrews that said talking of this gift this gift that the lord gave us and it you know when someone gives you a gift you've got to take possession of that gift it's it's yours it's yours and god gave his son to us he so loved us he gave us his son so he gave us this gift it was a gift and it was a gift to you it wasn't a gift about something to look at it was a personal gift from the father in heaven to you personally he gave you his son and when he gave you his son he didn't give you part of his son he didn't give you a just a story book about his son you know most people have just received a storybook about the lord you know like you give a book and but he gave himself he gave his only begotten son and he didn't give part of them he gave all of them he gave everything that he was he gave to you everything every part of what he possessed was in that gift it was a full gift and that's what a gift was and that gift uh had eternal life and so as we thought about that gift we went to hebrews the first and second chapter so that we could really see what this gift was because it's terrible to get a gift and you don't know what it does and i used the example of i i bought leslie a car for her birthday we needed a car and so i believe in killing two birds with one stone so i went out and bought her a car for her uh her birthday and you know we had the car it's a 215 model i believe or 16 something like that and so we had it for a couple years and i thought i i'm gonna get her remote start on her car so that she can press a button and the car will start up and it can warm up for so when i have to get in with her the car will be worn and so you know how you buy people a gift for yourself so you know i i i mentioned to ernest and aaron i want to because he's got a car similar i said i want to put remote start on your mom's car and he looked at us like we were crazy and i said yeah you know why don't you think that's a good idea says dad it's already got it and it went and pressed the button and pressed the button and the car started two years i didn't know what was all in the gift and i think that's a lot of what happens with us we don't know all that's in the gift of god we don't all know we haven't encompassed uh and and taken the time to go it i think it's a thing of of human nature you know that you never you never read the instructions you know you just go try to put it together yourself you know and maybe it doesn't come together just right and that but you learned to live with it but if you'd sit down and you'd read all about it and find out what it does you know and i got a confection of and i still don't know how that works because i haven't taken the time to really find out all that was in the gift so we just went through the first couple chapters of hebrew said and and describing this gift that god gave us and you know in one of the verses in hebrews the first chapter and the third verse it says that this gift was the brightness of his glory now think of that god gave you this gift and what he gave you was the brightness of his glory that's his gift to you the brightness of his glory just think how much he must have loved you to give your son the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person so if god is giving you his son he gave you himself because we realized when god created the heavens and earth that he didn't create them by using other things he created them by using himself they they were him he took out of himself and took out of what that he was his his nature his thoughts his attributes his person no wonder the invisible things of god can be clearly seen in the visible things around us so he he went and gave us himself and so now we find out in him giving us his son jesus he gave us the expressed image of his person in other words he gave us his personality how many people do you go through life knowing but you don't really know and then you get an opportunity to sit down and and and just have them open their heart to you and open their feelings and and the burdens that they carry and what they've went through in life okay and and you look upon them and your whole your whole attitude towards them changes you know you begin to find out you know why this person was was abused as a child and and you know and and they never had anything and uh uh you know finally uh the lord come on their life and they've always had these struggles and you know you're sitting there after a while in your hearts just going out to him because you you now you really see him you know them as a person and you can't know jesus as an object you've got to know him as a person you can't know him as a historical figure you know i heard george washington cross the delaware but i don't know george washington you know i heard abraham lincoln preached a great thing the emancipation proclamation but i don't know abraham lincoln you know but i would hate to say that jesus spoke to beatitudes and and spoke these things and say but i don't know jesus wouldn't that be a sad thing but but to know him is life and life everlasting to know the person that can and that's what the gift of god was was god gave mankind his personality no no don't look it as a separate gift in other words he gave god god gave us his personality that we could have that personality so we looked at it and we went through it and it was the brightness of his coming the expressed image of his person and and be uphold and upholding all things by the word of his power what he gave us is upholding in other words everything's here in its place because of the power of his word when he withdraws his word things is going to be very bad the stars will come crashing down i'll tell you what'll happen when he withdraws his word from this land they'll it'll turn into a new heavens and a new earth okay and and it says uh in upholdeth all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins he did it all by himself no help nobody else nothing he alone purged our sins and sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high this is what he gave you he gave you the one that's sitting on the throne of the majesty of high he's yours you have him you ever hear the expression it's not what you know but it's who you know well just think who it is that you have as a friend as a savior so we're just talking about this great gift and then we we read on and and how that he he wasn't uh just an angel some supernatural uh angelic uh being that that uh isn't uh uh couldn't be touched by our affirmatives but that he was he was a made a king of kings and lord of lords and he had the sepulchre in his hand so he was telling me he says that this isn't an angel this is the son of god he didn't give you an angel to something that wasn't important to him something that he just didn't love you know just like we said it's like if you have a great event at and you and invite somebody up let's say it's a some great crowning of a king or some great uh formal event you know you want the top person there you know like if the president goes to an event then that's a great event but if the president doesn't think that event's so great he sends the vice president and then if it's really kind of down on the ladder he sends the ambassador you know i mean but this gift wasn't even an angel it was above an angel this was the son of god this was the person of god this was god that the one that had the sepulcher in his hand and sat on the right hand of the throne of god who had power and authority and dominion and all things were subject to him and that's who he sent and and he said he was in the ninth verse he says and thou hath love righteousness and hateth iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with oil of gladness and uh of fellows and it says and thou lord in the beginning hath laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands think about this gift that god gave you it is not a shabby gift in other words he gave you the lord of glory the one who has judgment in his hand the sepulcher of righteousness that's who he was and then he makes this beautiful statement he says he says and doubt o lord in the beginning layeth the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands now listen to this gift you've got and they shall perish but that remaineth they shall wax old as death of garment and as a vestiger shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail you got a gift that's not going to get old it's not going to run out it's not going to go out of style you know it's it's the real thing and and so we just went down and and then we we went over and talked about this great gift of god being uh uh of what he said in in the third verse of the second chapter he says how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them so he he's saying what did he speak of he spoke of another kingdom he spoke of another life and of eternal life and he said i'm the gift of god i'm what's going to come in and and you're going to receive me and now this gift this if that same spirit that was in christ jesus dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body so you possess now a gift of eternal life you possess what will take you out of the grave you possess what will transform your body it's not something you know about this isn't a gift coupon that you can lose this is the real thing this is something you possess today it's been given to you okay and if you say well burma gary i don't know if i have that gift it's here for you to get it's here to receive let me tell you there's nothing anywhere that compares to the lord jesus his magnificent can his love and his ability is beyond the comprehension of men he's so he's he you can't even describe them and you have this gift this morning i'm not putting you in question i'm saying god's given you this gift but maybe you've never opened it or maybe you've never seen all that's in there for you and all that it can do for you you might be up against the wall with finance you might be up against the wall with health you might be up against the wall with anything but in this gift it possesses all that you have need of and like you said he says in the fifth verse it says and unto the angels hath he not put them subject but the the world to come of the world to come therefore we speak and so he he he's the one that told us about a world to come he plays the one that told us in my father's house are many mansions and i would not tell you if it wasn't so and i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also this is the gift that god gave us as we're just moving along just going over wednesday tonight's service it and then he says but you know he was made a little lower than the angels seventh verse thou crownest him with glory and honor and didn't set him over the works of thy hands now listen to this this is the gift you have now if you could ever understand it as your possession we always preach it all the time that we're his possession and we are his possession because he bought us with the price but in buying us with a price listen to what that he did he says thou hath put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him so you have somebody who is in charge of everything and listen to this but now we see not yet all things put under him we don't we haven't even seen all the things that are under his foot look at the things we're seeing in our age i don't care what they come up with he's king of kings he's lord of lords he's a lord of glory all things are in his hands and we're in his hands and nothing can pluck us out nothing can pluck us out you talk about a gift what a wonderful gift and so we see that he's that this gift it wasn't an angel it was the one who was in control of everything in charge of everything he had the sepulcher of righteousness sat on the right hand of god but he came lower than the angels this is how important he made this gift personal to you in the ninth verse but we see jesus who has made little lower the angels for the suffering of death and crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things all things are of him and who by all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering oh my he suffered and and let's we'll just finish on this part and it says he says for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren now we see this gift how it condenscended what it really was but it came down to suffer to take on death for us all so he took death so because he took death we don't have to take death you say oh you mean die let me tell you something watching this body pass away is nothing if we really could understand where that person is in glory and he makes that beautiful statement and and so we we saw that uh he he became he became uh lower than the angels in fact he became one of us so we could we could see the greatness of this gift and then in the 14th verse he says for so much as then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that hath the power of death that is the devil just think that's your gift we got to get rid of religion people we we've got to get and i'm going to go into that a little bit but we've got to get rid of religion we've got to get rid of worshipping him in ceremonies and and and worship him with creeds and and dogmas and intellectual thinking and and and creating concepts in our mind of what he is and what he isn't and what's transpiring and what's not transpiring and what's truth and what's not truth let me tell you something you can know jesus christ as a person and he's unchanging he doesn't change he's the same yesterday today and forever you can fold up the the worlds like a garment okay you can that gets old you can put it away but he does not change when you know him you know life and you know life more abundantly and when we can start living with him and by him you know when you've got him in your heart and you know that you possess him you don't care what someone believes you don't care what they criticize you don't care if they don't see it the way that you see it because you're not in control and your mind's not in control and your emotions aren't in control you've given up that control tower to the king of kings and the lord of lords you're in fellowship with him and paul said you don't know me by enticing words you know me by the power and the demonstration of jesus christ the same yesterday and forever and they'll know that you are my disciples by the love that you have one for another that's why a root of bitterness defiles many how can you have the gift of eternal life and know your internally secure and no nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand to know that he broods over you and he watches over you and he won't leave you nor forsake you and then you be worried what someone's going to do to you for what ten years two years three years four years how does that compare to eternal life you know if you've got the holy spirit you've got the love of god shed abroad in your heart that's what you have that's what he was said if i know all the mysteries and i speak with the tongues of men and angels and i understand all these great things and i don't have that love that he is it profiteth me nothing you know you just got a great big intellectual head scratch but i'll tell you if you've been purchased out of that dark place and you know that he's loved you and you can look down through the time of all the times he's kept you and all the things that he's done for you and you open up your history book like that king went and one night he couldn't sleep so he got out the chronicles and he he began to read and he saw where this uh person his name slips me but where he done a certain great thing and he said go get this guy go reward this guy god's not slack he doesn't forget your labor of love oh my i just think of this but i'm thinking it today as a gift and we're just going to close right here not close the service but just and he says that and and listen to this 15th verse and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage all their life have you ever met somebody's afraid to die it's a sad thing they struggle but he's got rid of that oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory i have a crown waiting for me in glory i've run a good race i've ran a good fight i'm on my way to pick up my crown don't don't cry for me i've got the gift you've been given the gift i just say this morning i think maybe we need just to sit down somewhere and open it up and see all that it has all the joy it has all the peace it has a joy that that is unspeakable and full of glory a peace that surpasses understanding something that you know okay it may all fall apart yeah and then we closed we were just talking about this gift and so we came down and it said he said this and we'll read the 17th and 18th verse it says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like an un to his brethren see he wasn't made uh something else he was made after the seed of abraham he says to be made like and unto his brethren that he might be merciful and faithful high priest in all things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that in other words for in that in the the fact that he became one of us the fact that he became one as in that in that he became one of us and he himself had suffered being tempted so he wasn't tempted in every way that we were tempted so this gift knows you and he became in such a way that you could know him so he's not something that you can't know he's not something you can't experience he's not somebody who doesn't understand because he's an angel no it behooved them to become a brethren and to suffer and to be tempted so that we could know that this gift as great and as powerful as it was if he came to a place that he could fellowship with him and he says this he says contempted so because he was made a brethren and made flesh like us and because he was tempted and like us he is able to secure them that are tempted you said what does that mean it means he is able to assist and support in times of hardship and distress he is able amen to do that that's the gift that we have now i'd like to call this morning service if i could and we know that in romans 6 and 33 the scripture says the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus this is what you have amen okay in in ephesians 2 8-9 and it says it says by for by grace ye are saved through faith not of yourselves but is a gift of god amen of god not of works lest any man should boast so we understand what this gift is and and so we we see this great gift of god and now i want to talk this morning about the first re-gifters the first re-gifters we pulled out something the other day at the house and somebody had given it to me and and i i i looked at it and i i said well i think i maybe we just ought to give that to such and such i was going to regift it of course then leslie looked at me he says are you sure that's not the person that gave it to you and i thought you know i'm not sure but i want to talk about the first re-gifters another word someone that received the gift and then regifted it they gave what they got and they regifted it as somebody else you know we we see probably one of the first re-gifters in the in this bible was in saint john the fourth chapter in in the gospel of saint john in the fourth chapter and i just as we bring this uh in the 10th verse and listen to what jesus tells the story of the woman at the well he says jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink that would have asked of him and he would give the living water now when we follow the story down right and she finally uh uh recognized uh all that had taken place and and and and everything we see that this woman was so moved upon that what she received she ran into the city and said come see a man who telleth me all things is this not the messiah amen she began to re-gift and if we go to the book of on the book of acts and we'll just talk about some of these things a little bit is that we know on the day of pentecost these these men came out and they were moved on the spirit they had received what god had promised them they had the gift of god go there and tarry to the gift of the holy ghost till you receive the gift of the spirit of god the gift of the holy ghost go way back till you get what i've been talking to you about and when they came out and the people said they're drunk he says no this is what was promised this was a gift of god he said he would pour out his spirit and they began to regift it they were trying to give to them what they possessed and it it it it's beautiful when you realize and they begin to understand that it was given to them so they could re-gift when he sent them out in matthew and matthew 10 and 8 he said go and do all these works pray for the sick cleanse the leopards raise the dead he said freely it was given freely give now i don't i it's important that you don't put yourself in the eyes of condemnation because you have a gift that fixes condemnation if your heart condemns you he is greater than your heart because when you start talking about signs and wonders people always think that they should they should uh be doing some kinds of works you don't do the works because you're trying to prove anything if you've got the gift you've got the gift you know someone gives you something you know you've got it the people can talk until they're blue in the face and say you don't got it you know i remember i bought something i thought i bought the last one and someone else says no i bought the last one i thought how many people bought the last one you know but i knew i had it what i had it didn't matter whether it was first last or what i knew what i got i knew it was mine it was my possession and so we we turn it over and this is such a beautiful little place here in the scriptures and peter and them are going up to the temple and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who's seen peter and john about to go into the temple and ask in all and peter fastened his eyes upon him with john and said look on us so he was looking to receive something so now peter's there and he says and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them now here he is the guy wants an arm but peter's got something they had something and they knew it was different from what others had they saw the need for the gift so can they look at this man and they know that they have something that he doesn't have they've got the gift they've got the gift of eternal life they've got the gift of the majesty they got the gift of the one that has all things subject to him that's the gift that's what they possess they just were in the upper room and they received that gift they were filled with that gift they knew they had that gift this guy's asking for an home but look at what they say just receive them and peter said i'm in silver and gold have i none but such as i have i re-gift it to thee in the name of jesus of nazareth rise up and walk do you understand he possessed it so he was the first re-gifter this is what i've got i'm going to give it to begin to see that they became the first re-gifters giving what they received they knew what they had and they knew what the person didn't have so just think of that as we just look at a couple more characters here and so we know the story it's a great story and so the people came up and all the people marveled this thing was great this guy was there every day and these two guys come up and this guy says he said i don't got silver and gold but i have something and i'm commissioned to re-gift it now understand that this morning you're commissioned if it was freely given freely give us this this gift didn't have anything to do with selfishness because it was the personality of god that you receive let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let every man look upon the needs of others other than himself so when he saw this and he saw this need and he knew that he possessed something that this other guy didn't possess he wanted to re-gift what he had to him they were re-gifters that's one thing a christian is he's a re-gifter it's been freely given to freely give okay and so all the people begin to wonder and then peter says and when peter saw it he answered unto the people's 12th verse ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man one though we didn't do this ourselves we regifted something that we got from the father [Applause] was in my glory and it goes on and he starts to explain and we we if we just read down it it says you know god the father of abraham and isaac and jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go now he's putting it back on him a little bit this is who did this the guy you rejected but i just watched this and it goes down we won't read it but if if you would just read down he talks about how they killed him and and how he made his name and he comes down it's in the 18th verse he says but those things which god beforehand showed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled and i like with peter he talks to him and he says i know you guys did these things ignorantly he says but so listen when he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and and when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you look what they're doing they're re-gifting when they see that somebody didn't have something and they knew they had it they gifted it you know another great a great place in the scriptures is in the fourth chapter so what happens is they start preaching this and and the scribes and the pharisees they get all upset so they go grab them and they throw them in jail right and so they're they they're locked up in in jail and you we know the story uh that uh what's going to take place and so over here in the 13th first after they explained these great things they said and now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled that they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus i'm telling you it's everything to have been with jesus just be with him invite him you've got to invite him into your life okay it doesn't matter that you know about him everybody knows about him because he's standing at the door and knocking but if you open the door and invite him in he will come in and sup with you another kill starts bestowing upon you gifts he'll start giving you what you have lack of and what you have need of for the father knoweth what you have need of even before you ask okay just being in this presence and they marveled that they had been with jesus because being with jesus they got something and then they go down here and they tell them okay it's a notable miracle so we just ask you guys that you just go out of here and with much threatening they threatened them but i'll tell you something these guys were re-gifters they were determined to give to others what they had received because the gift had the heart of the giver it wasn't a carnal gift it was a gift of life so they had the spirit of the gift that's what the gift of god is it's the gift of life it's the gift of himself the one that sat on the throne the one with majesty the one that was called brethren the one that all things were subject to him that's the gift they had that's what they were given they're not given theology they're not given doctrines they're not given bible teachings they're giving a person they're given something they've got something they experienced something they know is real and so they they say to them and peter says in the 19th verse and peter and john answered and said to them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god ye judge what would you do if you had the gift that i had what would you do to you judge would you re-gift this if you knew that you had what this crippled man had need of and you knew the gift that you had the gift that you possessed that if you regifted that to that man he would walk but i wonder if more people aren't concerned what people what peter said here then peter said unto him whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you come on our people hearken more into the opinion of the world hearken more unto this hearken more unto that are embarrassed because they can't put everything together i'll tell you never embarrassed paul said i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it's the power of god unto salvation how can you yes sir watch pbs that are ready to go over a cliff can't just let them go over a cliff how could you see someone that's sick and dying and not tell them there's a fountain of hope in life the evidence of not having the gift is not having anything to re-gift but if you've got it that's right the very fact that you possess the gift the gift itself is calling to be regifted it's crying re-gift me re-gift me re-gift me give me to others go into all the world and preach the gospel share me share me with others re-gift me these were the first three gifters they were re-gifters okay it's it it's beautiful in this scriptures and in another place they were they were thrown in prison in the fifth chapter and and they laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the common prison so these guys are out get re-gifting and every time they re-gift they get thrown in the clink does that stop them no because here's what drives them they know they have something that they don't have they know they don't have the hope of healing they know they don't have the hope of deliverance they know they don't have they they they don't even know about it they don't know they're they're empty it can the gift that they have this gift of the spirit the is to let the love of god be shed abroad by the holy ghost look the very thing that they have in them is crying out to be spread to be regifted because the gift that they have is the mind of christ it's the personality of christ it's the personality of god what the holy spirit is is the person of jesus christ in spirit form dwelling in you that's the gift of god jesus christ just like when jesus was going in that funeral possession passed them and then he looked and there was that mother and i'm sure with this great gift of discernment he knew where she was from and knew what her address was can knew what her time was unless you think that was the devil if kenny so knew all these things about her and she understood that's her only boy that's her livelihood but death crossed life and he looked and he said oh stop and rose that child up mother receive your son that's the nature they had in him we got too much religious nature we've got politicians instead of christians we got people who know the book but don't know the author i like what he told joshua be not dismayed don't be afraid i am the lord thy god and i'm with you wherever you go why do things dismantle but they were driven by the principle that they knew they had received a gift that they had received something different from what other people had and that's what they wanted to give so they were out re-gifting and they got thrown in prison and again they threw them in the common prison and and then we all know and they that went on and and they put all the guards there and all of a sudden it comes down here at in the 21st verse saying and the prison truly found we shot with all safeties and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened it we found no man within see these guys were re-gifters they're the first three gifters they're the first one that received the gift of his son and now they're they're giving it out they put them in prison and they lock them up but god knows they're re-gifters he sends an angel and unlocks the prison and they're going out and they're over at a house someplace having a revival planning on the next person they're going to re-gift this to and so i love this and we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the trees chief priest heard these things they doubted of them whether unto this would grow and then all listen to this and then come one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple regifting to all the people amen amen that's where we are re-gifters they were the first three gifters just think of it they were they they were the first re-gifters so if you have him you have all that he is if you've got theology then you you can argue that but when you possess eternal life now i want you to think of that the gift of god was what eternal life not of yourselves unless you can boast he gave it to you i want to announce to you this morning i will not die if this mortal corrupted ugly body of flesh departs from me i have a body waiting for me because that was gifted to me i go to prepare for you a place i go to prepare for you a body that will not perish and that you can be where i'm gonna be that when this flesh drops off this close of fast falls away and dissolved i have a body waiting for me that's been gifted to me i didn't earn it don't blame me that he gave me i think he gave me the gift of salvation so people could say if he could save him he could save anybody if he could raise him from the dead he could raise anybody from the dead so if you have him you have all that he is you see you gift healing to the sick sure you do because you're the one that tells them the gift exists you're the one that testifies to the gift you're the one that brings the faith because it's revealed from faith to faith you possessed all that he is all that god was he poured into christ the works that i do shall you do also because i go unto the father i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come again i'll be with you even in you till the end and i'll get the spirit of truth will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness you understand how can you be righteous and see a hungry child and you have a loaf of bread or you see someone in despair and you don't go the extra mile with them or someone without a coat and you don't give them your cloak also see that's the real evidence of reception of the gift you're so convinced that you're concerned so you're the possessor of the healing you give the healing you see someone that has no hope no hope how you just you just got to go tell them hey i know the healer i know the healer i don't care if you don't think i know him i know i know him i've been healed i've watched him healed i've watched babies come live in the womb and turn into position i watch cancers go off of people i can testify but they're not my testimonies they're not my aunts testimonies they're not my uncle's testimonies they're the testimonies of jesus christ the king of kings and the glory who gave that gift to us that we could regift it we're regifting him amen and there he is you possess the gift of deliverance anybody in here been delivered oh my god isn't that what paul said that he just wrote we we heard it of him and also them that witnessed it you know god's a deliverer so when you see somebody that's in need of deliverance you have that gift in you if you have him what we need to do is become re-gifters we need to start giving what we've got well i i guarantee you i think me and my wife could go into our closet and we've got enough clothes to to dress half dallas fort worth you know we just end up possessing too much cannot giving enough away we've got all this great gift that we've got that we claim we have the lord of glory eternal life how could you see someone that doesn't have eternal life and not want to give them what you have you've got the gift it's something you have to give it's something you have to give because it's been given to you and so my christmas message is let's become re-gifters let's go out and re-give everything we've got from him let's be like the loaves and the fishes the more we break and the more we give the more it grows let's let our cups overflow don't be ashamed that somebody what difference does it make if he's the mayor and he lacks what you've got just say mr mayor could i talk to you in private sir it would be all right i don't care if your security guard overhears but mr mayor i'd humbly like to share with you you're hellbound and you're going to burn in hell if you don't accept jesus christ the gift of life now do you have that life in you enough that you could express that love i just gave a harsh example so that you could understand but when someone you see the need can you take them by the hands can kneel down with them and say let's pray through if we were going to go through the room this morning and i was to say how many people have you knelt down with and prayed how many of your friends have you sat down with the bible and told them about the life you have how many people have you shared them with can we went right down the line i wonder when it comes up that it really the final conclusion was that we haven't opened our gift we've got it but we haven't opened it we haven't seen all that it can do so i say this morning let's open our gift let's look at all that he can do all the needs that we have in our bible let's just re-gift what we've got one to another let us re-gift let's join the re-gifters because if our faith in this last day is to be restored if we we have to come back to to the faith that came at the day of pentecost that all the palmer worm and all the cankerworm and all the caterpillar locusts have eaten if that promise can this day that that gift could be restored back to us then that would have to mean that if the faith of the fathers what the pentecostals fathers have if that revival was to take place in us and they were re-gifters then that would make us regifters that's right so let's go emptying our spiritual gift closet out let's go share them let's tell people when you see somebody lacking what you have regift it do you see someone that lacks joy re-gift your joy you see someone that lacks peace re-gift that peace tell them the peace if you've got somebody that you know is in need of healing gift the healing by his stripes we are healed go to that person re-gift it to him tell them about it be a re-gifter and i could go on and on but i hope that you understand today we've got such a great gift in christ jesus by the grace of god let's re-gift it and i believe in re-gifting so i'd like to close the service by having brother randy re-gift that song to me this morning amen because we need to practice what we preach could you do that brother randy that was beautiful all of you god bless you so much this morning brother dewey i heard the bells on christmas day and mild and sweet
